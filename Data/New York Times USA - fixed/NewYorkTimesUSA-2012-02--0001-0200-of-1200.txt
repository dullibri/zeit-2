HEADLINE: In Reversal, Consumer Confidence Turns Down

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Americans turned gloomy about the job market and their income prospects, a report from the Conference Board showed on Tuesday, as an index of consumer attitudes fell to 61.1 in January from 64.8 the month before. 
The data frustrated expectations for an increase after sharp gains in consumer confidence in November and December.
''We are braced for a more bumpy picture over the next few months. A lot of expectations probably ran away or got a little too lofty coming into the end of the year,'' said Sean Incremona, an economist at 4Cast Ltd. in New York.
A separate report showed that business activity in the Midwest grew more slowly than expected in January, hurt by a weaker labor market. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its Chicago Business Barometer index fell to 60.2 in January from 62.2 in December, compared with a forecast of 63.
A wider reading of the factory sector is due on Wednesday with the release of the Institute for Supply Management's national manufacturing survey.
Last week, the Federal Reserve showed the extent of its concern about the uncertain economic recovery by saying it would keep interest rates near zero for nearly three more years. That gloomy assessment was echoed on Tuesday by a Congressional Budget Office report that forecast United States unemployment above 8 percent for this year and 2013.
Companies are feeling the pinch, too. Growth expectations for first-quarter earnings are declining sharply because of worries about slowing growth and weak revenue trends at major companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.
''With the global economy slowing and domestic fiscal policy a drag on growth, the well-being of the U.S. consumer is crucial to the recovery,'' Alistair Bentley, an economist at the TD Bank Group, wrote.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Beats Profit Forecasts and Expects Strong Growth for '12

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
United Parcel Service posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and forecast 9 to 15 percent growth this year as solid demand in the United States and growing e-commerce shipments offset an uneven global economy. 
The company's fourth-quarter net income was down sharply because of a change in how it accounted for pension expenses.
But excluding that change, the profit would have risen, helped by strong growth in consumer business -- driven by online shopping in the holiday season -- which overshadowed weaker growth abroad, analysts said.
Fourth-quarter net income fell to $725 million, or 74 cents a share, compared with $1.025 billion, or $1.02 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results included a $527 million charge related to the change in pension accounting.
After adjusting for the pension-accounting shift, profit came to $1.28 a share, more than the $1.26 analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters.
The company's decision to adopt ''mark to market'' pension accounting puts it in line with other large employers, including Honeywell International and Verizon Communications. The shift can give companies a quick lift by removing billions of dollars in old pension losses from operating results, and bring companies closer to international accounting standards for pensions that become effective in 2013.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 6 percent, to $14.2 billion.
Internet and catalog orders propelled U.P.S. shipments during its record holiday season to nearly 500 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, even as sales for traditional brick-and-mortar stores were mixed, Scott Davis, the company's chairman and chief executive, told analysts on a conference call.
U.P.S. delivered 1.13 billion packages in the quarter, 3.6 percent more than it did a year earlier.
''Clearly we saw a strengthening economy and a strong holiday season and frankly it stayed fairly strong into January,'' Mr. Davis said. ''The U.S., while I wouldn't call it a robust economy right now, I do think a small-package market is performing better than we would have thought four or five months ago.''
Shares of U.P.S. fell 50 cents, or 0.66 percent, to close at $75.65 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Hurting Poor Borrowers

 BODY:
New York has some of the strongest anti-usury laws in the nation. But that could change if a deeply flawed bill pending in the State Legislature goes forward. The bill would allow check-cashing businesses, which are common in impoverished areas, to charge higher interest rates and to enter the lending business. 
Usurious lending is a national problem that Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has promised to address. He has said the agency would give special attention to largely unregulated financial institutions like payday lenders, whose loans can carry yearly interest rates as high as 400 percent.
The bill in Albany would exempt check-cashing stores from a 1976 statute that makes it a felony for lenders to charge in excess of 25 percent interest. The measure does not set a new interest limit, requiring only that state banking officials take the lender's profitability and business costs into account in determining the rate.
Several states that have changed their laws to allow higher interest rates for small, short-term loans have lived to regret it. Ohio, for example, exempted lenders from the state's 28 percent usury cap in 1995. Abuses forced its Legislature to restore the cap in 2008.
If New York exempts check-cashing stores, powerful lobbyists would make sure that the exemption was eventually extended to other financial institutions, including banks that already use exploitive payday-style lending in other states.
State lawmakers who argue that their constituents lack access to banking and credit -- which is often the case -- should not compound the problem by exposing them to a form of financial exploitation. While the bill prohibits lenders from roping their customers into a succession of new loans before the original debt is paid off -- a common and profitable practice -- this provision could be difficult to enforce. The legislators should instead be finding ways to bring legitimate financial services to communities that desperately need them.

HEADLINE: Equities End a Strong Month on a Mixed Note

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street closed a strong month narrowly mixed on Tuesday as weaker-than-expected economic reports surprised investors after a stream of positive data in recent months.
Still, stocks rallied sharply in January, partly on hopes the American economy will dodge the effects of a recession in Europe. But those hopes were dented Tuesday, with home prices in the United States and business activity in the Midwest missing expectations. Consumer confidence also dropped.
The market was sharply lower in the late morning, but erased much of that loss, repeating a pattern in recent trade that has been seen as a sign of resilience. 
''Once you start to get some negative numbers, especially around the consumer, it lends to the argument that G.D.P. growth is not really there and it is going to go back to zero,'' said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.81 points, or 0.16 percent, to 12,632.91. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.60 point, or 0.05 percent, to 1,312.41. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.90 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,813.84.
Earnings reports continued to paint a muddled picture. Exxon Mobil fell 2 percent to $83.74 and was the biggest drag on both the Dow and S.& P. 500. Exxon's profit narrowly beat expectations as rising oil prices offset falling margins on chemicals and fuel, and production fell short of some estimates.
Robert Sluymer, a technical analyst at RBC Capital in New York, said depressed interest rates and a stalling of gains in industrial copper are pointing to a short-term reversal in economically sensitive sectors, like materials and banks, that have led the rally.
According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 204 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have reported results so far, 59.8 percent topped estimates, tracking below the beat rate at this stage of the earnings season in recent quarters.
Hopes that Greece would reach a deal with private creditors on a debt swap and receive a bailout to sidestep a chaotic default raised market sentiment initially. Investors again flocked to the safety of United States securites. The price on the 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32 to 101 27/32. The yield fell to 1.80 percent, from 1.85 percent late Monday.
Shortly after the opening bell, the S.& P. 500 piereced a bullish technical level, known as a golden cross, as its 50-day average ticked above its 200-day average. The signal indicates a shift in momentum and usually means gains in the index within six months.
In 26 golden crosses since 1962, the S.& P. 500 gained an average 4.1 percent over the next three months and was positive 73 percent of the time. In the next six months it gained 6.6 percent and was positive 81 percent of the time, according to Birinyi Associates.
In January, the S.& P. 500 gained 4.4 percent, its best month since October. The Dow rose 3.4 percent for its fourth straight month of gains, while the Nasdaq advanced 8 percent.
Results from Pfizer and Eli Lilly both topped expectations. But Pfizer trimmed its 2012 outlook and Lilly repeated its forecast for a drop in 2012 earnings. Lilly rose 1.2 percent, to $39.74 and Pfizer dipped 0.8 percent, to $21.40.
Transportation stocks dipped as United Parcel Service gave up early gains to fall 0.7 percent, to $75.65. The package delivery group posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, but analysts cited profit-taking and company comments on euro headwinds in the first quarter.
Housing stocks fell after the S.& P./Case Shiller report on home prices. The Dow home construction index declined 1.7 percent. Lennar, a home builder, lost 2.9 percent, to $21.49.

HEADLINE: Making It Worse in Europe

 BODY:
European Union leaders failed on Monday to move forward on their most urgent task: increasing the bailout fund to protect Europe's ailing economies from defaulting on their bonds. 
Instead, leaders of 25 of 27 European countries agreed to sign a new fiscal compact that will legally restrict them from fighting recessions with robust fiscal stimulus. Most economists outside the euro zone consider this approach a dangerous one. Those countries account for more than 20 percent of the world's economy. Condemning them to longer and deeper recessions will drag down economies elsewhere that depend on trade, from the United States to China.
Without a bigger bailout fund, investors will likely keep betting against weakened economies like Italy and Spain, pushing up their interest costs and, consequently, adding to their deficits. Nevertheless, Europe's leaders deferred action on more money until March. Market speculators may not agree to wait.
The world has gotten used to failed European summit meetings. What is particularly disheartening about this one is that some European leaders seem to believe they succeeded. ''Considering the time frame, this was a real masterpiece,'' Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said of the new fiscal pact. It was only in December that she made clear to other European leaders that adopting a fiscal pact to balance their budgets and reduce debt was an essential precondition for Germany to continuing to pay its fair share of European debt-relief costs.
The fiscal pact imposes substantial fines on any signatory nation whose deficit averages more than 0.5 percent of gross domestic product over a full economic cycle, a condition the United States would have had great trouble meeting over the past three decades. The summiteers also made ritual nods in the direction of more jobs and higher growth, without providing any new money to achieve this.
As the European Union's biggest economy, and biggest contributor to the bailout fund, Germany continues to determine the approach in managing the Continent's economic crisis. Others, particularly those needing help paying their bills, have little choice but to go along, whether or not they really believe that German-dictated austerity will help their ailing economies. Many leaders -- Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy, for example -- have made clear that they do not.
A leader wiser than Mrs. Merkel would build a stronger European Union by helping her neighbors grow their way out of debt, not squeeze them to the breaking point. A wise leader would also remind German voters that the prosperity of their own export-dependent economy requires sustained demand in neighboring countries.
Poor German leadership in this crisis has exacted an increasing economic and social price from Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Belgium and France. The longer Germany insists on putting fiscal austerity ahead of growth, the more likely it becomes that Germany, too, will suffer economic pain.

HEADLINE: Richard T. Anderson

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Anderson, 71, is the president of the New York Building Congress, which represents professionals in the construction industry, including laborers, contractors, architects, engineers and developers.
He has been running the nonprofit association since 1994 and before that served as the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy group.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. What is your main role at the building congress?
A. I'm expected to follow through the strategic objectives of the organization, which is to be an advocate, to provide opportunities for professional exchange and to promote the image and the stature of the industry as a whole.
We have lots of organizations that deal with pieces of the industry, like the American Institute of Architects and the Real Estate Board of New York. We work with all of them.
Q. Are you its longest running president?
A. Yes.
Q. Any plans to retire?
A. No.
Q. So what are the association's strategic objectives in 2012?
A. No. 1 is to promote infrastructure investment in New York City; infrastructure is anything public.
It's important because it generates design and construction work for the industry. The private economy, which generates so much construction activity, needs the infrastructure as well.
While investment has been relatively high in the last few years, it's starting to slip.
Q. How so?
A. The capital budget is funded with borrowing, and there's significant pressure to reduce debt service.
The city starts the budget process next month and it goes through May. We're looking for them to hold the line because of the importance of capital investment.
We're probably the only advocate for the city's capital budget -- almost nobody else pays attention to it.
Q. How did the construction industry in the city fare in 2011?
A. Construction spending -- for all construction -- was about $27 billion. It's about the same as in 2010, and 2012 will also be about the same or slightly less. So it's still a fairly strong market. But then it's expected to fall off to $23 billion or so in 2013, and that concerns us. Public work is declining, and the private sector is not coming up sufficiently to make up for it.
Q.Where are you seeing the most strength?
A. Probably the strongest sector is the institutional sector: universities, hospitals, cultural facilities.
It's not an overwhelming portion of this $27 billion market, though -- only about $3 billion, without public schools.
Before the recession started, everything was white-hot across the board, but there was a problem with that: we got cost inflation, and it started to get very expensive.
Williamsburg, Flushing and the Bronx are getting a lot of construction activity, where 10 to 15 years ago there was nothing.
Q. What about office buildings?
A. The story with offices is that they're starting to come back. But the big question is, when will all the projects on the drawing board start to be built? We have about 20 million square feet of projects on the drawing board and only a couple of million square feet in construction. We need jobs to grow in New York City so that office projects can move forward.
Q. But you are starting to see the revival of some stalled projects.
A. Yes. The problem is others are being added, so the net number of stalled projects is not going down. The number has been over 600 projects for a couple of years. Mostly it's because of lack of financing. Then the other factor, of course, is demand. It's not what it was. Now it's only starting to come back, and it's mostly higher end.
Q. Let's talk about construction costs.
A. The overall picture is one of costs starting to increase again. They're influenced by, No. 1, the growing demand; No. 2, the cost of labor had not really been reduced significantly despite major efforts to do so; and No. 3, nowhere, except in New York City, do you have the cost of government being as big an influence as it is here.
There are things that government does to increase costs. They have provisions in contracts that no rational human being should agree to.
Q. Really?
A. For instance, they have a clause called ''no damages for delay.'' When you sign a public contract in New York City, you agree that you have no recourse if a public agency delays the project for any reason, for any amount of time. You can't recover those costs. So what do people do? They try to protect themselves. Either they walk away and don't bid, or if they do bid they raise the price.
Q. And your group lobbied to change that?
A. Yes, and we've had some progress. The city is now experimenting with contracts without it.

HEADLINE: A Sign Law Spurs Investment in Philadelphia

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- An influx of new residents, stores, restaurants and hotels in Center City has largely bypassed Market East, the blocks of Market Street east of City Hall to Independence Mall.
Plans for the area have included shiny glass retail pavilions, multiplex movie theaters and a Disney indoor amusement park, all of which foundered for various reasons. Still, over the last few months, the district's fortunes have brightened, prompted in part by the imminent arrival of a large new office tenant.
The tenant is Philadelphia Media Network, which publishes The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily News, as well as a Web portal, philly.com. It recently signed a lease for 125,000 square feet that will straddle the third floor of the old Strawbridge & Clothier department store building on Market Street and part of the third floor of the adjoining Gallery at Market East, a fortresslike, 1.1-million-square-foot indoor shopping mall that opened in 1977. The mall has three anchor stores, but it has struggled to attract tenants for the upper floors and is only 62 percent occupied. 
Philadelphia Media Network will be the first business to take advantage of a sign ordinance that Philadelphia passed last summer to help create a digital district in the Market East section. It allows developers, in exchange for an investment of at least $10 million, to put up and collect revenue from large digital signs and billboards on the outside of Market Street buildings between Seventh and 13th Streets.
Philadelphia Media Network will have two digital signs on Market Street and two on Ninth Street, and each sign will be about 14 feet wide and 45 feet long, said Joseph F. Coradino, the president of Preit Services and Preit-Rubin, the commercial development and management subsidiaries of the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, the company that owns both the Gallery and the old Strawbridge site.
The sign ordinance has limits. For example, it will allow digital signs to appear only on properties that have 100 feet or more of frontage on Market Street.
''This is not Times Square, where the goal is to basically cover buildings with signs,'' said Paul R. Levy, the president of the Center City District, a business improvement group and an early supporter of the ordinance. ''Our goal here was to integrate the signs into the existing architecture.''
Still, for Philadelphia Media Network, the prospect of new digital signage ''added to the attraction'' of coming to the area, said Michael Kuritzkes, the general counsel for the company, which came out of bankruptcy in October 2010. He said plans now called for the company to move from the historic, 525,000-square-foot Inquirer building on North Broad Street, where offices are spread out among more than 10 floors, to the space on Market Street, where ''everyone will see everyone else in a very collaborative way.'' The Inquirer building was sold last fall to the developer Bart Blatstein.
''For a very historic, traditional newspaper company to make a change in culture, this is a terrific place to be,'' he said.
At the Gallery a long-anticipated overhaul has yet to get under way, although city officials say Preit has presented a plan to make the mall livelier and the stores more accessible to shoppers on the street. To attract new retailers, the company hopes first to woo both fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants to a property that now has only two food courts. ''We think food should be the real focus first,'' Mr. Coradino said.
Alan Greenberger, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, said city officials were working with Preit to simplify the mall's complicated ownership so that it can more readily attract private financing.
''The trigger event for Market East will be the redo of the Gallery,'' he said.
One developer that already has a large stake in the Market East neighborhood is SSH Real Estate, a commercial real estate company based in the city.
In 2008, it helped form a partnership that eventually acquired Girard Square, a set of four buildings that straddle a full city block across the street from the Gallery.
At SSH, plans have long called for building a high-rise that would sit on the site of one of the buildings at Girard Square, and in December the company, along with its partners, teamed with National Real Estate Advisors, a large equity investor based in Washington, to help it reach its goal. Jeffrey J. Kanne, the president and chief executive of National Real Estate Advisors, said that building would include a fitness club, a 200- to 300-unit residential tower and a 250-room hotel, in addition to retail spaces.
Despite a recent boom in residential and hotel development, new restaurant rows and a recent expansion of the Pennsylvania Convention Center, Center City's retail market remains spotty. While some streets, like Walnut and Chestnut, are continuing to draw both national and international retailers, the consensus is that the area could use more midprice retailers, like a long-hoped-for Target store in Market East, where retail spaces of more than 25,000 square feet are still relatively easy to find.
One new tenant on Market Street is TJX Companies, the retailer based in Framingham, Mass., that operates stores under both the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls names.
It signed a lease in December for 26,000 square feet of space on the corner of 11th and Market Street, for what may possibly be a new Marshalls store, said Michael J. Katz, the leasing agent for the Jenel Management Corporation, the New York-based real estate company that owns the site.
The site is now occupied by a Staples store, and it sits on a modest stretch of Market Street that includes drugstores, cellphone shops and a two-acre street parking lot that was once promoted as a site for the Disney amusement park.
''The signage will show retailers that the area is changing,'' Peter C. Soens, a partner at SSH Real Estate, said of the new ordinance. ''There is very strong interest from retailers that they want to be in Center City, and Market East is now the only part of Center City where you can get a large footprint.''

HEADLINE: A Dismal Distinction in Housing

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH; Seth Feaster contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
MARIETTA, Ga. -- Housing prices continue to fall nationwide, despite a few modest signs of improvement. But not all markets are equal.
Places like Miami and Phoenix -- symbols of boom-time excesses and later the sites of fierce crashes -- were not the weakest performers last year. That distinction goes to Atlanta.
A sprawling Southern metropolis, Atlanta has become one of the biggest laggards in the economic recovery. In November, prices of single-family homes were down close to 12 percent compared with a year earlier, the largest decline among major metropolitan areas, according to data released on Tuesday in the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Home prices regionally are now below their levels of 2000, making Atlanta one of only four metro areas to have experienced such a slide. The price of entry-level housing in the area -- the lowest tier of the market, valued at just under $96,600 -- fell by close to a third last year. 
Even though the national economy shows signs of strengthening, the beleaguered housing market remains a significant drag on the recovery. Across a group of 20 metropolitan areas measured by S.& P./Case-Shiller, prices of single-family homes were 3.7 percent lower in November compared with a year earlier, with average prices at their 2003 levels. Economists say prices are unlikely to hit a nadir until at least late spring.
Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York, projects that average prices could slip by as much as 5 percent nationally this year because of the large amount of distressed properties for sale and a shortage of buyers. Although Mr. Porcelli describes a ''generally better outlook on housing'' than he has over the last few years, he added, ''we still have a long way to go.''
Here in Marietta, a suburb north of downtown Atlanta, the decline has attracted bargain hunters like Andy Heller. One damp afternoon last month, Mr. Heller, a part-time investor, examined a four-bedroom, faded yellow house that had sold seven years ago for $208,000.
Last fall, after a foreclosure by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the house was put up for sale. The asking price was slashed by more than a third last month to $99,900. Mr. Heller, eyeing kitchen cupboards with missing doors and signs of leaks in the upstairs bathroom, figured he could lop $30,000 more off the price.
''I am concerned as a citizen,'' he said. ''And on the other side as an investor, I see the opportunity of a lifetime.''
The reasons for Atlanta's housing woes are both representative of the nation's troubles and special to this former boomtown, where housing appreciated handsomely, though not to the lofty heights of Las Vegas, Miami and New York.
Where the region once attracted thousands of prospective home buyers drawn by plentiful jobs and more affordable living, that influx has dwindled. Local unemployment, at 9.2 percent, is slightly higher than the national rate, in part because one in every four jobs lost was connected to real estate, a much higher rate than in the rest of the country. Those jobs have yet to return, while even people with work are having trouble qualifying for loans.
The region, plagued by mortgage fraud and developers who dotted the exurban landscape with large luxury homes that never sold, is inundated with foreclosed properties. In fact, Atlanta has the most government-owned foreclosed properties for sale of any large city, according to the Federal Reserve.
Nationwide, sales of existing homes have recently picked up, prompting some economists to suggest that the housing market is finally starting to repair itself. But the number of new homes sold fell to a record low in December, and many homeowners are stuck in houses that are worth far less than they owe on their mortgages.
Last week, the Federal Reserve described the housing sector as ''depressed,'' and in his State of the Union address President Obama unveiled a refinancing program for homeowners waiting ''for the housing market to hit bottom.''
Atlanta has suffered greatly from a contracting pool of home buyers. The number of people moving from within the United States to Atlanta peaked at 100,000 in 2006 and plunged to just 17,000 by 2009, the latest census figures available.
''Most of the housing activity that we experienced in the past 10 years was people moving to Atlanta from other markets,'' said Domonic Purviance, real estate market analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
''If you lose 80,000 people a year coming to your market,'' Mr. Purviance added, ''that's the whole issue.''
The collapse of the housing market also put many prospective homeowners out of work.
From February 2008 to August 2011, Atlanta lost 60,000 jobs in construction and real estate, about 25 percent of job losses in the broader metropolitan area during that period. Across the nation, construction and real estate jobs were only 15 percent of total positions lost, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by IHS Global Insight.
Many homeowners forced into foreclosures or distressed sales are people whose livelihoods had depended on a robust housing market. That's what happened to the owners of a three-bedroom house in Dacula, about 45 minutes northeast of downtown Atlanta.
The husband, a home remodeler, had not had steady work in three years and the family was struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments. The couple, who asked not to be named because they were embarrassed to tell their extended family, were on the verge of foreclosure last month. Then Matt Hermes, an agent with Keller Williams who drives a bright red Ford F-150 pickup bearing the license plate ''BUYAHOM,'' persuaded them to try to sell it and negotiate with their lender to take a loss.
The couple recently accepted an offer on the two-story brick home, which cost them $160,000 in 2002, for $119,000 and are planning to move into a rental.
Such distressed sales are putting pressure on traditional sellers to slash their prices, too. In an upscale subdivision nearby, Christina West waited four years before giving in to the reality of the housing downturn.
She and her husband bought a four-bedroom home on a manmade lake in 1999 for $374,000. They spent $100,000 installing a pool, a hot tub, a basement bar and home theater.
When her husband lost his job as a sales executive at a consumer products company in 2007, the couple moved into a house that Ms. West had inherited from her mother in St. Augustine, Fla. They put the Dacula house on the market for $599,900.
They rejected several offers that they considered lowballs. ''Everybody kept saying 'Oh, it's a great house, it will sell,' '' Ms. West recalled. A contract for $447,000 fell through when the buyer could not secure a loan. Last month, the couple signed a contract for $360,000, effectively erasing previous gains and their large investment in improvements.
Other owners have simply been forced to give up their homes. In the third quarter of last year, the most recent period for which figures are available, foreclosed homes represented 24 percent of all sales in Atlanta, compared with a national rate of 12 percent, according to RealtyTrac, a data provider. Georgia is one of 30 states where a lender can foreclose on a home without appearing before a judge, which suggests that many more homes may be at risk of foreclosure in states where proceedings require court approval.
On a recent tour of several homes, James H. Sinnott, a corporate lawyer who is trying to raise an investment fund for distressed properties in Atlanta, was struck by the sheer volume for sale at astonishingly low prices.
In a well-kept subdivision in Jonesboro, south of downtown Atlanta, teenagers and elderly couples strolled the wide streets. Mr. Sinnott inspected a three-bedroom brick home that had floor-to-ceiling mirrors in several rooms, garish chandeliers and a number of stripped-out basement walls that made him suspect it had been used as a brothel. The asking price was $69,900. In Norcross, a northern suburb, he looked at a sun-filled three-bedroom home up a steep driveway that had sold for $131,300 in 2003. Now, the lender was asking just $39,900.
The glut is likely to grow. According to RealtyTrac, Atlanta has a nearly 12-month supply of foreclosed homes, about 70 percent of which are sitting on the books of servicers and lenders, waiting to go on sale. The release of just a chunk of properties can push down prices. ''You can't get a bottom until you clear the backlog,'' Mr. Sinnott said.
Mr. Sinnott, who is new to the investment market, is having trouble raising capital. But even an expert like Mr. Heller, who has bought more than 100 houses with a partner over the last 20 years and says he has never missed a mortgage payment, is frustrated by his difficulty securing loans.
Typically, he buys in middle-income neighborhoods and then signs tenants to rent-to-own contracts. If he had financing, he said, he would buy as many as 100 homes this year. ''If I had a lot of cash I would be going ballistic right now,'' he said.

Delia Ephron is right: with banks, it's their way or the highway.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Decline Again

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The American market for single-family homes continued to wobble, with prices declining again in November, nearly six years after they began to fall, a private report showed on Tuesday. 
Single-family house prices in a group of 20 metropolitan areas tracked by the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller composite index fell by close to 0.7 percent from October, and were down by 3.7 percent from November 2010, worse than the 3.4 percent annual decline seen in October.
Average home prices were back down to levels last seen in mid-2003, the index showed.
Housing has played a dominant role in the country's economic sluggishness, as homeowners have struggled with foreclosures or mortgage burdens that far exceed the values of their homes. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers and other real estate-related employees have been thrown out of work and are still struggling to cobble together incomes.
The 28-county metropolitan Atlanta region continued to stand out as the worst performer in the index, with home prices tumbling close to 12 percent from the previous November. In addition to Atlanta, home prices in Las Vegas, Seattle and Tampa all hit new lows in November.
Of the 20 cities traced by the index, home prices fell in 19 in November; only Phoenix had higher prices from the month before. On an annual basis, only Detroit and Washington experienced price rises.
''Despite continued low interest rates and better real G.D.P. growth in the fourth quarter, home prices continue to fall,'' David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at Standard & Poor's, said in a statement.
''The trend is down and there are few, if any, signs in the numbers that a turning point is close at hand.''
Since a peak in mid-2006, home prices tracked by the index have plunged by almost 33 percent.
Although economists believe the rate of declines in home prices may slow, they generally forecast further decreases this year. ''The enormous supply overhang of existing homes (particularly factoring in all those in foreclosure or soon to be) promises to keep pressure on prices for some time,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc., wrote in an analysis of the Case-Shiller data.

HEADLINE: Life Sciences Projects Revive in Central New Jersey

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
EAST WINDSOR, N.J. -- With its concentration of pharmaceutical giants like Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone Systems, and academic powerhouses like Princeton and Rutgers, central New Jersey has long had the foundation to be a major center for life sciences businesses.
Yet an effort to brand the area as such never caught on widely, and the global economic crisis of the last five years halted development of new laboratory space for life sciences companies. Now, signs of a small revival are apparent. Statewide, the number of biotechnology companies has grown to 335 from 80 in 1998, with about 10 of them either moving into the state or developing from in-state research in 2011, said Debbie Hart, the president of BioNJ, a nonprofit group that promotes the growth of biotechnology in New Jersey. 
In the life sciences, research institutes, medical centers and government agencies are collaborating to develop biological science and technology into spinoff companies that turn science into commercial applications.
These efforts tend to be concentrated in a handful of research clusters nationwide -- including the Boston area and Research Triangle Park in Durham, N.C. -- typically near major universities or hospitals. They provide stable, high-paying jobs, and when their research succeeds, the companies often expand rapidly.
For that reason, before the recession, many states and municipalities, including New York City, were passing initiatives to try to capture biotechnology businesses with new, specialized office and laboratory space.
In the five counties that are part of the central New Jersey cluster -- Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth and Somerset -- 5 percent of the office space, about 6.5 million square feet, is laboratory space and other specialized space for biotechnology companies, according to CoStar Group, a real estate information company in Washington. Including research and development space, that figure rises to nine million square feet.
Here in East Windsor, a 64,000-square-foot specialized office building is being built on spec, the first of four planned in a new development called SciPark.
The building has been fully leased to the global chemical company Elementis P.L.C., which designed the interiors and will take occupancy in March. The developer of SciPark is Woodmont Properties of Chatham, N.J., which says it hopes to lease and build the three other planned structures in the next three year.
The other three at SciPark, each about 60,000 square feet, will not be built speculatively, but for specific tenants, said Stephen A. Santola, an executive vice president and general counsel of Woodmont Properties.
''We've definitely seen an uptick in the last three to four months in interested tenants of all sizes, from start-up businesses to much larger users,'' he said. ''Tenants are willing to look at new space, at taking on more space, particularly in this region.''
Also benefiting the area is a world-class transportation and distribution system in one of the three major trade zones globally, said Katherine Kish, the executive director of Einstein's Alley, a nonprofit group promoting central New Jersey's life sciences corridor, along Route 1, the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 130.
Yet when the global real estate market declined in 2007, development of the specialized office space for biotechnology stopped in central New Jersey, as it did in many areas nationwide.
As a result of the economic crisis, the pharmaceutical industry has consolidated in recent years, which has led to many layoffs -- but that trend may benefit central New Jersey's biotechnology cluster, said James J. Medenbach, a senior vice president and member of the life science practice group at the commercial brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle.
''The mergers and acquisition activity to some extent has disadvantaged the work force, but it's been an advantage to companies that come into this marketplace and are looking to establish or grow themselves,'' Mr. Medenbach said. ''They can take advantage of the intellectual capital.''
Elementis, which was based in London, acquired a small company in central New Jersey in 1998, then moved its headquarters to the region, largely to exploit its highly skilled and specialized work force, said Greg McClatchy, the president of two Elementis divisions. ''We also wanted to take advantage of the natural synergies of having all these businesses located in one place,'' he said.
The life sciences space in central New Jersey has been privately developed except for the Technology Centre of New Jersey, a six-building, 311,000-square-foot complex designed for the lab and office needs of biotech companies in New Brunswick, N.J., Mr. Medenbach said.
The New Jersey Economic Development Authority developed the Technology Centre, keeping rents low for start-up life sciences companies, and the complex is 75 percent leased, he said. An additional 560,000 square feet of space could be built to suit biotechnology companies, but no development is imminent, he said.
Typically, lab space in New Jersey is about $25 a square foot, Mr. Medenbach said. In Manhattan, life science space can be more than $55 a square foot.
Even if development at the Technology Centre has stopped since 2002, a resurgence in biotechnology in central New Jersey may be heralded by a recent deal in Princeton. The global health care company Novo Nordisk is expanding, with the $215 million redevelopment of a 770,000-square-foot office building in the Princeton Forrestal Center. The center is a collection of 40 buildings with 6.5 million square feet of office and research space on land owned by Princeton University. The Novo building was an outdated structure that was originally home to Merrill Lynch.
Novo Nordisk has leased 500,000 square feet in the office building with an option to lease the rest. On completion of the project in 2013, it will have almost 700,000 square feet in two buildings at Princeton Forrestal.
''Novo is very exciting, and they're growing about 10 percent a year,'' said David Knights, the director of marketing for Princeton Forrestal. Princeton trustees are also in talks with a developer who is proposing to build an 800,000-square-foot Science Park at Princeton Forrestal, he said.
''I think there are enough things going on that science companies will return,'' Mr. Knights said. ''I don't think New Jersey's lost them completely.''

HEADLINE: A Nasty Fight Carries Risks for the Winner

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
With his resounding victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida on Tuesday, Mitt Romney showed a worried Republican base a side of himself that it has both longed for and feared that he lacked: the agile political street fighter, willing to mock, scold and ultimately eviscerate his opponent.
But if he has quelled doubts about his toughness, he also emerges from the Florida free-for-all and the three contests that preceded it carrying heavy new baggage. 
Mr. Romney was savaged by Mr. Gingrich over his record at Bain Capital, softening him up for the coming Democratic effort to portray him as a heartless capitalist happy to fire people to enrich himself. His release of his tax returns, complete with details about a Swiss bank account, provided new facts for opponents seeking to cast him as out of touch with ordinary Americans.
And the very trait that propelled him in Florida -- a willingness to descend into the muck and run a relentlessly negative campaign -- distracted from his economic-themed argument against Mr. Obama while deepening his rift with some populist conservatives. Should Mr. Gingrich remain a viable enough candidate to stay in the race through the summer, as he vowed on Tuesday, Mr. Romney could be forced to maintain an angry edge that could undermine his appeal among moderate and independent voters -- groups whose views of him, polls suggest, appear to have been harmed by the Florida melee.
''There are questions about his wealth and Bain, but he has not become an intensely polarizing figure yet,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who worked on Mr. Romney's presidential campaign in 2008. ''The question is, will he become that?''
Mr. Romney himself seemed sensitive to the perception that his campaign has become locked in a bitter -- and counterproductive -- war of words with his leading Republican rival.
''I would like to spend more of our time focusing on President Obama,'' he said in Tampa on Tuesday as voting was under way. ''That's ultimately what's going to be essential to taking back the White House.''
His challenge is about to become even more complicated. As much as he would like to be punching and counterpunching with Mr. Obama, he must still contend with Mr. Gingrich, who even after his steep loss described the primaries as a two-man nomination fight across 46 more states.
Mr. Romney faces a classic dilemma in presidential politics: Going negative is never an appealing option, but the alternative amounts to unilateral disarmament and a much higher likelihood of defeat, especially against a rival like Mr. Gingrich who has little to lose.
''In primary politics, short-term gains are what matters, because if you don't have the short-term gains, you won't be around long enough to deal with the long-term problems,'' said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.
Mr. Romney and his ''super PAC'' allies spent $15.4 million on television and radio advertising in Florida, three times what Mr. Gingrich and his supporters spent, in the most intensive assault of the Republican nominating contest: Over all, 92 percent of the ads from the candidates and outside groups were negative. In Florida, the outcome was what Mr. Romney needed -- and possibly enough to all but eliminate Mr. Gingrich as a threat.
But if Mr. Romney has to engage in a long stretch of negative campaigning against Mr. Gingrich, the challenge will be to hit back hard enough that he does not leave himself exposed to another Gingrich comeback without undercutting his own image.
A candidate who comes across as attacking too viciously and personally risks turning off all but the most partisan voters. It happened with Bob Dole, most famously when he lost his temper during the 1988 presidential race, snapping that Vice President George Bush should ''stop lying about my record.'' That moment haunted him throughout the campaign. That may be one reason that Mr. Romney, in the glow of his Florida victory, praised his competitors and turned his attention to the president.
Mr. Romney has never been especially squeamish about negative campaigning. As jarring as his tone has seemed over the past 10 days, he has a long history of resorting to such tactics. (The exception was 2008, when Mr. Romney bowed out relatively early in the primary season.)
During his 2002 campaign for governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney ran biting commercials that portrayed his Democratic rival, the state treasurer Shannon O'Brien, as a basset hound asleep on the job as men walked off with bags of money. His poll numbers soon surged, and he pulled out an unexpected victory.
''He has learned along the way that this stuff works pretty well,'' said Ms. O'Brien, who called the ads inaccurate and unfair.
This time around, Mr. Romney has been responding to scathing assaults from Mr. Gingrich, who in turn has said he went negative because the super PAC supporting Mr. Romney had unfairly attacked him in Iowa. Determined not to lose in Florida, Mr. Romney unleashed a wave of attacks on Mr. Gingrich's finances, ethics and even stability -- hammered repeatedly in TV commercials, conference calls, e-mails and speeches -- that helped stoke the image of Mr. Gingrich as an ''erratic'' and ''unreliable'' leader.
The balance that Mr. Romney is trying to strike in his battle against Mr. Gingrich is one he also has to strike if he ends up facing Mr. Obama, whose aides have made clear that a general election campaign against him will be highly personal.
As if to underscore the point, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, Stephanie Cutter, took to Twitter to mock Mr. Romney for a line about Europe in his victory speech.
''If he dislikes it so,'' she asked, ''why is he betting against the American dollar with his own Swiss bank account?''

HEADLINE: The House That George Romney Built

BYLINE: By LOUIS HYMAN. 
Louis Hyman, an assistant professor of history at the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell, is the author of ''Borrow: The American Way of Debt.''

 BODY:
Ithaca, N.Y.
AS Mitt Romney casts around for big ideas to solve the continuing financial crisis, he would do well to remember the experiences of his father, George C. Romney: as the secretary for housing and urban development during the Nixon administration, he oversaw the emergence of the mortgage-backed security industry -- and its first devastating policy failure.
The idea of the mortgage-backed security actually began under a Democrat, Lyndon B. Johnson, who saw it as a neat solution to the credit crunch of 1966. Banks had been losing depositors' savings steadily through the 1960s to the higher-yielding securities market. In the summer of 1966, this gradual shift accelerated into a crisis, after the Fed unexpectedly raised rates but barred banks from raising their own rates on deposits. 
Banks suddenly began to hemorrhage millions of dollars in deposits. Without deposits, banks could not lend for mortgages, and the housing industry ground to a halt, panicking builders and lenders around the country.
Johnson and other policy makers saw mortgage financing as a way to solve two problems at once: decoupling mortgage investment from deposits would help banks while making more money available for inner-city homeownership. The combined need for mortgage financing and mortgage access enabled the passage of Johnson's National Housing Act of 1968, which created both the first mortgage-backed securities and the first subprime loans. In turn, Ginnie Mae, overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, bought these mortgages, and in tandem with Fannie Mae, repackaged them as mortgage-backed securities for sale to investors.
Richard M. Nixon came to office in 1969, so it was left to a Republican administration, and Mr. Romney, to preside over the first mortgage-backed security sale in 1970, which they enthusiastically embraced. ''This event,'' Mr. Romney said, ''marks a revolutionary step forward in our efforts to increase the funds available for mortgage financing.'' But in an eerie prefiguring of the 2000s, the subprime lending program soon fell apart as predatory lenders and unscrupulous house flippers defrauded first-time buyers. The government found itself insuring mortgages on houses that could never be resold. After first denying the problems, Mr. Romney was ultimately forced to freeze the program in 1971. Yet even as the lending program ended, the mortgage-backed security sector blossomed, at least for higher-quality, middle-class homes. Securitization worked as an instrument to connect local demand and global capital.
Bypassing traditional bank deposits allowed money to come from almost anywhere: small-town banks, union pensions and European investors could all buy American mortgages. Lending on houses, at least for middle-class housing, became easier than ever before.
And that was the problem. While Mr. Romney may have stopped the fraud, he didn't address the flip side of the urban crisis: the millions invested in mortgages was money not invested in business.
Small-business loans, however, still relied on those dwindling deposits and could not be securitized. Big corporations and small homeowners could rely on the surging global capital markets, while small business found itself crowded out.
Put differently, policy makers in the late 1960s and early '70s confused the cause of prosperity (good jobs) with its symptom (homeownership). And for 40 years, we kept doing the same -- finding new ways to funnel money into housing, while doing little to put it into small-business growth.
One solution would be to begin securitizing small-business debt, which would provide a safe and profitable outlet for all that capital that corporations and banks are nervously hoarding right now. Unlike houses, small businesses will produce growth, which will benefit not only the owners and the lenders, but all of us.
Mitt Romney, the other Republican candidates and President Obama should consider the lessons of George Romney and remember that it's not enough just to stop what's not working. We also have to figure out what really works.

HEADLINE: Who's Tough Enough?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Joe Biden is always ready to jump in as a character witness for Barack Obama.
In the last presidential election, he offered effusive testimony that Obama was not too snooty to appeal to skeptical working-class voters.
This time around, Biden is talking up Obama's spine, aiming to show that all traces of Obambi are gone and that the president is pure BAM! now.
''I just want to tell you, this guy's got a backbone like a ramrod,'' the vice president assured House Democrats last week at a retreat in Cambridge, Md. 
He repeated a line he'd heard to sum up what his party should campaign on: ''Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.''
Biden, the only pol in town who can be more revealing on the record than off, dished up some of the confidential details of how the decision was made to go after Bin Laden in Pakistan.
Newt Gingrich wants a colony on the moon, but President Obama had to make the toughest call of his presidency based on the moon. Would there be too much moonlight that night for the brazen secret operation -- the kind that went wrong and marred Jimmy Carter's presidency?
''The president, he went around the table with all the senior people, including the Chiefs of Staff, and he said, 'I have to make a decision. What is your opinion?' '' Biden recounted. ''He started with the national security adviser, the secretary of state and he ended with me. Every single person in that room hedged their bets except Leon Panetta. Leon said go. Everyone else said, 49, 51. He got to me. He said, 'Joe, what do you think?' And I said, 'You know, I didn't know we had so many economists around the table.' I said, 'We owe the man a direct answer. Mr. President, my suggestion is, don't go. We have to do two more things to see if he's there.' ''
Biden is so eager to show how bold and cool Obama was in that teeth-rattling moment that he relishes admitting he gave cautious advice that was ignored.
The next morning, the president came down to get into Marine One, turned to Tom Donilon and said, ''Go.''
''He knew what was at stake,'' Biden said. ''Not just the lives of those brave warriors, but literally the presidency. And he pulled the trigger.''
The vice president concluded triumphantly: ''This guy doesn't lead from behind. He just leads.''
In a forum on YouTube and Google+ Monday, the president reinforced the spine spin, calmly dropping a news bomb by acknowledging that he had sent drones into Pakistan to execute pinpoint strikes on Al Qaeda. ''For us to be able to get them in another way,'' Obama said, ''would involve probably a lot more intrusive military actions than the one that we're already engaging in.''
Vice President Biden, Keeper of the Ramrod Backbone, hit the morning shows last week and painted a valorous picture of the president leaving the Situation Room for the State of the Union address after learning about the success of another daring Navy Seal raid that he had authorized to free aid workers from Somali pirates. ''All those pirates, all those terrorists, others should know we will find you,'' Biden told Charlie Rose on CBS.
In The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Leif Babin, a highly decorated former Navy Seal officer, accused the Obama administration of revealing secret operational details of Seal raids ''for political gain -- endangering our forces in the process.''
Still, this president has been much more reticent than his predecessor about celebrating his missions accomplished -- even though they really were amazing missions accomplished, not unnecessary missions mangled. And many of the Seal commandos seem to be enjoying their hero status.
Every election has the same narrative: Can the strong father protect the house from invaders? That question is burning now that intelligence sources are warning that Iranians might be coming to strike on U.S. soil. And, this time, we're also asking: Can the strong father save the house itself from going into foreclosure?
Like Biden, Mitt Romney's team has been busy building up the boss. In Florida, they focused intensely on strengthening Mitt's bendable backbone, coaching him so well on debate fisticuffs that Romney was able to instantly turn his rival back into Crybaby Newt. Mitt learned the age-old lesson: Slap the bully in the face and he runs off mewling.
After the Jacksonville debate, however, Mittens offered an unattractive display of vamping, chortling and gloating about leaving ''Goldilocks'' Gingrich in a puddle.
In his victory speech Tuesday night, Angry Mitt kept pounding: ''Mr. President, you were elected to lead. You chose to follow. And now it's time for you to get out of the way.''
But as he exits Florida, brushing Newt away and accusing Obama of adopting a strategy ''of appeasement and apology,'' Romney would do well to remember that real tough guys don't brag on themselves.
They let others do it.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expected To Charge Ex-Traders With Fraud

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors are preparing to file criminal charges against former traders at Credit Suisse, accusing them of defrauding investors by mispricing mortgage securities, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Charges could be filed as soon as Wednesday, said this person, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly. It is unclear how many traders will be charged.
The Credit Suisse traders are expected to be accused of overvaluing the positions on their books in order to increase their bonuses from the bank, this person said.
A case would be among the government's first criminal prosecutions involving a bank's valuation of complex securities called collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, which are created from bundles of mortgage bonds. The securities contributed to the inflating housing bubble and its subsequent collapse, which brought about the financial crisis of 2008.
The Justice Department has come under criticism for not bringing enough criminal cases connected to companies at the center of the financial crisis. In November 2009, in the first major criminal case connected to the financial crisis, a federal jury in New York City acquitted two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers on charges that they had misled investors as their portfolio of mortgage-backed securities plummeted in value.
At last week's State of the Union address, President Obama said that the government would redouble its efforts to investigate banks and other financial firms.
A new task force, said President Obama, ''will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.''
The Credit Suisse case has its origins in early 2008 when the Swiss bank fired a group of traders for inflating the value of collateralized debt obligations. The Swiss bank was forced to revalue to mismarked securities and take a $2.85 billion write-down.
The losses tied to the pricing errors were a major embarrassment for Credit Suisse, which performed better than most of its competitors during the credit crisis. Credit Suisse, which has been cooperating with the authorities in their investigation, will not be charged in the case. A spokesman for Credit Suisse declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment. A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected to file a parallel civil action, declined to comment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Economy Is Projected To Remain Sluggish

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that the economy would remain sluggish, with high unemployment, and that the federal budget deficit would exceed $1 trillion in 2012 for the fourth consecutive year.
The deficit will be $1.1 trillion in the current fiscal year, about $200 billion less than in 2011, and will fall sharply in the next three years as a result of tax increases and spending cuts required by existing law, the agency said in its annual report on the budget and economic outlook.
However, it said, that same combination of higher taxes and caps on spending will crimp economic growth. As a result, it said, the unemployment rate, which was 8.5 percent in December, will climb to 8.9 percent in the last quarter of this year, which includes Election Day, and will rise to 9.2 percent in the final quarter of 2013. 
''We have not had a period of such persistently high unemployment since the Depression,'' said Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Elmendorf said the tax increases and spending cuts ''would markedly slow the economic recovery'' in 2012 and 2013, but could add to the strength of the economy in the long run.
Assuming no change in current law, the budget office said, the economy -- measured by the gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation -- will grow 2 percent this year and just 1.1 percent in 2013.
The report provided grist for both parties. Republicans said it showed that President Obama's policies were not working, as evidenced by the high deficit, the rapidly increasing debt and continued high unemployment.
However, Democrats said the report confirmed their argument that new revenue, as well as spending cuts, would be needed to solve the nation's fiscal problems, and that a stronger economy was the best way to reduce the deficit.
The budget office said the federal government would borrow 30 cents of every dollar it spends this year, assuming a continuation of current law. Spending, it said, will total $3.6 trillion and revenues will total $2.5 trillion.
Tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. If Congress allows that to happen and if other laws remain unchanged, the report said, the deficit will fall to $585 billion in 2013 and $345 billion in 2014.
In other words, the report suggests, doing nothing may be the most straightforward way for Congress to slash the deficit, a goal espoused by lawmakers in both parties. Under an alternative scenario, the deficit would still drop below $1 trillion and decline as a share of the economy for several years if Congress extended the Bush tax cuts and reversed other budget-balancing policies.
This year's expected deficit of $1.1 trillion would amount to 7 percent of the economy, which is nearly two percentage points below the share recorded last year ''but still higher than any deficit between 1947 and 2008,'' the report said. ''Over the next few years, projected deficits drop markedly, averaging 1.5 percent of G.D.P. over the 2013-2022 period.''
Still, the budget office said, the government will need to continue borrowing to fill the gap between spending and revenues, and the total federal debt -- the accumulated total of such borrowing -- will rise to $21.6 trillion in 2022, from the current level of $15.2 trillion. And net interest payments on the debt would nearly triple, to $624 billion, the report said.
The budget office said it would cost $5.4 trillion if Congress continued the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 for another 10 years.
Mr. Obama and many Democrats want to continue most of those cuts for individuals with incomes under $200,000 a year and couples with incomes under $250,000 a year.
Because of the recession, total federal revenues declined in the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years and are just now returning to the level recorded in 2008. However, Mr. Elmendorf said, corporate tax payments are lower than expected and have not kept pace with the growth of corporate profits, so the average corporate tax rate has continued to decline.
Lawmakers of both parties say Congress must block impending cuts in Medicare payments to doctors, who face a 27 percent reduction in fees in March. Just to maintain Medicare payment rates at current levels, without an increase, would cost $372 billion over 10 years, compared with spending expected under current law, the budget office said.
The number of people receiving Social Security disability benefits has been increasing in recent years, and the budget office predicts that the disability trust fund will run out of money in 2016.
In addition, the budget office estimates that Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2022, two years earlier than the Obama administration predicted last May.
Mr. Elmendorf cited health care as a major factor driving the growth of federal spending. The cost of health benefit programs will more than double in the coming decade, rising by an average of nearly 8 percent a year and reaching $1.8 trillion in 2022, he said.
In particular, Mr. Elmendorf said, federal spending on Medicaid, the insurance program for low-income people, ''will shoot up rapidly in 2014, 2015 and 2016'' as the new health care law expands eligibility.
''About 67 million people were enrolled in Medicaid at some point in 2011,'' the budget office said. ''By 2022, about 95 million people will be enrolled.''

HEADLINE: As Syria Wobbles Under Pressure, Iran Feels the Weight of an Alliance

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Mark Landler and Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
As antigovernment forces in Syria's violent uprising have increased the pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to step down, Iran, his main Middle East supporter, also finds itself under siege, undermining a once-powerful partnership and longtime American foe.
It is an unusual position for Iran, and its vulnerability in Syria has not been lost on the United States, which has been imposing stiff economic sanctions on both countries.
In the calculus of predicting the political outcomes of the Arab Spring upheavals, some American officials and political analysts see the possible downfall of Mr. Assad as an event that could further undermine Iran as its economy reels under the sanctions imposed to get Tehran to suspend its nuclear program.
''It would completely change the dynamic in the region,'' one Obama administration official said Tuesday. 
The departure of Mr. Assad, the thinking goes, not only would threaten to sever Syria from Iran, which has long been a goal of the United States and its Arab allies, but also could deprive Iran of its main means of projecting power in the Middle East. If Mr. Assad were to fall, Tehran would lose its conduit for providing military, financial and logistical support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Both groups, which oppose Israel and are considered terrorist organizations by Washington, have vast arsenals of rockets and other weapons.
Moreover, the sanctions on Iran have severely impeded its ability to provide financial aid to Mr. Assad (let alone Hamas and Hezbollah), whose treasury has been depleted by the uprising and sanctions on Syria. Another senior administration official said Iran had nevertheless tried its best to prop up Mr. Assad, adding that ''you would see Assad fall faster if they weren't there.''
Syria is likewise important to Iran's efforts to assert its influence over the region, particularly because it borders Lebanon, which provides access to Hezbollah, and Israel, which Iran has declared its enemy.
Ali Banuazizi, a political science professor at Boston College and a co-director of its Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Program, said, ''To put it bluntly, if Iran is a threat, then one way to weaken that threat would be to weaken Syria and to help the anti-Assad movement in Syria.''
The weakness of the Syria-Iran axis represents a stark turnaround from a year ago, when Mr. Assad's grip on power seemed assured and Iran was describing itself as the inspiration for other Arab Spring uprisings and Islamist awakening that would subvert America and its allies. Iran even sent two naval vessels through the Suez Canal to Syria last February -- for the first time in more than 30 years -- in what the Iranians called a message of peace and friendship.
The uprising in Syria, now in its 11th month, has caused extreme discomfort to Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist organization that has been based in Damascus, Syria, for years. Last Friday, Khaled Meshal, Hamas's leader, left Damascus with no plans to return. Earlier in January, Ismail Haniya, Hamas's prime minister in Gaza, visited Turkey, a former Assad ally is now perhaps his most powerful regional critic.
It is by no means a certainty that Mr. Assad, who has repeatedly rejected calls for his resignation, will depart soon, despite the increased pressure on him on the streets of Syria and at the United Nations Security Council, where an effort by Western powers and the Arab League is under way to force him aside.
But as signs of his unpopularity have spread in Syria and his list of supporters declines, Iran has been one of the few conspicuous allies of Mr. Assad that has not abandoned him -- possibly because it has no alternative. Except for Mr. Assad's minority Alawite sect, other components of Syria's fractured sectarian mosaic have no affinity for Iran.
Many Syrians now view Iran as siding with their oppressor. There have been at least three instances in recent weeks of abductions of Iranians in Syria by anti-Assad forces.
The most notable was the seizure last month of five Iranians, whom Iran's state-run press called engineers but anti-Assad groups said were military advisers. In a video posted online by a unit of the insurgent Free Syrian Army, which claimed to hold the Iranians, one of the men identified as a hostage said the five had been ''involved in suppressing and shooting ordinary Syrians,'' and urged Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, ''to order the Iranian military personnel who suppress the Syrians to be repatriated from Syria, so we can also return home.''
While the veracity of that video has not been confirmed, it suggested a level of resentment in Syria toward Iran that had not been seen before.
Iran has continued to publicly recite Mr. Assad's version of the uprising -- that it is terrorism financed by foreign powers hostile to Syria. Ayatollah Khamenei added his voice on Tuesday, denouncing what he called ''the interference of America and its allies in Syrian domestic issues.''
At the same time, American officials said there was growing evidence that Iran was helping train and equip Syrian security forces.
''Our concerns include the fact that some of the tactics being used by the Syrian regime mirror tactics used in Iran against their own population and about increasing evidence of numbers of Iranians in and around Syria,'' the State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said.
In early January, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, Qassim Suleimani, visited Damascus, raising suspicions that Iran was advising Mr. Assad on how to quash the uprising. The Quds Force, part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, conducts operations outside Iran.
Still, Iranian officials have also urged Mr. Assad to show more flexibility toward his adversaries, advice he has basically ignored. While Iran will do what it can to ensure Mr. Assad's survival, a senior American official said the Iranians would not hesitate to seek a foothold with whoever succeeds Mr. Assad.
''There are certain constraints the Assad regime has that make it unable to reform its way out of this,'' said Andrew J. Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and an expert on Syria. ''Assad would have to undermine the very people he has to maintain order. I don't expect it's going to change now. I think the Iranians know that.''
At the same time, Mr. Tabler said, Mr. Assad's control has been undermined by American and other sanctions, and the Syrian treasury is dwindling. Given the sanctions on Iran, which have handed Iranians their own economic crisis, the leaders in Tehran are unlikely to provide significant financial aid to Mr. Assad.
''Some time in the middle of the year Syria is going to run out of cash, and it will be interesting to see what happens,'' Mr. Tabler said. Mr. Assad's demise, he said, ''would be the biggest blow to Iran's influence in the region in decades.''

HEADLINE: Economic Issues Drove Florida Voters

BYLINE: By MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- The economy, not social issues, mattered most to the Republican voters in Florida. A nominee who can win in November, not necessarily a ''true conservative,'' is the candidate they want.
Mitt Romney was backed by a diverse coalition of the state's electorate, in the first nominating contest with such a varied population. He won the majority of the votes from women, Hispanics, moderates, Catholics and the affluent, according to telephone and exit interviews with Florida voters. Newt Gingrich did well with very conservative voters and strong supporters of the Tea Party movement, which has a considerable following here and helped elect the state's governor, Rick Scott, and its junior senator, Marco Rubio, in 2010.
Florida has the fifth-highest foreclosure rate in the country, and voters see evidence of it in their own neighborhoods. Half the primary voters described the foreclosure situation in their communities as a major problem. About 40 percent of those voters backed Mr. Romney, who campaigned heavily on the issue, and a third voted for Mr. Gingrich. But Mr. Romney was the choice of almost half of those who considered foreclosures a minor problem or not a problem at all. 
In addition, Florida's unemployment rate, which is higher than the national average, may be weighing on voters' minds. The economy was the top issue for 6 in 10 voters, and most of them voted for Mr. Romney. More voters in Florida indicated that they were falling behind financially than in New Hampshire or South Carolina.
Unlike the earlier Republican contests, which allowed Democrats or independents to vote, Florida's primary is closed, permitting only registered Republicans. Still, almost 20 percent of the voters identified themselves as independents, a group that is considered a critical swing vote in the state and across the country. Mr. Romney won the votes of about 40 percent of them, and Mr. Gingrich received nearly 3 in 10.
Florida's voters labeled themselves as more conservative than those interviewed four years ago, but they were still more moderate than their counterparts in Iowa and South Carolina. About 7 in 10 Republican primary voters in Florida consider themselves conservative, and about 2 in 10 moderate. In 2008, 61 percent of Florida primary voters said they were conservative, and 28 percent were moderate.
Very conservative voters, about a third of the electorate, backed Mr. Gingrich, giving him more than 4 in 10 of their votes. Mr. Romney was backed by about 30 percent of very conservative voters.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney was considered the conservative alternative to a more moderate Senator John McCain, who became the party's nominee. In 2008, 44 percent of very conservative voters chose Mr. Romney, compared with 21 percent for Mr. McCain and 20 percent for Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York.
In this primary, about 4 in 10 voters said that Mr. Romney's positions were not conservative enough, while only half as many viewed Mr. Gingrich in a similar vein.
The state's ethnic diversity contrasts sharply with the largely white electorate in earlier contests this year. Mr. Romney did far better this time with Latino voters than in 2008: a majority of Latino voters, who made up about 15 percent of this year's Republican primary-goers, selected him. Four years ago, Mr. Romney finished far behind both Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani in the Hispanic bloc.
White evangelical Christians were important in Mr. Gingrich's victory in South Carolina. They made up 65 percent of that state's primary voters. But in Florida, 4 in 10 are white born-again or evangelical Christians; in South Carolina, it was 64 percent.
On Tuesday, these voters divided their support about evenly between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich. Ten days ago in South Carolina, 45 percent voted for Mr. Gingrich and 23 percent backed Mr. Romney.
Many of those evangelical Christians in South Carolina identified with or supported the Tea Party. And its popularity is just as strong in Florida as it is there or in Iowa. Two-thirds of Florida's G.O.P. voters said they supported the Tea Party, and they divided their votes closely between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich. In South Carolina, 45 percent of Tea Party supporters voted for Mr. Gingrich.
In Florida, Mr. Romney regained his status as the candidate most likely to win in November, and the ability to beat President Obama is becoming more important to Republican voters. It was the most important quality for about a third of those polled in Iowa and New Hampshire. About 45 percent in South Carolina said electability was the top quality, and about same number of voters in Florida agreed. But nearly 6 in 10 of those Florida Republicans selected Mr. Romney; half of those in South Carolina chose Mr. Gingrich.
The exit poll, conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press, includes in-person interviews with voters as they were leaving polling places across the state and telephone interviews with early and absentee voters.

HEADLINE: India's Air the World's Unhealthiest, Study Says

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS and MALAVIKA VYAWAHARE


HIGHLIGHT: Air quality in India worse than China and Bangladesh, a Yale and Columbia study says. 

 BODY:
India's has the worst air pollution in the entire world, beating China, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, according to a study released during this year's World Economic Forum in Davos.
Of 132 countries whose environments were surveyed, India ranks dead last in the 'Air (effects on human health)' ranking. The annual study, the Environmental Performance Index, is conducted and written by environmental research centers at Yale and Columbia universities with assistance from dozens of outside scientists. The study uses satellite data to measure air pollution concentrations.
India's high levels of fine particulate matter (a subject we've been looking at on India Ink, albeit just in Delhi) are one of the major factors contributing to the country's abysmal air quality. Levels of so-called PM 2.5, for the 2.5 micron size of the particulates, are nearly five times the threshold where they become unsafe for human beings.
Particulate matter is one of the leading causes of acute lower respiratory infections and cancer. The World Health Organization found that Acute Respiratory Infections were one of the most common causes of deaths in children under 5 in India, and contributed to 13% of in-patient deaths in paediatric wards in India.
When it comes to overall environment, India ranked among the world's "Worst Performers," at No. 125 out of the 132 nations, beating only Kuwait, Yemen, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Iraq. Neighboring Pakistan, in contrast, ranked 120th and Bangladesh was listed as No. 115 on overall environment.
It is not just India's big cities which are grappling with air pollution, said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of India's Centre for Science and Environment, a non-profit organization which was not involved in the study. Air pollution also is worsening in smaller cities, she said.
The main culprit, Ms. Roychowdhury said, is the growing number of vehicles in India. While the country still has far fewer vehicles per capita than developed nations, India's cars are more polluting, Ms. Roychowdhury said. Other air pollution experts also cite India's reliance coal and polluting industries like brick-making that are located close to densely-populated areas. 
Emission standards are nearly "10 years behind European standards," Ms. Roychowdhury said, and these standards are not legally enforceable, unlike in countries like the United States which has the Clean Air Act. India has an Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 which is supposed to be enforced by the Central Pollution Control Board. This act lacks teeth, Ms. Roychowdhury said. "We need to take big steps or the problem will overwhelm us," she said.
D. Saha, a scientist in the "Air Lab" at India's Central Pollution Control Board said the study's findings were not a matter of huge concern.
"We should not compare our country with others," Dr. Saha said. "India has a different terrain." He cited seasonal rainfall, deserts and dusty conditions as being responsible for the particulate matter. "Can we put water sprinklers across the country?," he asked.
Particulate matter comes from boilers, thermal power plants and cars, as well, he said, but India would not have development if these activities were curbed, he said. "The diseases mentioned in the report are caused by many factors not just particulate matter, we are raising undue alarm," Mr. Saha said.
His advice? "It is a non-issue, we have other pressing problems like poverty, focus on them."

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: The Buffett Rule

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
A deeply flawed bill pending in the New York State Legislature would allow check-cashing businesses, which are common in impoverished areas, to charge higher interest rates.
Jessica Ahlquist, a Rhode Island 11th grader, objected to the "School Prayer" that had been on her school's auditorium wall since 1963. What believers consider harmless can feel like coercion to nonbelievers.
Senate Democrats will propose legislation that would require million-dollar earners to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. Republicans will oppose it, but explaining a tax code that allows the wealthiest to escape their responsibility is getting harder to do.
Leaders of 25 European countries agreed to sign a new fiscal compact that will legally restrict them from fighting recessions with robust fiscal stimulus.

HEADLINE: Stupid N.C.A.A. Tricks: A Nocerablog Contest

BYLINE: JOE NOCERA


HIGHLIGHT: I thought I had stumbled onto the single dumbest N.C.A.A. rule of all time, but to my surprise, there are more out there. 

 BODY:
When I wrote my column last Saturday about Temi Fagbenle, the Harvard freshman who is being forced to sit out this year by the N.C.A.A., I thought I had stumbled onto the single dumbest N.C.A.A. rule of all time. (To refresh: Fagbenle moved to the United States from London after taking an exam required of all British students when they are around 15. Inexplicably, the N.C.A.A. rulebook says that taking that exam means that the student has finished high school, which is completely untrue. Rather, the exam is a passageway to the last few years of high school. The rulebook also states that a British student must then enter college within two years of "completing high school." Because Temi repeated her junior year after she got to America, she was ruled ineligible to play her freshman year in college.)
As it turns out, this rule isn't even close to the dumbest. I have since learned that N.C.A.A. rules allow a coach to give an athlete a bagel, but if it has cream cheese on it, that is a violation of amateurism. Oh, and here's another doozy: Last year, a track athlete at the University of New Hampshire had to travel for a weekend meet. The only problem was, she had a three-month old baby who was still nursing. The coach decided to let the woman bring her boyfriend and her baby to the meet. The N.C.A.A. ruled that this was an "improper benefit" to the athlete, and sanctioned both her and the track team.
Since I began writing about the N.C.A.A. earlier this month, I have been inundated with e-mails from readers, many of them parents of college athletes, with their own examples of N.C.A.A. idiocy. So we're going to have a contest. Send your favorite example of a stupid N.C.A.A. rule, or a rule that has been applied in some inane, thoughtless fashion to this blog's e-mail address: nocerablog@nytimes.com, or you can tell your story in the comment section, below. I will start posting the best ones over the next few days. The winner gets an autographed copy of "All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis," the book I co-wrote with Bethany McLean. (I'll get Bethany to sign it too.) I would have offered a free ticket to a college game, but I was afraid it would be ruled an improper benefit.
An earlier version of this post incorrectly described the reason the athlete from the University of New Hampshire was sanctioned. It was because her boyfriend accompanied her on the trip, not because she took her baby, as the post originally said. For more details, read this.

HEADLINE: The Fog of an Uncivil War in Sri Lanka

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: It has been nearly three years since Sri Lankan government troops crushed the separatist Tamil Tigers in a gory, scorched-earth campaign that brought an end to three decades of civil war. But the fog of war has still not lifted: Sri Lanka said Tuesday that it won't be sending a review of alleged war crimes to the United Nations for discussion. 

 BODY:
It has been nearly three years since Sri Lankan government troops crushed the separatist Tamil Tigers in a gory, scorched-earth campaign that brought an end to three decades of civil war. The final battles - with some 300,000 civilians caught in the crossfire - were fought on the northern beaches and in the impoverished hamlets of the island nation.
But the fog of war still has not lifted in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka said Tuesday that it would not be sending a review of alleged war crimes to the United Nations for discussion. There's no need, a senior government official said, because its international critics in New York won't be persuaded anyway. 
A United Nations report has already called for an international inquiry into likely atrocities. Investigators found credible claims that a lot of hands had a lot of blood on them. The Tigers, after all, pretty much invented suicide bombing and the use of female suicide bombers. And Sri Lankan artillery batteries unleashed hell, even if civilians were in the way.
Here's one representative sentence from the U.N. findings: "The Government systematically shelled hospitals on the frontlines.'' And this sentence, which found that the Tigers "started point-blank shooting of civilians who attempted to escape the conflict zone.'' 
It was that kind of war. More like murder.
In December, after the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission had taken testimonies from hundreds of battlefield witnesses, the government completed its review of the war.
Suresh Premachandran of the Tamil National Alliance, the leading political party of the minority Tamils, that the government's submersion of the report was meant to deflect a likely storm of criticism over its end-game prosecution of the war.
Sri Lanka's Foreign Ministry secretary told the Daily News in Colombothat government critics could not be persuaded by any explanation or defense. "We know that we can't make them happy no matter what we do,'' said Karunatilaka Amunugama.
In a recent commentary in The New York Times, the journalist Namini Wijedasa said the government report was "a valuable document, but regarding the war's final weeks, it is largely an apologia for the army.'' 
Sri Lanka's Independence Day falls on Saturday, marking the former colony's break from Britain in 1948. The timing would seem propitious for a reversal of the government's stance on its refusal to make a break with its more recent past.
Forwarding its report to the U.N. might also elicit some assistance from Washington if the United States and the European Union place further sanctions on Iran. Sri Lanka gets 93 percent of its oil from Iran. 
A senior U.S. Treasury official, Luke Bronin, is scheduled to have talks in Sri Lanka on Thursday. Iranian sanctions will certainly be on the agenda.
"We need an alternative. We'll tell them to give us an alternative," President Mahinda Rajapaksa told reporters on Tuesday, noting that in the end, U.S. and E.U. sanctions "are not punishing Iran - they are punishing us, small countries.''
He was asked if he would ask for a waiver of the sanctions, for a way to escape the Washington-Tehran crossfire.
"We might,'' the president said. "Otherwise, how do we survive?''

HIGHLIGHT: The inability of conservatives and liberals to get along may be traced back to the French Revolution. 

 BODY:
Corey Robin's new book presents conservatives as fundamentally committed to stopping "subordinate classes" from taking power from the ruling elite. Conservatism, Robin says, holds that "the lower orders should not be allowed to exercise their independent will, to govern themselves or the polity." Mark Lilla, however, has argued that Robin misrepresents the tradition of conservative thought.
According to Lilla, the distinction between conservatives and liberals is philosophical. Conservatives like Edmund Burke "have always seen society as a kind of inheritance we receive and are responsible for; we have obligations toward those who came before and to those who will come after, and these obligations take priority over our rights." But liberals like John Stuart Mill "assume that societies are genuinely constructs of human freedom, that whatever we inherit from them, they can always be unmade or remade through free human action."

Given this understanding, however, Lilla concludes that, in current America politics, everyone is a liberal: "We take it for granted that we are born free, that we constitute society, it doesn't constitute us and that together we legitimately govern ourselves." This seems right, but if it is, why do we still find talk of liberals and conservatives inevitable in describing our political differences?
The answer, I think, is that we have never gotten over the French Revolution. The revolution introduced the basic liberal idea that government must be fundamentally democratic: that, as Lilla puts it, "we legitimately govern ourselves." There is no sovereignty - no king, no social or economic elite, apart from the people themselves - that has ultimate political power. We all, in principle, share in the power to govern ourselves.
But this idea led (or, at least, was feared to lead) to a much more radical one: that everyone should have an share in power. Robin cites Edmund Burke: "The real object" of the French Revolution is "to break all those connections, natural and civil, that regulate and hold together the community by a chain of subordination." Conservatism derived from the fear that the liberal project of democracy would destroy all the traditional privileges of men over women, employers over workers, rich over poor, educated over uneducated, whites over other races, and the like.
We are all today liberals in the sense that we accept universal political inclusion. But we also tolerate and even support various forms of inequality, which amount to different degrees of political power. Differences in wealth, education, job, gender, race and age all in fact correspond to differences in power. Hardly anyone thinks all of these differences are bad, but conservatives on the whole think we have gone far enough or even too far in eliminating them, while liberals think that we are still far short of a proper distribution of power.
Many claim that the liberal-conservative division is over the role of government, with liberals supporting government intervention and conservatives opposing it. But the real issue is not so much whether government should intervene as it is on which side it should intervene. For the most part conservatives are, for example, quite in favor of government's regulating the behavior of labor unions and limiting the ability of consumers to sue businesses, whereas liberals are generally opposed to these sorts of government interference.
In an important sense, history is on the side of liberals. They can point to a continuing trend in the redistribution of power - favoring, for example, workers, women, minorities - that conservatives originally opposed but now generally join liberals in accepting. But there is no basis for assuming that any and all redistributions of power are appropriate (should we, for example, lower the voting age to 16 or even to 12?) or that a particular way of achieving a needed redistribution of power is sound (is reverse discrimination a good way of overcoming racial and gender inequalities?). To this extent, there may always be room for conservative critiques of liberal proposals.
What we need to keep in mind is that for us the basic issues of the French Revolution have been resolved (the final step was probably the Voting Rights Act of 1965). We firmly endorse the principle of democratic inclusion but also soundly reject the radical call for an equal distribution of power. We live in a post-revolutionary society, where liberals are not radicals and conservatives are not reactionaries. Our political debates - important as they often are - are about optimizing the distribution of power within a non-radical (that is, not completely egalitarian) democracy.
Much of the rancor of our politics comes from forgetting this fact. Conservatives see liberal proposals as steps toward extreme socialism or communism; liberals see conservative proposals as steps toward a repudiation of democracy. The stakes, however, are not anywhere near this high. Similarly, attacks - whether from Tea Party members or Wall Street Occupiers - on the legitimacy of our political institutions are fundamentally misguided.
I am not saying that conservatives and liberals are equally at fault. My personal opinion is that conservatives have gone much further down the path of demonization and delegitimization. But some liberals also have strong tendencies in this direction. In any case we need to stop fighting the French Revolution and focus on the hard work of governing ourselves with the democratic system we have so successfully built.

HEADLINE: Why a Liberal Arts Education Matters

BYLINE: VEDIKA KHEMANI


HIGHLIGHT: A native of Kolkata, India, writes of attending Harvey Mudd College in California, where she studied physics and math, as well as philosophy and creative writing, an experience that taught her how to think critically and ask questions. 

 BODY:
Well, what is it going to be: engineering, medicine or commerce? 
Most 12th-grade students in India are faced with this question, as they struggle to fit themselves into one of a few narrowly defined boxes. Heaven forbid someone might enjoy reading both Newton's laws and Plato's dialogues! Plato is clearly a waste of time with no practical, remunerative value. Or is it?
I grew up in Kolkata, India, and came to the United States as a freshman to study physics atHarvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif. Harvey Mudd is a unique liberal arts college which specializes in science and engineering, while also honing its graduates to be well read in the humanities and social sciences. While taking intensive physics and mathematics classes, I also studied history, economics, linguistics, philosophy and creative writing. I am now pursuing a Ph.D. in theoretical physics at Princeton University. 
Based on my experiences, I wanted to advocate for the value and necessity of a broad, liberal education rich in both technical subjects and the humanities.
The pragmatic attitude taken by most Indian students and parents is certainly understandable in a country where millions of students regularly compete for scarce college placements and job opportunities. The entrance requirements at Indian universities have steadily risen, with certain premier colleges in New Delhi posting the mind-boggling admission cutoff of 99 percent last year. 
In this high-stress setting, students want to study whatever will land them a job, creating a college experience much more akin to "technical training" rather than intellectual exploration. However, I believe it is precisely today's environment with a rapidly expanding, educated working class in India that makes an interdisciplinary liberal arts education all the more necessary.
In a global world dominated by so-called knowledge workers, the ability to communicate effectively and work well on a team is imperative. But besides raw technical ability, how do you develop the myriad other skills needed to distinguish yourself and excel in your job? How can you learn to inspire people so they want to work towards the sales goals you've set? 
As a start, try an oratory class and read speeches given by paradigm-changing leaders. To learn the brevity, precision and charisma needed to write a funding proposal for your dream project, try a creative writing class. To incorporate vastly different perspectives from your team members, try classes in psychology and philosophy. These may help you understand where they might be coming from. 
And nothing could be more practical than the humanities.
As the story goes, when three blind men felt an elephant, one concluded it was flat like a wall, another thought it sharp like a spear and the last was sure an elephant was thin like a snake. All were correct in their own way, just incomplete. 
The ability to synthesize different perspectives into the big picture is far more powerful than narrow expertise in any single field. The social sciences offer perspectives from vantage points separated by time, place and society. Drawing and painting offer perspectives on what perspective even means. Critical thinking is the logical result of being able to simultaneously synthesize multiple ideas in one's mind.
Real-world problems rarely ever have textbook solutions. More than anything, the purpose of a college education is to learn how to think critically and what questions to ask. Liberal arts colleges aim to mold their students into well-rounded, well-informed global citizens with a wide skill set -- whether it is through elective or voluntary courses that push specialized students to be broader, or general requirements that force every graduate to know at least something about certain subjects.
In the throes of our current economic crisis, all conventional strategies for success are moot. All the more reason for a liberal arts education that creates resilient people who can invent creative solutions and always have new ways by which to try things differently. 
As Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited; imagination encircles the world."

HEADLINE: A Love-Hate Relationship With Facebook

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Facebook is reportedly planning to file the prospectus for its initial public offering today, and the number of users suggests that Europe is in love with the company. But there are concerns about its policies and its reach as the European Union considers a tough new privacy law. 

 BODY:
LONDON - As Facebook reportedly prepared to head to Wall Street on Wednesday, a new survey has revealed the extent of young people's emotional dependency on social networking and the Internet.
A study published this week by Intersperience, a British-based consumer research consultancy, found that 70 percent of British teenagers chatted on Facebook, while six out of 10 said they would feel "sad" if they were deprived of access to the Internet.
Although the researchers said the statistics should not be a cause for concern, they are likely to be seized by parents worried by their children's apparent retreat into a virtual world.
Europe, with almost a quarter of a billion Facebook users, according to Internet World Stats, accounts for the networking site's biggest area of penetration after the United States. Worldwide, some 80 percent of Facebook users are outside the U.S., according to the company's own figures.
The explosive growth of Facebook has generated a love-hate relationship with social networking among European legislators.
On the one hand, governments increasingly use the Internet to communicate with their constituents and welcome the business benefits that social networking brings. On the other, social networking raises issues of privacy and censorship in an online environment governments find difficult to control.
Ahead of its expected IPO on Wednesday, Facebook claimed the economic benefits were significant. A study it commissioned from Deloitte and published last month estimated that, across the 27 states of the European Union, activity linked to Facebook generated gross revenue of E32 billion in 2011 and supported 232,000 jobs.
Experts, including my colleague Somini Sengupta, noted that the source of these benefits was very broadly drawn and suggested Facebook might be issuing a veiled warning to European legislators not to tamper with its activities or risk losing business.
The European Commission is considering a sweeping law that would fine companies such as Facebook for failing to obtain explicit consent from consumers about the use of their personal data. It and other Internet companies would also be obliged to delete such data forever at the consumer's request.
Further signs of official unease came in heated exchanges in a committee of the British House of Commons on Monday when legislators grilled executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter over privacy and legal concerns.
All this is not to say that European authorities and politicians do not use social networking when it suits them.
A range of national leaders now have Twitter accounts and public institutions use Facebook for outreach. The Basque regional parliament in Spain boasted this week that 200,000 people had accessed its Facebook page to seek information about a proposed climate change law.
And who knew the Danish police had its own Facebook page until they complained this week that the company had inadvertently taken it down?

HEADLINE: 3 Former Traders at Credit Suisse Charged With Bond Fraud

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Federal prosecutors accused three former Credit Suisse traders of inflating the value of mortgage bonds in 2007 just as the housing market was deteriorating. 

 BODY:
9:48 p.m. | Updated 
The government charged three former Credit Suisse traders on Wednesday with inflating the value of mortgage bonds as the housing market collapsed, a rare criminal prosecution of Wall Street executives for their conduct during the financial crisis.
Federal prosecutors contend they deployed the scheme to increase their year-end bonuses.
The charges, involving traders in New York and London, come just a week after President Obama pledged in his State of the Union address to escalate investigations of banks and other financial firms and "help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans."
Two of the Credit Suisse traders, David Higgs and Salmaan Siddiqui, pleaded guilty to mismarking their positions to avoid losses at the end of 2007, just as the housing market was deteriorating. Both are cooperating with the investigation.
The third man charged, Kareem Serageldin, their boss, headed a group that traded mortgage-backed securities.
In a conference call on Wednesday, the United States attorney for Manhattan, Preet S. Bharara, urged Mr. Serageldin, 42, an American citizen who lives in London, to come to the United States and face the charges against him.
"My client has done nothing wrong and is fully cooperating with the investigation," said James McGuire, a lawyer for Mr. Serageldin. "In terms of how and when he plans to defend the case I need to confer with him."
In court appearances Wednesday, Mr. Higgs, 42, and Mr. Siddiqui, 36, both said that they participated in the fraud at the direction of Mr. Serageldin.
"The stunning scale of the illegal mismarking in this case was surpassed only by the greed of the senior bankers behind the scheme," said Robert Khuzami, the head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought a parallel civil action against the former Credit Suisse traders. The assets that the Credit Suisse traders overvalued were mortgage-backed securities, the bonds that caused hundreds of billions of dollars in losses across the global financial system.
As the housing market inflated, banks pooled mortgages, many of them to shaky borrowers, and packaged them into complex collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. The banks then sold parts of the C.D.O.'s to investors, who believed the C.D.O. structure protected them from losses on the mortgages backing the securities. Ratings agencies shared that view, often awarding C.D.O. securities a triple-A credit rating.
From 2003 to 2007, Wall Street issued nearly $700 billion in C.D.O.'s that contained mortgages, according to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.
As the housing market crumbled in 2007, however, demand for mortgage-backed assets evaporated, and banks - particularly Merrill Lynch and Citigroup - were saddled with money-losing holdings they could not sell. These would later be the source of the crippling losses that forced each to take government bailouts.
Unlike stocks, mortgage-backed securities lacked a liquid market with transparent pricing. And as the subprime-mortgage crisis escalated, it became harder for banks to attach a market value to their holdings. As their portfolios dropped in value, many banks were reluctant to mark down their holdings. These banks were later forced to take billions of dollars of losses when the housing market collapsed.
Mortgage securities were at the center of the S.E.C.'s 2010 lawsuit against Goldman Sachs that accused the bank of securities fraud, a case that Goldman paid $550 million to settle. Also in 2010, Citigroup paid $75 million to settle S.E.C. charges that in 2007 the bank had failed to disclose some billions of dollars of subprime-mortgage exposure contained in the bank's C.D.O.'s. Neither bank admitted wrongdoing.
The government's case against the former Credit Suisse traders depicts a brazen scheme to artificially increase the price of bonds on their books to create fictitious profits just as the housing market was seizing up.
In one instance, the team, facing an inquiry from Credit Suisse's internal controls group in August 2007, tried to justify their mortgage bond portfolio's inflated value by seeking "independent" marks from other banks' trading desks, according to the government.
After learning that the marks at Deutsche Bank and Barclays Capital were substantially lower than their own marks, they looked elsewhere.
Mr. Siddiqui, the junior trader, subsequently secured sham "independent" marks from a friend who worked at a small investment bank.
"In less than a minute, Mr. Siddiqui's friend generated prices on a number of AAA bonds that were nearly identical to those recorded by Mr. Siddiqui and his conspirators," the government said.
The false profits allowed Mr. Serageldin, the head of the group, to secure a cash bonus of more than $1.7 million and a stock award of more than $5.2 million. Credit Suisse rescinded the stock award after it discovered the fraud; the government will try to get the cash bonus back as well.
The government's investigation of Credit Suisse originated in early 2008 when the bank disclosed that it was taking a $2.65 billion write-down after discovering that a team of traders had mismarked the value of mortgage securities on their books. Credit Suisse suspended the team.
The bank, which will not be charged in the case, has been cooperating with authorities.
Mr. Bharara, whose office brought the case, has become a leading figure in the government's effort to combat financial fraud. The federal prosecutor appears on the cover of the new issue of Time magazine that arrives on newsstands on Friday. Plastered over Mr. Bharara's portrait is the headline: "This Man is Busting Wall St."
His office has received the most attention for its crackdown on insider trading at hedge funds, including the conviction of the billionaire Raj Rajaratnam.
The Credit Suisse prosecution is the latest in a series of fraud cases that Mr. Bharara has brought against large financial firms and their executives. In October, it brought a civil lawsuit against the Bank of New York Mellon, accusing it of cheating state and other pension funds nationwide out of foreign exchange fees over the last decade.
Earlier last year, Mr. Bharara's office filed a civil complaint against Deutsche Bank, claiming that one of its units had lied about the quality of government-backed mortgage loans it underwrote.
Both Bank of New York Mellon and Deutsche Bank have denied the government's claims.
Mr. Bharara has bristled at criticism - some of it from his relatives, he has said - that the government is not prosecuting enough people related to misconduct during the financial crisis. Mr. Bharara has said that complex financial fraud cases, like the four-year-old Credit Suisse investigation, take time to build and are often difficult to prove.
"The number of prosecutions is not a function of resources, effort, commitment or courage," Mr. Bharara said last year, speaking to a group of reporters.
"It is a function of the laws, the facts, and the painstaking nature of these investigations."

HEADLINE: Former Intern Sues Hearst Over Unpaid Work and Hopes to Create a Class Action

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: Xuedan Wang worked at Harper's Bazaar four months without pay, putting in 40-hour workweeks. In such cases, her lawyers argue, interns are doing the jobs of entry-level workers, without being compensated. 

 BODY:
5:23 p.m. | Updated A former unpaid intern for the fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar filed a lawsuit on Wednesday, accusing its parent company, the Hearst Corporation, of violating federal and state wage and hour laws by not paying her even though she often worked there full time.
In her lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the intern, Xuedan Wang, and her law firm are asking to make the case a class action on behalf of what they say are hundreds of unpaid interns at Heart Magazines, which also publishes Cosmopolitan, Seventeen and Good Housekeeping.
Employment experts say a growing number of young people, hundreds of thousands of them, do unpaid internships each year as they seek to get a foot in the door and gain work experience. But some interns and labor advocates assert that many employers are taking advantage of these interns - and violating Labor Department rules in the process - by using the interns essentially to do the jobs of other workers and not providing a bona fide educational experience.
The lawsuit against Hearst states, "Employers' failure to compensate interns for their work, and the prevalence of the practice nationwide, curtails opportunities for employment, fosters class divisions between those who can afford to work for no wage and those who cannot, and indirectly contributes to rising unemployment."
According to the lawsuit, Ms. Wang, who graduated from Ohio State University in 2010, was an intern at Harper's Bazaar from August 2011 to December 2011 and said she generally worked 40 hours a week but sometimes as many as 55 hours. Her lawyers said that Ms. Wang, with a degree in strategic communications, coordinated pickups and deliveries of fashion samples between Harper's Bazaar and fashion vendors and showrooms and assigned other unpaid interns to help carry out the pickups and deliveries.
She also helped maintain records on the fashion samples and process reimbursement requests for corporate expense reports.
"Unpaid interns are becoming the modern-day equivalent of entry-level employees, except that employers are not paying them for the many hours they work," said Adam Klein, one of the lawyers for Ms. Wang. "The practice of classifying employees as 'interns' to avoid paying wages runs afoul of federal and state wage and hour laws."
Hearst, like many other media companies, does not pay its interns, but officials say it arranges for them to receive academic credit through their college or university. Hearst officials said that this arrangement is made clear to prospective interns in advance.
A spokesman, Paul Luthringer, said: "We have not been served with any such lawsuit and thus cannot comment at this time."
The lawsuit pointed to guidelines from the United States Labor Department, which state that unpaid internships are only lawful in the context of an educational training program, when the interns do not displace regular employees and the employer derives no immediate advantage from the intern's work. The guidelines also state another criterion for internships to be unpaid: "the internship experience is for the benefit of the intern."
Ms. Wang's lawyers said that by treating her and others as interns rather than regular employees, they were denied not only wages, but also Social Security contributions and the right to receive unemployment insurance and workers' compensation.
Last September, Mr. Klein's Manhattan-based law firm, Outten & Golden, filed a lawsuit against Fox Searchlight Pictures, accusing it of violating wage laws by using unpaid interns to work on "Black Swan" and other films. Fox Searchlight has denied any wrongdoing.
An earlier version of this post had an incorrect date -- December 2010 -- for when Ms. Wang began her internship.
An earlier correction had the wrong starting date for Ms. Wang. She worked four months, from August 2011 to December 2011.

HEADLINE: Despite Big Victory, Romney Won't Let Up on Gingrich

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney comes off a Florida win questioning Newt Gingrich's conservative credentials. 

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS - On a three-hour flight from Florida, where Mitt Romney picked up the state's 50 delegates Tuesday night in a big primary victory, to Minneapolis, an ebullient Mr. Romney came to the back of his private airplane to chat with his traveling press corps.
 "Wow, what a night, huh?" said Mr. Romney, clad in jeans and white dress shirt. "If they all go like that I'll feel pretty good. I obviously feel terrific."
 Mr. Romney, who waged a against Newt Gingrich in Florida, showed no signs of easing up on the former speaker of the House, at least in the short term. 
 
 When asked if a line from his victory speech Tuesday night - about how a heated primary won't divide the Republicans but simply make each candidate stronger - still held true if the fight continued all the way to the convention, Mr. Romney willingly brought up Mr. Gingrich, attacking his conservative credentials while touting his own.
 "I really think that he fact that conservatives in Florida said they supported me makes sense," Mr. Romney said, before laying into Mr. Gingrich's record on things like climate change and Medicare reform:
 
"I'm the guy that refused to sign a cap and trade bill in New England. The speaker sat down with Nancy Pelosi on cap and trade. So who's the conservative in that one? How about making sure that Medicare is fiscally solvent? I put a proposal out which now Wyden and Ryan have taken on legislatively. When Ryan put his plan, Paul Ryan put his plan out in the first place I said it was a major advance, a big step forward, we were on the same page. Speaker Gingrich called that right-wing social engineering. Who's the conservative on that one? I mean his big idea in the last campaign was building a colony on the moon. Spending that kind of money I don't consider conservatism. And by the way, there's only one person on the stage that's argued for a national health care mandate as late as 2009, that was Speaker Gingrich."
 
He concluded, somewhat incongruously, "So I'm not saying he's not conservative. I'm just saying he's not the pure conservative he would have people believe, and I think the folks in Florida saw through that."
Mr. Romney, who did not get a congratulatory call from Mr. Gingrich after his Florida victory - "You know, it doesn't bother me in the slightest," he said -said he expected Mr. Gingrich to command some of the spotlight in the next round of contests, whether or not Mr. Romney keeps the pressure on him.
"I think the Speaker will get ample airtime whether I'm talking about him or talking about other issues," Mr. Romney said. "You know, I don't know what he'll be saying in Minnesota, or what he'll be saying in Nevada, but we've seen a pattern of him going to each state and making promises of the things he'll do for that state."
Mr. Romney also accused Mr. Gingrich of pandering to the various early nominating states.
"He's just gone from state to state to state, he's taken an issue that is a local issue and said he's all in favor of it," Mr. Romney said. "We have not heard from him how he's going to balance the budget. It's instead been a campaign of promises, and what he calls bold ideas, but which are primarily satisfying the interests of the local population."
"There's nothing wrong with helping people that have concerns and challenges in the state, but it begins to be a pattern when you see it state after state after state, and you recognize the reason we're in the trouble we're in is because of politicians who promise stuff to everybody they see," Mr. Romney added.
When asked by a reporter about a comment he had made early Wednesday morning to CNN, in which he said, "I'm not concerned about the very poor -we have a safety net there," Mr. Romney said his comment needed to be viewed in the full context he had originally intended.
"I've said throughout the campaign my focus, my concern, my energy is going to be devoted to helping middle income people, all right?" he said. "We have a safety net for the poor in the country, and if there are holes in it, I will work to repair that. And if there are people that are falling through the cracks, I want to fix that."
He added: "But my focus in the campaign is on middle-income people. Of course I'm concerned about all Americans - poor, wealthy, middle class, but the focus of my effort will be on middle income families who I think have been most hurt by the Obama economy."

HEADLINE: In Climate Fight, Tracking the Line Between Diagnosis and Treatment

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Some inconvenient realties behind dueling manifestos on global warming science and solutions. 

 BODY:
The last few days have seen frenzied volleys in the fight over climate science and policy, beginning with a 16-author op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal on Friday and, most recently, with a 39-author rebuttal published today in the paper. Most of the authors in both camps are scientists.
In a quick post last night, I noted one hard reality -- that it will be economic pressures, not scientific findings, that largely determine what the world's nations do, or don't do, to limit the flow of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from fuel burning.
The other factor is public willingness to integrate long-term risks in near-term behaviors. In poor countries, this is nearly impossible. In rich ones, we're not too good at it, either (consider the well-forecast, but denied, risk of a housing bubble and lack of earthquake readiness in Oregon as examples).
Roger Pielke, Jr., of the University of Colorado, Boulder, has long been pummeled by climate campaigners for pointing out the primacy of economic conditions over climate concerns through his "iron law of climate policy." But he's hardly alone in noting this reality. I often have cited the 2005 statement of then British Prime Minister Tony Blair to make the point:
The blunt truth about the politics of climate change is that no country will want to sacrifice its economy in order to meet this challenge.
With this in mind, below you'll hear from economists with somewhat different reactions to the initial Journal op-ed article.
But first let's return to the dueling scientists and their allies. Both manifestos illustrate the lure and hazards of arguing from the edges. It's always easier to cast an opponent in stark, caricatured terms. But society loses out in the resulting din.
The first group of authors tries to label the climate science community as an army of influential catastrophists, alarmists, and profiteers -- glossing over the reality that the vast body of climate science and climate policy analysis is, as in any field, full of gradations (not to mention that there's not much evidence of substantial influence).
There are valid points hidden deep in the op-ed piece (any presidential candidate should indeed care about bolstering, not shredding, our capacity to monitor and understand climate), but they are interlaced with ridiculous comparisons (Lysenkosism and climate activism).
The piece claims a pecuniary motive for the scientists pushing for emissions limits, while ignoring the far greater monetary benefit going to companies and factions seeking to sustain society's fossil energy norms while fighting any effort (modest or ambitious) to limit long-term environmental risks from those energy choices.
The rebuttal letter, and many other blog posts and online reactions from some of the signatories, does a good job of calling out scientific inaccuracies in the first column. But the authors, most of whom have degrees in meteorology and related physical sciences, can't resist pushing their own policy point:
In addition, there is very clear evidence that investing in the transition to a low-carbon economy will not only allow the world to avoid the worst risks of climate change, but could also drive decades of economic growth. Just what the doctor ordered.
The thing is, that framing entirely avoids the policy issue that the first team was addressing -- which was about the pace and scale (drastic or otherwise) of such an effort. How fast a transition? How costly?
Those are legitimate issues worth digging in on. And there the answers are not a function of a single set of scientific, or economic, skill sets, but of the aggregate result of society's pushing and pulling, tugging and tussling.
I'd love to see a flatter playing field for that discussion, in which politicians consider the issue without the blinders created by campaign contributions and the like and the public has the sources and skills to get beyond oversimplified debating points.
But that's no different for energy and climate policy than it is for health policy, military spending and goals, and a host of different consequential issues.
The rebuttal began with a much-used metaphor for paying attention to the right expert: "Do you consult your dentist about your heart condition?"
The reality for most of the signatories of the rebuttal letter is that they are more akin to medical technicians -- making sure the thermometers gauging a fever are reliable -- and radiologists -- interpreting a CT scan -- than diagnosticians prescribing the appropriate treatment.
You don't consult a radiologist about how to proceed when a scan identifies a tumor. And even with oncologists, you absolutely pursue multiple opinions.
I had a relevant experience yesterday when I went to my general practitioner to discuss various issues. My stroke neurologist (background here) has prescribed a full aspirin a day for the rest of my life -- a wise course from her standpoint. My doctor said that guarantees a bleeding ulcer.
We're figuring out a reasonable path navigating how to balance those very different risks.
Back to climate economics.
As I wrote above, James Carville's campaign mantra about "the economy, stupid," is vital to keep in mind here as well, so I'll closed with the voices of three economists who've extensively analyzed the economic impacts of accumulating greenhouse gases and various policies for curbing emissions.
Each sent a constructive reaction to last Friday's Journal piece.
They're featured here as a group "Your Dot" post (a Dot Earth feature aimed at fostering productive non-anonymous commentary).
The comments build on the reaction early this week from William Nordhaus, the Yale University economist who disputed how the authors of the first Journal piece characterized his work on the economics of aggressive and slower climate policies.
Here's Martin L. Weitzman, a professor of economics at Harvard who has extensively analyzed climate risks and responses. 
I think that Bill got it just about right in the citation: "Climate change is unlikely to be catastrophic in the near term, but it has the potential for serious damages in the long run. There are big economic stakes in designing efficient approaches."
The WSJ petition crossed a bright line of civil discourse by the degree of misrepresentation of Bill's views. Likewise, when extreme climate-change worriers push on a gullible public unwarranted attribution of noisy bad weather events to climate change, they cross a bright line that deserves opprobrium.
There is enough difficulty in deciding how to weave workable policy into high degrees of uncertainty without crossing bright lines of misrepresentation. So I think we all need to rule misrepresentations out of order because the court of public opinion already has an overloaded docket in dealing with this kind of futuristic uncertainty.
Here's Robert O. Mendelsohn, a professor of economics and forest policy at Yale University:
I have read through the [op-ed article] and I believe that they have a point in that the climate community sometimes goes after authors who find contrary results almost like how the Roman Catholic Church went after heretics in the Middle Ages. The general argument of the critics appears to be the lack of evidence to support "dramatic" programs of harsh greenhouse controls (e.g. 80% reductions in emissions). I personally believe the critics are right about this. The evidence to engage in harsh mitigation programs is very scanty.
However, what the critics do not say is that they would support modest rational programs to begin reducing greenhouse gases immediately. I view this as a major weakness of the critics because such policies are what society should be talking about.
I do not believe the critics made much attempt to depict Bill [Nordhaus]'s work accurately. However, it is fair to say that a rational modest policy would permit continued economic growth into the future including the continued development of emerging and undeveloped countries.
Finally, here's Gary W. Yohe of Wesleyan University (who is also a signatory of the Journal rebuttal letter):
The Wall Street Journal opinion piece convolutes many very complicated ideas, but two that they completely ignore are very simple.
On the one hand, climate change depends on cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions, which drive concentrations which drive temperature change. Holding concentrations or temperature (more remotely) to a particular target therefore means limiting cumulative emissions of, say, carbon over time... a limited amount of time if we are talking about an iterative approach, and over a long period of time if we are talking about reducing the likelihood of some very nasty consequences well after we (but not our grandchildren -- if we are lucky enough to have some) are gone.
More to the point, this simple truth from climate science means limiting cumulative consumption of (say) carbon to a particular number; and so carbon emissions become an "exhaustible resource" and mitigation becomes an exhaustable resource problem. Successful students in first semester introductory economics (at least at Wesleyan) learn that the least cost solution to an exhaustible resource problem (we do discounting right off the bat) is to calculate a scarcity rent, apply it immediately to the price of the resource, and let it grow at the rate of interest.
Hotelling reported this result in the economics literature in the 1930's. It is gospel, and even intro students understand that delay in allocating a scarce resource over time is never a least-cost option.
But what if there were a chance that there was no reason to restrict cumulative emissions of heat-trapping gasses? What if cumulative emissions of carbon were not limited? A paper on "hedging" that I publishedin Science in 2004 with Natasha Andronova and Michael Schlesinger (see Dot Earth for a discussion and link) indicated that starting mitigation now would be the right choice even if our analysis included a significant chance that doing nothing would turn out to be (in 2035) the right choice -- that is, even with a 20% chance that climate change would turn out to be a hoax. I think that the likelihood of that is close to zero, but so what?
We included it in our analysis and observed that many of the temperature targets that negotiators contemplate would be impossible if no action were taken to limit emissions of heat trapping gasses before 2035. Not just economically impossible, but technologically impossible given resource constraints that have only become more binding over the past few years.
In short, doing nothing closes policy options that could turn out to have been the right choice - in a time when our grandchildren will wonder what it was that we were thinking about.
It follows from both of these fundamentally economic insights that proposing delay for decades is an irresponsible option that is offered by those who (1) really do not understand climate science and, (2) perhaps more importantly, really completely misrepresent the economics of the problem.

HEADLINE: Will the I.R.S. Be Busy Next Year?

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The outcome of the presidential election might help determine how many audits the Internal Revenue Service conducts and whether they're aimed more at individuals or corporations, if historical patterns hold, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 
Republican and Democratic presidents are quite different in their enforcement of tax laws and their administration of the Internal Revenue Service.
Republicans are constantly telling us how different they are from the Democrats, and vice versa. But in many ways Republican and Democratic politicians are a lot like Coke and Pepsi - very different marketing but essentially made of the same chemicals.
President Obama, for example, has retained the Republican policy of keeping prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. And as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney put into place a state health insurance plan that in many ways resembles the federal Affordable Care Act enacted by a Democratic Congress.
Economists have studied the history of policy making by Republican and Democratic presidents. They find a few differences here and there, but for the most part both types of presidents play to the same middle of the country and to many of the same interest groups.
But one significant difference between the two parties had been their administration of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency of the United States Treasury that enforces tax rules. A dissertation written in 2005 by Valentin Estevez at the University of Chicago found that:
 "Under Democratic presidencies the audit rate of income tax returns is higher than under Republican presidencies even after the inclusion of various political and economic controls."
 "During Democratic presidencies the I.R.S. tends to audit fewer individual returns and more corporate returns than during Republican presidencies."
"Parties may be in fact resorting to more subtle redistributive policies, such as the likelihood of an audit, to favor their constituency."
I.R.S. data released since Mr. Estevez's dissertation have confirmed the tendencies of Democratic and Republican presidents to use I.R.S. audits differently. Twelve percent of millionaire earners were audited in 2011, when Barack Obama was president, compared with 5 to 7 percent audit rates for 2004-9 (George W. Bush was president most of that time). Among people earning less than $200,000, a far lower percentage of returns are audited (about 1 percent in 2011).
Steven Miller, deputy I.R.S. commissioner for services and enforcement, told The Associated Press, in reference to the recent audit rates, that "I.R.S. officials said the high ratio was part of an effort to demonstrate that tax laws are applied fairly." 
If these past audit patterns continue, whether or not millionaires can expect to meet I.R.S. auditors in 2013 and beyond depends a lot on whether President Obama defeats the Republican nominee.

HEADLINE: Romney "Not Concerned About the Very Poor"

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: On CNN, the Republican front-runner made a remarkably tone-deaf statement. 

 BODY:
American voters have long shown a willingness to elect very wealthy presidents, as long as they demonstrated a real concern about people on the economic rungs far below. Given what the last few weeks have revealed about Mitt Romney's wealth, and how he made it, you would think he would want to go out of his way to show that concern.
Instead, within hours of winning of the Florida primary, he did precisely the opposite, making a televised statement this morning that was breathtakingly callous even by the modern standards of Republican heartlessness.
He actually said, live on CNN, that "I'm not concerned about the very poor."

With his interviewer, Soledad O'Brien, looking stunned, Mr. Romney explained that the poor have their government safety net, which he would be willing to repair if broken. But he plans to leave it to the Democrats to care about their needs.
"We will hear from the Democrat party the plight of the poor," he said. "And there's no question it's not good being poor and we have a safety net to help those that are very poor. But my campaign is focused on middle Americans. You can choose where to focus, you can focus on the rich, that's not my focus. You can focus on the very poor, that's not my focus. My focus is on middle income Americans, retirees living on Social Security, people who can't find work."
As it happens, many of the people in the last two categories have become quite poor since the downturn began, relying on the same government safety net in which Mr. Romney seems to have little interest. Last September, the Census Bureau said there were 46.2 million people living in poverty. That's 15 percent of the American people.
Statistics aside, at a time when voters have expressed a strong concern about economic inequality, it was a remarkably tone-deaf statement for the Republican front-runner to make. He had previously made it quite clear that his proposed budget cuts would destroy or damage many programs for the poor, but that's still a long way from a man worth $250 million actually saying out loud that he is not interested in the struggles of those with nothing.
Millions of the "middle Americans" that Mr. Romney professes to care about have become very concerned about falling out of the middle, and with good cause: There are 51 million people with incomes less than 50 percent above the poverty line. If they do slip into poverty, they now know they will also slip right off the radar of the man who promises to be a uniter, not a divider.

HEADLINE: The Right and Romney

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why conservatives should count themselves lucky that Romney hasn't taken their advice. 

 BODY:
There's been a lot of groaning and sighing and eye-rolling among conservatives over the fact that Mitt Romney, flush with victory in Florida and poised to pivot to the general election, offered the following remarks to CNN:
I'm not concerned about the very poor. [] We have a safety net there. If it needs a repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich . I'm concerned about the very heart of America, the 90-95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling.
Here's Jonah Goldberg's exasperated response:
I get the point he's making. It's a point that Bill Clinton won the presidency with - but with language that voters. Romney's language won't do anything of the sort. And the concern is, after nearly a decade of running for president, if he can't get this stuff down now he never will.
... there are plenty of things one could say to defend Romney on the merits of what he says here. But great politicians on the morning after a big win, don't force their supporters to go around defending the candidate from the charge that he doesn't care about the poor. They just don't.
I entirely agree. It's been clear for a long time that nobody will ever confuse Romney with a great politician, and he seems constitutionally incapable of avoiding blunders ("I like to fire people," the $10,000 bet, etc.) that play into every single stereotype of the out-of-touch rich guy. For these and many other reasons, he's been a weak frontrunner throughout the primary season, and he'll carry all those weaknesses into the general election contest.
But however justifiable the latest (and by no means the last, I'm sure) wave of conservative angst over Romney's problems may be, it should also be noted that the likely Republican nominee would be in far worse shape for the fall campaign if he had listened to many of his critics on the right, and taken advice on how to brand himself instead. His "I'm not concerned about the very poor" comments were embedded in an attempt - however clumsy and faltering - to define himself as a champion of the hard-pressed middle class, and to distance himself both from the "just expand the welfare state" politics of the left the "just cut taxes on the wealthy, and the rest will take care of itself" politics that too often defines the contemporary right. He may not have hit that sweet spot, but at least he knows that the sweet spot exists. Whereas many conservatives seem convinced that the best way for Romney to counteract his image as an out-of-touch Richie Rich is to embrace policies that are only likely to confirm that stereotype.
Here's the Wall Street Journal's William McGurn, for instance, giving Romney advice on how to finish off his primary opponents:
The most constructive way for Mr. Romney to kill off his rivals while bringing the party together is simple: Steal their best ideas. Mr. Gingrich has done precisely that with Ron Paul by calling for a commission to study the gold standard. Mr. Romney could easily do the same, echoing Mr. Paul's call for an honest dollar or adopting Mr. Gingrich's flat tax.
Obviously McGurn and I have rather different views about what constitute the "best" of conservatism's current stable of ideas. But set aside the substance and just focus on the politics. He's suggesting that Mitt Romney - Mitt "Bain Capital" Romney, Mitt "multiple vacation homes" Romney, Mitt "one of the richest candidates ever" Romney - should kick off a recession-era campaign by branding himself as the candidate of gold (gold!) and massive upper-bracket tax cuts. In other words, he's urging the Republican frontrunner to not only write the White House's re-election script, but to footnote it and annotate it as well.
So yes, Romney's "I'm not concerned about the very poor" comments are a reminder of his many failings as a politician. But the Republican Party is far better off with the Romney campaign it has, warts and all, than it would be with the kind of campaign that many voices on the right have called for.

HEADLINE: Romney Spins His Remarks on the Poor, Poorly

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Message: I care. 

 BODY:
I guess it was starting to dawn on Mitt Romney that he really put his well-shod foot into his mouth when he announced on CNN this morning that he is "not concerned about the very poor." During a press gaggle later in the day, Mr. Romney clarified: "No no no no. No no." Six no's are more emphatic than one.
Then he added: "You've got to take the whole sentence, all right, as opposed to saying, and then change it just a little bit, because then it sounds very different. I've said throughout the campaign my focus, my concern, my energy is gonna be devoted to helping middle income people, all right? We have a safety net for the poor in, and if there are holes in it, I will work to repair that. And if there are people that are falling through the cracks I want to fix that."
Mr. Romney went on to say: "Wealthy people are doing fine. But my focus in the campaign is on middle-income people. Of course I'm concerned about all Americans -- poor, wealthy, middle class, but the focus of my effort will be on middle income families who I think have been most hurt by the Obama economy."

OK, got it. Everyone should focus on the whole sentence.
Greg Sargent pointed out on the Plum Line blog that it's ludicrous for Mr. Romney to whine about people taking him out of context, when much of his campaign against President Obama, and Newt Gingrich, has been based on taking remarks out of context and twisting them, or just making stuff up. (Mr. Obama has never "apologized for America," as Mr. Romney likes to claim.)
But let's take him at his word and look at the whole sentence. Actually the whole several sentences, which David Firestone quoted in full, and in context, earlier today. What he said was quite clear, which was that the poor have a safety net, and that the "Democrat party" will talk about their plight. He failed to mention his opposition to just about every Democratic proposal to alleviate poverty, his support for budget cuts that shred the safety net, and his own plans for making it even less robust.
What context reveals is not Mr. Romney's compassionate conservative core, but his ignorance about this country. Almost one in three Americans is poor, or on the verge of becoming poor, including many of the Social Security recipients and recent jobless he mentioned this morning. And, if he glanced at the paper occasionally, he would see that he was actually being rather generous to the Democrats, who are not running a campaign based on helping the very poor. They're focused on middle class issues, too.
My suspicion is that the whole "I'm so concerned about the middle class" is sort of like President George H.W. Bush's infamous "message: I care" remark in 1992. It's not a deeply felt and firmly held position, so it's hard for him to keep it straight in his head.

HEADLINE: Facebook's Filing: The Highlights

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: At long last, it's Facebook Filing Day. The technology reporters and editors at The New York Times downloaded their own personal copies of the company's long-awaited filing for an initial offering of stock and combed through it for interesting, uh, bits. Here are the results. 

 BODY:
 At long last, it's Facebook Filing Day. The technology reporters and editors at The New York Times grabbed their own personal copies of the company's long-awaited filing for an initial stock offering and combed through it for interesting, uh, bits. See the results below, and let us know what you find in the comments.
It Lands As DealBook reports, Facebook has filed to sell $5 billion in stock. The company will seek the ticker symbol FB for its shares, but it did not list an exchange.
 Traffic Jam The filing is here on the Securities and Exchange Commission's Web site but its servers seem to be straining under the load.
 Monthly Users Facebook says in its filing that just over half of its 845 million monthly active users log on every day. 
Big Data Facebook stores more than 100 petabytes (100 quadrillion bytes) of photos and videos, it says. It has built storage and serving technologies, like Haystack, to efficiently serve and store the data. -
 Games With the System In 2011, the social games maker Zynga accounted for about 12 percent of Facebook's revenue. No single company represented more than 10 percent of Facebook's revenue in 2010 and 2009. -
 Will Sandberg Leave? Rumor has it that Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer, is interested in politics, but in the filing, her loss is cited as a potential crucial risk factor for investors -- it "could harm our business." -
Growing Fast Facebook reported $3.71 billion in revenues in 2011, up fivefold from 2009. Net income was reported as $1 billion. The vast majority of revenues came from advertising, but its reliance on ads has declined in the last three years, thanks in part to the proceeds from virtual goods sales on Zynga. 
Rise of Mobile Facebook cites the growing use of mobile devices as a risk, because it doesn't get meaningful revenue from the use of its mobile products. Advertising there is a challenge. -
 Going Global Facebook's revenue still comes mostly from advertisers and other sources in the United States, but it is increasingly shifting outside the country. In 2011, nondomestic sources of revenue accounted for 55 percent of Facebook revenue, down from 67 percent in 2009. -
 Competition From Google Facebook gives more space in the filing to the relatively young Google Plus than to any other social network, saying, "We compete broadly with Google's social networking offerings, including Google+, which it has integrated with certain of its products, including search and Android." -
 Young Company The top executives are all under 44, with Theodore W. Ullyot, the general counsel, the old geezer at 44. -
 Thoughts From Zuckerberg In a letter accompanying the S-1 filing, Mark Zuckerberg says he created Facebook "because it was something I wanted to exist." He also says the company's goal is "to rewire the way people spread and consume information" with their friends and family, businesses and governments. Mr. Zuckerberg also says the company's primary reason for going public is to build a strong economic engine to further the company's ambitions. "Simply put: We don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services," he said. -
'Like' Addiction Facebook users generated 2.7 billion likes and comments a day in the last three months of 2011. -
 Paychecks Sheryl Sandberg makes just about half what Mark Zuckerberg makes. Mr. Zuckerberg's 2011 salary plus bonus, not including stock, was $703,833, compared to Ms. Sandberg's $381,966. But Mr. Zuckerberg will reduce his salary to $1 a year in 2013. 
 Securities Regulators Facebook says it has received "formal and informal requests for information" from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission about an inquiry into the sale of private company securities and Facebook's number of stockholders of record. The company said it had responded to all the S.E.C. requests for information and believed it was in compliance with federal securities laws. -
 Pay to Play Just as Facebook takes a slice out of what Zynga earns from its game players, it says that "we may seek to extend the use of payments to other types of apps in the future." -
 Overseas Explosion Facebook continues to grow abroad. As of the end of last year, Facebook had 37 million monthly active users in Brazil, a nearly 300 percent increase from the year earlier. In India, the company had 46 million active users, 132 percent more than in 2010. By comparison, Facebook had 161 million active users in the United States, a 16 percent increase from the previous year. -
 Venture Capital Only two investment firms own at least 5 percent of the company, Accel and DST. Other known investors that are missing from that list and thus are below 5 percent: Goldman Sachs, T. Rowe Price, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Greylock Partners, Elevation Partners, Tiger Global, Meritech Capital Partners, Li Ka Shing and Andreessen Horowitz (though Marc Andreessen personally owns shares as a board member). -
 Ad Revenues In 2009, 2010 and 2011, advertising accounted for 98 percent, 95 percent and 85 percent of Facebook's revenues. The prospectus notes: "The loss of advertisers, or reduction in spending by advertisers with Facebook, could seriously harm our business." -
We Need Ads That 85 percent figure makes Facebook more dependent on ad revenue than CBS, "the most ad-dependent old media firm," says Peter Lauria, editor of technology at Thomson Reuters. -
 Founder Power Dustin Moskovitz, a Facebook founder who now runs a business software start-up company called Asana, owns 7.6 percent of Facebook himself -- less than Accel's 11.4 percent but more than any other venture capital firm. -
 Zuckerberg's Slice Mark Zuckerberg owns 28.4 percent of the company's shares but a far higher share of the voting power, thanks to proxy arrangements with other shareholders. -
More Risks Facebook notes that a number of social networks (R.I.P., Friendster) have not been able to maintain user growth and momentum and that Facebook is not immune to similar declines and erosion. The company cites changes in user sentiment, adopting privacy policies that are perceived negatively by consumers, adverse media reports, an inability to present meaningful information to users, overwhelming users with ads and government regulation as potential risk factors affecting its business. -
Pitch to Advertisers According to Facebook, in December 2011, an advertiser could reach an estimated audience of more than 65 million United States users in a typical day on Facebook, compared with "American Idol" reaching an audience of 29 million people with its 2011 season finale. -
Sandberg's Ownership Mr. Zuckerberg is the biggest shareholder by far, but Sheryl Sandberg, the company's No. 2 executive, has made out nicely as well. According to the S-1 filing, Ms. Sandberg owns 1,899,986 Class B shares, which give her less than 1 percent ownership of the company, but she maintains another 39,321,041 in restricted stock options. Tweaked the treatment of the Class B shares here. Based on outstanding shares, at a valuation of $100 billion, her stake could be worth roughly $1.6 billion. -
 All in the Family The Facebook board gave two million shares of stock to a Zuckerberg family member "in satisfaction of funds provided for our initial working capital."
 Sister's Pay Randi Zuckerberg, Mr. Zuckerberg's sister, worked at Facebook for three years until August 2011. Including base salary and bonuses, she was paid $128,750 in 2009, $139,578 in 2010 and $89,536 in 2011. In comparison, Mr. Zuckerberg was paid $703,833 in 2011. -
Love for Hackers Every few months Facebook holds a hackathon, where employees build prototypes of new ideas they have. Products like Facebook's Timeline, chat tools and video conferencing were born from hackathons, the filing says. -
 The Hacker Culture Facebook echoes Google and Amazon.com by warning Wall Street that it favors rapid innovation "over short-term financial results." Mr. Zuckerberg describes Facebook's "hacker culture," which he says means the company favors fast and imperfect products and lives by the mottos "Done is better than perfect" and "Move fast and break things." -
 The Anti-Apple Follow-up to that. If Apple put corporate slogans on its walls, the company would be far more likely to choose the opposite: "Perfect is better than done." -
 What's $100 Billion Worth? Mashable, the tech blog, has assembled a list of 10 things less valuable than Facebook. It includes the gross domestic product of Qatar, the cost of the Olympics and the global coffee industry.
 Quora Weighs In A thread on Quora, the question-and-answer site created by former Facebook employees, is the filing. The most interesting find? That Facebook's current revenue-to-profit ratio is almost exactly one-tenth of Google's. -
 All Aboard Facebook added more than 1,000 employees in the last year, growing the company's staff to 3,200 from 2,127. The company said it expects head count to increase "for the foreseeable future." -
 A Target for Cyberattacks The S-1 lists malware, viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks as risk factors and warns investors: "Because of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks." -
 Zuckerberg's Father To elaborate on the family-related post above: Edward Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg's father, provided initial capital to start Facebook and was then offered an option to buy two million shares of Class B stock. Although the option to buy the shares expired, in 2009 the board issued two million shares to Glate L.L.C., which is owned by Edward Zuckerberg. -
 Privacy The word "privacy" appears 35 times in Facebook's S-1 filing. In comparison, "privacy" was used three times in Google's S-1 filing from 2004. -
Hostile Territory In Japan and South Korea, Facebook has a penetration rate of less than 15 percent. In China, where Facebook access is restricted, it has 0 percent penetration. 
Data Centers Facebook developed designs for its data centers, server hardware and software. It opened its first owned-and-built data center in Prineville, Ore., in April 2011. Facebook also owns a data center in North Carolina and leases facilities in California and Virginia. -
 Thanks, That's All At the end of the lengthy filing is a page of people -- apparently Facebook employees -- holding cards that say "Thanks" or "Thank you." It's a tribute to "the millions of you who made this possible." Of course, most of those millions of you will not be getting any shares. -
 Profit Machine On Twitter, MG Siegler, a tech pundit, notes that Facebook has more profit than Google had revenue when it went public in 2004. Back then, he says, Google had $961.8 million in revenue and $105.6 million in profit, compared to Facebook's $3.7 billion in revenue and $1 billion in profit. -
Valuable Friendships Facebook considers our friendships to be valuable to its business, because increased user engagement allows it to attract more users, programmers and advertisers: "Users add value to the overall Facebook ecosystem each time they engage with friends, developers, or advertisers." There were more than 100 billion friend connections on Facebook as of Dec. 31, 2011. Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land, wonders if this is the first business to count our friendships as assets. -
 Hey, Big Spenders In 2011, Netflix bought $3.8 million worth of advertisements on Facebook. The Washington Post Company purchased $4.2 million. -
The Billionaires Club Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership stake in Facebook is large, but Bill Gates owned an even bigger share of Microsoft, about 49.2 percent, just before it went public in 1986. Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, each owned about 15 percent of their company when it went public in 2004. But given Facebook's expected valuation of at least $75 billion, Mr. Zuckerberg will be far richer on the day of his initial public offering of stock than those tech titans were. -
 Air Facebook Only Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have been approved to use private aircraft for business purposes by the Facebook board. The company also pays for Mr. Zuckerberg's personal use of private aircraft in connection with his "comprehensive security program." The cost of that personal aircraft use in 2011: $692,679. -
 Shoring up the Scaffolding Facebook said that last year it shelled out $606 million for servers, network equipment, storage infrastructure and the construction of data centers. In 2012, the company plans to increase that investment to as much as $1.8 billion. Although the company plans to finance a portion of those expenses by leasing some capacity, it could cut into the bottom line and net income. -
 The S-1 ... on Twitter? In the grand tradition of inanimate objects that tweet, Facebook's filing already has a mock personality on Twitter. A recent gem: "Over here at the S.E.C., we call him One Buck Zuck." -
 Symbolic Facebook's stock symbol will be FB. FACE was taken, but I was holding out for LIKE or POKE. 
That's it for now. Thanks for reading.

HEADLINE: Facebook Files for an I.P.O.

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: Facebook, the vast online social network, took its first step toward becoming a publicly traded company on Wednesday, as it filed to sell $5 billion of shares. 

 BODY:
It sure pays to have friends.
Facebook, the vast online social network, took its first step toward becoming a publicly traded company on Wednesday as it filed to sell shares on the stock market. The service, hatched in a Harvard dormitory room nearly eight years ago, is on track to be the largest Internet initial public offering ever -- trumping Google's in 2004 or Netscape's nearly a decade before that.
In its filing, Facebook, which has more than 845 million users worldwide, said it was seeking to raise $5 billion, according to a figure used to calculate the registration fee. The company will seek to have the ticker "FB" for its shares, but did not list an exchange.
But many close to the company say that Facebook is aiming for a far greater offering that could value it as high as $75 billion to $100 billion. At that lofty valuation, Facebook would be much bigger than many longer-established American companies, including Abbott Laboratories, Caterpillar, Kraft Foods, Goldman Sachs and Ford Motor.
"Facebook's I.P.O. marks another stage of the Internet's evolution," said Charlene Li, founder of the Altimeter Group, a technology consulting firm. "It's so valuable, because it's not just about content, it's about our connections."
The filing sheds some light on how its meteoric run has turned the upstart into a formidable money maker. The company, which makes the bulk of its money from advertising and the sale of virtual goods, recorded revenue of $3.7 billion last year, an 88 percent increase from the prior year. During that period, Facebook posted a profit of $1 billion. It is still a fraction of the size of its rival Google, which recorded revenue of $37.9 billion last year, but many analysts believe Facebook's fortunes will rapidly multiply as advertisers direct more and more capital to the Web's social hive.
Facebook, unlike any other site, has come to define the social era of the Web. More than a portal, its value lies in its dynamic network of social connections and the enormous amount of information shared by its users. In many ways, Facebook is a data processor, archiving and analyzing every shred of information, including its users' interests, locations and every article and link that they "like." The collection of data is a potential goldmine for advertisers, keen to better understand and target consumers.
"Facebook changed the way entrepreneurs thought about platforms and sharing," said Shervin Pishevar, a Menlo Ventures partner who built games on Facebook as the former chief of the Social Gaming Network.
Indeed, the social network has become something like an economy into itself, fostering businesses like the music service Spotify. The game maker Zynga, which went public late last year, generates more than 90 percent of its sales from Facebook.
"Facebook has become the biggest distribution platform on the Web," said Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, a service that accepts only Facebook users. "We noticed that users who connected our service to Facebook were three times more likely to become a paying user."
But for all the promise of Facebook, the company is still trying to figure out how to properly extract and leverage data while keeping its ecosystem intact. For all its billions, Facebook makes a small sum on a per-user basis. Last year, it made a little more than $1 per user.
The Wall Street firms underwriting the I.P.O. are Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and Allen & Company. 
Facebook has come a long way from its scrappy start-up days.
Mr. Zuckerberg, a freckle-faced computer prodigy from Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., started the service, then known as Thefacebook, in his Harvard dorm room in February of 2004. He rolled out the site carefully, first opening it up to other Ivy League schools to keep the community intimate.
Some of Mr. Zuckerberg's classmates sent e-mails to old high school friends, cajoling them to join the site. By the end of 2004, the site reached one million users.
"That's the kind of stuff I do - small little projects, and eventually they all fit together," a young Mr. Zuckerberg told The Harvard Crimson.
Like Google, Facebook was not the first in its category. Start-ups like Six Degrees.com, Myspace, LinkedIn, Friendster and others predated the service. But Facebook quickly eclipsed the competition by drilling down on the mechanics of sharing.
In 2006, Facebook made it easier for users to keep tabs on their connections by introducing news feeds. These data streams made sharing automatic, broadcasting short bursts of information, updates and announcements, from friends in real time. One year later, Mr. Zuckerberg rolled out the Facebook Platform. The move effectively collapsed the walls that separated the service from the rest of the Web by allowing third parties to develop applications on the site. The policy of openness and Facebook's pursuit of so-called "frictionless sharing" has made it nearly impossible to escape its long shadow online. Over the last four years, its user base has grown to 845 million from roughly 50 million. On average, users spend more than 9.7 billion minutes a day on the site, according to the filing.
Mr. Zuckerberg has been made wealthy by Facebook, and an I.P.O. would make him wealthier. When Facebook was valued at $23 billion, Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $6.9 billion. At a market value of $100 billion, Mr. Zuckerberg's 28.4 percent stake in Facebook would be worth $28.4 billion.
Yet his ambitions seem more akin to Alexander Graham Bell than to other Internet billionaires. Mr. Zuckerberg says he wants to "make the world a more open place," according to his Facebook profile.
In recent months, his team has rolled out more features toward that end, like Timeline, which makes it easy to scroll through a user's entire history, and new partnerships, with companies like Ticketmaster, that will allow users to pull even more data from outside publishers into Facebook's platform. The company is also said to be designing its own mobile phone, which will give Facebook an even larger footprint in its users' digital lives.
Mr. Zuckerberg's push for openness has not always been embraced by the online community, which, at times, has been leery of his efforts to reset the boundaries of what people should share. Facebook, as the protector and transmitter of personal information, has to maintain a delicate balance between financial interests and the privacy concerns of its users. Major changes to Facebook's platform have frequently inspired fierce backlashes, including calls to boycott, lawsuits and the ire of lawmakers. 
As Facebook's influence grows, so too does scrutiny from Washington. In November, Facebook reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, after the regulators accused the social network of misleading customers on privacy issues.
With sharing at the center of Facebook, and the new Web, analysts also wonder whether the constant chatter will create too much white noise. As psychological barriers to sharing fall and companies become more deft at leveraging social media, there's a legitimate concern that platforms, like Facebook, will be less valuable without the proper filters.
And user growth has slowed in some mature markets. In the United States and Canada, the company added three million users -- for a total of 179 million -- in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the previous quarter, Facebook had added seven million users. 
"What are the limits of sharing?" Ms. Li, of the Altimeter Group, said. "At what point does the presence of all these partners on Facebook, all this sharing, begin to degrade the quality of the site overall?"
A previous version of this post misspelled the surname of the founder of the Altimeter Group, a technology consulting firm. It is Charlene Li, not Yi.

HEADLINE: Romney's 'Poor' Remark Resonates

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's remarks that touch on income and class draw some unwanted attention. 

 BODY:
Obsessive attention to detail suffuses Mitt Romney's candidacy for president, from the number of times aides check the microphones at his rallies to the relentless manner in which they scour Twitter.
But his aides aren't always able to bring that famed level of discipline to a crucial area of the Romney campaign - their candidate's seemingly endless ability to utter remarks that, to his critics' delight, sail onto political blogs, YouTube and Twitter.
On Wednesday morning in an interview with CNN, Mr. Romney said, "I'm not concerned about the very poor," a comment that has ricocheted around the Web and cable news channels, and that Mr. Romney took pains to clarify in a brief conversation with reporters as he flew to Minnesota.
The comment seems to have captivated the political psyche because it reinforces the Democrats' biggest line of attack against Mr. Romney, as well as the Republicans' worst fear: that Mr. Romney's net worth, estimated at $200 million, leaves him out of touch and unable to relate to average Americans who are struggling.
Taken in the full context of his remarks, as Mr. Romney urged reporters to do, his statement appears more benign: "I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs a repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich - they're doing just fine."
But for a campaign that has been accused of taking Mr. Obama's remarks out of context, the sentence about the poor immediately became cataloged in a growing list of comments by Mr. Romney that suggested a distance from the concerns of struggling Americans.
As his tax returns became a growing issue, Mr. Romney said his speaking fees of more than $370,000 amounted to "not very much" money.
When talking about taxation in August, he said, "Corporations are people" -- a line that will not go away, despite its context: "Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people. Where do you think it goes?"
And he said, "I like being able to fire people" for bad service, just as his leadership at the venture capital firm, Bain Capital, was being questioned.
So, the latest remarks about the poor play into the narrative that his critics like to draw -- that he is an out-of-touch capitalist. Even conservatives are furious with Mr. Romney.
PunditandPundette.com wrote: "My real point is that a conservative candidate would talk about increasing opportunity for the very poor, about lessening the need for food stamps and housing vouchers by reducing government and invigorating the economy, rather than touting the awesomeness of our massive, dependency-inducing welfare state and suggesting it might need some beefing up.
"But Romney's no conservative. So this is to be expected. "
At The Weekly Standard, John McCormack wrote on the magazine's Web site:
"Romney's remark isn't merely tone-deaf, it's also un-conservative. The standard conservative argument is that a conservative economic agenda will help everyone. For the poor, that means getting as many as possible back on their feet and working rather than languishing as wards of the welfare state."
Asked later on his plane to elaborate on the remark, Mr. Romney said, "I've said throughout the campaign my focus, my concern, my energy is going to be devoted to helping middle-income people, all right?"
"We have a safety net for the poor in the country, and if there are holes in it, I will work to repair that," he added. "And if there are people that are falling through the cracks, I want to fix that."

HEADLINE: Three Ex-Credit Suisse Traders Charged

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
9:48 p.m. Updated
The government charged three former Credit Suisse traders on Wednesday with inflating the value of mortgage bonds as the housing market collapsed, a rare criminal prosecution of Wall Street executives for their conduct during the financial crisis.
Federal prosecutors contend they deployed the scheme to increase their year-end bonuses.
The charges, involving traders in New York and London, come just a week after President Obama pledged in his State of the Union address to escalate investigations of banks and other financial firms and ''help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.''
Two of the Credit Suisse traders, David Higgs and Salmaan Siddiqui, pleaded guilty to mismarking their positions to avoid losses at the end of 2007, just as the housing market was deteriorating. Both are cooperating with the investigation. 
The third man charged, Kareem Serageldin, their boss, headed a group that traded mortgage-backed securities.
In a conference call on Wednesday, the United States attorney for Manhattan, Preet S. Bharara, urged Mr. Serageldin, 42, an American citizen who lives in London, to come to the United States and face the charges against him.
''My client has done nothing wrong and is fully cooperating with the investigation,'' said James McGuire, a lawyer for Mr. Serageldin. ''In terms of how and when he plans to defend the case I need to confer with him.''
In court appearances Wednesday, Mr. Higgs, 42, and Mr. Siddiqui, 36, both said that they participated in the fraud at the direction of Mr. Serageldin.
''The stunning scale of the illegal mismarking in this case was surpassed only by the greed of the senior bankers behind the scheme,'' said Robert Khuzami, the head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought a parallel civil action against the former Credit Suisse traders. The assets that the Credit Suisse traders overvalued were mortgage-backed securities, the bonds that caused hundreds of billions of dollars in losses across the global financial system.
As the housing market inflated, banks pooled mortgages, many of them to shaky borrowers, and packaged them into complex collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. The banks then sold parts of the C.D.O.'s to investors, who believed the C.D.O. structure protected them from losses on the mortgages backing the securities. Ratings agencies shared that view, often awarding C.D.O. securities a triple-A credit rating.
From 2003 to 2007, Wall Street issued nearly $700 billion in C.D.O.'s that contained mortgages, according to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.
As the housing market crumbled in 2007, however, demand for mortgage-backed assets evaporated, and banks - particularly Merrill Lynch and Citigroup - were saddled with money-losing holdings they could not sell. These would later be the source of the crippling losses that forced each to take government bailouts.
Unlike stocks, mortgage-backed securities lacked a liquid market with transparent pricing. And as the subprime-mortgage crisis escalated, it became harder for banks to attach a market value to their holdings. As their portfolios dropped in value, many banks were reluctant to mark down their holdings. These banks were later forced to take billions of dollars of losses when the housing market collapsed.
Mortgage securities were at the center of the S.E.C.'s 2010 lawsuit against Goldman Sachs that accused the bank of securities fraud, a case that Goldman paid $550 million to settle. Also in 2010, Citigroup paid $75 million to settle S.E.C. charges that in 2007 the bank had failed to disclose some billions of dollars of subprime-mortgage exposure contained in the bank's C.D.O.'s. Neither bank admitted wrongdoing.
The government's case against the former Credit Suisse traders depicts a brazen scheme to artificially increase the price of bonds on their books to create fictitious profits just as the housing market was seizing up.
In one instance, the team, facing an inquiry from Credit Suisse's internal controls group in August 2007, tried to justify their mortgage bond portfolio's inflated value by seeking ''independent'' marks from other banks' trading desks, according to the government.
After learning that the marks at Deutsche Bank and Barclays Capital were substantially lower than their own marks, they looked elsewhere.
Mr. Siddiqui, the junior trader, subsequently secured sham ''independent'' marks from a friend who worked at a small investment bank.
''In less than a minute, Mr. Siddiqui's friend generated prices on a number of AAA bonds that were nearly identical to those recorded by Mr. Siddiqui and his conspirators,'' the government said.
The false profits allowed Mr. Serageldin, the head of the group, to secure a cash bonus of more than $1.7 million and a stock award of more than $5.2 million. Credit Suisse rescinded the stock award after it discovered the fraud; the government will try to get the cash bonus back as well.
The government's investigation of Credit Suisse originated in early 2008 when the bank disclosed that it was taking a $2.65 billion write-down after discovering that a team of traders had mismarked the value of mortgage securities on their books. Credit Suisse suspended the team.
The bank, which will not be charged in the case, has been cooperating with authorities.
Mr. Bharara, whose office brought the case, has become a leading figure in the government's effort to combat financial fraud. The federal prosecutor appears on the cover of the new issue of Time magazine that arrives on newsstands on Friday. Plastered over Mr. Bharara's portrait is the headline: ''This Man is Busting Wall St.''
His office has received the most attention for its crackdown on insider trading at hedge funds, including the conviction of the billionaire Raj Rajaratnam.
The Credit Suisse prosecution is the latest in a series of fraud cases that Mr. Bharara has brought against large financial firms and their executives. In October, it brought a civil lawsuit against the Bank of New York Mellon, accusing it of cheating state and other pension funds nationwide out of foreign exchange fees over the last decade.
Earlier last year, Mr. Bharara's office filed a civil complaint against Deutsche Bank, claiming that one of its units had lied about the quality of government-backed mortgage loans it underwrote.
Both Bank of New York Mellon and Deutsche Bank have denied the government's claims.
Mr. Bharara has bristled at criticism - some of it from his relatives, he has said - that the government is not prosecuting enough people related to misconduct during the financial crisis. Mr. Bharara has said that complex financial fraud cases, like the four-year-old Credit Suisse investigation, take time to build and are often difficult to prove.
''The number of prosecutions is not a function of resources, effort, commitment or courage,'' Mr. Bharara said last year, speaking to a group of reporters.
''It is a function of the laws, the facts, and the painstaking nature of these investigations.''

HEADLINE: Note to Christo: Don't Start Hanging the Fabric Yet

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
CANON CITY, Colo. -- The shouting isn't over for ''Over the River.''
The $50 million project by the artist Christo, who hopes to drape nearly six miles of the Arkansas River here in southern Colorado with suspended bank-to-bank fabric, received approval from federal land managers late last year.
But on Wednesday, a new battlefield emerged in law and local politics: in Denver, opponents filed a federal lawsuit aiming to block construction, which Christo had hoped to begin this summer. The suit argues that land managers violated federal law in approving the plan and gauging its environmental impacts. 
And two days of hearings before the Fremont County Commission began here in Canon City -- near the eastern end of the proposed 42-mile stretch of the river-as-art -- to consider local event permits.
Christo's supporters -- a strange bedfellow's mix of art lovers, politicians and tourism interests -- rallied near the county administration building before the session began, handing out sky-blue T-shirts.
Anti-Christo forces, led by a group that has dubbed the project, and the name of their organization, ''Rags Over the Arkansas River,'' or ROAR, said that moneyed interests and state politicians were pushing a project that would mostly benefit outsiders.
''We should be looking into this greed,'' said Yvonne I. Nelson, a resident of the canyon who described herself as ''82 and feisty.''
Local business leaders and politicians, meanwhile, pointedly reminded the three members of the commission, in case they had forgotten, that the economy is still bad in this part of Colorado. ''Over the River,'' they said, which is financed entirely by Christo through the sale of his art, is a gift that would put places like Canon City on the map, maybe even as a destination on the international art scene, in ways that could have huge long-term benefits.
Loving or hating Christo's design, several suggested, is beside the point.
''Some people may see it as ragweed, some people may see it as a beautiful rose, but I think the benefit for the community is there,'' said Colby Katchmar, a member of the Canon City Council
The project, which is projected to draw upward of 400,000 visitors -- during the two-year construction period and the two-week final exhibition, tentatively scheduled for August 2014 -- has divided people over multiple fracture lines.
Some speakers at the hearing said they resented the pressure to say yes, which they said is bearing down on their small rural communities from local chambers of commerce and politicians, led by Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a vocal enthusiast.
Others said the project, in seeking to create art in the midst of an already stunning natural setting in a rugged river valley, would diminish nature by presuming to improve upon it -- a prospect that would offend true lovers of Colorado's wild beauty and keep them away.
''Coloradans are not New Yorkers -- they come to the mountains for scenery, wildlife, recreation and peace and quiet,'' Ellen Bauder, the vice president for science at ROAR, said in remarks to the commission. ''Bumper-to-bumper traffic, stoplights in the middle of nowhere and long lines are not their idea of recreation, and no amount of public relations is going to make it so,'' she added.
The lawsuit, filed on ROAR's behalf by a group of students at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law, argues that land managers did not adequately address the long-term effects of the project on wildlife, especially the bighorn sheep that clamber about on the canyon's cliffs.
And in classifying an art project as a ''recreation activity,'' the suit says, the federal analysts framed their assessment in ways that excused the impact of the thousands of bore-holes, rock-bolts and anchors that will have a cumulative effect, the suit says, not unlike industrial mining.
''In truth, the art project is akin to a massive resource extraction project, and under federal law should be treated as one,'' the complaint reads.
A spokesman for the Over the River organization, Steve Coffin, said he was confident that the federal environmental impact statement, which took years to complete, would not be undone by the suit. ''The E.I.S. was thorough and complete,'' he said.
Art for art's sake was somewhere in the mix, too. Liz Greene, 23, an artist from Denver, drove down on Tuesday to be here to support ''Over the River,'' and also for a hug.
Ms. Greene, who does multimedia art, while working a retailing job to make ends meet, said that as kind of a hobby, she collected hugs from famous artists, and had come here partly to bag a Christo.
She did. As he was chatting with supporters at the rally before the hearing, Ms. Greene took a deep breath, waited for an opening, and stepped up. ''You're great, can I hug you?'' she asked him.
''Best hug ever,'' she whispered after stepping away from the clutch.

HEADLINE: Asia Society Expands, East and West

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Even as cultural organizations around the country contract because of the economic downturn, Asia Society is pushing against the tide with two new multimillion-dollar buildings, one of which opens in Hong Kong next week, the other in Houston this spring.
The buildings are part of a philosophical as well as physical expansion for the society, a nonprofit institution founded in 1956 by John D. Rockefeller III to educate the public about Asia and perhaps best known for the elegance of its headquarters and galleries on Park Avenue at 70th Street. 
Long regarded as a New York institution with regional branches, Asia Society over the last few years has aimed to recast itself as an international organization, partly through the construction of the two major centers in cities where it previously had only offices.
The new buildings -- each of which cost about $50 million -- will catapult the annual operating costs of each location to $4.5 million from about $1 million, but Asia Society says it is confident about the investment.
''By the year 2050, more than 50 percent of the world's gross domestic product will come from India and China,'' Vishakha N. Desai, president of the society, said in a recent interview at her office. More than 60 percent of the population will live in Asia then, she said.
''We're going from Pax Americana to possibly Pax Pacifica,'' she added. ''This is a century when America will be a very important player, but not the player. There is a different balance of power in the world.''
Because the world has changed, so has Asia Society's mission. Where once the organization was focused on explaining Asia to Americans, now it emphasizes strengthening partnerships in areas like culture, business, public policy and education, not only between Asians and Americans but among Asians themselves.
''We have to think about how we relate to Asians as partners,'' Ms. Desai said. ''The fastest-growing trade is intra-Asia trade, yet there isn't an Asian community. People don't know each other well because for the last 250 years, everybody looked to the West.''
In May the organization announced its first appointments of chairmen on both sides of the Pacific: Henrietta Holsman Fore, a former chief of the United States Agency for International Development, who is based in Washington, and Ronnie C. Chan, a real estate developer in Hong Kong and China.
''This is that time when we should be increasing our footprint,'' Ms. Fore said. ''We are covering 51 countries in Asia. They are not one country. They are very different, interesting, growing countries. As a result there is a need for more scholarship, more visits, more business transactions, more tourists, more exchanges of artists, more connections between leaders.''
The Hong Kong project is in a 19th-century former factory that was used by the British military to produce and store explosives and munitions. The architects are Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, who designed the American Folk Art Museum's former home on West 53rd Street in Manhattan and the new Barnes Foundation being built in Philadelphia.
The Houston center, in the city's museum district, was designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, who was responsible for the renovation of the Museum of Modern Art. The Korean artist Lee Ufan has been commissioned to produce a site-specific work to inaugurate the sculpture garden there.
''It makes sense that the Asia Society wants to find new ways -- physically and virtually -- of reaching audiences and donors,'' said Adrian Ellis, a longtime arts consultant who recently served as executive director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. ''Hong Kong and Houston are growth markets. If it were Detroit and Islamabad, that would be more surprising.''
Each center has art galleries, lecture halls, meeting spaces and offices. Both are opening with exhibitions that pay tribute to Asia Society's founding with selections of traditional Asian art from its permanent collection. (The society started a contemporary collection in 2007.)
Ms. Desai said she realized that it would not be easy to support these new branches, given the state of philanthropic giving. Asia Society, which has a $38 million annual operating budget, had a 25 percent drop in its endowment in 2009 and was forced to cut its staff by about 11 percent. The Hong Kong project is planning for deficits in its first few years.
In 2010 Asia Society also had to cope with the abrupt death of its high-profile chairman and cheerleader, Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But Ms. Desai said she was optimistic about the prospects for financial support. International corporations are interested in Asia Society's work, she said. And she added that she hoped to increase the size of the board beyond 50 members, which will broaden the slate of committed inside donors.
Ms. Desai said she wanted to increase the proportion of Asian trustees on the board to 50 percent from 35 percent. Mr. Chan, one of the society's chairmen, said he hoped to draw some trustees from places like Indonesia.
''To have both sides understand each other -- Asia on the one hand and the United States on the other,'' he said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong, ''there is really the need for expertise from different countries.''
Some may question the need for an Asia Society in an increasingly globalized world. But the society's executives say the institution has become more essential because it can serve as the link among various constituencies.
''The world is far more interconnected today,'' Mr. Chan said. ''Hence the need to understand each other is greater than ever before.''
Asia Society's new programs include the Asia 21 Young Leaders Initiative, which brings together more than 150 Asians under 40 from the Asia-Pacific region. And the Women Leaders of New Asia program promotes a group of women from the public and private sectors.
When the society was first established, ''people thought knowing about Asia was nice -- 'I'll get to it when I can,' '' Ms. Desai said. ''Now it's a necessity.''

HEADLINE: Off the Grid In the City

BYLINE: By KARRIE JACOBS

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
MINNIE J. CHAPA, a 75-year-old great-grandmother and proud renter of a nearly new, minimalist-style, three-bedroom home here, said old neighbors from Haskell Street, a stretch of cottages just east of downtown where she spent nearly 50 years, regularly ask her, ''Do you live over there in the matchbox houses?''
To describe SOL Austin, the five-and-a-half-acre development in which Ms. Chapa resides, as ''the matchbox houses'' is both accurate and unfair.
Yes, the houses are small by American standards (they range from 1,030 to 1,816 square feet), and the architectural style is decidedly rectilinear. But the boxiness is mediated by the skyward tilt of butterfly roofs, angled to hold photovoltaic arrays and channel rainwater into barrels. 
SOL, an acronym for Solutions Oriented Living, is an ambitious attempt to upend the conventions of the American subdivision. It was developed by a partnership between Chris Krager, a 43-year-old architect who heads a firm called KRDB, and Russell M. Becker, 47, a civil engineer and general manager and owner of Beck-Reit & Sons Ltd., a construction company.
The community is intended not just to be sustainable in its design and materials, but ''net zero'' -- in other words, a housing development that would produce all the energy it consumed, with super-efficient homes outfitted with solar panels and geothermal wells. Moreover, this small development is also doing its part to take on the problems of economic and social injustice.
That it has been, so far, only partly successful in achieving these goals makes it no less interesting as a design experiment.
SOL is in East Austin, about three miles from downtown, an area designated African-American by a 1928 city plan. In 1962, the construction of I-35, a major north-south artery, further isolated the area's population.
Over the last decade, however, those priced out of more-desirable neighborhoods to the south began to migrate east. The 2010 census showed a 40 percent increase in the area's white population, while the number of minority residents dropped. During the same period, skyrocketing property taxes forced many longtime homeowners out.
Mr. Krager, who has a degree in business from Michigan State University and ran a Chicago mortgage brokerage before he became an architect, has made a practice of buying small pieces of property for which he designs and builds thoughtfully laid out modern homes, priced to appeal to young creative types who normally couldn't afford an architect. Mainly, he's done this in East Austin -- which essentially makes him part of the problem.
''Ten years ago, we paid $15,000 for the first lots we built on in East Austin,'' Mr. Krager said. ''On that same street now, lots are $150,000.''
He began looking at land not just east of I-35, but farther out, east of a secondary highway, 183. When he found a live oak tree farm under the flight path of the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, he and Mr. Becker bought it in 2007, for $700,000, and began work on a 40-house development.
''I figured that while we were at it, we might as well take all of our interests as a design firm and put them into one prototype project,'' Mr. Krager said. He wanted to ''examine sustainability on a more holistic level, that would not just look at green buildings, but in our interest in affordability, in the economic and social components of sustainability as well.''
As it happens, holistic sustainability proved harder to achieve than Mr. Krager and Mr. Becker anticipated. The pair spent six months doing their homework, pricing thermally efficient windows, foam insulation, Energy Star appliances and frugal heat pumps for heating and cooling.
Indeed, every house in SOL achieves the same high level of energy conservation: they were all designed to meet the federal Department of Energy's guidelines for net-zero capable construction, which is to say, they use 55 percent less energy than a typical house (circa 2006). And all of them are constructed from a menu of materials (including low-V.O.C. paints that don't contribute to air pollution and cabinets that don't emit formaldehyde) widely regarded as green.
But the recession, the partners said, made the net-zero agenda impossible to carry out. Just as they were breaking ground -- at the exact moment the economy derailed in autumn of 2008 -- financing dried up. Drilling 40 geothermal wells, one for each house, was out of the question.
''I would have liked to have mandated the photovoltaic arrays,'' Mr. Krager said. But he found that buyers were often unable or unwilling to roll the cost (an extra $24,000 for an array substantial enough to fully power a house) into their mortgages. And Mr. Krager, who was embarking on an $8 million to $9 million project for a market that no longer existed, wasn't in a position to argue.
For the development's market-rate houses -- 11 of which have been sold, and 13 of which have yet to be built -- solar power became an option. Homeowners installed arrays over time, as rebates from Austin Energy and tax credits from the federal government became available. So far, only four market-rate houses sport arrays and only one is also heated and cooled by a geothermal well.
SOL may never get to net zero (Mr. Krager no longer markets it that way), but much of his idealistic vision is intact. For one thing, close to half the homes are reserved for low-income renters and buyers.
Before the housing bubble burst, Mr. Krager hammered out a plan with Mark Rogers, executive director of the nonprofit Guadalupe Neighborhood Development Corporation, to sell 16 of the 40 homes to the organization. The group, in turn, sold eight of the houses at a subsidized rate to low-income buyers (who typically were able to buy a house valued at more than $200,000 for half price) and rented the other eight to tenants like Ms. Chapa, who pays $600 a month.
Mr. Krager made this arrangement, he insisted, because economic sustainability was part of his vision, but it is also true that the fact that he had already sold more than a third of the units is what convinced his bank that, despite the housing crash, the project was viable. And with those 16 subsidized homes, Mr. Krager could dictate solar power: each of those houses has a photovoltaic collector on the roof, although Guadalupe's budget didn't cover arrays large enough to produce as much power as the houses consume.
IN appearance, at least, SOL resembles a typical suburban development. There is even a cul de sac, as required by fire code.
But the rhythm of the place is different in many ways. The lots are smaller, and each house is positioned to maximize its use of what Mr. Krager calls ''quality outdoor space'': U-shaped and H-shaped homes embrace grassy courtyards where residents put their Webers, picnic tables and hammocks.
''I feel like it's part of the house,'' said Sandra Barry, 29, a television news producer who shares her 1,090-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath house with her husband, James McNown, a 26-year-old silk-screen printer.
And unlike the more traditional development across Perry Road, which presents an unbroken line of two-car garages and putty-colored facades, SOL is variegated and colorful, and has a lightness that makes it look pleasantly toylike. (It also includes a 1930s cottage, original to the property, that was moved across the site, renovated by University of Texas students and seamlessly wed to a modern addition.)
The houses do look a little like matchboxes, but inside they are spacious and light-filled. Typically, there's an open kitchen, a hallway with a handy built-in desk, generous closets and cleverly disguised storage areas.
But the most obvious thing that distinguishes them is the shape and placement of their windows. Elongated clerestory windows maximize daylight while keeping heat gain (this is Texas, remember) to a minimum.
The owners of the market-rate houses, which all sold at prices in the low $200,000's, also set this place apart. They tend to be in their mid-20s to early 30s, and part of the creative culture for which the city is known.
Ms. Barry and Mr. McNown, who moved to SOL in April of 2010, just happened upon the development. ''We fell in love with it as soon as we saw the design,'' Mr. McNown said.
But while the green aspects of the development were a draw, the couple didn't install solar panels until last year. ''The city had an excellent rebate this summer,'' Ms. Barry said. Through this year's record-setting run of 100-degree days they were racking up minuscule $13 monthly electric bills.
To date, there is only one household in which achieving net zero is a top priority. The first market-rate house sold, it belongs to Pete Brubaker, 34, a systems engineer, and his wife, Erin Swaney, 32, a microbiologist. So far, they are the only homeowners who have paid to install the geothermal well and the sophisticated system that monitors and analyzes their energy use (it costs about $10,000). And as Mr. Brubaker pointed out, as long as features like those and the solar panels are optional, the development will never be truly net zero.
Still, its green aspirations are only one aspect of the appeal. While Mr. Krager hasn't quite succeeded in building a subdivision that doubles as a power plant, he has created a new type of suburb.
Most of the young homesteaders say they love the way the neighborhood is filling up with others like them, but they also praise the presence of the subsidized renters and homeowners, a generally older and more racially diverse group. In short, they are buying into the 1950s suburban ideal without leaving the city behind.
Mr. Krager has cited the innovative postwar California developer Joseph Eichler as an inspiration, as well as the pedestrian-scaled neighborhoods built by the New Urbanists since the 1980s. But his polished modern architecture combined with an attention to social issues is uniquely of the moment and seems to have hit the sweet spot with the youngest generation of homebuyers.
He and Mr. Becker have explored development opportunities in Albuquerque and Fort Worth, but Austin seems like the natural place for his approach to take off. For one thing, the city has lofty environmental goals, including a requirement that all new homes be ''zero energy capable'' by 2015, or about 65 percent more energy efficient than homes built since 2006. Also, the city council recently approved plans for increased downtown density that involve levying fees on developers of downtown residential towers that exceed the height permitted by zoning. The fees are intended to fund affordable housing on the outskirts of downtown.
And as Lucia Athens, the city's chief sustainability officer, noted, because Texas is a ''car-dominated society'' and not everybody wants to live downtown, a green version of ''the suburban prototype,'' one that ''isn't intimidating and feels kind of familiar,'' might prove invaluable.
In any case, Mr. Krager and Mr. Becker are one home sale away from paying off the $1.2 million bank loan that paid for the development's infrastructure, like sewage and water systems, meaning they have weathered the housing bust and are beginning to see a profit. Their lenders are increasingly willing to let them build spec houses, homes that don't have a buyer before construction. And Mr. Krager believes that built houses will sell faster than those shown to buyers in computer renderings, so SOL will likely be complete by late next year.
Austin's first true net-zero subdivision may have to wait until domestic energy generation is required by law, but for now, the developers of SOL have done well (or, at least, survived) by doing pretty good.

1. Most houses at SOL have carports rather than garages. The windows are strategically placed to maximize interior daylight while keeping heat out. 2. Louvered sliding doors are used in tandem with west-facing glass doors, to promote cross-ventilation and minimize heat gain. This particular door is made from custom cedar slats. 3. The slatted door opens onto a living room with a polished concrete floor and a well-insulated concrete block wall. The sofa is a Carter by Gus, the kitchen stools are Onda from Design Within Reach and the artwork is a photo detail of a 1954 Seymour Fogel mural. 4. The butterfly-style roofs were designed to channel rainwater, a valuable resource in drought-prone Texas. Some residents collect the water in barrels and use it for gardening. 5. The most unusual house at SOL is a 1930s cottage with a modern addition. The old interior (in the foreground) blends seamlessly with the new one (seen through the doorway). 6. The kitchen, in the 1930s portion of the house, has its original shiplap pine walls, stripped of plaster and paint
 the floor is the original oak. The cabinets are Ikea, the table is from Blu Dot and the chairs are Eames. 7. The house owned by Pete Brubaker and Erin Swaney has a substantial 5.2-kilowatt photovoltaic array on the roof, as well as geothermal heat and cooling, a rain barrel and the development's only two-car garage.

HEADLINE: Hiring Contractors Without Getting Into Trouble

BYLINE: By KATHERINE REYNOLDS LEWIS

 BODY:
Jeff Ready, chief executive of Scale Computing, would like nothing more than to double his sales staff to meet projected demand for the information technology infrastructure that his Indianapolis-based company develops and manufactures. But in an uncertain economy, Mr. Ready is reluctant to commit to significant hiring.
Instead, he uses independent contractors to supplement Scale Computing's presence at trade shows, as well as to help with legal, public relations, finance, accounting, editing and other functions.
''It's been difficult to predict the future in terms of the strength of the economy,'' Mr. Ready said. ''You have to be very prudent in how you hire. What I'm doing is trying to keep a smaller in-house contingent and supplement it with contractors based on the ebbs and flows of how much business we have.''
For both legal and practical reasons, Scale Computing does not use contractors in areas like sales that require significant oversight and training, and Mr. Ready also worries about the ever-present risk of a contractor being unavailable or quitting. And there is a larger concern: the government has been cracking down on companies that treat workers as contractors for wage, tax and benefit purposes but as employees when it comes to their work duties. 
An audit conducted by either the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor can overwhelm a small business -- even if the issues raised turn out to be unfounded.
Business owners interviewed for this small-business guide say that independent contractors can be helpful when companies try to increase operations while retaining the flexibility to cut back if necessary. But if not used effectively, they can increase costs without producing the desired results.
KNOW THE LAW The first consideration is the legal risk. ''It has become a much bigger issue in the last three to five years because the federal government is taking a much harder enforcement approach,'' said Kevin B. McCoy, partner with Kruchko & Fries, a labor and employment law firm based in McLean, Va. Under federal tax and labor law, contractors must have greater independence than employees, which effectively limits their use. Employers must also comply with state labor requirements.
There is widespread misunderstanding about when an individual meets the legal requirements to be treated as a contractor, rather than as an employee, Mr. McCoy said. Employers most often slip up, he said, when they try to fill a part-time or short-term need with an independent contractor, thinking that because the position is less than full time or of limited duration, it can be filled by a nonemployee.
In fact, the law speaks to the independence of the individual and the employer's control over the work -- not to the number of hours worked. Simply put, if you tell someone when, where and how to work, you do not have a contractor relationship.
An employer that violates the I.R.S. rules on independent contractors can be forced to pay back employment taxes as well as penalties. Labor laws for independent contractors generally relate to the minimum wage and overtime rules, and violations can lead to the payment of back wages and triple damages.
Kelly Strowd found this out when a contractor for the pet-sitting franchises she operates in North Carolina filed for unemployment after her contract was terminated. In the end, the individual did not pursue the claim, and the state employment security commission found the business in compliance. But the audit required Ms. Strowd and her accountant to spend a tremendous amount of time pulling together hundreds of pages of documentation and explaining them to the auditor.
''It was really nerve-racking,'' she said. ''I could have owed years of back taxes. I probably would have gone bankrupt.''
Since then, she has changed her orientation process for new contractors, who walk and care for the pets. She emphasizes that they are independent contractors, with control over their own client relationships and how they perform the work. Instead of giving them a branded T-shirt that might appear to be a uniform, she provides such clothing for purchase as an option. She also encourages them to develop their pet-sitting businesses with other clients.
Bottom line: Do not use an independent contractor just because you cannot afford an employee. Use contractors when the task to be performed can truly be done independently.
HIRE CAREFULLY Because contractors are fundamentally different from employees, you should anticipate the associated management and communications challenges. You do not want to save 50 percent of the cost of a function, like software programming, just to end up adding 80 percent in management costs.
ORI, a research firm based in Herndon, Va., solves that problem by detailing the scope of every project carefully, screening contractors intensely and setting clear expectations. Contractors are a quick and cost-effective way to bring in high-level talent with specialized expertise for the data-intensive projects the company completes for government and association clients. ''In research, our needs change based on the types of studies our customers need,'' said Kathleen Benson, president.
As soon as ORI submits a proposal to a client, managers begin to think about the type of contractor needed, the specific job components and who in the firm's database might be a good fit. Ms. Benson has learned the hard way to match the individual's capabilities to the project carefully.
''One of the benefits of an independent contractor is that you can really zero in on very specific needs and skill sets,'' said Ms. Benson, who uses temporary staffing firms like Flexforce Professionals in addition to ORI's network. During the screening process, ORI checks references and conducts background checks. To ensure legal compliance, contractors must show proof of insurance and a record of self-employment tax payments. They must also maintain a dedicated work space, since many work from home. Ms. Benson looks for signs that the contractors may be exaggerating their experience or are overextended with other projects.
ORI sets up a communication plan, establishes shared expectations from the beginning and trains managers on the role of a contractor. Typically, contractors will submit status reports on a weekly basis that include any challenges they are encountering or anything they need from ORI. ''It's important to document everything early and up front, what the expectations are, when you expect to get the stop-go decisions,'' Ms. Benson said.
RETAIN THE KNOWLEDGE It also helps to select the work that goes to contractors strategically. Before committing to a large-stakes venture, Edward Hechter, owner of PartyPail in Enumclaw, Wash., always runs a small test project with each new contractor to make sure the person is reliable.
''It is generally not about quality of work,'' Mr. Hechter said. ''It's about the ethos side: are they going to do what they said they were going to do? It's when they go silent or they miss the deadline and tell you after the fact, 'I need another two weeks,' that you have a problem. If they're managing expectations with us, then we love it.''
Mr. Ready of Scale Computing often assigns work that requires creativity or special expertise to his staff and supplements with contractors for more mundane tasks, like having employees develop marketing materials and hiring contractors to copy-edit and produce the actual documents.
His goal, he said, is to make sure he doesn't lose the knowledge base completely, especially since a contractor is always ''one phone call away from taking another full-time job again, and that could be in the middle of a project.''

HEADLINE: In a Surprise, Car Sales Start New Year Strongly

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- New-vehicle sales in the United States were unexpectedly strong in January, an early sign that the auto industry could have its best year since 2007, carmakers and analysts said Wednesday.
Sales increased 11.4 percent from January 2011, according to the research firm Autodata. The industry's annual selling rate, an important measure of its health, climbed to 14.18 million, the highest in more than two years.
The Chrysler Group beat forecasts with a 44 percent increase in monthly sales, and Honda posted its first year-over-year gain since it began struggling with inventory shortages after last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Honda's sales were up 8.8 percent. 
Toyota, Ford Motor and Nissan each reported modest increases, while Hyundai and Kia set January records. Volkswagen reported a 39.5 percent gain, its best January since 1974.
In contrast, General Motors said sales were down 6.1 percent from January 2011, when sales were inflated by big discounts offered after the company's public stock sale. Sales of G.M.'s plug-in hybrid, the Chevrolet Volt, also fell from December after a government investigation into the potential for its battery to catch fire after a crash received widespread publicity.
Small cars were among the biggest factors driving the increase. Car sales rose 19.9 percent, while truck sales increased 3.7 percent.
''This is healthy, this is good. It's sustainable,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president of industry trends and insight at the automotive research Web site TrueCar.com. ''It's going to be another year of recovery where we have a very good chance of getting to that magic 14 million number.''
Annual sales have been below 14 million for each of the last four years, falling to as low as 10.4 million in 2009. Hitting 14 million this year would represent at least a 9 percent increase from the 12.8 million sold in 2011.
January was the first month in which the seasonally adjusted, annualized selling rate surpassed 14 million since August 2009, when the government's cash-for-clunkers program briefly bolstered demand. Excluding that spike, January's rate was the highest since May 2008.
''We're bullish on where the industry's going,'' said Robert S. Carter, Toyota's top sales executive in the United States. ''For the month of January to come in at this level is reason for continued optimism.''
Honda and Toyota reported big rebounds for some of their models in January, after having difficulty meeting demand for much of 2011. Sales of the Toyota Camry, a midsize sedan that was redesigned several months ago, rose 56 percent. The industry's top-selling compact car was the revamped Honda Civic, which posted a 50 percent increase.
Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst with the Web site Edmunds.com, said sales would be increased for a few more months by shoppers who had put off trying to buy a new car or truck last year, when scarce supplies caused prices of some popular models to rise.
''This is a solid start to 2012, especially when there were so many fewer 'buy' messages in January compared to December's heavy holiday sales push,'' Ms. Caldwell said.
Rising auto sales in general are a positive contributor to the economy, but the gains for pickup trucks in particular may indicate long-awaited improvement in the housing market. Sales of full-size pickups rose 47 percent at Chrysler and 8 percent at Ford.
''There might be some truth to the view that housing is starting to turn,'' Peter Nesvold, an analyst with Jefferies & Company, wrote in a note to clients this week. ''We estimate that roughly 30 percent to 40 percent of pickup truck sales are into the contractor or construction markets. This makes pickup sales a good below-the-radar indicator for construction and/or housing trends.''
G.M. sold just 603 Volts in January, down from 1,529 in December. Don Johnson, G.M.'s vice president of United States sales operations, said demand was ''clearly impacted'' by news that federal safety regulators were investigating the car after three Volt battery packs caught fire after crash simulations.
G.M. has said it will modify the battery pack but is not recalling the car. The regulators closed their investigation on Jan. 20, concluding that the car was not defective, but ''exaggerated negative coverage'' of the investigation hurt sales, Mr. Johnson said in a conference call Wednesday. A House subcommittee conducted a hearing on the issue last week during which several Republican members of Congress criticized the car.
''Now that the dust has settled, we're going to get back on track,'' Mr. Johnson said.
He said G.M. hoped to attract more buyers with a low-emissions package that would allow the Volt to travel in high-occupancy vehicle lanes in California, an attribute that helped the popularity of models like the Toyota Prius in that state.

HEADLINE: Three States to Require Insurers to Disclose Climate-Change Response Plans

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
Insurance commissioners in California, New York and Washington State will require that companies disclose how they intend to respond to the risks their businesses and customers face from increasingly severe storms and wildfires, rising sea levels and other consequences of climate change, California's commissioner said Wednesday.
Up until this point, those states required about a third of larger insurers to turn over the information in a survey; for all others it was voluntary. 
''Our experience and other states' experience as regulators is you get a far better response rate if you require response to be provided than if you just allow companies to decide when and how they will respond,'' said Dave Jones, the California commissioner. ''Our goal is to have the most complete, best and accurate information possible for investors, the insurance industry, regulators and the broader public.''
California, which has the ninth-largest economy in the world, has led the way on this push to make a traditionally backward-looking industry anticipate and respond to the business liability presented by a changing climate. These new state regulations will focus attention on the insurance industry's role in mediating the country's response to climate change.
''We are asking insurers to share their views of the risk of climate change so that we can be sure that the industry and regulators are appropriately prepared,'' said Robert H. Easton, a lead insurance regulator in New York.
Last year's level of natural disasters was unprecedented, according to an August report by the A. M. Best Company, which rates the financial strength of insurers. By late June, the estimated $27 billion in losses suffered by the American industry exceeded the 2010 total.
Many insurance companies, particularly large international reinsurance firms, have been grappling with the issue of assessing risks that are not reflected in the historical record of insurance payouts.
''Global warming presents unique risks, and it is vital that our insurance industry adequately account for the impacts of climate change,'' Benjamin M. Lawsky, superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services, whose portfolio includes insurers, said in a statement. ''We look forward to working with the industry to address these important and growing risks.''
The disclosure survey will be mandatory for companies writing policies worth more than $300 million nationwide. It was created by Ceres, a Boston-based nonprofit group that leads a coalition of investors and environmental groups in gathering information about business responses to climate change, and prods them to do more.
Andrew Logan, the director of Ceres's insurance program, said Wednesday that the insurance industry ''is distinguished by poor disclosure on this issue.'' He added, ''To me it is a continuing surprise that an industry that is so obviously affected by this talks so little about it.''
Robert Hartwig, president and economist at the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, sharply disputed this point. ''No industry discloses more about the impact of climate on its earnings and its ability to operate,'' he said. ''Look at any quarterly earnings report and you'll see it's full of the impact of weather on earnings.''
He added, ''If insurers have shown anything over the course of the centuries in which they have oared it is that they are capable of managing changes in the weather on both the micro and the macro scale.''
Roughly 25 percent of the industry's large property, casualty and life insurance companies participated in an earlier version of the survey sent out by California and five other states last year. A rule change, combined with California's partnership with New York and Washington, will mean that 300 of the larger insurers will have to comply. Companies that do not complete the survey could face fines, although it is highly unusual for companies to ignore such directives.
The climate risk survey made its first appearance in California in 2008 -- a period which Mr. Hartwig described as ''the post-'Inconvenient Truth' period,'' a reference to the climate-change documentary featuring the former Vice President Al Gore.
The survey's contents, Mr. Logan said, ''are pretty basic. What the regulators are trying to get a sense of is whether companies have thought about the cost implications for their businesses.''
He added: ''The big takeaway from the survey last year is that there is a high level of concern among insurers about the impacts of climate change that is not matched by concrete plans to deal with those impacts. There is a real gap between the risk that's been identified and plans to address it.'' Eleven of the 88 companies surveyed last year, he said, reported having formal policies to manage climate change.
Another group that might benefit from such disclosures, said California's insurance commissioner, Mr. Jones, are investors in the insurance industry.
Jack Ehnes, the chief executive of the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which has $148 billion in investments, some in insurance, echoed this statement.
''If we feel insurance or energy companies are not incorporating climate risk into their analyses and their boards of directors are not recognizing it,'' he said, ''that failure to do so endangers the value of that investment.'' The result, he said, would not be disinvestment but ''engagement with those companies,'' because ''they are not caretaking their business very well.''
Mr. Hartwig, however, said that an insurer's portfolio ''should not be subject to criticism based on the holding of securities of companies that some people may in fact object to.''

HEADLINE: Manufacturing and Construction Showing Growth

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Manufacturing activity in the United States grew in January at the fastest pace in seven months, helped by a rise in new orders. And builders ended a poor year for construction by spending more on homes and projects for the fifth straight month. 
Reports on the sectors, released Wednesday, bolstered other data showing that the economy started the year strong.
The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said its manufacturing index rose last month to 54.1 from 53.1 in December. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.
Consumers are buying more cars and trucks, while businesses ordered more machinery and other equipment. That has driven manufacturing, which expanded for the 30th consecutive month.
Both new orders and order backlogs rose to nine-month highs. Increasing order backlogs suggest manufacturers are lacking the capacity to meet demand. That could mean more growth in production and employment in the near future, economists said.
Export orders also rose, a sign that manufacturers have not yet been affected by Europe's slowing economy.
''This is a very encouraging report on manufacturing activity that shows particular strength in leading indicators,'' said John Ryding, the chief economist at RDQ Economics.
The report followed other healthy readings on manufacturing in China, Germany and Britain.
Separately, the Commerce Department said spending on construction projects rose 1.5 percent in December, the fifth consecutive monthly gain. That pushed spending to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $816.4 billion, the highest level in 20 months.
The gains coincided with other signs that showed the troubled housing industry might be improving. Builders are more confident after seeing more interest in homes, and single-family home construction rose in the final three months of last year.
Still, the construction industry remained weak. Spending on all building projects in 2011 was just $787.4 billion, which was 2 percent lower than the previous year and roughly half the level economists consider healthy.
The best indication of the economy's health will come Friday, when the government is to report on January hiring and unemployment.
Economists expect that the economy added 155,000 net jobs, the seventh month in a row of solid hiring. The unemployment rate is expected to stay for the second month at 8.5 percent, near a three-year low.
A separate report from the private payroll agency ADP showed that private sector employment rose by 170,000 in January from the previous month. That was 10,000 fewer jobs than expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet.
ADP also said December job growth was smaller than it had previously reported -- 292,000 instead of 325,000.
Factories were still adding jobs but at a slower pace than in December, according to the I.S.M. report.

HEADLINE: House Hunting in ... Aruba

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
A HOME IN THE 19th-CENTURY FARMHOUSE STYLE IN ARUBA
$1.2 MILLION
This three-bedroom home, its concrete facade painted bright red, was custom-built in 1995 to evoke a traditional Aruban farmhouse called a cunucu, which blends European and Indian influences. Popular in the 19th century, these dwellings had slanted tile roofs, sometimes with dormers like this one, allowing tropical heat to rise. This property also has a two-car garage and two studio apartments with kitchens, which were built in 2004 next to the main house in the same style, expanding the property to a total of five bedrooms, five baths and 8,177 square feet.
The house is set on a landscaped quarter-acre lot surrounded by a fence. The backyard has a swimming pool along with a large boxed-in sandy area that functions as a small beach, as well as an extensive outdoor kitchen, a bar and a dining area. Previous owners were restaurateurs who equipped the kitchens, both inside and out, with professional-grade stainless steel appliances, said Jan Welage, the listing agent, who is with Coldwell Banker Aruba Realty. The outdoor kitchen has a Japanese teppanyaki table, which allows grilling directly on the table, as well as an oven and grill from the American manufacturer DCS. 
The house is fully air-conditioned, and the furnishings are included in the asking price. The front door opens onto a living and dining area with vaulted white wooden ceilings, ceramic tiled floors and large arched windows. The main floor also has a study and kitchen. Upstairs, the master bedroom opens out onto a ceramic-tiled terrace overlooking the pool. From the terrace are views of a seasonal waterway called the Salina, and the ocean beyond. The room has a steeply slanted, beamed ceiling, and French doors that open to a small room, currently used as a fitness area. The adjoining bath has a Jacuzzi.
The property is on a cul-de-sac in an exclusive residential subdivision in the Bakval area of Noord, the northern part of Aruba, which is home to many resorts and tourist restaurants. The closest beach is Palm Beach, by the Aruba Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino. However, many other beaches and Aruba's only 18-hole golf course are also in close proximity. The most convenient shopping is in the town of Palm Beach. Schools are near the Aeropuerto Internacional Reina Beatrix just outside of Aruba's capital, Oranjestad, which is about 15 minutes away.
MARKET OVERVIEW
The global economic crisis has not spared Aruba, which in 2009 saw the end of a decadelong rise in home prices. The decline was anywhere from 15 to 25 percent, said Muna Habash, a broker and the owner of MPG Aruba Real Estate. Some homes can now be bought for less than it cost to build them, she said.
Yet even though the economic malaise in the United States has rippled to the island, which is largely a second-home market for North Americans, the problems have not been severe enough to cause large numbers of foreclosures and short sales, said Dick Souge, the owner of Coldwell Banker Aruba Realty.
In fact, the drop in prices now seems to have spurred the market. Last year the number of sales rose 60 percent over the previous two, though there are still many houses on the market, he said.
Currently, the price of a two-bedroom, 2,400-square-foot property with a pool is about $325,000, one of the best bargains in the Caribbean islands, Mr. Souge said. Still, Aruba does have its high-end homes. About 15 houses are listed in the $3 million to $6 million range, said Hans Veenhuysen, an agent with Aruba Sotheby's International Realty.
Bakval is just south of Malmok, the site of the island's priciest real estate; homes in Bakval range from $800,000 to $1.3 million, Mr. Souge said. This home, typically priced for the area, has been on the market since June 2011. Homes at this price have been selling slowly, despite the improvement in the market, the agent said.
WHO BUYS IN ARUBA
North Americans are the largest group of buyers in Aruba, though growing numbers of investors are South American, primarily from Venezuela and Brazil, Mr. Veenhuysen said. Three years ago, Mr. Souge said, second-home buyers looked to invest exclusively in the Noord section of Aruba, but more recently they have sought attractive deals in the island's midsection, as well as in the colony of homes built for executives of the former Lago oil refinery on the southern tip. Foreign buyers find Aruba appealing because it places no restrictions on taking money out of the country, he said.
BUYING BASICS
Many of the privately owned homes in Aruba are on leased land owned by the government, agents said. The leases last 60 years, and the homeowners pay an annual leasing fee, which cannot increase over those 60 years. The lease for this home expires in 2052. Most leases are renewed at their expiration, agents said.
''In the whole history of Aruba,'' Mr.Veenhuysen said, ''I am aware of only one time a lease wasn't renewed, and it was because they had to make a road.''
Notaries handle all sales. Closing fees range from 4 to 8 percent of the purchase price, Ms. Habash said. They include a transfer tax of 3 to 6 percent and notary fees of 1 to 2 percent, depending on whether there is a mortgage.
Brokers' fees are typically 5 to 6 percent and paid by the seller, Ms. Habash said.
Mortgages are obtainable, but most buyers pay in cash, she said. Local banks typically have higher interest rates -- currently 7 to 8.5 percent -- than banks in the buyers' home countries, Mr. Souge said.

HEADLINE: Militants Plead Guilty in Plan to Bomb London Stock Exchange

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS and ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- Four Islamic militants, all British citizens, admitted involvement on Wednesday in a conspiracy inspired by Al Qaeda to place a bomb in the toilets of the London Stock Exchange, with the hope that the multistory building would catch fire. Five other men involved in a wider terrorist conspiracy pleaded guilty to lesser charges.
Prosecutors said the stock exchange plot was foiled by the arrests of the nine men, all with family origins in Bangladesh or Pakistan, in December 2010 at their homes in London, Cardiff and the Midlands town of Stoke-on-Trent. They said the men's plans were discovered after undercover counterterrorism officers tailed them as they surveyed London tourist attractions and tracked their conversations through secret electronic monitoring devices planted in their homes, cars and computers. 
Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and the United States Embassy were among the targets scouted or considered by the men, the court was told. Others included the home of the London mayor, two rabbis and the London Eye, a 440-foot Ferris wheel towering above the River Thames.
The case was part of Britain's long-running battle against terrorist plots involving militants born or living in Britain since the bombings on July 7, 2005, that killed 52 people, plus four bombers, on three London subway trains and a bus.
The outcome was taken by British counterterrorism experts as a triumph for the elaborate electronic surveillance techniques deployed by the country's web of intelligence and security agencies. But the case also served as a warning of potential threats as London prepares a security force of nearly 25,000 men and women, including troops, to protect the 2012 summer Olympic Games, which begin in July.
The nine had been set to plead innocent to terrorism charges but changed their pleas to guilty at the last minute when the judge warned them of heavy sentences, including up to 13 and a half years for the man suspected of being the ringleader, if the case went to a prolonged trial. By pleading guilty, legal experts said, the men made themselves eligible for a ''discount'' of as much as 10 percent in their prison terms when sentenced next week.
For years, Britain's top counterterrorism officials have been warning of what they called a network of Islamic terrorist cells across the country, and saying that the security agencies, despite major increases in financing and staff, lack the resources to track them all. Bob Quick, a former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard, said in a BBC radio interview that the plot ''serves to remind us that there are still people out in the country contemplating and capable of carrying out terrorist attacks on innocent people.''
But other experts said that the arrests and convictions of the men showed the vast improvements in British methods of hunting down would-be terrorists.
Alexander Carlile, a member of the House of Lords and formerly the government's independent reviewer of counterterrorism legislation, said the tracking of the militants in the stock exchange plot had been ''an excellent example of the surveillance and interception capabilities of British intelligence, as good as and probably better than any other country in the world.''
But he added, ''We must not cease for one moment to be vigilant about the dangers of terrorism, particularly in this Olympic year.''
Much of Britain's covert electronic listening, code-breaking and surveillance is conducted by an institution called Government Communications Headquarters, known as GCHQ, run in close collaboration with the National Security Agency in the United States. GCHQ is one of three British intelligence agencies, along with the domestic MI5 security agency and the overseas MI6 secret intelligence service. GCHQ's operations are conducted mainly from its headquarters at the entrance to the spa town of Cheltenham, where most of the agency's 5,500 staff members work, according to its Web site.
The militants involved in the case that went to court on Wednesday met through their affiliations with Islamic groups, prosecutors said, and communicated via Internet and cellphone. They also met in public places, like parks, where they believed official surveillance would be more difficult, unaware that undercover agents were scrutinizing their movements.
Mohammed Chowdhury, 21, and Shah Rahman, 28, both of Bangladeshi descent and from London, together with two militants from Wales, Gurukanth Desai, 30, and Abdul Miah, 25, admitted planning to plant a bomb at the London Stock Exchange ''with the obvious attendant risk but without any intention to cause death or even injury but with the intention to terrorize, damage property and to cause economic damage,'' said Christopher Blaxland, a lawyer acting for Mr. Chowdhury.
The nine were arrested before they had set a date for attacks or built bombs, the prosecution said. Though not members of Al Qaeda, they were inspired by the anti-Western tirades of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American jihadist killed by an American drone strike in Yemen in September, said Andrew Edis, a prosecution lawyer.
Counterterrorism officials found the men in possession of a Qaeda magazine containing an article titled: ''Make A Bomb In The Kitchen Of Your Mom,'' the prosecution said.

HEADLINE: Quinn's Friendship With Lobbyist May Pose Test in Mayor Bid

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR and DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
They met as eager activists who leafleted for candidates and demonstrated against antigay violence outside the Stonewall Inn. Young, female and gay, Christine C. Quinn and Emily Giske became such close friends that Ms. Giske moved into Ms. Quinn's building in Chelsea and introduced Ms. Quinn to the woman who is now her fiancee.
Over the two decades of their friendship, each woman has become powerful -- Ms. Quinn is the speaker of the City Council, while Ms. Giske is one of the best-connected and most popular lobbyists at City Hall and in Albany. And now, as Ms. Quinn seeks to solidify her status as a leading contender in the 2013 campaign for New York mayor, their close but complex relationship poses a challenge to both women, in a contemporary twist on a perennial political story line that will test Ms. Quinn's leadership abilities if she is elected mayor.
Lobbying City Hall is a significant business for Ms. Giske's firm, Bolton-St. Johns. In recent years, the company has reported earnings of $2 million to $3 million annually while lobbying the city government, billing its clients nearly $15 million in the six years since Ms. Quinn was elected speaker. 
Ms. Quinn has presided over multiple Council deliberations of concern to clients of Ms. Giske's firm, over issues like whether businesses should be required to provide paid sick leave, the disbursal of city budget money to nonprofit groups, and land-use matters along the Brooklyn waterfront and elsewhere.
At the same time, Ms. Giske has advised Ms. Quinn at key moments in her career, including her contested bid to become speaker and her controversial decision to back a one-time lifting of the city's term limits.
Ms. Quinn's bond with Ms. Giske is emblematic of her ease working the levers of city politics. While she has been hailed as a groundbreaking politician -- she is one of the most prominent lesbian officeholders in the nation -- Ms. Quinn has also become, in some ways, an establishment insider who is as comfortable with corporate titans on Wall Street as with housing activists in Chelsea.
Norman Adler, a founder of Bolton-St. Johns who sold the firm to Ms. Giske and four other lobbyists, said that even though Ms. Quinn was fiercely independent and made her own decisions, Ms. Giske's friendship had been beneficial.
''Emily can go and can lay things out for her, and she has access to do that in a way that a lot of other people don't,'' he said. ''So if it's a matter of who can talk to Chris and her senior staff, Emily's going to be there before a lot of other people.''
The friendship has not been without its challenges -- the two women had a falling out in 2008 -- and the Council has at times acted contrary to the interests of Ms. Giske's clients. But just a few months ago, Ms. Giske was introducing Ms. Quinn to a potential supporter for her mayoral campaign. Ms. Giske did not respond to an e-mail and phone call, while Ms. Quinn declined repeated requests to be interviewed, and instead issued a written statement.
''Emily and I became friends 20 years ago, long before she was a lobbyist and I was elected to the City Council, and have remained the closest of friends ever since,'' she said. ''Emily and Bolton-St. Johns abide by exactly the same rules as every other firm in the city. In fact, under my leadership we have made New York's lobbying laws some of the strictest in the nation by increasing transparency and demanding accountability from lobbyists and elected officials alike.''
But Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, a government watchdog group, said the closeness of the Quinn-Giske relationship merited scrutiny.
''The public is very suspicious of lobbyists in general,'' she said, ''and when someone who is a close associate is making their living and improving their financial status because of their ongoing personal relationship with an elected official, that makes you a lobbyist on steroids.''
She added, ''I think this is a discussion we need to be having.''
Ms. Giske, who is 51, began lobbying in 1993, and moved to Bolton-St. Johns in 1999, the same year that Ms. Quinn, who is 45, was first elected to the Council.
''Obviously, it's been an asset over time,'' Mr. Adler said of the friendship between Ms. Giske and Ms. Quinn, adding, ''I'm sure people were impressed with the fact that Emily had the relationship with Chris.''
The Council has done well by many of Bolton-St. Johns' clients in recent years. Ms. Quinn and other council members have directed hundreds of thousands of dollars to nonprofit organizations that Bolton-St. Johns represents, including most recently Care for the Homeless; the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center; and the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation. Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center, also represented by Ms. Giske, has received capital financing from the Council in the last two budgets.
And Ms. Quinn, expressing concern for small business owners, shelved a measure introduced in 2010 that would have required all employers in the city to provide paid sick days to their workers. A Bolton-St. Johns lobbyist spoke to council members -- not including Ms. Quinn -- on behalf of one of the measure's leading opponents, a business coalition that included Bolton-St. Johns' client Yum Brands, the parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
In some cases, Ms. Quinn and Bolton-St. Johns have found themselves on opposite sides of an issue. In 2009, the Council voted to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, over opposition from the Cigar Association, a Bolton-St. Johns client. And more recently, Ms. Quinn has criticized as too large a homeless shelter opened by the Bowery Residents' Committee, another client.
The two women met in 1992, when Ms. Quinn volunteered to work on a Senate primary campaign for which Ms. Giske was the political director. At the time Ms. Quinn was working as the chief of staff to Tom Duane, the first openly gay member of the Council; Ms. Giske was a Democratic campaign adviser, and the two women bonded quickly.
''They clearly have a close personal relationship,'' said Assemblyman Daniel J. O'Donnell, a Manhattan Democrat who was active alongside the women in a political club called the Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats.
Three days after the Sept. 11 attack, Ms. Giske brought Ms. Quinn to dinner at Food Bar, a Chelsea restaurant, with Ms. Giske's girlfriend and one of her colleagues, Kim M. Catullo. Ms. Quinn and Ms. Catullo have been together since; they are engaged to be married this year.
In 2006, Ms. Giske moved into London Terrace, the apartment building where Ms. Quinn and Ms. Catullo lived until last year. On occasion, Ms. Giske has ridden to events with Ms. Quinn in the speaker's city-provided car, a courtesy permitted under a ruling by the city's ethics board.
In 2005, when Ms. Quinn was seeking the position of speaker, Ms. Giske used her deep ties in Manhattan politics to help Ms. Quinn court district leaders and county chairs, whose support was crucial to her victory the following year.
''She was the mechanic'' of the speakership campaign, recalled Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, Jr., the Manhattan Democratic leader at the time.
The friendship cooled in 2008, amid a controversy over Ms. Quinn's disclosure that the Council had been appropriating millions in taxpayer dollars to fictitious organizations. Ms. Quinn criticized two of her staff members for continuing the practice of holding money in reserve accounts after she had ordered it stopped. After they left her employ, one of them, Michael Keogh, took a job at Bolton-St. Johns.
Ms. Quinn was surprised by Mr. Keogh's move and unhappy about it. Ms. Giske was upset over news accounts suggesting that the lobbying firm had given Mr. Keogh a soft landing, according to Mr. Adler.
Over time, the rift was largely repaired. Ms. Quinn was supportive as Ms. Giske was treated for cancer, according to friends, and their professional alliance appears to be strong.
In 2009, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg asked the Council to suspend the term limits law so that he could run for a third term, and Ms. Quinn decided to support him, Ms. Giske played a role behind the scenes, gauging support among council members.
Now, as Ms. Quinn gears up for her own mayoral campaign, Ms. Giske is helping again. In late October, she arranged a meeting between Ms. Quinn and Carol Bellamy, the first female president of the Council, who in 1985 unsuccessfully challenged Mayor Edward I. Koch. Ms. Giske worked for Ms. Bellamy on two subsequent, and unsuccessful, campaigns for state comptroller.
''I got an e-mail from her saying could we put this together,'' recalled Ms. Bellamy, who met with Ms. Quinn and Ms. Giske in a Chelsea diner on a rainy morning, and said she expected to support Ms. Quinn in her mayoral bid. ''It was the first time I'd really met her and spent some time with her.''

PERSON: Don Cornelius 

HEADLINE: A Smooth Operator In the Name of Soul

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
With his deep voice, his sharp suits, his aviator glasses and the stage presence of a grown-up music fan, Don Cornelius was every bit the smooth TV personality on ''Soul Train,'' the nationally syndicated Saturday-morning show he created, produced, wrote and hosted from 1971 to 1993. Behind his blend of suavity and enthusiasm, and what he called ''the hippest trip in America,'' was a cultural mission.
Mr. Cornelius, who died on Wednesday at 75, had been a journalist and a disc jockey in Chicago, and in 1970 he took the next step for many a D.J. on local television: hosting an after-school dance party, with guests from a fertile Chicago soul scene. But he quickly went national, with a low-budget format straight out of ''American Bandstand'': stars performing in a small TV studio while dancers showed off their moves. He'd do brief interviews with the musicians and, between guests, records would play while pairs of dancers strutted their latest moves down the railroad tracks painted onstage. 
Of course there was a crucial difference between ''Soul Train'' and ''American Bandstand'': most of the performers were African-Americans and the music was soul, R&B and eventually hip-hop. (Rockers crossing over into R&B, like David Bowie and Elton John in the 1970s, were also welcome.) A quick ''Scramble board'' segment between songs had dancers reveal the names of historic African-American figures. In the interviews Mr. Cornelius might ask James Brown to say a few words about violence in ''our communities'' and introduce a 19-year-old Al Sharpton.
But for the most part Mr. Cornelius didn't preach about civil rights or the marvels of African-American art. He was manifesting them. With a smile he'd sign off each show wishing his audiences ''love, peace and soul.''
''Soul Train'' kept black musicians visible as pop radio was resegregating itself. The FM radio band was hardening its market-tested genre boundaries, becoming an assortment of narrow niche offerings and separating (white) rock from (black) R&B. At the same time the integrationist hopes of 1960s soul -- the ''sound of young America'' championed by Motown -- had run aground in the riots of the late '60s and the hard-hit urban economics of the 1970s.
That didn't lower the quality of the songs; the '70s were a different kind of golden age for soul. Less concerned with trying to reach some distant mainstream, African-American musicians came up with fiercely complex funk, idealistic messages and ultra-slinky bedroom songs. Mr. Cornelius's stroke of genius was to bring a ''targeted'' format to television, where, even if ''Soul Train'' was slotted on Saturday morning rather than prime time, it could be seen nationwide. (''Soul Train'' may also have reminded the networks that there was an African-American audience watching; black sitcoms proliferated in the 1970s.) The reach of ''Soul Train'' let Mr. Cornelius book great musicians with few other opportunities to appear on national TV. He chose well.
Now the ''Soul Train'' archives, particularly from its first decade, are a nostalgia trove of flamboyant and awful 1970s fashion -- those lapels! those bell-bottoms! those eyeglasses! those fabrics! -- and of surprisingly durable dance moves. The swivels and angular twitches of ''Soul Train'' dancers would evolve through break-dancing and beyond, still to show up onstage now behind Beyonce and Rihanna.
But it's more than nostalgia; now those archives are a record of performances that would hardly be documented otherwise. ''Soul Train'' shows musicians, live or lip-synced, seizing their big TV moment before an ideal audience, one that could show the rest of America just how to shake it to the groove. If African-American music was going to be marginalized on television -- as it was even during MTV's early years -- then Mr. Cornelius was going to host an irresistible party. It was separate, but funkier.

HEADLINE: U.S. to End Combat Role in Afghanistan as Early as Next Year, Panetta Says

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- In a major milestone toward ending a decade of war in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said Wednesday that American forces would step back from a combat role there as early as mid-2013, more than a year before all American troops are scheduled to come home.
Mr. Panetta cast the decision as an orderly step in a withdrawal process long planned by the United States and its allies, but his comments were the first time that the United States had put a date on stepping back from its central role in the war. The defense secretary's words reflected the Obama administration's eagerness to bring to a close the second of two grinding ground wars it inherited from the Bush administration. 
Promising the end of the American combat mission in Afghanistan next year would also give Mr. Obama a certain applause line in his re-election stump speech this year.
Mr. Panetta said no decisions had been made about the number of American troops to be withdrawn in 2013, and he made clear that substantial fighting lies ahead. ''It doesn't mean that we're not going to be combat-ready; we will be, because we always have to be in order to defend ourselves,'' he told reporters on his plane on his way to a NATO meeting in Brussels, where Afghanistan is to be a central focus.
The United States has about 90,000 troops in Afghanistan, but 22,000 of them are due home by this fall. There has been no schedule set for the pace of the withdrawal of the 68,000 American troops who will remain, only that all are to be out by the end of 2014.
Mr. Panetta offered no details of what stepping back from combat would mean, saying only that the troops would move into an ''advise and assist'' role to Afghanistan's security forces. Such definitions are typically murky, particularly in a country like Afghanistan, where American forces are spread widely among small bases across the desert, farmland and mountains, and where the native security forces have a mixed record of success at best.
The defense secretary offered the withdrawal of the United States from Iraq as a model. American troops there eventually pulled back to large bases and left the bulk of the fighting to the Iraqis.
At the same time, Mr. Panetta said the NATO discussions would also focus on a potential downsizing of Afghan security forces from 350,000 troops, largely because of the expense of maintaining such a large army. The United States and other NATO countries support those forces at a cost of around $6 billion a year, but financial crises in Europe are causing countries to balk at the bill.
''The funding is going to largely determine the kind of force we can sustain in the future,'' Mr. Panetta said.
He and his team played down last week's announcement by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France that his country would break with its NATO allies and accelerate the withdrawal of its forces in Afghanistan by pulling back its troops a year early, by the end of 2013. Pentagon officials said Mr. Sarkozy and the United States might be more in tune than it appeared, although they acknowledged confusion about the French president's statement and said their goal was to sort it out at the NATO meeting.
''A lot of policy officials in Paris were scrambling'' after Mr. Sarkozy's announcement, a senior American defense official said. ''So getting exactly to what the French bottom line is hasn't been easy for them, much less for us.'' The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing the internal deliberations of another country.
Mr. Sarkozy made the announcement after an attack by a rogue Afghan soldier who killed four unarmed French soldiers on a training mission. There have been similar episodes of Afghan troops' killing of American forces, most recently involving the death of a Marine in Helmand Province this week.
The senior defense official said the Americans considered the attacks as ''isolated incidents,'' although ''obviously very disturbing.'' He said vetting procedures for Afghan security forces were being reviewed.
Mr. Panetta said he would also seek to reassure NATO that although budget constraints and a focus on Asia were forcing the United States to withdraw two combat brigades -- as many as 10,000 troops -- from Europe, it was not abandoning its allies. The United States, he said, would try to make up some of the difference by rotating more troops in for training exercises in Europe.

HEADLINE: 'Poor' Quote By Romney Joins a List Critics Love

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Reno, Nev.

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS -- Obsessive attention to detail suffuses Mitt Romney's candidacy for president, from the number of times staff members check the microphones at his rallies to their relentless scouring of Twitter.
But Mr. Romney's aides cannot always bring that well-known level of discipline to one crucial aspect of the campaign: their candidate's seemingly endless ability to utter remarks that, to the delight of his critics, sail onto political blogs, YouTube and Twitter.
On Wednesday morning in an interview with CNN, Mr. Romney said, ''I'm not concerned about the very poor,'' a sound bite that ricocheted around the Web and cable news channels, and which Mr. Romney felt the need to clarify with reporters as he flew to Minnesota. 
The comment captivated the political chatter, at least for the day, because it seemed to reinforce what might be his rivals' most potent line of attack against him: that Mr. Romney, with a net worth estimated at $200 million, is out of touch and unable to relate to struggling Americans.
Taking in the full context of his remarks, as Mr. Romney urged reporters to do, his statement seems more benign: ''I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs a repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich; they're doing just fine.'' He is most concerned about the middle class, he said.
But for a campaign that has itself been accused of taking President Obama's words out of context, the remark about the poor immediately became cataloged in a growing list of awkward comments by Mr. Romney, including a remark that his speaking fees last year of $374,327 were ''not very much'' and his line that ''corporations are people.''
Unlike President George W. Bush's malapropisms, which generally served as late-night punch lines, Mr. Romney's foot-in-mouth comments have an economic undertone, which have gained traction because they perpetuate his critics' attacks that he is an unfeeling corporate titan.
''Now let me just say something,'' Newt Gingrich said when asked about the ''poor'' comment. ''I am fed up with politicians of either party dividing Americans against each other.''
''I am running to be the president of all the American people,'' he added, ''and I am concerned about all the American people.''
Although Mr. Romney has become a better campaigner in many ways, he cannot seem to stop making inopportune remarks.
Last June, he told a group of unemployed workers in Florida, who had just finished telling him their stories, that he understood their plight.
''I'm also unemployed,'' Mr. Romney said as a joke. ''I'm networking. I have my sight on a particular job.''
At a debate, he offered Gov. Rick Perry of Texas a $10,000 wager -- an amount that, even if facetious, reminded voters just how much disposable income Mr. Romney has.
Speaking to crowds in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney claimed that he, too, had feared the ''pink slip'' during his life.
So, on the plane to Minnesota on Wednesday, Mr. Romney found himself in a familiar situation, forced to walk back gaffes.
When asked to elaborate on the ''poor'' remark, Mr. Romney said, ''I've said throughout the campaign my focus, my concern, my energy is going to be devoted to helping middle-income people, all right?''
''We have a safety net for the poor in the country, and if there are holes in it, I will work to repair that,'' he added. ''And if there are people that are falling through the cracks, I want to fix that.''
He also made a substantive nod to low-income workers, renewing his support for automatic increases in the federal minimum wage to keep pace with inflation -- a position sharply at odds with most of his party.
''I haven't changed my thoughts on that,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama's Oblique Attacks Hint at Romney as Expected Rival

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Mark Landler reported from Falls Church, Va., and Michael D. Shear from Washington.

 BODY:
FALLS CHURCH, Va. -- President Obama and Mitt Romney traded jabs on Wednesday over economic issues, from helping burdened homeowners to finding jobs for skilled workers, as the two appeared to be girding for a general-election fight after Mr. Romney's decisive victory in the Florida primary.
Mr. Obama's attack came obliquely, in details of a new White House proposal to help homeowners refinance their mortgages, which he cast as a humane alternative to those who contend that the housing market must bottom out before people can find relief. Mr. Romney made that argument last year in Nevada. 
Mr. Romney counterpunched hours later, accusing the president of being ''detached from reality'' for the way he responded to a woman whose husband was out of work. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Romney used his speech after winning in Florida to deliver a withering indictment of Mr. Obama's leadership.
Never mind that the Republicans have yet to settle on a nominee; the thumping nature of Mr. Romney's victory has reinforced the belief of Mr. Obama's advisers that he will be the choice. And the president -- though he professes to be governing, not campaigning, and rarely mentions Mr. Romney by name -- has used recent speeches to systematically assault the positions of Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor.
For Mr. Obama, the goal is to frame, as early as possible and in an advantageous way, the choice between himself and his most probable rival. For Mr. Romney, it is to keep his focus on the president rather than get bogged down in damaging intraparty squabbles with Newt Gingrich and other Republican rivals, though he went after Mr. Gingrich as well on Wednesday, questioning his conservative credentials.
The introduction of a package of housing proposals here gave Mr. Obama a chance to hammer his theme of economic justice for the middle class, and to draw another contrast with Mr. Romney. Even responsible homeowners, the president said, have been victimized by unscrupulous banks and mortgage brokers.
''It is wrong for anybody to suggest that the only option for struggling, responsible homeowners is to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom,'' he said at a community center here, clearly referring to Mr. Romney. ''I refuse to accept that, and so do the American people.''
Housing values in this Washington suburb have dropped by a quarter, the president said, while more than half of homeowners in Las Vegas are underwater on their mortgages, meaning that what they owe is more than what the house is worth. Mr. Obama's reference to Las Vegas hardly seemed accidental; Mr. Romney made his comments about the housing market bottoming out to a Las Vegas newspaper.
Jared Bernstein, a former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said, ''Romney taps into a fairly strong conservative sentiment on housing, which is 'liquidate, liquidate, liquidate.' The idea that you would intervene in housing finance is anathema to them, given their ideology.''
Mr. Bernstein said that such reluctance would be understandable except that banks and other institutions are not providing enough credit to resuscitate the market. Mr. Obama's housing proposal, parts of which would require Congressional legislation, aims to make it easier for homeowners to refinance mortgages.
Mr. Romney, at a rally in Minnesota before flying to Nevada to compete in its caucus on Saturday, accused the president of refusing to take responsibility for an economy he does not understand. He also mocked him as disconnected from Americans.
''Is he so detached from reality?'' Mr. Romney asked, noting that the president appeared surprised during an online discussion when a woman said that her husband, an unemployed engineer, was having trouble finding work. ''Does he not understand what's going on in America?''
Mr. Romney's rhetorical pivot back to Mr. Obama began moments after he claimed victory in Florida, vowing that ''my leadership will end the Obama era and begin a new era of American prosperity.''
By Wednesday morning, his staff had offered a glimpse of its general-election strategy, releasing a 2008 memorandum from Hillary Rodham Clinton's pollster complaining that Mr. Obama's campaign had ''engaged in a mean-spirited, unfair character attack'' on her, using language that was ''patently false and demeaning.'' Mr. Romney also criticized Mr. Gingrich, saying that his proposal for a colony on the moon was hardly conservative.
And Mr. Gingrich, trying to lasso the Tea Party movement before the Nevada caucuses, will announce the endorsement on Thursday of Donald Trump.
In Minnesota, Mr. Romney trained his sights on Mr. Obama. He accused the president of being ''remarkably comfortable with trillion-dollar deficits'' and of ''crony capitalism.'' And he said the president thought foreign policy should ''consist of appeasing and accommodating some of the world's worst actors.''
Mr. Obama has strenuously rejected that criticism, pointing to his raid on Osama bin Laden. Mr. Romney may find new ammunition with Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta's announcement Wednesday that American troops would wind down their combat role in Afghanistan in 2013. But the White House, noting the popular support for the end of the war in Iraq, seems eager to have that debate.
Even if he does not mention Mr. Romney, the president has lost few chances to take shots at him. Visiting the Washington Auto Show, Mr. Obama inspected new hybrid vehicles from Ford, Dodge and General Motors and reminded people of his administration's role in bailing out two of the Big Three carmakers.
''It's good to remember the fact that there were some folks who were willing to let this industry die,'' he said. ''Because of folks coming together, we are now back in a place where we can compete with any car company in the world.''
And who was it who once argued that the government ought to let the carmakers fail? Mitt Romney.

HEADLINE: Lure of a Senate Bill Attracts Amendments, Some of Them Relevant

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the Senate these days, even a popular bill has trouble passing.
Most senators profess support for a bill to ban insider trading by members of Congress. But somehow the bill has quickly become snarled in a tangle of friendly and unfriendly amendments.
Prospects for the legislation looked bright on Monday when the Senate voted 93 to 2 to take up the measure, which would prohibit lawmakers from trading stocks on the basis of confidential information they gain by virtue of their public office. 
Just 48 hours later the sponsors of the bill were trying to keep it on track. Some senators wanted to make it tougher. Some wanted to make it weaker. And some wanted to address tangential issues.
''At some point, this becomes ridiculous,'' said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. ''Senators come over here and say they are not going to allow a vote on an amendment unless they are guaranteed votes on non-germane, non-relevant amendments. It becomes a circus.''
More generally, sponsors of the bill said they had heard grumbling from colleagues in both parties about the bill's requirement for lawmakers to disclose stock sales and purchases within 30 days of the transactions. Some senators with big stock portfolios have apparently suggested that this would be an unreasonable burden.
Republicans say the disclosure requirement should apply to federal employees in the executive branch, as well as members of Congress.
''The goal in the course of this floor debate is to make sure the executive branch -- those most likely to take advantage of insider information -- is fully and adequately covered,'' said the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
Supporters of the bill agree in principle. But they worry about the possibility that financial disclosure statements for hundreds of thousands of career civil servants would be posted on the Web. So they want to limit the disclosure requirement to civilian federal officials subject to Senate confirmation.
The managers of the bill -- Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine -- agreed to a vote on an amendment to require swift disclosure of stock trades by executive branch employees.
But Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, would not agree unless he got a vote on his proposal seeking a constitutional amendment to establish term limits for members of Congress.
And Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, wanted an assurance that the Senate would vote on his amendment to impose a permanent ban on special-interest spending and tax items known as earmarks.
Ms. Collins and Mr. Lieberman tried Wednesday to winnow the amendments on which votes would be allowed.
''We are making progress,'' Ms. Collins said. Mr. Lieberman implored colleagues, ''Let's try to not make this measure so sweet or so good that it cannot pass.''
A companion bill in the House has more than 255 co-sponsors, including at least 90 Republicans. House Republican leaders said they planned to call it up for a vote this month.
In the Senate, the legislation has attracted more than two dozen amendments.
Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, offered one that would prohibit federal officials from approving grants or loans to companies in which they or their immediate relatives had ''a significant financial interest.''
Another Paul amendment would cancel the pension of any former member of Congress who becomes a lobbyist or goes to work for a private entity that employs lobbyists or does business with the federal government.
Mr. Paul said he was ''somewhat sickened and somewhat saddened by people who leave office and become lobbyists.''
Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the breadth of this proposal was breathtaking. It would, he said, revoke pension benefits from a retired member of Congress who accepts ''any kind of remuneration -- a salary, a consulting fee, even an honorarium for a speech -- from any company that employs a registered lobbyist.''
Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, also wanted to go beyond the bill. He would require senators to divest themselves of stock in companies that could be affected by their actions.
''Why should members of the Senate vote on issues that affect the oil industry while owning oil industry stock?'' Mr. Brown asked.
Under his proposal, senators could put such holdings in a blind trust, and they could own shares in a broad-based mutual fund but not in a mutual fund focused on one sector of the economy.
The legislation was turning into a vehicle for ethics proposals of all sorts.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, offered an amendment that would block payment of bonuses to senior executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while the companies are under government conservatorship.
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, proposed an amendment that would require members of Congress to disclose the terms of mortgages on their homes. She said this was prompted by the discovery that some lawmakers had received loans on favorable terms from Countrywide Financial.
Some senators want to tighten the deadline for disclosure of stock transactions. Mr. Brown wants to require reporting within 10 days, rather than the 30 allowed in the bill.
Other senators said that lawmakers should have 90 days. Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, said the Senate might settle on a quarterly reporting requirement as the most feasible.

HEADLINE: For G.O.P., Pipeline Is Central to Agenda

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Just six months ago, Keystone for many Americans was the state nickname for Pennsylvania. But now Keystone, the Canadian pipeline, has become a centerpiece of the Republican economic and political agenda, and the party's preferred truncheon against President Obama.
On the airwaves, on the campaign trail and in both chambers of Congress, Republicans are relentlessly pushing for an expansion of the pipeline known as Keystone XL and criticizing Mr. Obama's decision to reject the project for now, forgoing thousands of pipeline jobs. Democrats, increasingly worried that the pounding on the issue will detract from their own message against income inequality, are looking for ways to defuse it. 
Republicans are framing Keystone as an urgent jobs and energy project at a time of high unemployment and creeping gasoline prices, and trying to portray Mr. Obama as giving in to hard-left environmentalists in an election year at the expense of addressing both.
The Republican presidential candidates frequently invoke Keystone on the campaign trail. Newt Gingrich highlighted the project in his concession speech in Florida on Tuesday, saying approval of the project would be one of his first priorities as president.
Republicans are further spotlighting the support that many Democrats -- and some labor unions -- have shown the project, as a way of demonstrating that Mr. Obama's party, not theirs, is divided over the project.
''I think people care very much about the price of gas,'' said Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat facing a tough re-election battle in Missouri. ''I support the pipeline,'' she said. ''I disagree with it being used as a political football.''
This week, Democrats moved to blunt the Keystone attacks, with some party leaders showing qualified support for the project. On Tuesday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said that if a Keystone bill would guarantee that oil extracted in the project be sold domestically, not overseas, as some critics fear, ''then I'll take a look at it.''
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, told reporters that the project ''has merit.''
For Republicans, the pipeline is a political trifecta. It unites most of their party and divides the Democrats. It is also fairly easy to explain to voters, and it hits on the key concerns of many Americans: jobs, energy independence and fear of economic competition with China, which Republicans have said will be the recipient of the Canadian oil without the Keystone plan.
''The American people are asking, Where are the jobs?'' Speaker John A. Boehner wrote in an e-mail, ''and Republicans are going to fight for these jobs.''
House Republicans have made approval of the pipeline, which would stretch from oil sands formations in Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast, a central goal this year. Their latest bill would remove the State Department's authority over the project.
Senate Republicans have their own legislation to permit the Keystone project to proceed outside Nebraska while a new route is formulated that would avoid the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills region of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides water to many states.
The number of jobs that could be created by the Keystone expansion -- supporters say 20,000 -- is disputed. But many companies and labor unions around the country were counting on the expansion and had already made materials or hired workers to gear up.
''We are on the other side of the Ping-Pong table here,'' said J. M. Bernhard Jr., president of the Shaw Group, a supplier of fabricated piping systems that had begun to do work for the project.
''It's hard to understand why we would allow pipelines through the marshes of Louisiana, which I dearly love, and not have other states participating in something for the betterment of the entire United States,'' said Mr. Bernhard, a supporter of Mr. Obama who donated to his 2008 campaign.
Keystone has been mired in politics for years, with opponents and supporters of the project each claiming to represent the people of Nebraska, which sits in the center of the proposed expansion. Supporters portray the state as universally in love with the project, while opponents say the state's residents validate their own dislike of it.
The truth is somewhere in between. TransCanada, the company behind Keystone, initially proposed a route that would cross the Sand Hills and Ogallala Aquifer. Many Nebraskans -- including Gov. Dave Heineman, a Republican, and some members of the state's Congressional delegation -- resisted that plan even though the State Department, which has jurisdiction over the project, found it acceptable after extensive review.
Late last year, Mr. Heineman called a special session of the Legislature that resulted in a law requiring the new Keystone XL route to be constructed away from the Sand Hills. TransCanada agreed, but the Obama administration, facing continued protests from environmental groups, said it would delay a decision on the new route until after the election.
House Republicans pushed back, using an amendment to the payroll tax holiday extension bill in December to require that the administration make a faster decision while allowing the Nebraska reroute to proceed. Mr. Obama responded by rejecting the TransCanada application.
''We have said from Day 1 we support the project but objected to the route,'' Governor Heineman said in an interview. ''So now we're trying to figure out, where do we stand? I think everyone in Washington is playing games. I think we can use a little American and Nebraskan common sense here.''
The White House is betting that Americans will ignore the Keystone issue, and that Mr. Obama's recent speeches on the road about his energy initiatives, including one in which he said that the Department of Interior would hold a new drilling lease sale for the Gulf of Mexico, will blunt Republican efforts.
''As for the president's commitment to energy security and expanding domestic production,'' said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman, ''the numbers speak for themselves. Since 2008, domestic oil and gas production has increased each year, and last year we produced more oil at home than at any time since 2003.''
A wild card is whether workers invested in the project will serve as an echo chamber for the Republicans' criticism.
''The problem with Keystone,'' said Representative Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, ''is that many of the workers are blue collar. They go to their job and come home and take care of their children, and I don't know if they are going to get on Facebook and 'friend' a bunch of people or anything like that.''

HEADLINE: Still Battling G.O.P. Foes, Romney Turns to Face Obama

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
On the heels of a commanding victory in Florida, Mitt Romney on Wednesday morning sought to move ahead toward a coming confrontation with President Obama even as he headed west for the continuing battle with his Republican rivals.
The campaign to be the Republican nominee showed no signs of letting up after the brutal, 10-day slugfest in Florida. After a brief stop in Minnesota, which holds its caucuses Tuesday, Mr. Romney is scheduled to hold an evening rally in Las Vegas. Nevada voters caucus on Saturday.
In Nevada, Mr. Romney will find Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Representative Ron Paul waiting for him -- three defiant reminders that for all his recent success, he has not yet finished the job he first set out to accomplish more than six years ago: becoming the party's standard-bearer.
And campaign-finance reports released late Tuesday reveal a flood of money pouring into campaigns and ''super PACs'' that will provide the means to extend even further the character attacks that dominated the Republican contest for most of January. 
Mr. Romney now faces what could be weeks, or even months, of a complicated political balancing act as he tries to use his success in Florida to cement the impression that his grip on the Republican nomination is all but inevitable, consolidate conservative support and seize control of the party.
Watching closely is Mr. Obama, whose advisers on Wednesday morning said that the bitter Republican primary was making Mr. Romney a weaker candidate. Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, said in a memo to reporters that Mr. Romney's ''out-of-touch positions'' in Nevada ''will continue to repel the very voters who will decide the White House.''
Mr. Romney's campaign shot back, saying the president was clearly ''worried'' about facing Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, in the general election.
Appearing on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe'' program on Wednesday morning, Mr. Romney lashed out at his opponents from the left and the right, accusing the president of ''crony capitalism'' that is hurting free enterprise and questioning Mr. Gingrich's conservative credentials.
''He was the guy who called Paul Ryan's Medicare plan radical right-wing social engineering,'' Mr. Romney said of Mr. Gingrich, while also noting the television commercial on global warming that Mr. Gingrich filmed with Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic speaker of the House.
''The idea that he's somehow the conservative guy just doesn't square with his record,'' Mr. Romney said.
Reports that Mr. Romney, who is now receiving Secret Service protection, was traveling to Minnesota on Wednesday amid negotiations for an endorsement by Representative Michele Bachmann were quickly denied by Mrs. Bachmann, a former Republican presidential candidate. And in fact during his stopover in Minneapolis he did not meet with her.
In his victory speech Tuesday night, Mr. Romney made it clear that he wanted to get back to focusing almost exclusively on what he considers the failures of Mr. Obama's record during the past three years in office.
''My leadership will end the Obama era and begin a new era of American prosperity,'' he declared to about 2,000 people -- his largest post-election crowd yet.
Speaking on CNN's ''Starting Point'' on Wednesday morning, Mr. Romney said he would focus on the middle class, not the rich or the poor. ''I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs a repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich -- they're doing just fine,'' said Mr. Romney.
Asked during a flight to Minnesota to elaborate on his wording about the poor, he said, ''You've got to take the whole sentence,'' then added: ''But my focus in the campaign is on middle-income people. Of course I'm concerned about all Americans -- poor, wealthy, middle class, but the focus of my effort will be on middle-income families who I think have been most hurt by the Obama economy.''
But his efforts to pivot toward a debate with Mr. Obama come as his Republican rivals show no signs of conceding.
In his concession speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Gingrich did not congratulate Mr. Romney nor provide any indication that he was beginning to wrap up his up-and-down bid to become the Republican nominee.
Mr. Gingrich's challenges loom large as he heads toward Nevada and beyond. He faces a month of contests in the West and the Rust Belt that would seem to favor Mr. Romney before returning to the South in March.
And he must confront potential skittishness from supporters -- and especially donors like Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate who, with his wife, has already donated $10 million -- about whether his campaign remains viable as it seeks to challenge Mr. Romney, who has a bigger war chest and the ever-increasing backing of the Republican establishment.
Mr. Gingrich anticipated those questions in his speech Tuesday night and said his answer would be to use ''people power'' to defeat ''money power'' during a Republican primary contest that he predicted would continue for another six months.
''We will be in Tampa as the nominee in August,'' Mr. Gingrich vowed.
Mr. Gingrich ignored his other two rivals, Mr. Paul and Mr. Santorum, declaring the Republican contest to be a ''two-person race between the conservative leader Newt Gingrich and the Massachusetts moderate.''
That is not how the other two men see it -- and they made that clear Tuesday night and Wednesday.
In Colorado on Wednesday, Mr. Santorum criticized Mr. Romney for the health care plan he approved as governor in Massachusetts. Having stayed clear of character attacks, Mr. Santorum nevertheless had vowed a relentless campaign to demonstrate what he sees as the similarities between Mr. Romney's health care plan and Mr. Obama's.
But Mr. Santorum also still must make the case that he -- not Mr. Gingrich -- is the better alternative to Mr. Romney for Republicans. In his concession speech on Tuesday night, he said Florida's results proved that to be true.
''Newt Gingrich had his opportunity,'' said Mr. Santorum, who is set to travel to Nevada later on Wednesday. ''He said, 'I'm going to be the anti-Mitt,' and it didn't work. He became the issue. We can't allow our nominee to be the issue in the campaign.''
Already in Nevada, Mr. Paul repeated his promise to continue his campaign for ''liberty'' as he continues to try and gather delegates to the Republican Party's convention.
''The message is loud and clear,'' he said on Tuesday night. ''The enthusiasm is here, but it has to be translated into proper political action. That means attending the caucuses, and send a powerful message to this country that we want our freedoms back, we don't want more government!''

HEADLINE: Jobs Lost, Now They've Taken the Porcelain

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
These have been among the worst of times for Trenton, a once-proud industrial city that has struggled with grim finances, large-scale layoffs and rising crime. Now comes the latest indignity: The Brooklyn Museum demanded the return of its vase. 
The 4-foot-7-inch porcelain vase was a source of local pride. It dated from Trenton's heyday. It was designed by a ceramic artist who had forsaken London for Trenton. It was made by one of Trenton's most successful companies, which also made the country's first one-piece solid porcelain lavatory.
The vase was sent off to the 1904 World's Fair. The Brooklyn Museum sent it to Trenton in 1997 on loan to the Trenton City Museum. Robert Cunningham, the president of the Trenton Museum Society, said its departure began last month with a telephone call from someone at the Brooklyn Museum.
''They indicated they had heard the director of the museum was laid off for budgetary reasons and there was no one there and they were worried about their vase,'' he said Wednesday. ''I said, 'There's a full-time person from the city there, not the director but a full-time person; the museum is open six days a week; we, the volunteer museum society, are in there all the time; we have two people we employ; there's security; and things are basically the same.''
He said the next communication from Brooklyn was an e-mail saying the vase could not stay in Trenton. It did not seem to matter that Mr. Cunningham's society had already spent $19,000 to buy one of three other similar vases or that it was planning to borrow the other two and exhibit all four.
Barry Harwood, the curator of decorative arts at the Brooklyn Museum, said the Trenton museum's financial problems or its safety in Trenton were not the main reasons he wanted the vase returned. ''But in all honesty,'' he said, ''the economic crisis fueled our desire to have it come back.''
He said the vase -- impressive for its size and scale but stylistically ''a rather old-fashioned and conservative object'' -- had been in storage when the Trenton museum asked to borrow it in 1997. ''It's been there a very, very long time,'' he said. ''I had been thinking about bringing it back, so the decision to bring it back was independent and prior to their economic crisis.'' He said it was picked up on Tuesday.
''We will put it out on view,'' he said. ''Exactly when, I don't know.''

HEADLINE: The Darkening Tone of the Primaries

 BODY:
After two weeks of mean-spirited campaigning in Florida, where the Republican contenders jockeyed for the right-most flank of their party, maybe it should not have been shocking when Mitt Romney announced that he is ''not concerned about the very poor.'' 
Speaking on CNN on Wednesday, and in a lame attempt later to spin his remarks, Mr. Romney tried to explain that he was focused on middle-income Americans because the poor -- now a full 15 percent of the population -- already have a government safety net. He failed to mention, of course, that his policies, and those of his fellow Republicans in Washington, would drive more people into that net -- while at the same time shredding it.
The remark was in keeping with the callous tone of the campaign for the Florida primary, in which Mr. Romney handily beat Newt Gingrich. Even in his victory speech Tuesday night, Mr. Romney hinted darkly at the tone of the campaign to come. He accused President Obama of ordering ''religious organizations to violate their conscience'' and vowed to defend religious liberty.
It was a reference to the Obama administration's requirement that large religious institutions, like hospitals and universities, provide insurance coverage for birth control. He was promising to defend the Roman Catholic Church's ''religious liberty'' to deprive its tens of thousands of employees and university students of their own liberty.
Tellingly, that was a cheap remark stolen from Mr. Gingrich, who had accused Mr. Romney of the same thing for a similar action he took while governor of Massachusetts. He even claimed, absurdly, that Mr. Romney took kosher food out of the mouths of Holocaust survivors.
Rather than repudiate such tactics, the lesson Mr. Romney took is that any line, no matter how brutal, is fair game if it brings a few more angry voters to your side. Of course, that didn't work too well for Mr. Gingrich, whose willingness to say virtually anything -- promising Cuban-Americans that he would start a violent uprising to overthrow the Castro regime, for instance -- left him without the support of a single demographic group.
When Mr. Romney descended into the mud with him, it soured many voters about the entire Republican field, according to several polls. Independents have been particularly turned off by Mr. Romney's hard-right stridency. Mr. Romney has spent so much time on the attack against either Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Obama that his only positive message in Florida was an off-key rendition of ''America the Beautiful.'' At a time when the country is increasingly concerned about economic inequality, a candidate worth $250 million says he is not concerned about their welfare because government programs -- many of which his budget would gut -- will take care of them.
Among the middle Americans that Mr. Romney says he is focused on are 51 million people just above the poverty line, according to the Census Bureau. Many of them fear slipping beneath it, and now they know that will mean disappearing from the concerns of the Republican presidential front-runner.
After winning on Tuesday, Mr. Romney said his campaign was ''about saving the soul of America.'' If this is the direction he plans to take in the coming months, he will first need to save the soul of his campaign.

HEADLINE: Downturn and Political Upstarts Transform Nevada's G.O.P. Caucuses

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JENNIFER MEDINA; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- When Mitt Romney won the Republican presidential caucuses in Nevada four year ago, this was a different state, and the Republican Party was a different party.
The Nevada economy was in trouble, but it had not reached the depths that were soon to come: The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent when Republicans gathered to vote in January 2008; it is 13 percent today, the highest in the nation. The optimism and political spirit that enlivened Nevadans as they found themselves at ground zero in the fight for the White House have been replaced with gloom and apathy. Voters speak of abandoned homes, dispiriting battles in Washington and disappointment with President Obama.
''A lot of people had lives and homes and jobs that they now see are never coming back,'' said Frank Nason, the president of a struggling Las Vegas real estate brokerage. ''I haven't heard anybody talk about anything that matters to us. It's just the same-old from everyone, and instead of any of the bailouts helping regular people, it helped everyone else but them.'' 
And in 2008, there was no such thing as a Tea Party. These days, Nevada is a cauldron of Tea Party activity. There are competing bands of Tea Party leaders, and one of its candidates unsuccessfully challenged Senator Harry Reid, the leader of the Senate Democrats, in 2010.
The economic and political changes of the past four years have established Nevada as a major battleground this fall, while adding some unpredictability to the Republican caucuses on Saturday. Mr. Romney is widely viewed as being in a strong position to win again this time, partly because he is a Mormon and Mormons are expected to make up slightly more than a quarter of the electorate.
But the intensity of Tea Party activists in Nevada, fueled by the relentless economic downturn here, suggests the state might offer the Tea Party one of its final chances to block Mr. Romney. Ron Paul is focusing on Nevada at the expense of other states, while Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum are competing intensely for Tea Party backers. On Wednesday, Mr. Santorum released an advertisement here that attacked Mr. Gingrich for supporting the Wall Street bailouts, describing them as ''a slap in the face of the Tea Party.''
And with this four-day burst of campaigning after the Florida primary, Nevada is offering the Republican field a test drive through a genuine swing state, which Mr. Obama won in the 2008 general election and is anxious about carrying again in 2012.
Nevada has been as ravaged by the economic downturn as any state, consistently posting some of the highest unemployment and foreclosure rates in the country. One in every 175 homes is in foreclosure. In every suburb here, signs advertising move-in specials abut vacant lots and half-completed development projects.
The collapse in the construction industry has been devastating; it once accounted for 12 percent of all jobs, but it is down to 5 percent. When the construction of a $550 million project by Caesars Entertainment Corporation began in Las Vegas last year, civic leaders rejoiced. But two other large developments on Las Vegas Boulevard have gone mostly untouched in the faltering economy.
''We've probably bottomed out, but the glass is certainly not half full,'' said Stephen P. A. Brown, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ''Construction is doing very badly, and the only thing that will help that is population growth, and the only thing that will help that is jobs, so we have a real circular problem.''
There are some signs of improvement, including a small increase in passengers at the Las Vegas airport and upticks in sales tax receipts and gambling revenue. But home values continue to fall to levels not seen since the late 1990s.
''We are still depending on tourism for our economy, and we don't know exactly how much that will all come back and what it will look like,'' said Elliott Parker, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada, Reno. He added: ''Nevada is probably a little more pessimistic than the rest of the country. People are really skeptical about whether things are going to take another long time for recovery.''
Nevada has always had a strong libertarian and antigovernment sentiment; the rise of the Tea Party has given some form to that once inchoate anger. Sharron Angle, the Republican challenger to Mr. Reid in 2010, said the ''awakening of the silent majority'' had changed the political contours of Nevada.
''It's a very different climate that we're facing in 2012,'' she said.
On Saturday, registered Republicans will gather at precincts across the state to vote on the four candidates, a process that will eventually lead to the allocation of delegates.
Mr. Romney won the caucuses in 2008 with 51 percent of the vote. About one-quarter of the voters were Mormons, according to surveys of voters entering caucus sites, and 95 percent of them said they supported Mr. Romney. Mr. Paul came in second with 14 percent, and both Mr. Paul and Mr. Romney show evidence of having precisely the kind of strong organization needed in a caucus state, where turnout is often just a small portion of the party's electorate.
''Neither Ron Paul or Mitt Romney left the state. They have been here the whole time,'' said Amy Tarkanian, the Republican state chair.
Mr. Gingrich is looking to the Tea Party here to provide him with the organization that he does not have. ''You have this activist base much more willing to take on the establishment,'' said David Damore, a professor of political science at U.N.L.V.
Sue Lowden, a former Republican chairwoman who is supporting Mr. Gingrich, said the Tea Party network ''gives the other candidates a chance to emerge as the second or third player on our caucus day, because I don't think that Romney would be their choice because he's more of the establishment.''
Ryan Erwin, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney's effort here this year and in 2008, said that anger at government had been a force last time -- ''Nevada has always been a state that has a chip on its shoulder because the federal government owns 85 or 86 percent of the land here'' -- but that all four candidates could benefit from this new dynamic.
Whether the emergence of the Tea Party here helps Mr. Romney is an open question; that said, the evidence that supporters of the Tea Party will scatter their votes among the other three candidates is a diffusion that should serve him well.
Jeri Taylor-Swade, a Tea Party organizer in Las Vegas, said that most Tea Party activists were backing Mr. Gingrich, but that many remained undecided. ''The race could still change at any moment, and people really have a chance to change the outcome,'' she said.

HEADLINE: From Founders to Decorators, Facebook Riches

BYLINE: By NICK BILTON and EVELYN M. RUSLI; Nick Bilton reported from San Francisco and Evelyn M. Rusli from New York.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The graffiti artist who took Facebook stock instead of cash for painting the walls of the social network's first headquarters made a smart bet. The shares owned by the artist, David Choe, are expected to be worth upward of $200 million when Facebook stock trades publicly later this year.
The social network company announced its $5 billion public offering Wednesday afternoon, which is expected to value the whole company at $75 billion to $100 billion. Ultimately, that offering will mint a lot of billionaires and millionaires.
Some of them are well known, like Mark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder, but many others are not household names. Mr. Zuckerberg, 27, has 533.8 million shares, worth $28.4 billion based on a company valuation of $100 billion, or $53 a share. He also has undisputed control of the company, a remarkable achievement since the company has received financing from some of the world's top business minds. He owns 28.4 percent of the company outright and he controls 57 percent of the voting rights. 
Facebook's first outside investor, Peter Thiel, the billionaire contrarian, led a $500,000 investment in Facebook in late 2004. He has 44.7 million shares that could be worth more than $2 billion. Elevation Partners, the venture capital firm of Bono, the U2 frontman, paid $120 million for a chunk of Facebook's shares in 2010 and could receive a payout that would help mask less sage investments in Palm and Forbes.
Accel Partners, whose principal partner, Jim Breyer, invested in the start-up seven years ago, holds 201.4 million shares. Accel could have a thousandfold return on some of its investment.
Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer, holds 1.9 million shares, about 0.1 percent of the company. But she may ultimately collect 38.1 mil-lion additional shares, according to the filing, making her one of the richest in a tiny club of Silicon Valley women who are billionaires.
The wealth created by a technology company's entrance into the public markets has long been startling. Netscape's 1995 offering made millionaires of scores of people, including its founder Marc Andreessen, now a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who invested early in Facebook and holds 3.6 million shares worth nearly $200 million. When Google went to market with its $1.67 billion I.P.O. in 2004, hundreds of people joined the millionaire ranks, including secretaries, a company masseuse and a company chef.
Bill Gates controlled only 49.2 percent of Microsoft as it went public in 1986. Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, each owned about 15 percent of their company when it went public in 2004.
Two factors distinguish Facebook's turn. For one, the projected value of Facebook is enormous --the largest on record for an Internet company, even several times greater than Google's offering in 2004. The social network, founded in Mr. Zuckerberg's dorm room at Harvard eight years ago, is expected to be valued north of $75 billion. Shares of Facebook have already traded on the secondary market, where private shares are bought and sold, above $80 billion.
And unlike Google's public offering, a large chunk of the wealth tied to Facebook has already been realized, thanks to the thriving secondary market and an eager pool of global investors. Even if Facebook hits only the low end of expectations for its offering, it will still yield some of the greatest returns in the history of venture capital.
''Facebook will return insane amounts of money to the early stakeholders,'' said Alex Gould, a technology investor and instructor at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, who has been studying venture returns for several years. ''Facebook is not just a fund-maker, it's a firm-maker.''
It's a big winners circle. DST Global, the investment firm led by the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, owns roughly a 7 percent stake in the company. It bought the bulk of its shares from 2009 to 2011 at valuations of $10 billion to $50 billion.
According to the company's filing, Mr. Zuckerberg's father, a New York dentist, was awarded two million shares of stock ''in satisfaction of funds provided for our initial working capital.'' Dustin Moskovitz, Mr. Zuckerberg's college roommate, a fellow Harvard dropout and company co-founder, holds 133.8 million shares.
During Facebook's early years, the company granted valuable options to about 250 employees, according to two former senior Facebook officials with knowledge of the matter. This club includes some of the largest stock packages, these people said.
In 2007, the company stopped issuing options and switched to restricted stock units. Still, a large number of employees hired after 2007 have millions in shares today. David A. Ebersman, Facebook's chief financial officer, who was hired in 2009, has more than seven million in unvested shares.
The list of notable shareholders also includes some people who may be considered unwelcome at Facebook. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the Olympic-rowing pair, Harvard graduates and former business partners of Mr. Zuckerberg, own about 1.2 million shares as part of their settlement with the company and their former classmate, who they claim essentially stole their idea for Facebook.
The company's estranged co-founder, Eduardo Saverin, who provided some of the initial financing and later sued the company for cutting his stake, managed to cut an even larger settlement, worth 5 percent of the company. He has since sold a large block of his shares on the secondary market. He is not mentioned in the Facebook filing.
The payout to Mr. Choe, the graffiti artist, could provide more money from his paintings than Sotheby's attracted for its record-breaking $200.7 million auction in 2008 for work by Damien Hirst.
In 2005, Mr. Choe was invited to paint murals on the walls of Facebook's first offices in Palo Alto, Calif., by Sean Parker, then Facebook's president. As pay, Mr. Parker offered Mr. Choe a choice between cash in the ''thousands of dollars,'' according to several people who know Mr. Choe, or stock then worth about the same.
Mr. Choe, who has said that at the time that he thought the idea of Facebook was ''ridiculous and pointless,'' nevertheless chose the stock.
Many ''advisers'' to the company at that time, which is how Mr. Choe would have been classified, would have received about 0.1 to 0.25 percent of the company, according to a former Facebook employee. That may sound like a paltry amount, but a stake that size is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, based on a market value of $100 billion. Mr. Choe's payment is valued at roughly $200 million, according to a number of people who know Mr. Choe and Facebook executives.
Although Mr. Choe initially led a rough life including run-ins with the law, he is wealthy even without the Facebook offering. (It is unclear whether he sold any portion of his Facebook holdings on secondary markets.) Now a very successful artist with gallery shows and pieces exhibited in major museums, Mr. Choe declined requests to be interviewed for this article; he said he wanted to maintain his privacy. He has, however, published an obscenity-strewn book of his art, ''David Choe,'' which includes images of the multimillion-dollar murals at Facebook.
Mr. Choe's page on Facebook shows the life of a modern-day renegade artist. Among the images of his graffiti, there is a trail of images of him partying with scantily clad women and spending large amounts of money on alcohol. In recent weeks, Mr. Choe promoted photos of a $40,000 bottle of alcohol; a single shot, he boasted, costs $888.
He offers life advice in his book: ''Always double down on 11. Always.''
Maybe the better advice is to take stock, not cash, from Harvard dropouts in Silicon Valley.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Relief Plan Aims at Refinancing

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
President Obama, in announcing new mortgage relief on Wednesday, acknowledged that previous efforts to help homeowners had fallen short of expectations. And he tried to explain how his new effort, much of which would require Congressional approval, would fare significantly better.
In making his case, Mr. Obama framed the changes as a round of improvements that would build on previous efforts to make it easier to refinance mortgages. 
''I am sending Congress a plan that will give every responsible homeowner in America a chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low rates,'' he told an audience in Falls Church, Va. ''No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks.''
In recent months, his administration has scrambled to make a breakthrough on the mortgage front, given limited cooperation from Congress and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
The president's latest proposal was aimed at two groups of eligible homeowners: about 11 million whose loans are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and about 3.5 million whose loans are privately held. Those estimates include only homeowners who are current on their loan payments, have a credit score above 580 and are paying interest rates high enough to make refinancing attractive.
For those with privately held loans, the president will ask Congress to allow the Federal Housing Administration to refinance their mortgages in a program to be financed by a fee charged to large banks based on their size and the riskiness of their portfolios. The estimated cost of the program would be $5 billion to $10 billion, depending on the number of participants. Only houses whose values fall within F.H.A. guidelines, from about $270,000 to $730,000 depending on location, would qualify.
The F.H.A. would use the bank fee to insure itself against the credit risk of taking on the new mortgages, a White House official said.
Another part of the proposal is aimed at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which eased some restrictions on refinancing last fall, but not as much as the White House wanted. The Federal Reserve has called some of Fannie's and Freddie's barriers to refinancing, like risk-based fees for mortgages whose risk the companies have already shouldered, unjustifiable.
Mr. Obama's proposal is intended to force the mortgage giants to inject more competition into the refinancing market, eliminate appraisal fees and extend to everyone refinancing rules that had been made to help those who owed more than their homes were worth.
More than 10 million homeowners owe more money on their homes than they are worth, and home prices have continued to fall. The result is a drag on household wealth and consumer spending, with many families stuck in homes they are unable to sell but cannot afford to keep.
Some proponents of refinancing hailed the plan as a step in the right direction, though there were concerns about its chances of passing Congress. In a research note, Morgan Stanley called the plan's chances of passage ''improbable,'' but applauded aspects that did not require Congressional approval, such as reduced red tape in existing government refinancing programs.
Mass refinancing, long a goal of the administration, would essentially be an economic stimulus plan because it would lower homeowners' monthly payments, giving them more cash to spend. The president's plan includes incentives for homeowners who choose to apply the savings toward paying down their principal, helping them to rebuild some of the home equity that was wiped out in the financial crisis.
Proponents of mass refinancing have said that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can allow homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth to refinance without taking on more risk because the loans are already guaranteed. But media reports disclosed this week that Freddie Mac also had $5 billion invested in a type of security whose returns hinge on keeping interest rates high -- in effect, the company bet against homeowners' ability to refinance at the same time that it was increasing restrictions on refinancing.
Jay Carney, the chief White House spokesman, said Monday that the Treasury Department was ''looking into'' the report. But on Tuesday a spokesman for the department said that Treasury did not have oversight authority over Fannie and Freddie. In a statement, the Federal Housing Finance Agency on Monday said it was examining the investments and that Freddie Mac was no longer entering into new transactions of that type.
The F.H.F.A.'s inspector general is also looking into issues related to the transactions as part of a larger evaluation of the administration's oversight of Fannie's and Freddie's investments, a spokeswoman for the inspector general said. But she said evaluations were distinct from investigations, which are conducted in the case of potential criminal or civil violations.
On Wednesday, the F.H.F.A. announced that it would begin the pilot phase of a program to sell pools of foreclosed properties to investors, in hopes of increasing the number of rental units available, and reducing the stream of foreclosures weighing down home prices.

HEADLINE: Two Nobelists Offer Views of Human-Driven Global Warming

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: More Nobelists convey their views of the evidence that humans are exerting a growing, and troubling, influence on the global climate. 

 BODY:
3:05 p.m. | Updated |
Given the flurryofattention this week around what two batches of scientists of various stripes think of evidence that humans are exerting a growing and disruptive influence on climate, it's worth checking in with two Nobel laureates who've long been focused on the atmosphere and climate.
As I've written before, whatever your view of the science and policy choices related to global warming, you can probably find a Nobelist with matching views. But Mario Molina and Burton Richter deserve a prominent place at this table given their sustained attention to relevant issues.
While participating in a November conference connected with the International Year of Chemistry, I spent time talking with Molina of the University of California, San Diego, a 1995 laureate in chemistry for his work (with others) on the atmospheric impact of ozone-destroying refrigerants and related chemicals. In a talk at the event, he conveyed his view of the incomplete, but compelling, picture of greenhouse-driven climate change with this photo illustration (right).
[3:05 p.m. | Updated | In a comment below, Laurie Dougherty helpfully pointed to 2010 congressional testimony by Molina in which he described his jigsaw analogy this way: 
There appears to be a gross misunderstanding of the nature of climate change science among those that have attempted to discredit it. They convey the idea that the science in question behaves like a house of cards: if you remove just one of them, the whole structure falls apart. However, this is certainly not the way the science of complex systems has evolved. A much better analogy is a jigsaw puzzle: many pieces are missing, and some might even be in the wrong place, but there is little doubt that the overall image is clear, namely that climate change is a serious threat that needs to be urgently addressed. It is also clear that modest amounts of warming will have both positive and negative impacts, but above about 4 or 5 degrees Fahrenheit most impacts turn negative for many ecological systems, and for most nations. (Read the rest.)]
I've posted a lot on contrasting climate manifestos published in the past week by The Wall Street Journal, but it's worth adding the perspective of Richter, a physics Nobelist who's been deeply focused on humanity's energy challenge, including the climate impact of greenhouse gases. As I've noted before, he's the author of "Beyond Smoke and Mirrors," a cogent road map for facing the daunting long-term challenge of cutting emissions of greenhouse gases even as humanity's growth spurt crests in the next few decades.
Here's a note Richter sent in reaction to the initial 16-author op-ed article in the Journal, which challenged the need for prompt action to stem emissions:
The letter of the 16 scientists (physicists, I am sorry to say) published in the Wall Street Journal on 1/27/2012 says that more and more scientists doubt the dangers of global warming. That may be true of those who have not really looked at the issue, but it is certainly untrue of those that have.
There are two legitimate questions to ask about global warming. First, is the temperature going up? Second, if it is changing, what is causing it? The letter first casts doubt on the temperature rise, and then goes on to say even if it is rising, it is probably natural and has little to do with greenhouse gas emissions. I suppose it is nice to try to have two strings for your bow.
On the first question, the average temperature of our planet has, in fits and starts, been going up for more than 100 years. The average temperature each year fluctuates by a considerable amount and to see an effect one has to average over some period of time just as the technical analysts of the stock market look at the moving average over some number of day to discern trends.
Some of the authors of the letter know this; some do not. That the temperature has not gone up for a few years is irrelevant. To those who are interested in the most recent analysis, I point them to the work of Dr Richard Muller and his group at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Muller was a climate skeptic and pulled together a group of scientists and mathematicians and reanalyzed all the data. He did an outstanding job and gets the same answer as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The letter quotes one of its authors, Nobel Laureate Ivar Giaever, damning the American Physical Society's statement that the evidence for warming is incontrovertible.
Armed with my own Nobel Medal, I say if you can read a graph, the evidence is indeed incontrovertible because the temperature has gone up. The American Physical Society is right, he is wrong, and I can't understand why he complains about the temperature rise issue when there is more to discuss on the second question; who is the villain?
We have seen in the past a temperature change of about the same amount as the current one and it was a cooling. The Little Ice Age that began in the 14th century reduced the temperature of at least the northern hemisphere by about one degree centigrade in a couple of hundred years, and CO-2 emissions had nothing to do with it. The authors should be asking why today we are fairly sure the enemy is us.
In science we try analyze effects to discern their cause. When effects showed Newton was wrong on some things, Einstein put forward relativity which left Newton alone in his domain of validity and showed how new things happened when one left that domain. That is also the story of climate change.
In the 1950s we learned that CO-2 was going up faster than assumed previously. In the 1970s the World Meteorological Organization and the International Council for Science put together a group to try to understand what might happen if trends continued. The UN took it over in 1988 and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change was born. Its first report in 1990 said the temperature was going up and not enough was known to say if it was nature or us doing the driving. In its 1995 report humans were said to be contributing. In the 2001 report it said human activity was the likely cause. In the 2007 report it said it was very likely that humans were the drivers. The next report is due out in 2013.
As to the Little Ice Age, its origins were a mystery until very recently. New research ties it to a series of violent volcanic eruptions that threw material into the sky leading to a cooling. We will need more work to make sure this is true, but this is how science works; analyze effects to discern their causes and incorporate what you learn into a larger understanding.
The science is still evolving and new effects are being recognized and included. It may be that some of them will lower the predicted greenhouse driven rise while some will increase it. Meanwhile there are many things we can do that have multiple benefits. Going to 54 miles per gallon as the E.P.A. and the car companies agree can be done lowers our oil imports and reduces greenhouse gases. Switching from coal to gas to generate electricity eliminates a major harmful set of pollutants and improves health as well as reducing emissions. Improved efficiency can lower energy use in buildings, saving money and reducing emissions. It makes sense to do things that have economic benefits as well as potential climate benefits.
There is one place where the writers and I do agree. There are lots of uncertainties in the climate analysis and more investment in reducing those uncertainties is certainly warranted. Maybe we can at least get that done no matter who wins the next election.
Incidentally, The American Physical Society has started a Topical Group on the Physics of Climate. The authors can join in the discussion without resigning from the society, and perhaps learn a few things. Of course, polemical letters are more fun.

HEADLINE: The Great Mirage

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Nevada primary is on Saturday, but you don't hear much from the candidates about what's gone wrong economically in Las Vegas. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS - Before you write off Vegas, which looks like the American Dream in a pawn shop at 3 a.m., the irrepressible Oscar B. Goodman wants to make a case.
"We're opening up the new Mob museum later this month, and that's special, you know, because our heritage came from the Mob," says Goodman, who was three-term mayor of this town, until his wife, Carolyn, took over last year. Before that he was a Mob lawyer, who, upon entering politics, said it was unwise to call him after 5 p.m., because there was a good chance he'd be drunk.
Dare to dis Vegas, with its yellowed, tattered edges showing everywhere, its billboards for "discount bankruptcy" more ubiquitous than Wayne Newton signs, the urban face for a state with the nation's highest unemployment rate and percentage of homes in foreclosure, and you get a Goodman mouthful.
"Listen, I believe I could pass a polygraph test on this, but we have the best chefs in the world, and our sports bars are..." - you get the picture.

Once, in a galaxy far, far away, Time magazine put this everlighted desert outpost on its cover with the tag line: "Las Vegas - The New All-American City." There followed many years when Vegas was the nation's fastest-growing metropolis, adding 70,000 people a year, leading in job growth, its theme-tourism and casinos and multi-tiered service economy heralded as a role model for the rest of the country. 
Las Vegas, said the casino mogul Steve Wynn back in the mid-1990s, "represents all the things people in every city in America like." Of course, he also said one of his gaudy creations was "what God would have built if he had the money," which gives you some hint of his civic pride.
And so America became more like Vegas, casinos sprouting across the fruited plain, until every state in the nation but Hawaii and Utah had some form of legalized gambling, and national gross revenues exceeded $30 billion a year. Even Kansas got into the numbers racket. And as the low-paying service economy replaced jobs in manufacturing, those workers were hailed as the coal miners of a new era.
Except, those workers didn't make anything. And there's the flip side of Vegas as the template for the new American city: it represents casino capitalism at its worst. Home mortgages for all! Casinos in every neighborhood! No personal or corporate income tax! Developers get whatever they want! All hail the rich! It was supposed to defy nature, because everyone knows gambling is recession-proof.
Oops. The hangover is a doozy; almost five years and counting, unemployment is still in double digits, and thousands have left town, leaving mortgages behind with the furniture. As the late Hunter S. Thompson said, "For losers, Vegas is the meanest town on earth."
Now Vegas seems more like Pottersville, the dystopian city that replaced Bedford Falls in "It's a Wonderful Life." And who is Mr. Potter? Why, it's Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino tycoon who is almost single-handedly keeping Newt Gingrich in the presidential race, with a husband-and-wife $10 million donation to the toxic Gingrich super PAC. The Nevada variant of the Supreme Court's corporations-are-people era is an aging gambling king: Newt's sugar daddy, the ninth richest man in the world.
I exaggerate a bit about Vegas's hard times. The construction crane, known as the state bird, is not extinct, though it appears endangered. On Super Bowl Sunday, great rivers of money will gush through the windowless centers of sports betting here. Plus, I still have a soft spot for any city with the audacity to use fantasy projection as its architectural guide. 
Vegas is both an enduring American theme pasted to an arid hide - anything goes, at any time, clustered around The Strip, which is outside the city limits - and a valley of almost 2 million people trying to make a fresh go of it. 
What happened was, one ethos infected the other, and that became the wrong model. In allowing banks and Wall Street to place bets on any piece of paper tied to property - without much consequence for the bettors, as it turned out - the titans of free enterprise embraced casino capitalism. 
Now, with the presidential campaign in Nevada for a week, in advance of Saturday's first-in-the-West Republican caucus, you would think we'd be hearing much vigorous debate on what went wrong, here and everywhere that followed the model.
But no. I saw Mitt Romney give a stump speech in a warehouse stuffed with boxes of toilet paper. He never mentioned foreclosures, or how banks should behave, or why the educational system was so impoverished in a state where corporate barons ran free and most taxes came from gambling or retail sales. Gambling, remember, is the ultimate regressive tax. (I mean gaming - the euphemism of choice here).
When he spoke, Romney was within neon-illumination distance of both The Strip and a sea of foreclosures, and yet he talked about the economic implications of neither. Perhaps that's just as well. Romney's position - that the housing market should just be allowed to bottom out, the market grim reaper rolling through the red-tiled subdivisions - is not popular in Nevada. 
And the proposal that President Obama unveiled Wednesday, government aid for distressed homeowners seeking lower lending rates, is dead on arrival in Congress.
Obama got in trouble earlier when he tried to engage the mentality behind the go-go period. "When times are tough," he said in 2010, "you don't blow a bunch of cash on Vegas when you're trying to save for college."
Wrong. You blow the college fund, and then vote for lower taxes. At least, that seems to be one message I picked up from some Nevada Republicans. 
So we return to Oscar Goodman, who was furious at Obama's comments, but says the Republicans are skirting the real issues. Goodman is honest enough to admit his own political mistakes.
"I wasn't smart enough to see any of this coming," he said of the epic collapse of the Nevada economy. "A lot of folks didn't think you'd ever have to pay the piper."
Goodman is a self-professed independent, the fastest-growing political entity in the West. When I spoke to him, he was excited about one economic plus in town -- a new steakhouse and bar, Oscar's, named for the man who once represented Anthony "Tony the Ant" Spilotro, who inspired the character memorably played by Joe Pesci in "Casino." 
Ah, but even Oscar's is a bit of a mirage. Goodman doesn't own it or manage it, despite the bar's liberal use of his image and memorabilia. "They've licensed my persona," he says.

HEADLINE: Citing Overstated M.P.G., Owner of Civic Hybrid Wins Judgment Against Honda

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: A woman from Southern California won a judgment in small claims court against Honda for misrepresenting the fuel economy she could expect from her 2006 Civic Hybrid. 

 BODY:
5:09 p.m. | Updated 
"Maybe I am Don Quixote tilting at windmills," Heather Peters said Thursday in a telephone interview, a day after winning a $9,867 small-claims court judgment against American Honda for claimed fuel-economy deficiencies of her 2006 Civic Hybrid. "But I'm hoping that what I'm doing helps the little guy have a better chance at getting justice."
She may, however, have little time to savor her victory. Chris Martin, a spokesman at the automaker's headquarters in Torrance, Calif., said late Wednesday that an appeal would be filed.
Ms. Peters filed the small claims action late last year, contending her vehicle never achieved the fuel economy of 51 miles per gallon in highway and 46 m.p.g. in city driving that Honda promoted. "Honda promised me this car would get over 50 m.p.g. Instead I'm lucky to get 28 now," she said Thursday. "The advertising brochure said, 'Drive it like you would a normal Civic.' Now they say it takes special driving skills to achieve that mileage. I would have never bought it in the first place if they would have told me that."
Under a fuel-economy testing procedure no longer used by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Civic Hybrid scored as high as 51 m.p.g. highway. The agency, having revised its testing methods, rated the current Civic Hybrid at 44 m.p.g. city and highway. Although several class action lawsuits have been filed on behalf of disgruntled owners of the 2003-9 Civic Hybrid, Ms. Peters said she opted out of proposed settlements, saying they were insufficient.
In California's small claims courts, parties argue cases without formal legal representation. A plaintiff may sue for much as $10,000. The fact Ms. Peters was awarded $9,867 was an indication of the strength of her claim, she said.
Under the terms of an earlier settlement offer, Civic Hybrid owners who were willing to trade in their car could receive a $1,000 transferable discount coupon or a $1,500 nontransferable coupon toward a new, nonhybrid Honda or Acura. Class members who wanted to keep their hybrids were eligible for a $500 coupon, but the coupons could not be used toward the purchase of another Civic Hybrid, new or used. Honda also offered to provide a DVD of tips for achieving better fuel economy. A revised settlement, to be considered by a San Diego court next month, would add $100-200 cash payments, dependent on model year.
Nicholas E. Chimicles, of the firm Chimicles & Tikellis of Haverford, Pa., the lead attorneys in the class action, wrote in an e-mail Thursday that Mr. Peters's victory would not impact the class action. "Well over 30,000 class members have already submitted claim forms electing to participate in the settlement, indicating support for a settlement, which Ms. Peters herself described in a November 18, 2011, e-mail to class counsel as 'one of the best class action settlements I have ever seen,'" he wrote.
On the firm's Web site, the law firm estimates that the total value of the settlement to be "as high as $228 million." The firm claims that an additional 300,000 purchasers of Civic Hybrids from later model years could also be eligible to make claims.
Ms. Peters formerly practiced corporate law, but had allowed her license to lapse in recent years as she pursued other interests. She said she renewed her license Monday, in part so she could offer legal services to other Civic Hybrid owners who might want to follow her lead.
"I will give the necessary paperwork and forms to other owners who want to do what I did, with step-by-step instructions on how they can proceed," she said Thursday in a telephone interview. (Jalopnik, the automotive news Web site, also published a how-to guide for filing a small claims action against an automaker.) "The whole idea of taking this to small claims court is to give people a chance to have their day in court without having to hire a lawyer," she said.
Under California law, Honda has 30 days during which to appeal the judgment against the company. Unlike typical appeals, small claims matters may be challenged over the facts of the case and not just possible errors of law in a judge's ruling.
Also, in Superior Court, legal representation is allowed. Ms. Peters seemed undaunted.
"I'm confident that we will be able to put on an even stronger case this time," she said. "We have received additional information through our Web site, dontsettlewithhonda.org, including information from a Honda whistle-blower."
"I'm not afraid," she added.

HEADLINE: Food Aid, Aiding War

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new study suggests that receiving food aid from the United States increases the likelihood of civil conflict. 

 BODY:
Memo from the Department of Unintended Consequences: A new study suggests that receiving food aid from the United States increases the likelihood of civil conflict. The working paper is by Nathan Nunn, an economics professor at Harvard, and Nancy Qian, an economics professor at Yale. From the study's conclusion:
By exploiting year-to-year variation in wheat production in the United States, along with cross-country variation in a country's propensity to receive food aid from the United States, we show that, on average, food aid promotes civil conflict. An increase in U.S. food aid increases the incidence, onset and duration of armed civil conflicts in recipient countries. We show that our results are not a result of U.S. food aid crowding out aid from other countries. We also find that food aid has a more adverse effect on small-scale armed conflicts and in countries with a less developed transportation network. These findings support qualitative accounts of food aid either being stolen during transport or being taken from target populations by small armed groups that use the resources to fund conflict.

HEADLINE: The Price of Globalization: American Jobs

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: "We are accustomed to thinking of the left as having an internationalist perspective," writes Chrystia Freeland. "The irony today is that the real internationalists are no longer the bleeding-heart liberals, they are the cutthroat titans of capital." 

 BODY:
A new consensus is forming among some influential economists: global trade is not good for everyone - at least not equally. Factory workers who have seen their jobs exported to countries with cheaper laborers could have told them that, you say? But this is an important sea change, Chrystia Freeland writes in her latest Page Two column. Referring to a recent paper by David H. Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson, she says, we are not talking about protectionists.
Drawing on detailed data from local labor markets in the United States, the authors of the ''The China Syndrome'' argue that globalization, and in particular trade with China, is having a huge impact on blue-collar U.S. workers: ''Conservatively, it explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment.''
The deleterious effects go beyond those workers who lose their jobs. In communities hit by the China syndrome, wages fall - particularly, it turns out, outside the manufacturing sector - and some people stop looking for work. The result is ''a steep drop in the average earnings of households.'' Uncle Sam gets hit, too, especially in the form of increased disability payouts.
Chrystia says that Europe, and especially Germany, can teach the Americans a thing or two: "Germany has turned the China Syndrome to the benefit of both its chief executives and its blue-collar workers."
Do you agree? Have German workers fared better than their American counterparts in the age of globalization? What about other European workers? And what will austere budgets and cuts in the social welfare net mean for European workers going forward? Is America's problem, American policies rather than China? As one commenter noted in relation to this poston Rendezvous, "Your country is sick, and it didn't catch the disease from China."

HEADLINE: Evidence for Jellyfish Invasion Is Lacking, Study Says

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: There is insufficient data to support the common wisdom that jellyfish populations are exploding, researchers say. 

 BODY:
In 2009, a Japanese fishing boat capsized when its crew tried to haul in a net full of the gigantic Nomura jellyfish. That was just one of the grabber headlines from that year, when the 450-pound jellyfish species was clogging Japanese waters.
Over the last decade, reports of proliferating jellyfish have multiplied, as have fears that they are overrunning the world's oceans. Fisheries in Tunisia and Ireland have been disrupted, and power plants in Florida, Scotland, Japan and Israel have had to temporarily shut down when jellyfish clogged their cooling-water intake systems.
There has been plenty of finger-pointing, with many arguing that human activity is degrading the oceans and throwing off the delicate marine balance. Overfishing is feared to have carved out far more ecological space for jellyfish, and some have linked climate change and warming oceans to sudden explosions or blooms of jellyfish populations that once lay dormant.
Writing this week in Bioscience, however, scientists including Robert H. Condon, a researcher at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, argue that there simply isn't enough long-term data to conclude that global jellyfish numbers are on the rise.
This finding that previous conclusions were premature is the result of an international effort begun in 2010 by the Global Jellyfish Group to compile all of the available data on jellyfish populations. The new and growing database is known as the Jellyfish Database Initiative, or JEDI.
Dr. Condon said the story line that jellyfish were taking over the oceans started with a paper published in the journal Science in 2001 predicting a series of human-induced scourges on the world's oceans. The paper lacked hard evidence but was widely cited and quoted, he said.
A lack of information on jellyfish populations and the perceived novelty of the phenomenon contributed to making a jellyfish explosion seem like common wisdom in the years that followed.
Dr. Condon describes it as a classic case of shifting baselines: a lack of older data leads us to conclude that there is a new problem.
But studying trends in jellyfish numbers and the natural or human-induced drivers behind them is vital. Jellyfish have broad ecological and economic impacts. Growth in the numbers of venomous species in areas dependent on tourism can have devastating effects, for example, and high jellyfish biomass can be highly detrimental to certain fish stocks.
On the other hand, some jellyfish species like hydromedusa produce valuable products like fluorescent proteins used in medicine, and other species play crucial roles in sustaining healthy populations of sea turtles.
Unfortunately, studying jellyfish is notoriously difficult. Some small species are so delicate that they explode when touched, making netting them for population surveys more or less futile. They also have complicated and poorly understood life cycles, and some are quite dangerous to humans.
The good news is that data has been flooding into JEDI from around the world, and Dr. Condon is optimistic that useful analysis will soon be available. What is more, there is a new Web site, JellyWatch, where citizen scientists can report jellyfish sightings to help fill in the research gaps.

HEADLINE: What's at Stake in Friday's Jobs Report

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The economic pie is growing, but the share going to American workers is at an all-time low. Friday's jobs report will help determine whether American workers will finally start getting a bigger cut. 

 BODY:
7:57 p.m. | Updated The economic pie is growing, but the share going to American workers is at a record low. Friday's jobs report is expected to show that Americans are not on their way to getting a bigger cut. 
Much is at stake in the Labor Department report, which economists predict will reflect unemployment stagnating at 8.5 percent in January. Lackluster job growth could bolster the Republican argument that President Obama's economic policies are leaving American workers behind.
The economy has been growing now for 10 straight quarters. It has even made up the ground lost from the recession, and the United States now churns out more goods and services than it did before the downturn began in 2007. But that output is being produced with six million fewer workers, despite population growth.
As a result, the share of income produced in the country that is flowing to workers' bank accounts has been steadily shrinking.
Of every dollar of income earned in the United States in the third quarter of 2011 - the latest period for which data is available - just 44 cents went to workers' wages and salaries. That is the smallest share since the government began keeping track in 1947, according to the Commerce Department, and it continues a trend that predates the Great Recession. The average share of national income going to wages, salaries and benefits (like health insurance) over the last 50 years has been about 57.6 cents on the dollar.

If you include workers' benefits in the calculation for the third quarter, the share of national income received by workers rises to 54.5 percent. But that measure is also at its lowest level since 1955. 
On the other hand, American businesses are doing extremely well.
Tepid job growth, stagnant wages for existing employees and growing international demand for American products have all helped corporate profit margins reach all-time highs, according to two different measures from the Department of Commerce and from earnings per share in the S.&P. 500.
As a result, it is primarily corporations and their shareholders, rather than workers, who are benefiting from the American recovery.
Of every dollar in income earned in the United States, more than 10 cents goes to corporations. That's up from 7.3 cents per dollar of income when the recession began at the end of 2007.
The economy is not a zero-sum game; when the overall economic pie grows, the size of each slice can become bigger too. That means corporate gains and worker gains can be complementary, and in the United States they usually are. After all, companies need workers to help them make all the stuff that earns them profits.
What is happening, though, is that many companies are sitting on their cash or investing it in capital equipment rather than investing it in new workers.
This trend cannot go on forever, of course; there are only so many additional goods and services that can be squeezed out of an existing work force, even with new technologies that make workers more productive.
The question is how long it will take for companies to pick up the pace of hiring and raising wages, and by extension - though not for altruistic reasons - help workers get a bigger share of the pie.
Friday's report on hiring in January should provide some enlightenment on this question.
The nation has had a net gain in jobs for 15 consecutive months - or five quarters, exactly half as long as it has been expanding its output. In those 15 months, the country has averaged a net gain of 137,000 jobs a month. That is about the number needed just to keep up with population growth.
It is also almost exactly the number that economists expect Friday's report to show for January. The median forecast is 135,000 jobs, compared with 200,000 jobs added in December.
If the forecasts are accurate, then, in January the nation's employers did nothing to shrink the backlog of unemployed workers. And if so, they did nothing to narrow the gap between the recovery gains going to labor and those going to the corporate sector.
An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to the share of national income that has come to about 57.6 cents on the dollar, on average, over the last 50 years. It is wages, salaries and benefits (like health insurance), not wages and salaries alone.

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank Profit Falls on European Debt Crisis

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: Deutsche Bank said its net profit plunged in the fourth quarter after the European sovereign debt crisis led to a decline in revenue in its investment banking division. 

 BODY:
6:38 p.m. | Updated 
FRANKFURT - Deutsche Bank, the largest German bank, said on Thursday that its net profit plunged in the fourth quarter after the European sovereign debt crisis and turmoil in financial markets led to a loss in the investment banking division.
The results, which were also pulled down by costs related to legal action against the bank, highlight the challenges awaiting the successors of Josef Ackermann, who will retire as chief executive in May. He will be succeeded by Anshu Jain, head of the investment bank, and Jurgen Fitschen, head of regional management worldwide, who will share chief executive duties. Deutsche Bank's net profit fell 69 percent, to 186 million euros, or $244 million, from October through December compared with the fourth quarter of 2010, a drop worse than analysts had expected. The investment banking division reported a pretax loss of 138 million euros after a profit of 719 million euros a year earlier.
Mr. Ackermann acknowledged that the glory days of investment banking, which in the past generated most of the bank's profits, were probably over for now. But he insisted that Deutsche Bank, which is based in here, could continue to grow by taking business from rivals.
"Although the entire pie is likely to be smaller in the future," he said at a news conference, "Deutsche Bank will be able to handle a larger slice."
Profit also was hurt by a loss of 373 million euros related to Deutsche Bank's exposure to Greek bonds, and a 655 million euro loss related to lawsuits, including one brought by the United States government.
Mr. Ackermann said that the bank booked more losses in the most recent quarter than necessary so it would leave the new chief executives with a clean slate. He said that was his "going-away present" to his successors.
Besides confronting the debt crisis and its effect on trading and deal making, Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen must address legal attacks in Germany and the United States that have hurt the bank's reputation; they were the subject this week of a cover article in Der Spiegel, a widely read German magazine.
On Tuesday, a regional court in Frankfurt ordered Deutsche Bank to pay 15 million euros in damages to the German travel company Schauinsland-Reisen. The company's suit claimed the bank did not provide adequate advice on a derivative it sold to hedge currency risks, Bloomberg News reported.
The lawsuit by the United States government accuses Deutsche Bank of lying about the quality of home loans it handled under a government program. The United States is demanding that the bank repay hundreds of millions of dollars of losses on those loans.
Mr. Ackermann denied that the bank's reputation had suffered, and presented opinion surveys showing that the bank was better regarded than its peers. He suggested that some of the legal actions against the bank reflected sour grapes on the part of investors.
"Everyone who has lost money tries to get it back," Mr. Ackermann said. But he also conceded, without being specific, "We did things that in retrospect should be seen critically."
While Mr. Ackermann held center stage at the news conference, which attracted several hundred journalists, Mr. Jain began to emerge as a more public figure. He answered several questions, speaking English in contrast to Mr. Ackermann, who spoke mostly German. Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen, the other soon-to-be co-chief executive, mingled with journalists afterward, though Mr. Jain drew a larger crowd.
He said there was "no substance" to reports that he and Mr. Ackermann had become estranged, and gave his predecessor some of the credit for turning Deutsche Bank into a force to be reckoned with in investment banking.
"Joe and I have had a very close working relationship for 10 years," Mr. Jain said. "He has supported everything we have done."
In Germany there is widespread skepticism about whether Mr. Jain is the right person to lead Deutsche Bank when it is trying to reduce its dependence on the boom or bust profits of investment banking. The unit that includes the bank's retail branches in Germany made a fourth-quarter profit of 227 million euros, the bank said, an increase of 5 million euros from the period a year earlier.
Mr. Fitschen, who oversees the German unit of Deutsche Bank, is expected to concentrate on expanding services to consumers and businesses.
In addition, Paul Achleitner, chief financial officer of the German insurer Allianz, will become chairman of the supervisory board. Typically German supervisory board chairmen are elder statesmen who play a discreet role. But at 55, Mr. Achleitner, former head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, is in his professional prime and is expected to be an active overseer.
As a result, there is concern that the bank will lack one leader with undisputed authority. Mr. Ackermann defended the arrangement, saying, "We found a solution that covers the needs of the bank well."

HEADLINE: Citibank Tries a New Approach to Small-Business Lending

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The bank will provide most of the capital but the funds will actually be dispersed by a small-business advisory firm. 

 BODY:
The big United States banks have come under withering criticism for not lending enough to small businesses, but this week brings word that Citigroup, the parent of Citibank, will participate in a novel program to steer capital to small businesses that have an especially hard time getting it: those located in economically distressed areas. What's novel about the program is that while Citigroup will provide most of the capital, it will not disburse it. Instead, it will rely on Next Street, a self-described "merchant bank," to underwrite loans to businesses that Next Street deems capable of rapid growth. If the initiative succeeds, it could serve as a model for similar programs around the country.
Next Street, with offices in Boston and New York, helps arrange financing for small-business clients, often from third-party sources, while at the same time providing the sort of tactical and strategic advice normally beyond the reach of those companies - particularly businesses based in what are politely described in community development circles as low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The newly formed Next Street Opportunity Fund will loan $30 million to established businesses in such communities.
To qualify for a loan, companies will have to have between $3 million and $60 million in annual revenue and a history of at least five or seven years. Individual loans will range from about $1.5 to $2 million and carry terms of five to seven years, at interest rates "comparable to a traditional loan with commensurate risk," said Tim Ferguson, a Next Street co-founder and partner.
At the same time, borrowers will be expected to retain Next Street as a consultant, if they haven't already. "Small businesses need access to high-level strategic advice, and we would argue that the strategic advisory piece is as important as the capital," said Ronald L. Walker, Mr. Ferguson's partner. "The advice mitigates the risk." The monthly fee for that advice ranges from $5,000 to $25,000.
That's one distinction between an Opportunity Fund loan and a conventional loan. Another is the purpose of the financing. Mr. Ferguson said that when banks offer traditional forms of capital, like lines of credit and term loans, it is "based on past performance, not growth. They're not offered growth capital, from capital markets." Next Street, by contrast, will pursue ambitious targets for Opportunity Fund borrowers. "We do expect these companies to double in size," Mr. Walker said. "We're talking about sustained growth over three to five years. And that's top-line as well as bottom-line growth."
Under the terms of the deal, Next Street is essentially borrowing the money for the fund from its investors, led by Citigroup, which is providing $25 million, and will then re-loan the money to its clients. Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit organization that supports affordable housing in 30 cities across the country, will contribute $2.5 million. The remainder will come from wealthy investors.
The Citigroup official overseeing the bank's investment, Andy Ditton, conceded that the fund's prospective borrowers were a difficult market for the institution to reach on its own, in part because traditional banking is not conducive for financing strong growth. But more than that, "I don't think the kind of businesses they'll be lending to are the kinds of businesses any bank will lend to," he said. "The businesses they're lending to are struggling, and they're struggling because of their business strategy.
"The only way you can grow that business is to do the consulting, working with management for contract expansion and new relationships," said Mr. Ditton, who helps manage Citigroup's program for investing in disadvantaged neighborhoods, which is required under the Community Reinvestment Act. "And that's not the role a traditional banker would play. A bank lends money - it's not a series of management consultants, let alone Web page designers and that sort of people. It's better for us to use people who have that expertise already rather than us trying to develop it."
Half of the businesses working with Next Street are owned by women or minorities - the population that finds it hardest to get any kind of credit at all, said John Taylor, president and chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which advocates for banking services in disadvantaged communities.
Mr. Taylor said that the aspect of the collaboration that is most appealing about the Opportunity Fund is that "they're providing growth capital without taking an equity position. There are VCs out there who'll give you money, but they'll take your fist born. You're giving out the wealth of your business."
But, Mr. Taylor added, the value of Next Street's efforts would hinge on whether the fee structure is fair and whether the technical assistance provided is truly useful. "If both of these things are true, it's wonderful," he said, "because there is really a dearth of access to small business credit in general, particularly equity-type credit, and particularly for people of color and women."
Next Street's founding partners said neither concern was warranted. "Our fees are always commensurate not only with the work that we do, but the opportunity in the business," said Mr. Ferguson. And notwithstanding the minimum revenue and age requirements for borrowing businesses, in practice, he said, "most will be $10 to $20 million in revenue, will have been in business for 10 to 15 years. And they have the capacity to absorb the fees."
To questions about the quality of Next Street's advice, Mr. Ferguson said, "we wouldn't have worked with over 100 small businesses if we weren't adding value to these enterprises."
The Next Street partners, and their backers, described the Opportunity Fund as a pilot project with rapid growth potential of its own. "The perception is that the risk in the inner city markets for these type of small businesses is much greater than in the broader business lending marketplace," Mr. Ferguson said. "But what we've found from the limited amount of data that we can see, and from our own experience, is that the default rate is much lower than for the broader corporate marketplace. This pilot, if successful, will have people recognize that there is an opportunity to lend to these types of businesses, provided they couple it with the sort of advisory services that we're talking about."
Mr. Walker added that there are more than 25,000 similarly situated businesses in the country's largest inner cities that could potentially take advantage of this type of financing. "Next Street's model has always been that there's a need for this model nationally," he said. "This is a national opportunity."
Citigroup's Mr. Ditton agreed. And he said that if the project succeeds, other organizations would likely begin pairing strategic consulting with financing, and that the bank would be open to supporting those efforts as well. "Our hope is that this $25 million is going to go out the door very quickly and show that there's real interest in this, and that the companies they're targeting will accept the help and the advice that Next Street is providing them and use the capital to grow and expand," he said. "If that all plays out, we hope to expand this to hundreds of millions of dollars nationally."

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Dial Down TV Advertising

BYLINE: BRUCE JAPSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Pharmaceutical companies have cut spending on television advertising by 20 percent over the last five years, according to a Nielsen study. Analysts expect drug advertising to continue to fall as more brand-name drugs face generic competition. 

 BODY:
Spending on the advertising of brand-name prescription drugs on television -- which not long ago was a fast-growing marketing venue for the pharmaceutical industry in the United States -- has dropped more than 20 percent in the last five years.
According to new figures from Nielsen, spending on television advertising fell 23 percent to $2.4 billion from the beginning of 2007 to the end of last year. Spending in 2011 dropped 2 percent from 2010, and last year was the fourth consecutive year that such spending fell. Drug companies in the United States spent more than $3.1 billion on advertising pharmaceuticals on television in 2007, Nielsen said.
The decline is in sharp contrast to the decade-long drug-industry advertising spree that began in 1997, when the Food and Drug Administration loosened its regulations and allowed direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs on TV.
Some industry analysts attribute part of the decline to controversy over such ads. Employers and health insurance companies have long complained that TV ads drive consumers to the latest, often most expensive, pills. And doctors complain that their patients often pressure them into prescribing these heavily advertised drugs.
Perhaps the most well-known criticism of TV advertising of pharmaceuticals arose in 2004 when Merck withdrew the once heavily advertised painkiller Vioxx after studies showed it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
Such controversies have led to greater scrutiny of drug ads by the F.D.A. as well as by doctor groups like the American Medical Association.
Analysts say spending on brand-name drug ads on television could deteriorate further because of generic competition to some top-selling drugs that have been widely advertised, like Pfizer's Lipitor for cholesterol.
From 2011 to the end of 2015, more than $100 billion of brand-name drug sales will be exposed to generic competition, IMS Health said.
Pharmacies and health insurance companies offer incentives to patients with drug coverage to choose cheaper generics over brand-name drugs, limiting the power of television advertising.
This week, Pfizer said fourth-quarter sales of its Lipitor fell more than 40 percent in the United States, where the drug lost patent protection in late November.
Though Nielsen said the $156 million Pfizer spent on TV ads for Lipitor last year was more than the amount spent on any other branded prescription drug, the figure was down 14 percent from the Lipitor advertising in 2010.
Pfizer just entered the third month of a 180-day period of market exclusivity in which Lipitor is competing against just two generic versions, so it has continued to advertise on TV. But the company said it has not yet decided to make a long-term commitment to advertising Lipitor on television after that.
"We will continue to listen to patients over time and adjust our plans for Lipitor, including advertising, as needed to determine how we can continue to best meet the needs of patients," said a Pfizer spokesman, MacKay Jimeson.

HEADLINE: Progress on Letting Big Banks Fail

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has taken some good first steps to regulating the biggest banks, and what's more, it's doing so in public, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The drafters of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law got an important thing right. Despite fierce pushback from the banks - and lackluster support from the White House at critical moments - the legislators communicated a key new intent: megabanks must be able to fail, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation should be in charge of that liquidation process.
The F.D.I.C. was an inspired choice for this role, because it is less captivated by the "magic" of Wall Street and less captured by its money and influence than any other group of officials. 
The F.D.I.C. has also long been in the business of shutting down banks while limiting the damage to taxpayers, although it did not previously have complete jurisdiction over the largest banks when they got into trouble. It could only deal with those parts that had federally insured "retail" deposits, and this turns out not to be where the biggest problems have occurred in recent times.
Charged with this mandate involving the too-big-to-fail banks and with the difficult task of potentially shutting one or more of them without disrupting the economy, the F.D.I.C. took the remarkable step of opening up its decision-making process.

By creating a Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee of informed outsiders and by Webcasting the deliberations of that group, the agency has brought perhaps an unprecedented degree of transparency to public policy for banks - a point made forcefully by Dennis Kelleher; his blog at Better Markets is a must-read for anyone who cares about financial regulatory reforms. (Disclosure: I'm a member of the committee, an unpaid position.)
Committee members hold a wide range of views. Some are quite sympathetic to our existing financial structures, some much more skeptical. You can look over the list and make up your own mind as to who is on which side, and you might want to review the recording of the Jan. 25 meeting. 
There is no question that the senior leadership of the F.D.I.C. is paying attention to the committee - and at the meetings, key people are put on the spot to discuss all relevant details with well-informed committee members, who can ask a lot of follow-up questions.
It is inconceivable that any other part of our financial regulatory apparatus will ever open itself up in the same way - for example, the Federal Reserve (in both Washington and New York), the Treasury Department and the Federal Stability Oversight Council are likely to be forever opaque. They, too, should open themselves up in public to tough cross-examination by experts, but that goes directly against their aloof and perhaps arrogant culture.
The history of American public administration is littered with examples of policy gone wrong - and actions misdirected - because informed and well-meaning critics were kept at arm's length. Information is withheld even from other agencies. Powerful special interests work their influence; the rest of society has no effective voice. Even the most energetic Congressional oversight is unlikely to work when expert critics are kept so far from the real policy action.
Within the financial sphere, if the F.D.I.C. really manages to convince the markets that big banks can and will fail - meaning that creditors face the genuine prospect of losses - that changes everything. 
Once this kind of failure is a realistic option, there is more pressure for meaningful supervision, because no one wants to be the supervisor in charge when a huge financial institution goes out of business. As was the case with the Lehman bankruptcy examiner report, when a company fails, we really learn who was asleep at which switch.
Are the markets now persuaded that too-big-to-fail is really over? Not yet. As Peter Fisher of BlackRock pointed out at the meeting of the Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee, we should watch for investors demanding a higher return as compensation for the higher risk of actual failure. In other words, the interest rate at which big banks borrow would need to increase - for their holding companies, their operating subsidiaries or both.
The threat of failure for megabanks will be credible only when the F.D.I.C. can convincingly put a firewall around the losses. We need creditors to a collapsing bank to lose the value of their loans - for example, those who have lent to the bank holding company may have some part of their exposure written down and the rest converted to equity.
At the same time, there needs to be a convincing fence, in the sense that one failing megabank must not be able to bring down the rest of the financial system. The threat of liquidation for any big company will be credible only if the damage can be limited to people with direct exposure - otherwise someone at the highest level of government, presumably with the approval of the president, will override all plans and provide a backdoor bailout. 
There is always a back door; the point is to make it politically unappealing and economically unnecessary to use it. 
The recent failure of MF Global demonstrates that this is entirely possible. Jon Corzine must be one of the best-connected people in the country - few Wall Street financiers are as close to this administration's power brokers. He placed big bets as if he were still running Goldman Sachs, but MF Global was only about one-twentieth the size. 
People who trusted MF Global lost money (and there may have been fraud, which is a different matter and is, one hopes, subject to proper law enforcement action). But the spillover damage to the rest of the financial system was minimal. When Mr. Corzine's bets went bad, a bailout was not discussed. 
The F.D.I.C. is moving in the right direction, although there is much to do before big banks can be treated like MF Global. 
Banks must be required to have a financing and legal structure within which losses can be imposed while also allowing for an orderly wind-down of the business. New management and a new board must be brought in under intense time pressure. The failure of an international bank needs ex ante cooperation agreements with other countries, particularly Britain. 
Still, in a complex financial system with powerful special interests and myriad global risks, not all of which can be readily quantified, the F.D.I.C. is moving closer to a clear statement of the problem and, at a very granular level, what needs to be done. This is progress.

Yes, we all know he is Facebook's twenty-something visionary founder, as well as the person who has led Facebook to a potential market value of $75 billion to $100 billion. But there is another reason an investment in Facebook is really an investment in Mr. Zuckerberg: Facebook's offering documents show he will retain control over Facebook even when it becomes one of America's largest publicly traded companies. 
Mr. Zuckerberg's control is based on the structure of Facebook's shares. Facebook is proposing to go public with a dual-class share structure. Public shareholders will purchase Class A shares that have one vote apiece. Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook employees and current Facebook investors will hold Class B shares, which have 10 votes apiece. This is a deviation from the one share one vote norm followed by most publicly traded companies. 
 Eight years after the company's founding, Mr. Zuckerberg has retained a remarkable percentage of Facebook's ownership -- he currently owns 28.4 percent of the Class B shares.
This alone does not give Mr. Zuckerberg total control over Facebook.
He has also entered into voting agreements with other Class B shareholders, including shares held by the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Facebook's first president, Sean Parker. These agreements give Mr. Zuckerberg voting control over an additional 30.6 percent of the Class B shares. Mr. Zuckerberg even retains control over about half of these shares if he decides to leave Facebook. Post-I.P.O., he will control at least 57.1 percent of the Class B shares, potentially more if some investors sell their B shares in the offering. This will give him complete voting control over the company. 
Mr. Zuckerberg's consent will be required if the company is sold. Unlike most public companies, Facebook will not have a nominating committee for its directors comprising the independent directors on Facebook's board. Instead, all of the directors will be selected by the board itself, a group that will be appointed by Mr. Zuckerberg. He can also remove and replace any director at any time. 
Nor is this going to change any time soon. 
Facebook's organizing documents dictate that when Class B shares are transferred, they typically will convert into the low-vote Class A shares. It is likely that, over time, Mr. Zuckerberg will hold onto the bulk of his Class B shares as other holders of Class B shares sell off their stakes. 
This is the rub of the dual-class shares. 
Mr. Zuckerberg can also sell down his shares. But until the Class B shares comprise less than 9.1 percent of the outstanding Facebook shares, the holders of the Class B shares control Facebook. 
Given this low threshold, Mr. Zuckerberg, 27, is likely to have enough Class B shares to give him control of the company for a long, long time, despite the fact that he will have a much smaller economic stake. In fact, other shareholders are more likely to sell their Class B shares more quickly than Mr. Zuckerberg, who appears to want to manage Facebook for the long-term. 
As a result, his control over Facebook could increase over time. 
Mr. Zuckerberg is not alone in using this type of structure to maintain ownership of a prominent technology company. The founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, set up a similar structure and retain voting control over Google. 
Yet they are two people who counterbalance each other, not a single individual. 
Three other prominent company founders, Andrew Mason at Groupon, Mark Pincus at Zynga and Reid Hoffman at LinkedIn, have also adopted similar dual-class voting structures at their companies. At the time of those public offerings last year, Mr. Mason controlled 19.7 percent of the votes at Groupon, Mr. Pincus controlled 37.4 percent of the votes at Zynga and Mr. Hoffman controlled 21.7 percent of the votes at LinkedIn. 
These companies, however, are much smaller than Facebook. And while their stakes are sizable, they do not entitle any of the three founders to remove and replace directors at will. 
Even Bill Gates had less than 50 percent control over Microsoft at the time of its I.P.O. -- he owned 49 percent of the company. Since he did not own dual-class shares, any sales by him were sure to reduce his controlling interest. 
Mr. Zuckerberg thus stands alone in exercising this degree of control over a very public technology company. As DealBook's Evelyn M. Rusli and Peter Eavis have reported, Facebook could be valued more richly than Amazon, Kraft Foods and Goldman Sachs. 
In essence, Mr. Zuckerberg has created an empire that he will continue to rule. 
This is not necessarily a bad thing. He is young, but he has already accomplished more than most of us will in our lives. He is the guiding force behind Facebook. 
Mr. Zuckerberg had the foresight to obtain these voting agreements, arrangements which now ensure he will control the company for a substantial amount of time. By maintaining control, Mr. Zuckerberg no doubt hopes to continue to implement his vision free from intrusive shareholder influence. He is about to get his wish. 
As for the public, whether they buy Facebook shares boils down to whether they believe in Mr. Zuckerberg and the control he will wield.

HEADLINE: Lax Oversight Blamed in Demise of MF Global

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: A House panel faulted risk oversight by some ratings agencies and MF Global's chief risk officer for the firm's demise. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Congress delved deeper into the downfall of MF Global on Thursday, accusing the rating agencies and one of the firm's chief risk officers of failing to sound alarms.
 At the hearing, the fourth Congressional forum to focus on MF Global, lawmakers homed in on the firm's risky purchases of European sovereign debt and the crisis of confidence that ultimately led to the brokerage's demise and the mysterious disappearance of some $1.2 billion in customer money.
Lawmakers questioned executives with the ratings services Standard & Poor's and Moody's, raising concerns about MF Global's European bets only in the firm's final days. The executives portrayed their ratings as prudent, faulting MF Global for obscuring its holdings.
"I was about to give you guys credit for actually being on top of this or in front of it, and now I'm not so sure," said Representative Michael E. Capuano, Democrat of Massachusetts, after a testy exchange with the two executives at the rating agencies.
The oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee also heard from Michael Roseman, a former chief risk officer at MF Global, who warned about the danger of the European bets in 2010. His successor, Michael Stockman, who took over after Mr. Roseman repeatedly clashed with the firm's top executives, was slower to respond, expressing worries only three months before the bankruptcy last year.
"We did our job during this period," a defiant Mr. Stockman told the House panel. "In my view, the board and senior management were highly sophisticated; they knew and understood how the" European debt bets worked.
But his defense was not received well. While the positions were the idea of Jon S. Corzine, the firm's chief executive and a former United States senator from New Jersey, lawmakers noted that it was up to the risk chief to rein in their boss's risk-taking.
 "You were not a lowly clerk," Representative Bill Posey, Republican of Florida, told Mr. Stockman.
 The committee plans to deliver a report on the causes and consequences from MF Global's collapse later this year.
 In his bet, Mr. Corzine, a former bond trader, wagered that Europe would not let nations like Ireland and Spain default. But concerns within MF Global began to emerge in the fall of 2010.
 Mr. Roseman spoke up in September 2010 when the bond positions jumped to $2 billion. Two months later, with the positions at nearly $4 billion, Mr. Roseman outlined the risks to the board. The directors sided with Mr. Corzine.
 Around the same time, MF Global began searching for a new risk officer. In January 2011, MF Global hired Mr. Stockman, who like Mr. Corzine, once worked at Goldman.
"For the first several months of my tenure, based on analyses performed by my department, I believed that the risk profile associated with the company's European sovereign debt position was acceptable in light of then-prevailing market conditions," said Mr. Stockman.
By July - with the positions swelling to more than $6 billion and Europe's debt crisis dragging on - Mr. Stockman changed his stance. "As credit markets deteriorated in the summer of 2011, I came to the view that it would be prudent for the company to mitigate the increased risks," Mr. Stockman said.
While the board eventually heeded Mr. Stockman's concern, it was too late. Moody's downgraded MF Global's credit rating on Oct. 24, and within a week, the firm was in bankruptcy.
Mr. Posey said it appeared that "Mr. Stockman was hired to tell Mr. Corzine what he wanted to hear." Another lawmaker called him a "yes man," a notion that Mr. Stockman disputed.
Lawmakers also criticized the rating agencies for their slow response to the company's European positions. For example, S.&P. did not downgrade MF Global to junk status until the day of its bankruptcy.
Richard Cantor, chief credit officer for Moody's, said his company did not act sooner because MF Global was not forthcoming about its exposure to European bonds until October.
 But Representative Randy Neugebauer, the Texas Republican who leads the House panel, waved a public filing from MF Global that disclosed the European bet in May 2011. Mr. Neugebauer questioned why the disclosure did not raise red flags at Moody's. By October, it was also reported in the media that regulators ordered MF Global to set aside additional capital to support the European trades.
 "How do you explain that?" Mr. Neugebauer asked. "Do your analysts read financial newspapers?"
 Not everyone was slow to downgrade MF Global. James H. Gellert, the chief executive of Rapid Ratings, which unlike its competitors is paid by investors rather than the companies it rates, had a more negative outlook on MF Global for two years. "We saw significant warning signs across the board," Mr. Gellert said.
 Internally, MF Global was aware of its precarious position should market sentiment turn. The firm had produced an emergency plan just weeks before its demise, if the ratings agencies downgraded MF Global to junk.
In such a case, the company estimated, the stock price would plummet and liquidity demands would mount, but "we remain solvent - are able to manage liquidity through stress period as we reposition our business and stabilize our financing lines."
With the benefit of hindsight, the plan, which was cited at the hearing, now seems hollow.
Three months after the collapse, customers have little recourse to get their money back. The case has highlighted the light regulatory touch that the industry has enjoyed over the years, offering little in the way of formal protection for customer funds.
 Responding to that void, the CME Group, the for-profit exchange where MF Global conducted much of its business, said Thursday that it would start an insurance plan for farmers and ranchers that would cover up to $100 million in losses suffered in the event of another bankruptcy by a firm that trades with it.
 But the plan, which does not cover losses sustained from the collapse of MF Global, is largely symbolic. Farmers and ranchers make up a small but highly visible part of the futures market. At the same time, the CME Group, a futures industry's regulator, has faced criticism for the way it handled MF Global.
 Still, many in the industry are hopeful the CME's move will prompt more change to protect customers, like those now in place in the securities markets.
"It's real enough for the farmers and ranchers, but I think it's clear that part of the symbolism is public relations to contain some of the fallout," said J. Samuel Tenenbaum, director of the Investor Protection Center at Northwestern University of Law. "But they clearly know something has to be done."

HEADLINE: What Else Does the Bible Teach About Capitalism?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A rabbi, writing in The Wall Street Journal, argues that the Bible is pro-capitalist. But there are plenty of anti-free-market and anti-capitalist ideas in the Scriptures, too. 

 BODY:
Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal published an opinion article by Rabbi Aryeh Spero titled "What the Bible Teaches About Capitalism," which argued that Americans should laud Mitt Romney's private equity career.
An outline of his reasoning: The United States was founded upon "the Judeo-Christian ethos," and within that ethos "resides a ringing endorsement of capitalism as a moral endeavor."
The Bible and related Judaic-Christian teaching are pro-capitalist, he argues, because God's people are told to work and encouraged to be creative (which could be read as entrepreneurial), and because the Tenth Commandment forbids envy (including envy of the 1 percent). Additionally, Rabbi Spero notes, "King Solomon's thriving kingdom crashed once his son decided to impose onerous taxes."
Whatever capitalism's merits, I'm not sure hanging its moral legitimacy on Jewish Scripture is such a solid plan. The Holy Book also conveys plenty of ideas that are anti-capitalist and anti-free-market.
Deuteronomy 23:19, for example, orders: "Do not charge your brother interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest." "Foreigners" can be charged interest, however. Exactly who counts as a foreigner has fueled centuries of debate, and at least one Shakespearean play. (That play, "The Merchant of Venice" was home to the line "The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose," by the way.)
Additionally, a biblical prohibition against "taking advantage" of the person on the other side of a sale was interpretedby ancient rabbis to mean that sellers were permitted a profit margin that was no greater than one-sixth of a good's selling price. Any markup beyond that had to be returned to the buyer.
That restriction might not go over very well in private equity circles.

HEADLINE: The War on Organized Labor

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Mitch Daniels signed a bill making Indiana another "right to work" state. 

 BODY:
You have to admit that the Republican Party is organized, methodical and persistent - especially if you're a Democrat, because your party is pretty much the opposite.
Slowly but surely, across the country, Republican governors and state legislatures are making progress in their war against labor unions, especially ones that represent public employees. Just yesterday, there was bad news from two states.
In Indiana, Gov. Mitch Daniels signed a bill making Indiana another "right to work" state, which is one of those slogans, like "pro-life" and "family values," that sounds unobjectionable, but isn't. That law is relatively simple: It prohibits labor contracts from requiring workers to pay union dues. The spin is that this is better for everyone. The truth is that it is not only bad for labor but also bad for the economy.

Unions will reduce a company's profits somewhat, because they get higher wages for workers. But economists have found that unionization has a minimal impact on growth and employment. Six of the 10 states with the highest unemployment have right-to-work laws in place. North Carolina, which has the lowest unionization rate in the country, 1.8 percent, also has the sixth highest unemployment, 10 percent.
In 2010, wages of workers in unionized manufacturing companies in Indiana were 16 percent higher than in non-union plants. One Harvard study, published this summer in American Sociological Review, concluded that the decline in unionization since the 1970s is responsible for one-fifth of the increase in hourly wage inequality among women, and one-third among men.
The other bit of news on Wednesday came from Arizona, where Republican lawmakers are pushing a bill that would ban collective bargaining for public-sector employees.
They are mimicking a similar - and I think ultimately unconstitutional - law in Wisconsin, which pioneered the idea of singling out the people who work for their government and denying them the right to collective bargaining.
There has been a backlash. Opponents of the bill in Wisconsin have managed to recall two state senators who worked on it, and they have their sights on Gov. Scott Walker. Last November, Ohio voters overturned a bill that would have stripped most public employees of their right to collective bargaining.
The Republicans are not just waging an anti-union campaign, but an anti-government campaign as well. Right-wingers believe government is the cause of all things bad in the economy and in society, and are willing to sacrifice those who toil in the public interest in their effort to hobble it.
Proponents of the anti-union laws have told me it's reprehensible for public employees to negotiate over wages, benefits and working conditions when their employer is the government to which we all pay taxes. When I ask, how is that different from negotiating with any employer, the answer I generally get is "it just is."
Unions have over-reached in many ways, clinging to wage-and-benefits agreements that are simply untenable in today's economy. But they are fundamental to maintaining fairness for workers. And governors in many states, including New York, have managed to get concessions from public employee unions without outlawing them.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times
The campaign filings of "super PACs," the political groups that burst onto the scene after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, reveal an assortment of donors spending millions of dollars largely to support Republican candidates, most notably Mitt Romney, write Nicholas Confessore and Michael Luo. The filings also reveal the degree of secrecy that these PACs can offer to donors.
A day after Mr. Romney's decisive win in Florida, the Republican nominating contest left one economically battered state on and moved to another, Nevada, a place that Adam Nagourney and Jennifer Medina describe as transformed into a major battleground by the economic downturn and the rise of the Tea Party. The state's caucuses are on Saturday.
As President Obama introduced a package of housing proposals in Virginia on Wednesday, he traded jabs with Mr. Romney, his foremost rival for the White House, offering a preview of their general election arguments if Mr. Romney secures the Republican presidential nomination, Mark Landler reports.
From Capitol Hill to the campaign trail, Republicans have seized on Mr. Obama's decision to reject for now the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline. Jennifer Steinhauer writes that in an election year, the issue gives Republicans an issue that is easy to explain to voters and that touches on voters' economic concerns.
The Senate's swift movement on a bill that would ban insider trading among members of Congress has been stymied by lawmakers' attempts to strengthen, weaken, or broaden the legislation by attaching amendments, a development that demonstrates how difficult it is to get even a popular bill through Congress, Robert Pear writes.
Happening in Washington
At 8 a.m., President Obama will speak at the National Prayer Breakfast. The guests include Michelle Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Economic data expected this morning include fourth-quarter productivity data and weekly jobless claims at 8:30, followed at 10 by weekly mortgage rates.
On Capitol Hill, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will testify at 9 before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about a controversial gun trafficking investigation known as Operation Fast and Furious.
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will address the economic outlook and the federal budget situation at a hearing of the House Budget Committee that starts at 10.
At the same time, Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, will appear before the House Permanent Select Committee to discuss national security threats to the United States.

HEADLINE: At Prayer Breakfast, Obama Ties Economic Message to Christian Values

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: Speaking at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, President Obama on Thursday sought to link Christian values to his recent message of economic justice for the middle class. 

 BODY:
President Obama, speaking Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast, sought to link his recent message of economic justice for the middle class to Christian values.
Referring to his call for the wealthy, including him, to pay more taxes, Mr. Obama said, "For me as a Christian, it also coincides with Jesus's teaching that, 'for unto to whom much is given, much shall be required.'"
Referring to his calls for the middle class to have a "fair shot" at economic opportunity, the president said, "Part of that belief comes from my faith in the idea that I am my brother's keeper, and I am my sister's keeper."
And Mr. Obama said Wall Street needed play by the same rules as Main Street because, "far too many neighbors in our country have been hurt and treated unfairly over the last few years, and I believe in God's command to 'love they neighbor as thyself.'"
As in previous addresses at this annual Washington event, Mr. Obama spoke about his own faith, recalling an upbringing that was not particularly religious, a subsequent religious awakening and a visit to the North Carolina home of Rev. Billy Graham, where Mr. Obama said he was moved to find himself praying for the aging evangelical leader. 
But this speech, coming on the cusp of his re-election bid, inevitably carried a more political tone than previous ones. Mr. Obama acknowledged disagreements over how best to get the country back on track, but lamented the toxic nature of the political discourse.
"Sometimes we talk about respect, but we don't act with respect towards each other during the course of these debates," he said to the audience, a mixture of Republicans and Democrats as well as religious leaders.
The president embraced the criticism of a previous speaker, Eric Metaxas, a writer who delivered a funny, but trenchant, assault on those who he said espouse "phony religiosity" while failing to care for the poor or respecting those with whom they disagree, on issues like abortion.
Mr. Obama pointedly echoed Mr. Metaxas, saying, "We can all benefit from turning to our creator, listening to him, avoiding phony religiosity and listening to him." Later, he added, "Our goal should not be to declare our policies as biblical. It is God who is infallible, not us."
Mr. Metaxas, who has written biographies of the German pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the British abolitionist William Wilberforce, also asked the audience to join Mr. Obama in singing "Amazing Grace," noting that the president has shown his musical chops by recently crooning an Al Green song.
The president emphasized that his themes of economic equity and a fair shot for the middle class would reinvigorate the American economy. But he said they were also product of his faith, noting, "We're required to have a living, breathing, active faith in our own lives." He also said those policies could find roots in other religions, from Islam to Judaism.
Mr. Obama, who has attended every National Prayer Breakfast since he became president, was accompanied by his wife Michelle, as well as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Several members of his cabinet, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, also attended the event, which marked its 60th year.

LAS VEGAS - Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney here Thursday afternoon in a joint appearance that lasted less than seven minutes and included no questions.
The two men stood behind a lectern emblazoned with a gold "Trump" plaque (a large Romney sign hung off to the side, largely out of the TV shots), and the endorsement came amid several impromptu news conferences that Mr. Trump organized for himself.
When they finally took the stage together, Mr. Romney uttered perhaps the truest statement of the event, which had come together in a last-minute flurry after false reports that Mr. Trump would throw his support behind Newt Gingrich. "There are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life," Mr. Romney said. "This is one of them."
He proceeded largely on message, making sure to give a shout-out to Mr. Trump's "magnificent hotel," and calling his endorsement "a delight."
Then, continuing onto the message his campaign presumably wanted him to drive home, Mr. Romney added, "I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement, and of course I'm looking for the endorsement of the people of Nevada."
Promoting his own success as a businessman, Mr. Romney said: "I spent my life in the private sector. Not quite as successful as this guy, but successful none the less."
As Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, stood off to the side, Mr. Trump then stepped up, grinning and nodding at the crowd, which offered up occasional shouts of "The Donald!"
Calling it a "real honor and privilege to endorse Mitt Romney," Mr. Trump added, "Mitt is tough, he's smart, he's sharp, he's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love."
He concluded: "So, Governor Romney, go out and get 'em. You can do it."
On Thursday morning, Newt Gingrich was asked while touring a forklift manufacturer in Las Vegas if he was expecting Mr. Trump's endorsement, as insiders in his campaign had told a variety of news outlets, including The New York Times, the previous evening.
"Who knows?'' Mr. Gingrich said with a shrug. "I'm just watching in amazement.''
"Some people have this knack of gathering attention,'' he said with a laugh, referring to Mr. Trump. 
Michael Cohen, a political adviser to Mr. Trump, said that the developer-turned-reality star never gave Mr. Gingrich an indication of an imminent endorsement. He and Mr. Trump were traveling to Las Vegas, Mr. Cohen said, as the Internet was lighting up Wednesday night with accounts of a Gingrich nod. "We landed and the cellphones started going,'' Mr. Cohen, who is Mr. Trump's usual conduit to political reporters, said. He made no effort to throw cold water water on the erroneous reports. "You can't get 1,000 e-mails and start responding,'' he said. 
Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump held at least two impromptu news conferences as he wandered around his hotel, pausing to answer reporters' questions with relish. No, he would not entertain a third-party or independent run if Mr. Romney was the nominee. Yes, he likes Mr. Romney's tough stance on China. And all those mean things he said about the guy just months ago? Well, that was before he knew him.
"Just twiddling my thumbs," Mr. Trump joked when asked if he planned to pass the time "hanging out" until Mr. Romney arrived. In fact, he explained, he was touring his hotel with his "hotel people."
"How do you like it?" he asked a group of traveling reporters, many of whom had spent the night elsewhere. "Do you see why it's the No. 1 hotel in Nevada?"
At another point, the crowd grew so thick that network and cable anchors, vying for Mr. Trump's attention, seemed to spin him around like a bobble-head doll, shouting out questions from all sides.
When the brief endorsement wound down, Mr. and Mrs. Romney, after greeting some friends in the front row, retreated offstage, as Mr. Trump followed.
Unable to help himself, he turned back to the room and flashed a "V" sign - for victory, we assume - before he disappeared. Only to reappear again, just moments later, for yet another press conference.

HEADLINE: Fact Check: Romney on the Recession

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has revived his assertion that President Obama made the recession worse. Economists, the nonideological ones, disagree. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is back to saying that President Obama "made it worse" - the recession, that is - but his charge remains factually challenged.
Accepting the endorsement of Donald Trump, a former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, in Las Vegas on Thursday, Mr. Romney said of the president: "He's frequently telling us that he did not cause the recession, and that's true. But he made it worse."
That statement echoed one that Mr. Romney, a former one-term governor of Massachusetts, used when he announced his candidacy in New Hampshire in June 2011, and that he repeated for weeks afterward until he was confronted by an NBC-TV producer and fact-checking organizations. He dropped the line for many months, but has recently revived it.
The consensus among nonideological economists since 2009 has been that the stimulus measures of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve actually prevented the recession from becoming worse, even from turning into a second Great Depression. But, they say, the downturn was more severe than initially thought given its roots in a financial crisis (as opposed to the normal business cycle of ups and downs), which in turn has made for a slow recovery.
In the most extensive analysis of the government response, in mid-2010, the economists Alan S. Blinder and Mark Zandi used a Moody's Analytics simulation of the economy and concluded that the effects on economic growth, job creation and inflation "are huge, and probably averted what could have been called Great Depression 2.0."
While intervention in the financial markets by the independent Fed and the Treasury - including the much vilified banking bailout that Mr. Romney also condemns - had the bigger positive impact, the effects of Mr. Obama's fiscal stimulus package of spending and tax cuts "appear very substantial," the economists wrote.
For example, they said, economic growth in 2010 was raised about 3.4 percent, the unemployment rate was about 1.5 percentage points lower and almost 2.7 million more jobs were created, compared with what would have happened without the stimulus.
Mr. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University, is a former vice chairman of the Fed and a former economics adviser to President Bill Clinton. Mr. Zandi is chief economist of Moody's Analytics and has advised members of Congress in the Democratic and Republican Parties, including Senator John McCain in his bid for president.
The Congressional Budget Office, in its latest periodic assessment of the stimulus measures' effects, reported in November that in the third quarter of last year, those policies raised the gross domestic product by between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent, lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 of a percentage point and 1.3 percentage points, and increased the number of people employed by between 400,000 and 2.4 million.
On Thursday, Mr. Romney also joined Mr. Trump in incorrectly citing another report from the Congressional Budget Office. Mr. Trump said the report this week projected that unemployment, now 8.5 percent, would go up to 9.2 percent by 2013. In fact, the office projected that the unemployment rate would remain above 8 percent this year and next year before slowly declining further.
Of the 8.4 million jobs lost in the recession, 4.4 million were lost before Mr. Obama took office in January 2009. About 2 million new ones have been created since that time, pushing the jobless rate down from its 10.1 percent peak in October 2009 but leaving it high.
When Mr. Romney was first challenged last summer about his charge that Mr. Obama made the economy he inherited worse, he told reporters, "I didn't say that things are worse."
He did then, and he has again.

HEADLINE: Geithner Defends Dodd-Frank

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The Treasury Secretary, taking on Republican critics, says legislation has helped stabilize the financial sector. 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner on Thursday made a full-throated defense of the administration's post-crisis regulation of the financial system, which he insisted was "getting stronger and safer."
"These gains will erode over time if we are not able to put our full reforms into place," he said, according to prepared remarks he was to deliver at a news conference at the Treasury Department. 
His comments came as the Dodd-Frank law has come under fire from the Republican presidential candidates, all of whom, including Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, have called for its repeal, arguing the regulatory burden it imposes is slowing the recovery. 
The Dodd-Frank law, passed in the summer of 2010, is "paralyzing lending to entrepreneurs, killing small banks, crippling small businesses, driving down the value of housing and creating corrupting Washington controls over the biggest banks," Mr. Gingrich writes in his policy platform.
The law also remains contentious on Capitol Hill. Members of Congress have offered more than a dozen bills to whittle away some of its provisions or get rid of it altogether. 
But Mr. Geithner argued that the changes "forced a necessary and fundamental restructuring of the financial system," lowering the threat posed by "too big to fail" financial institutions and constraining the amount of risk that banks can take on. 
"Remember 2008, 2009," Mr. Geithner said. "Remember the fact that the reason why we're living with very high unemployment, with millions of Americans having lost their homes" is because of failures within the financial system.
"If you want to go back to that, and you want to choose that future, then you should be in favor of repeal of the law," he added.
He said there was "no credible evidence to support the argument that these reforms are having a material negative effect on the economy." Rather, he argued that the Dodd-Frank law had helped stabilize the financial sector and promote the recovery. 
"Those who are working to slow the pace of reform will only increase uncertainty, and they will damage our efforts to get the rest of the world to adopt a level playing field," he said. 
Mr. Geithner made little news in his remarks. But he did say that the administration planned to make progress on transforming the mortgage finance system - though not too much progress. 
Mr. Geithner said that Treasury would continue to detail a plan to bring private capital back into the housing market and to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises that have cost American taxpayers more than $150 billion since 2008.
Mr. Geithner said that the administration hoped to "lay the foundation for consensus" on a housing proposal. But, he added, "realistically, we don't expect to legislate this year."

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HAWES

 BODY:
HAWES, Rosilla Hornblower. Died on January 27, 2012 at the age of 100. Most beloved mother of Lynden B. Miller, cherished mother-in-law of Leigh M. Miller and adored grandmother of Gifford, Marshall, Ethan, and Christian Miller, their wives and eight great-grandchildren whose lives she enriched with her kind, loving and generous nature and her wide-ranging knowledge of literature, public affairs and history. She was born in New York City in 1911 and attended the Chapin School and Vassar College, class of 1933. She was married in 1935 to Alan R. Breed who died in 1954. In 1979 she married Alexander B. Hawes who died in 1995. She lived in Washington, D.C. for many years before returning to her native New York almost a decade ago. 
Her New York roots went way back in New York history. Her ancestors ranged from Susannah Rutgers Marshall, a businesswoman in 18th century New Amsterdam, the Architect, Henry Rutgers Marshall, to Judge William B. Hornblower of the New York Court of Appeals, as well as many other New York architects and lawyers. Her family for many generations believed passionately in public service, and dinner conversation when she was growing up always centered on current events and politics. After Vassar, where she majored in sociology and economics, she worked at the National Consumers League, an organization dedicated to helping women in the workplace founded by Frances Perkins. From long family tradition, she was always a passionate Democrat and, as she put it, "a New Yorker to the bone," so she delighted in the public careers of her two grandsons, Gifford Miller, former Speaker of the New York City Council, and Marshall Miller, Chief of the Criminal Division at the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Though not a gardener herself, she was proud of her daughter, Lynden B. Miller, Public Garden Designer, in her role of beautifying the city they both loved. For those lucky enough to know her, she personified a LADY: elegant, gracious, thoughtful, tactful and sympathetic to everyone she met. She spent her life cherishing the many people she loved and supporting New York City causes and institutions like The New York Botanical Garden, The New York Public Library and The Community Service Society. Contributions in her memory could be made to any of those organizations.

HEADLINE: An Indian Reservation in Crime's Deadly Grip

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
WIND RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION, Wyo. -- At a boys' basketball game here last month, Wyoming Indian High School, a perennial state power, was trading baskets with a local rival. The players, long-limbed and athletic, are among the area's undisputed stars, and their games one of its few diversions. On this night, more than 2,500 cheering, stomping people came to watch.
Outside the gym, in a glass trophy case, are photographs of players from recent championship teams. Someone peered in and, moving his finger along the line of smiling faces, delivered a cruel counterpoint: killed in a car accident at 19 while intoxicated; murdered in his 20s; struck in the head with an ax not long after graduation.
The Obama administration, which has made reducing crime a priority in its attempt to improve the quality of life at dozens of Indian reservations plagued by violence, recently ended a two-year crime-fighting initiative at Wind River and three other reservations deemed to be among the country's most dangerous. 
Nicknamed ''the surge,'' it was modeled after the military's Iraq war strategy, circa 2007, which helped change the course of the conflict. Hundreds of officers from the National Park Service and other federal agencies swarmed the reservations, and crime was reduced at three of the four reservations -- including a 68 percent decline at Mescalero Apache in New Mexico, officials said. Wind River, as has been true for much of its turbulent history, bucked the trend: violent crime there increased by 7 percent during the surge, according to the Department of Justice.
Despite its bucolic name, the reservation, nestled among snowcapped peaks and rivers filled with trout, is a place where brutal acts have become banal. A rambling stretch of scrub in central Wyoming the size of Rhode Island and Delaware combined, Wind River has a crime rate five to seven times the national average and a long history of ghastly homicides.
During the initiative, which increased the number of officers on the reservation to 37 from 6, crimes included the murder of a 13-year-old girl who had been missing for four days and whose partly clothed body was found under a tree, and the killing of a 25-year-old man, who the police say had been beaten with a child's car seat and a dumbbell by two friends after a sexual encounter.
''This place has always had the gloom here,'' Kim Lambert, a tribal advocate on the reservation, said as she drove by a line of small houses people refer to as ''murderers' row.'' ''There has always been the horrendous murder. There has always been the white-Indian tension. It's always been something.''
Crime may be Wind River's most pressing problem, but it has plenty of company. Life, even by the grim standards of the typical American Indian reservation, is as bleak and punishing as that of any developing country. On average, residents can expect to live 49 years, 20 years fewer than in Iraq. Unemployment, estimated to be higher than 80 percent, is on a par with Zimbabwe's, and is approaching the proportionate inverse of Wyoming's 6 percent jobless rate.
The reservation's high school dropout rate of 40 percent is more than twice the state average. Teenagers and young adults are twice as likely to kill themselves as their peers elsewhere in Wyoming. Child abuse, teenage pregnancy, sexual assault and domestic violence are endemic, and alcoholism and drug abuse are so common that residents say positive urinalysis results on drug tests are what bar many from working at the state's booming oil fields.
On one section of the reservation, people must boil drinking water because chemicals, possibly the result of the oil and natural gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, have contaminated the water supply. And fearing that the chemicals might explode in a home, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered residents to run fans and otherwise ensure ventilation while bathing or washing clothes.
The difficulties among Wind River's population of about 14,000 have become so daunting that many believe that the reservation, shared by the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone Tribes, is haunted -- the ghosts of the innocent killed in an 1864 massacre.
''Anywhere, there are good spirits and bad spirits around,'' said Ivan Posey, a member of the Eastern Shoshone Business Council. ''But when people are struggling in their lives, those bad spirits come around more often. It's kind of a yin and yang.''
Why the other reservations were able to curb crime while Wind River was not has been a matter of grave speculation. Some blame Wind River's geographic isolation and a general apathy on the reservation, while others point to the numerous troubled children being raised by grandparents unable to keep track of them.
During a recent Friday night patrol on the reservation, Michael Shockley, a Wind River police officer whose department lacks even the basic ability to track crimes, said he was surprised to learn that the surge had not reduced violent crime.
Even with 10 fewer officers than it had during the surge, Officer Shockley said, the Police Department responds to all calls, not just the most serious ones. Crime, he said, has appeared to ebb, especially when compared with what he referred to as the bad old days, when on a single night about a year ago, he drove a total of 400 miles, logged 42 calls and arrested 19 people.
Still, signs of disillusionment are ubiquitous: piles of empty Black Velvet whisky and vodka bottles; discarded prescription bottles for painkillers; gang graffiti; burnt-out homes.
As far as criminality, this is the pinnacle,'' Officer Shockley said. ''You see everything here.''
The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which oversees the Wind River Police Department, says the rise in violent crime was a result of people reporting offenses they might have ignored before -- which suggests that the reservation's crime rate is even higher than previously thought. In fact, the bureau says, crime has fallen since the surge ended in October, although it did not provide statistics.
Joseph Brooks III, the Wind River police chief, said that one resident, shocked that the police response had gone from hours to minutes, told him, ''Chief, if I knew you were going to come immediately, I would have called you later.''
One crime the surge was unable to prevent was the death of Marisa Spoonhunter, an eighth grader at Wyoming Indian Middle School who was killed in April 2010. Her parents recognized her body by the coat they had recently bought for her in Denver.
Marisa's 21-year-old brother, Robert, and 19-year-old stepcousin were arrested and convicted. The three had been drinking in a trailer home when Robert Spoonhunter said he blacked out and awoke to find his sister and cousin having sex. An enraged Mr. Spoonhunter said he choked his sister for about 20 seconds before flinging her away. Marisa's head hit a weight-lifting bench.
The men fastened a rope to her ankles and dragged her under a tree. Before resuming drinking, they put her clothes in a burn barrel.
At the sentencing, Vern Spoonhunter, the father of Marisa and Robert, said Marisa had been in the third generation of Spoonhunters to be murdered at Wind River -- meeting the same end as his father and brother.
''Now we have two rooms in our home that are empty,'' he said, referring to his children. ''And that's what we have to deal with.''

HEADLINE: Tower for Rent, With Million-Dollar Views

BYLINE: By REYHAN HARMANCI. 
rharmanci@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Last Friday, a group of about 60 writers, artists, Telegraph Hill residents and community activists gathered in a North Beach art gallery to hear seven poets wax lyrical about that oh-so-San Francisco landmark, Coit Tower -- and protest a proposed plan by city officials to open the top floor for private parties.
Lincoln Bergman, a San Francisco poet, captured the fervor of the crowd with his verse in praise of the New Deal-era artwork inside the tower: 
The beautiful murals that meet us,
In the tower some teens call Coit-us,
We must make agitation
To fund preservation
Unified, no one can defeat us!
The event was ''a classic North Beach happening,'' said Jon Golinger, president of the association Telegraph Hill Dwellers and the leader of the Protect Coit Tower effort, which is a reaction to what some residents say is a disturbing trend toward public space being commercialized.
Over the past few years, in response to deep budget cuts, the city's parks department has become increasingly focused on finding ways to raise money from its property holdings. Many of those efforts have led to neighborhood skirmishes.
''Privatization is bad,'' said John Rinaldi, an author and activist known as Chicken John, who led an effort to keep food trucks out of Dolores Park last year. ''Our park system is not supposed to be a revenue generation system.''
Mr. Golinger's group is planning to turn in signatures on Monday to get a measure on the June ballot that would strictly limit ''commercial activities and private events at Coit Tower'' and also require the Recreation and Park Department to earmark more money from admission fees to maintenance of the tower, which was built in 1933. The city earns around $650,000 a year, largely from the $7 entrance fee.
The department is seeking a new vendor to run both the tower's gift shop and the new event program, which it hopes will begin by summer.
For Mr. Golinger, the concern is that using Coit Tower for parties would transform ''what is one of San Francisco's most iconic public spaces.''
Phil Ginsburg, head of the parks department, disagrees.
''It's a bit of hyperbole,'' he said. ''We have an active program of renting out our park sites for weddings and birthdays and special events. What park system doesn't?''
Along with their dislike of the Coit Tower proposal on philosophical grounds, opponents of the park department's plan point to the fragile state of its historical murals as a reason to be cautious about raising money through events. Mr. Golinger has been working since this fall to raise awareness about chipped and unsupervised artwork, done by 26 painters, many of whom had studied with Diego Rivera as part of the Works Progress Administration.
The Coit Tower plan is just one part of the department's efforts to increase ''earned revenue'' -- via parking fees, building and park rentals, fees for food trucks and other initiatives -- to make up for budget cuts.
According to a report released this past summer by the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, a nonprofit urban planning and research group, Recreation and Park has lost almost 25 percent (or $12 million per year) from what used to be its primary financial source, the city's General Fund, in the past six years. The earned revenue went up 27 percent in that time, to almost $10 million annually.
This past fall, a heated debate ensued over the department's plan to put food trucks in Dolores Park, with some people opposing placement of trailers in the park's scant green space.
In Golden Gate Park, two proposals -- one to install artificial turf and stadium lights at the soccer field and another to put a recycled-water-treatment plant inside the park -- have galvanized groups like Save Our Parks and the Golden Gate Preservation Alliance.
Gray Brechin, a University of California, Berkeley, geography professor and author of ''Imperial San Francisco,'' said that while he was sympathetic to the economic plight of cities, he is troubled by the ''slippery slope'' of privatization.
''It's happening throughout S.F. parks, all meant to be public,'' which were largely created by the Works Progress Administration, he said, noting that the trend was also playing out elsewhere too, with, for example, the pivotal decision in the 1990s to open the Presidio national parkland in San Francisco to private enterprise. By a congressional decree, the national parkland must become financially self-sustaining by next year.
But not everyone sees the parks department as pushing that far in the revenue-generating direction. ''They are trying their best to maintain public space,'' said Corey Marshall, a policy director at SPUR, noting that the Coit Tower situation is part of ''a much broader debate about how we best fund government.''
Mr. Ginsburg acknowledged that his department was facing long-term trends in reduced government spending and defended his approach to getting more revenue. Without doing things like putting a restaurant in the Marina Degaussing Station or installing a tennis shop with a cafe at the courts at Golden Gate Park -- both current proposals -- he said that San Francisco would look more like the California state park system, which is rife with closings.
''We are at a concerning point,'' he said, ''but we're a long way away from the rhetoric of selling the public commons.''

HEADLINE: Nonprofit News Groups Considering a Merger

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS. 
plewis@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
In early 2009, San Franciscans faced the very real prospect that theirs could be the first major American city without a daily newspaper. The city's only remaining broadsheet, the Hearst-owned San Francisco Chronicle, was in financial trouble and was slashing its reporting staff. Rumors spread that Hearst was considering letting the 145-year-old newspaper die.
Warren Hellman, a San Francisco investor and philanthropist, told friends he was alarmed by the potential loss of quality news coverage in the Bay Area, and he commissioned McKinsey & Company to evaluate a purchase of The Chronicle. He rejected that plan and decided instead to create a new experiment in nonprofit civic journalism. The Bay Citizen was launched in 2010 with grand ambitions, $5 million in seed money, and a performance by Mr. Hellman's bluegrass band, The Wronglers, with Mr. Hellman twanging his banjo.
Then Mr. Hellman died unexpectedly, on Dec. 18, at age 77, of complications arising from treatments for leukemia. Now, The Bay Citizen is considering a potential merger, according to people involved in the discussions, a move that could see the publication absorbed by an older but similar nonprofit news organization in Berkeley, and raising questions about whether the founding patron's vision for a revitalization of Bay Area news reporting can survive him. 
The unexpected death of Mr. Hellman left The Bay Citizen without its founder and benefactor. In September, the news organization's founding editor-in-chief, Jonathan Weber, resigned abruptly. In October, the founding chief executive, Lisa Frazier, announced that she would resign in early 2012 for health reasons. Last week, the interim editor-in-chief, Steve Fainaru, a former Pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporter for The Washington Post, announced that he was resigning to pursue a book project.
In the weeks before Mr. Hellman's death, sources say, he began discussions with a local newspaperman, Phil Bronstein, then a vice president at Hearst Corporation, to take over as chief executive of The Bay Citizen when Ms. Frazier stepped down. Her last day on the job is Monday. She declined to comment for this article.
Mr. Bronstein, 61, who was editor of The San Francisco Chronicle from 2003 until 2008 (previously he served as the executive editor), is president of the board of the Berkeley-based Center for Investigative Reporting, C.I.R., another nonprofit journalism group that was founded in 1977. As a board member, Mr. Bronstein was involved in the creation of California Watch, a project of C.I.R., which assembled the largest team of investigative reporters in California. California Watch, which has an editorial staff of 27, was formed in 2009 and distributes what it calls high-impact journalism to more than 80 different publications.
Mr. Bronstein, according to people familiar with the board's deliberation, said he would accept the job as Bay Citizen C.E.O. only if it were merged with C.I.R. and California Watch. In December, shortly after Mr. Hellman's death, some board members and Bay Citizen contract partners -- including The New York Times, which carries Bay Citizen reporting on Fridays and Sundays in its Bay Area editions -- began hearing about the proposed Bay Citizen-C.I.R. merger.
Reached Thursday, Mr. Bronstein said he and Mr. Hellman had met periodically for years to discuss journalism, including features that Mr. Hellman suggested for The Chronicle, like ''Rascal of the Week, Crook of the Week, hilarious stuff,'' Mr. Bronstein said. He said that before founding The Bay Citizen, Mr. Hellman was considering making a donation to C.I.R. ''at a large level,'' and that after The Bay Citizen was started, talks eventually involved a closer working relationship between The Bay Citizen and C.I.R.
People involved with the discussions stressed this week that no merger agreement has been reached, and that the legal and financial logistics of combining two California nonprofit organizations, both of them regulated under section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Service code, are daunting. Any merger agreement would have to be approved by the state attorney general, Kamala Harris, who oversees mergers of nonprofit corporations.
''The attorney general could step in and apply the brakes if she finds organizations proposing to merge where the missions and purposes of the two don't match up,'' said Gene Takagi, a specialist in the law of nonprofits and managing attorney at the NEO Law Group, based in San Francisco.
''If the opera and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals propose a merger, that's going to be a problem,'' he said.
In a presentation to the Bay Citizen's board last week, Mr. Bronstein, the leading candidate to be the combined organization's chief executive, presented a vision of the combined news groups that would create ''an unprecedented level of accountability reporting for the Bay Area'' and create ''the largest investigative reporting team in the region.''
However, in his presentation, Mr. Bronstein also suggested ''economies of at least $1 million in operational expenses and $900,000 in duplicative personnel.'' He outlined plans for the combined organizations to focus on ''entrepreneurial journalism,'' raising the possibility of turning the technology of the news group into a profit center.
Conspicuously absent from his presentation was the Bay Citizen's contractual agreement to provide The New York Times with Bay Area news each week. Mr. Bronstein said the agreement could possibly conflict with partnerships that C.I.R. has with dozens of other print partners.
What the possible merger means for The Bay Citizen, C.I.R. and California Watch, three of California's most ambitious public-interest reporting ventures, is a topic of intense speculation in their respective newsrooms.
''Journalists have been left out of the process,'' said Aaron Glantz, a Bay Citizen staff reporter and chairman of the newsroom's Newspaper Guild unit. ''Neither the organization's board of directors nor the outgoing C.E.O. have ever consulted with staff on the possible merger.''
Mr. Fainaru attended several board meetings where the merger was discussed, but declined to talk about specifics. As for his departure, he said the opportunity to work on a book with his brother, the investigative journalist Mark Fainaru-Wada, ''has always been a dream of ours.''
With the board unable to define its strategy, ''I felt the decision was pretty much made for me,'' Mr. Fainaru said. He told colleagues that he would also take an investigative journalism job with ESPN. His last day is Thursday.
''We are deeply concerned that in the absence of a C.E.O. and editor-in-chief, we do not have an advocate who will fight for what we have all worked so hard to build here at The Bay Citizen,'' Mr. Glantz said in an e-mail.
Robert Rosenthal, executive director of C.I.R., said: ''I think there's a tremendous possibility of bringing together two strong and unique organizations and blending their strengths and assets into something unique in nonprofit journalism. It could be transformational in terms of innovation around story delivery on all platforms and engaging its audiences in ways that were unthinkable even five years ago, as the technology and social media are evolving.''
Mr. Bronstein said that he shares the same vision as Mr. Rosenthal.
He added that discussions were fluid. ''Things could jell quickly,'' he said, ''and they could also fall apart quickly.''

HEADLINE: Indexes Hold Firm While Tech Shares Advance

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stock indexes ended little changed ahead of Friday's monthly employment report, but technology shares rose after strong earnings from the chip maker Qualcomm.
Recent economic data suggesting the economy is on a slow but steady path to recovery has helped feed a rally in stocks. The jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show the improving labor market trend remained intact in January, will be a crucial test of the rally. 
Claims for jobless benefits dropped more than expected in the latest week, according to data released on Thursday.
''A decent number, and I would expect equities to continue their advance; a not decent number and we'll have a correction. It's that simple,'' said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading in Chicago.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by 150,000 after increasing 200,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 8.5 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 11.05 points, or 0.09 percent, to 12,705.41. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.45 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,325.54. The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.41 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,859.68.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 2/32, to 101 19/32. The yield fell to 1.82 percent, from 1.83 percent late Wednesday.
Technology shares outperformed the broader market. Qualcomm hit its highest level in 12 years after first-quarter profit trounced estimates. Its shares gained 2 percent to $60.73 after hitting a high of $61.95.
MasterCard rose 6.7 percent to $381.57 after it beat analysts' estimates for the seventh consecutive quarter.
Health care shares were among the losers. Merck said profit would be little changed in 2012. Its shares fell 0.5 percent to $38.44.
The insurer Cigna posted a lower than expected fourth-quarter profit. It also forecast 2012 earnings below Wall Street's target, sending shares down 3.4 percent to $44.13.
New claims for unemployment benefits in the United States fell more than expected last week, indicating further healing in the jobs market.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slid 12,000 last week to 367,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
While Thursday's claims data has no direct bearing on the monthly report due Friday, analysts said the trend in claims was positive.
A separate Labor Department report showed growth in nonfarm productivity slowed in the fourth quarter. Some analysts suggested that companies might be closer to squeezing all they can out of their current staff.
''For the moment that's a good thing because it means that any expansion in demand will lead to hiring,'' said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics in New York.

HEADLINE: No Rust in Rochester

BYLINE: By DUNCAN T. MOORE. 
Duncan T. Moore is a professor of optical engineering and the vice provost for entrepreneurship at the University of Rochester.

 BODY:
Rochester
AFTER years of decline, Eastman Kodak, once the largest employer in Rochester, filed for bankruptcy protection last month. But rather than following Detroit, Cleveland and other once-bustling industrial cities into decay, Rochester continues to grow at a healthy clip. Why?
The question goes beyond the city limits of what was once called ''Snapshot City.'' Why does Pittsburgh prosper while Detroit sputters? How did San Diego make the transition from a Navy town to a diversified economic success while Fresno, Calif., has one of the country's highest home foreclosure rates? 
The answers are complex and unique to each. But the latest city to struggle with economic dislocation shows how good policy making, entrepreneurship and a little luck can ensure that a city doesn't just survive, but thrive.
While no one here is glad to see Kodak go bankrupt, it's hardly the catastrophe many imagine. Indeed, while over three decades Kodak's Rochester-area employment dropped to fewer than 7,000 jobs from 61,000, the community itself gained a net 90,000 jobs. That's because the Rochester economy is more diverse than most realize -- in part, surprisingly, because of Kodak. The high-skilled workers it let go over the years created a valuable labor pool for start-up companies, particularly in optics and photonics.
It also helps that Rochester has a strong higher-education sector, which has likewise been supported by Kodak. The University of Rochester became a leading research center through gifts from Kodak's founder, George Eastman, who also gave generously to the Rochester Institute of Technology.
These universities have an immense impact on the regional economy. The University of Rochester, along with its medical center, is now the area's largest employer. Over the last five years it has received more than $1.9 billion in research money, most of it from the federal government, which has in turn fueled local growth beyond the campus gates.
Yet another asset is Rochester's cultural institutions. Many highly skilled former Kodak workers chose to stay because of the amenities inspired by Eastman's philanthropy, including the Eastman School of Music, the Rochester Philharmonic and the International Museum of Photography.
True, many Rust Belt cities have fine universities and cultural institutions. What they lack, however, is a fertile entrepreneurial class to move in as the dominant employer fades and leaves. In fact, it's the very presence of a single big company that can keep smaller ones from taking root.
Recognizing this risk, two decades ago Rochester began a network of private and nonprofit partnerships to diversify its economy. Organizations like High Tech Rochester and Greater Rochester Enterprise work with local government and academia to train entrepreneurs and support new business ventures. Since 1996, 51 start-ups -- 38 of which are still active -- were created based on University of Rochester technologies alone.
The state and federal governments have been a big help, too. In 2006, the region around Rochester received a four-year federal Department of Labor grant to finance economic development initiatives -- which in turn paved the way for almost $70 million in projects awarded in 2011 from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's Regional Economic Development Council initiative.
Creative destruction will continue to wreak havoc across the global economy. The experience of Rochester, San Diego, Pittsburgh and other cities in surviving offers several lessons.
The first is to make better use of local intellectual capital, starting with universities. One challenge Rochester faces is replacing the young people who once came to work in Kodak's laboratories. Here's where higher education comes in handy: public and private organizations should build connections with students through internships and other efforts that give graduates a reason to stick around.
Moreover, universities provide stability in a rough economy by drawing in state and federal dollars, which can compensate for the decline of a major employer.
Of course, private companies need to be part of the game as well. Those left behind when a dominant employer disappears must be willing to pivot to a longer view, as Kodak did for generations. Instead of managing quarter to quarter, they must help reinforce the local work force, as well as invest in the community so as to keep it attractive to new high-skilled workers.
Put differently, there is no single answer for cities facing the departure of a major employer, and there are many things unique to Rochester, Pittsburgh and San Diego that have allowed them to thrive where others have foundered. But long-term investments in education, culture and community have made all three postindustrial success stories, and there is no reason such a strategy can't help the next city hit by a big-business bankruptcy to follow their lead.

HEADLINE: MoMA Acquires Works by Feminist Artists

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Marina Abramovic riveted and provoked audiences at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2005 when she re-enacted a 1969 performance piece by the Austrian-born artist who calls herself Valie Export. In the piece Ms. Abramovic stalked around the stage with a large fake gun, wearing pants with the crotch removed.
It might have been tough stuff for the audience, but Ms. Abramovic's performance was one of several projects in recent years that have begun to elevate the work of obscure but important feminist artists like Ms. Export (who prefers her name in all capital letters) and Martha Rosler, catapulting them into mainstream institutions. 
This week the Museum of Modern Art said it had acquired important groups of work from the 1960s and '70s in a variety of mediums by Ms. Rosler and Valie Export. Included are all Ms. Rosler's original photo montages as well as a complete set of 20 color prints of her landmark series ''Bringing the War Home,'' which she created in the Vietnam era between 1967 and 1972.
Both women examine issues of the body and sexual identity. ''All of their thinking is so present,'' said Sabine Breitwieser, chief curator of media and performance art at the museum.
''Bringing the War Home'' deals with issues of how war enters lives. ''We see these beautiful advertisements in magazines and next to them these horrifying war images,'' Ms. Breitwieser said. ''This is what she has connected. Until now most of these images were only shown in underground magazines, but they really belong in a museum.''
The works by Valie Export include videos, photographs and two early films. ''It's what she calls expanded cinema,'' Ms. Breitwieser said. ''It does not consist of the usual things like a screen and a projection; rather she has deconstructed elements about how a film is generated.''
STILL LIFE FOR THE NATIONAL
Over the last few years the National Gallery of Art in Washington has been strategically increasing its holdings of works by African-American artists of various periods and styles. Last year it bought its first painting by the contemporary artist Kerry James Marshall, and now the gallery has stepped back in time, acquiring ''Still Life With Fruit and Nuts,'' an 1848 canvas by Robert Seldon Duncanson.
Measuring just 12 by 16 inches, the painting features an immaculately composed pile including a pear, an apple, grapes, walnuts, hazelnuts and peanuts on a table.
It was auctioned in 2000 at what was then Phillips de Pury & Luxembourg (now Phillips de Pury & Company), selling for $222,500. The buyer was the Babcock Galleries in New York, which sold it to an unidentified private collector. That collector took it back to Babcock to sell for an undisclosed price. John Driscoll, the Babcock's owner, offered it to the National Gallery.
Franklin Kelly, the National Gallery's deputy director, said he did not remember seeing the still life when Phillips had it for sale.
''We've been looking for a painting by Robert Seldon Duncanson for a long time,'' Mr. Kelly said, explaining that although the artist is better known for his landscapes, the gallery sought a still life for two reasons: It would be a particularly fitting addition to an already world-class collection of American still lifes by masters including Raphaelle Peale, Martin Johnson Heade, John Frederick Peto and Michael William Harnett. And Duncanson's landscapes are already well represented in the nearby Smithsonian American Art Museum as well.
The painting was hung this week in the American galleries of the National Gallery's West Building.
CATTELAN TO OPEN SPACE
It has been less than two weeks since ''Maurizio Cattelan: All'' closed at the Guggenheim Museum, and the place is noticeably quieter. Nearly 337,000 visitors flocked to see the Cattelan retrospective -- wacky creations that included the eerie image of Pope John Paul II felled by a meteorite, an old woman stuffed in a refrigerator, even the artist himself as a precocious boy on a tricycle -- all dangling from ropes down the Frank Lloyd Wright rotunda. The show was a final curtain call of sorts. When the exhibition opened in November, the 51-year-old Mr. Cattelan said that it was the end of his art making.
Well, we haven't heard the last of him after all. Maybe he won't be making his often disturbing and whimsical pieces anymore, but as he said by telephone from Milan, Italy, this week, ''When I called for early retirement, I never said I'd be unemployed.''
On Feb. 16 in Manhattan Mr. Cattelan will open Family Business, a closet-size exhibition space at 520 West 21st Street, next door to one of Gagosian's two Chelsea galleries. The nonprofit space is a sequel to the Wrong Gallery, a minuscule exhibition space that Mr. Cattelan and the curators Massimiliano Gioni and Ali Subotnick ran on West 20th Street from 2002 until being evicted in 2005. (It then re-opened at the Tate Modern in London, but closed in 2008.)
Family Business will be financed in part by the Bard Center for Curatorial Studies in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. ''It's a museum in miniature,'' said Tom Eccles, executive director of the center. ''This will give our students a presence in the heart of New York.''
Bard's won't be the only students involved in Family Business. The artist and teacher Marilyn Minter has organized the inaugural exhibition. Called ''The Virgins Show,'' it will be work by young artists who are either past or present students from the two graduate schools where she teaches: the School of Visual Arts and Yale University Art School. None of these artists have shown their work outside their academic environments. ''Hence they are virgins,'' Ms. Minter said.
''All of a sudden there's a new crop of abstract painters,'' she explained when asked what the work was like. ''I think it's a trend.''
Rather than painting on conventional canvases, these so-called virgins have painted on everything from panty hose to signs found on the street.
''The art world takes itself too seriously,'' Ms. Minter said. ''We're trying to have some fun.''
The space won't be exclusively for fine art. Ms. Minter said that a band from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, appropriately called the Virgins, will play at the opening.

'How I Learned to Drive' (in previews; opens on Feb. 13) Norbert Leo Butz and Elizabeth Reaser head the cast for this first major New York revival of Paula Vogel's 1998 Pulitzer Prize-winning play, about the unhealthy relationship between an adolescent girl and the manipulative uncle teaching her to drive, both of whom are outsiders within their family. Kate Whoriskey (''Ruined'') directs. Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Rooney)
'Hurt Village' (previews begin on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 27) Katori Hall (''The Mountaintop'') returns to Memphis for this premiere, a tale of a teenage rapper, her family, their home in a housing project -- and the return of her father, an Iraq war veteran. With Ron Cephas Jones and Tonya Pinkins. Signature Theater, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (DeWitt)
'The Inexplicable Redemption of Agent G' (previews begin on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 14) Death in Vietnam, swaggering rap and a character named the Playwright: The Ma-Yi Theater Company, in collaboration with Vampire Cowboys Theater, presents the Off Broadway debut of this genre-defying work by Qui Nguyen, which ran downtown last year. Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (DeWitt)
'A Map of Virtue' (previews begin on Monday; opens on Thursday) The 13P company, formed by 13 playwrights out to have their work produced and not just read, has reached No. 12 with this Erin Courtney work about art, artists and birds. Yes, it's a collision of ideas and images. Ken Russ Schmoll directs. 13P's writers include Young Jean Lee, Ann Marie Healy and Sarah Ruhl (No. 13, whose production is scheduled for this summer). Fourth Street Theater, 83 East Fourth Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, 13p.org. (DeWitt)
'Myths and Hymns' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) A song cycle by Adam Guettel (''The Light in the Piazza'') becomes a family drama in this revised version produced by Prospect Theater in an Upper West Side church space, appropriately for its new title. (It was called ''Saturn Returns'' in its 1998 concert version.) Elizabeth Lucas, the director, has created a narrative for the piece. West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101, propspecttheater.org. (DeWitt)
'The Navigator' (previews begin on Thursday; opens on Feb. 11) Eddie Antar's play returns for a run on a bigger stage in this popular production, at least among the audience members who voted in the 2011 Innovative Theater Awards; they granted the show eight nominations. It's the tale of an out-of-work, out-of-luck guy who gets unlikely help from his car's GPS system. WorkShop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, fourth floor, (866) 811-4111, workshoptheater.org. (DeWitt)
'Rutherford & Son' (previews begin on Saturday; opens on Feb. 27) The solid Mint Theater stages this 1912 family-business drama by Githa Sowerby, directed by Richard Corley. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (DeWitt)
'Rx' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Primary Stages presents this new play by Kate Fodor (''100 Saints You Should Know'') about romance and pills, in which a woman participating in the clinical trial of a new drug targeting workplace depression falls for her doctor, who is also testing a pharmaceutical cure for heartbreak. Ethan McSweeny directs an ensemble that includes Marin Hinkle, Stephen Kunken and the always sublime Marylouise Burke. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Rooney)
'Tokio Confidential' (previews begin on Sunday; opens on Feb. 11) An American widow heads to Japan, where she falls in love with a tattoo artist -- in 1879, when body ink was perhaps not quite as omnipresent. This musical, by Eric Schorr, comes from Scandal Productions. Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (DeWitt)
'The Ugly One' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The contemporary German playwright Marius von Mayenburg gets the art-comes-first Soho Rep treatment in a production directed by the theater's former artistic director Daniel Aukin (the recent ''4000 Miles'' and frequent collaborations with the playwright Melissa James Gibson, of ''[sic]'' fame). This social satire, produced in collaboration with the Play Company (''Invasion!''), has 99-cent Sundays. Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, sohorep.org. (DeWitt)
Broadway
- 'Anything Goes' Kathleen Marshall's zesty revival of Cole Porter's hit-packed musical embodies the essence of escapist entertainment in the 1930s, when hard times called for bold smiles, tough wisecracks and flashy fantasies. Sutton Foster is sensational as the nightclub evangelist Reno Sweeney (2:30). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' As the fatally conflicted Bess, the extraordinary Audra McDonald is a gale force of emotion in Diane Paulus's slimmed-down musical adaptation of the landmark 1935 opera. Otherwise, despite a likable performance from Norm Lewis as Porgy, this production feels cloudy and mild, only rarely acquiring the majesty of the opera that inspired it (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Nick Jonas plays the amoral hero of Frank Loesser's 1961 musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties: Stockard Channing, Rachel Griffiths, Stacy Keach, Judith Light and Justin Kirk (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Road to Mecca' A quiet, slow and ultimately powerful revival of Athol Fugard's three-character play about the inevitable and necessary apartness of artists. Rosemary Harris is wonderful, a study in subliminal radiance, as an aging South African sculptor under siege from the forces of conventionalism. Jim Dale and Carla Gugino provide strong support in Gordon Edelstein's production (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold directs a bright cast that includes Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
'Stick Fly' Lydia R. Diamond's overstuffed but lively comedy-drama feels like a Tyler Perry melodrama (sans Madea) as revised by an academic specializing in issues of class in African-American culture. Condola Rashad gives the standout performance in the director Kenny Leon's uneven production, playing a young woman who embodies the problems of racial and class divisions that the other characters theorize about (2:15). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Reopens on Tuesday at the Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Wit' Cynthia Nixon gives a large, lucid and delicate performance in this immaculately staged (and inevitably moving) revival of Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama from 1998 about a terminally ill English professor. Lynne Meadow's smart and sensitive production magnifies the play's innate theatricality without compromising the hard emotional truth at its center (1:40). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
- 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the Apple co-founder's life and vision into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'The Philanderer' An early work by George Bernard Shaw, this drawing-room farce follows a Victorian-era love triangle among a rake, the woman he loves and the woman who loves him. Shaw meant to explore some of the feminist territory Ibsen had in ''A Doll's House,'' but he met with only mixed success. This production by the Pearl Theater Company does little to elevate the play either, though it benefits from Karron Graves's comic performance as the impetuous and frustrated Julia Craven (2:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Daniel M. Gold)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Richard III' Kevin Spacey entertainingly out-acts everybody onstage in Sam Mendes's valedictory production for the Anglo-American Bridge Project. Say what you will about Mr. Spacey's histrionic excesses, he provides a sustained (and intelligent) interpretation as Shakespeare's murderous crookback. The same cannot be said of Mr. Mendes's staging, a grab bag of postmodern gimmicks (3:00). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)
'Russian Transport' Janeane Garofalo plays it straight, more or less, in Erika Sheffer's dark drama about the corrupting influence of a new Russian immigrant (the excellent Morgan Spector) on a Brooklyn family (2:10). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents gets to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Yosemite' Daniel Talbot's stormy dysfunctional family drama never entirely coheres persuasively (1:20). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Zinoman)
Off Off Broadway
'Gonna See a Movie Called Gunga Din' The theater company Van Cougar mashes up staged snippets of Hollywood war movies with testimonials from real-life veterans. But these two styles undermine rather than amplify each other, resulting in a missed opportunity (2:00). Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, Brooklyn, (800) 836-3006, thebushwickstarr.org. (Eric Grode)
'History of the World' Judith Malina, 85 and still the unsinkable life force behind the venerable downtown avant-garde troupe the Living Theater, instigates another rebellion with this exuberant, dizzying flight through the course of Western civilization, peppered with political observations. It's never dull, but the audience participation may deter some viewers. Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-0255, livingtheatre.org. (Andy Webster)
'That Ain't No Lady' The doyenne of New York's now-defunct annual outdoor drag festival, Wigstock, Lady Bunny purveys bawdy stand-up and pornographic pop song parodies in her first new cabaret act in 10 years. Looking like Dusty Springfield on steroids and introduced ''direct from the Port Authority men's room,'' the Lady and her show are definitely not for the prudish. But anyone feeling nostalgic for the seedy old days before Times Square became a tourist-friendly theme park will get a kick out of this evening of big hair and bad manners. Tuesday only (1:30). La Escuelita Cabaret Theater, 301 West 39th Street, (212) 631-0588, brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)

Last Chance
- 'The Canterbury Tales Remixed' (closes on Sunday) In his delightful one-man show, Baba Brinkman, a medieval literature scholar, has adapted Chaucer's 14th-century masterpiece into a hip-hop show. The conceit may sound cheesy, but Mr. Brinkman makes a surprisingly persuasive case that the two art forms are thematically (and in some cases, rhetorically) similar. Both feature thugs, dangerously beautiful women, death-defying daredevils and Creflo Dollar-esque men selling salvation. Drawing on analogies to pop anthems and celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Herman Cain, Mr. Brinkman demonstrates just how relevant these stories are (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'The Fall to Earth' (closes on Sunday) What begins as an amusingly fraught mother-daughter encounter takes on dark and predictable shadings in Joel Drake Johnson's gothic drama. Deborah Hedwall is delightful as the boundary-demolishing mom, but she is asked to paper over some increasingly awkward lurches in tone (1:25). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Grode)
'Gob Squad's Kitchen (You've Never Had it So Good)' (closes on Sunday) An inspired riff on the wacky world (and sometimes wearying movies) of Andy Warhol. Although it strives with tongue in cheek to recapture the ''essence'' of that time, this goofy, smart and moving show succeeds best in combining video, live performance and audience participation in alerting us to the excitement of the present moment (1:50). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Leakey's Ladies' (closes on Saturday) This portrait of the real-life primatologists Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas has promising source material: three brilliant young women living alone in the jungle, swinging machetes, tracking real-life King Kongs, having affairs, battling hunters, maybe even getting their heads chopped off. But this theatrical adaptation is less action-packed thriller than dutiful book report, told primarily through long, prosaic letters to the others and glossing over lots of juicy and controversial details of their lives (1:00). Dixon Place, 161A Chrystie Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org. (Rampell)
'Leo' (closes on Sunday) Circle of Eleven's hourlong acrobatic show, conceived and performed by Tobias Wegner, is charming but slight physical theater. Mr. Wegner is a winning presence, but his concept, of a man isolated in a room where the laws of gravity don't apply, soon becomes a trap (1:10). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Claudia La Rocco)
- 'The London Merchant, or the History of George Barnwell' (closes on Saturday) This rare revival of George Lillo's 1731 tragedy is given an excellent production that's both dark and tense (2:10).

'Mission Drift' (closes on Saturday) A sprawling, intermittently enjoyable but indulgent musical epic about the American ideal of expansionism and its toxic undertow. The songs, written and often sung by the terrifically talented Heather Christian, portraying (sort of) a Las Vegas piano-bar entertainer, are the highlight of an evening that would be twice as much fun at about half the length. Part of the Coil festival (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org. (Isherwood)
'Newyorkland' (closes on Saturday) Temporary Distortion's latest stunning multimedia production cuts through cliches about police officers. Part of the Coil festival (1:15). Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, (866) 811-4111, bacnyc.org. (Zinoman)
'Outside People' (closes on Saturday) Zayd Dohrn's smart but slight comedy of manners finds an insecure New Jersey native (the likably nebbish Matthew Dellapina) plopped down in Beijing, where he falls in love with a native (an affecting Li Jun Li) with mysterious motives (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Isherwood)
- 'Stopped Bridge of Dreams' (closes on Sunday) John Jesurun's latest brew of theater and video is a heady, darkly poetic and funny rumination on the human condition. What better metaphor for the contemporary moment than a flying house of pleasure, from which there is no escape? (1:15). La MaMa, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (La Rocco)
'Untitled Feminist Show' (closes on Saturday) The latest theatrical adventure from Young Jean Lee dispenses with words entirely to present a frolicsome combination of dance and mime, performed entirely in the nude by a half-dozen downtown theater and dance luminaries. Untitled, but also unfocused. Part of the Coil festival (1:00). Baryshnikov Arts Center, Jerome Robbins Theater, 450 West 37th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org. (Isherwood)

HEADLINE: Before Ice Cream Shop Can Open, City's Slow Churn

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.; sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee's office announced last week a $1.5 million fund to help small businesses, calling the sector the ''Backbone of SF Economy.''
If true, then the saga of a new ice cream shop seems to indicate that the city needs a good chiropractor.
The Ice Cream Bar opened Jan. 21 in the Cole Valley neighborhood -- an homage to the classic parlors of the 1930s, complete with vintage soda fountain and lunch counter seating. It has become an immediate sensation, packed with both families and the foodie crowd, savoring upscale house-made ice creams and exotic sodas (flavorings include pink peppercorn and tobacco). The shop also employs 14 full- and part-time workers. 
But getting it opened wasn't easy.
''Many times it almost didn't happen,'' said Juliet Pries, the owner, with a cheerful laugh.
Ms. Pries said it took two years to open the restaurant, due largely to the city's morass of permits, procedures and approvals required to start a small business. While waiting for permission to operate, she still had to pay rent and other costs, going deeper into debt each passing month without knowing for sure if she would ever be allowed to open.
''It's just a huge risk,'' she said, noting that the financing came from family and friends, not a bank. ''At several points you wonder if you should just walk away and take the loss.''
Ms. Pries said she had to endure months of runaround and pay a lawyer to determine whether her location (a former grocery, vacant for years) was eligible to become a restaurant. There were permit fees of $20,000; a demand that she create a detailed map of all existing area businesses (the city didn't have one); and an $11,000 charge just to turn on the water.
The ice cream shop's travails are at odds with the frequent promises made by the mayor and many supervisors that small businesses and job creation are top priorities.
The matter has also alarmed some business leaders, who point out that few small ventures could survive such long delays.
''Someone of lesser fortitude would have left three months into it,'' Ted Loewenberg, president of the Haight Ashbury Improvement Association, said of Ms. Pries. ''Through these hard times we've heard all the rhetoric about streamlining the process, about one-stop shopping. It hasn't happened.''
That could soon change. An ordinance easing the process for opening a small business is expected to be considered by the supervisors within weeks. It has already been approved by the planning commission.
''The city has had the reputation of being a difficult place, and a hostile place, to do business,'' said Mark Farrell, the city supervisor who has the most private-sector experience (he still operates a venture capital firm). ''We're changing the dialogue.''
According to Mr. Farrell, a critical shift occurred last year when supervisors approved a tax incentive to keep the headquarters of Twitter, the social network, in the city after the company threatened to move.
But he admitted that such actions were relatively easy compared with reforming the city's entrenched bureaucracy. ''To change the inner workings of government is a longer proposition,'' he said.
Christina Olague, a former Planning Commission president who was recently appointed city supervisor, said that planning codes governing businesses had ballooned over the years to become hundreds of pages long. ''It's so convoluted,'' she said. ''It's so difficult for these businesses to move ahead.''
Even the planning department itself is calling for reform. ''Hello City Planner,'' an animated cartoon produced by the department and posted on its Web site, depicts a litany of farcical city hassles faced by a woman applying to sell ice cream.
''Wow! That's a long time and expensive,'' the ice cream lady says after the planning employee in the animation explains the slow process and high fees.
Cases like Ms. Pries's inspired the video, although some believe her runaround was exceptionally absurd. Even after she acceded to all the city's demands, her paperwork sat unprocessed for months. Ms. Pries would not say exactly how much it all cost, including construction, but smiled and nodded when asked if it was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
And yet, remarkably, she does not complain. Ms. Pries is as effervescent as her sodas, and excited about her prospects -- looking ahead, rather than back. Perhaps this optimism is why she finally prevailed, when so many others would have given up.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.
Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space at Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause of rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Sarah Sze: Infinite Line' (through March 25) Promising a new angle on Ms. Sze's mesmerizing, minutely detailed installations, this midcareer solo reveals that this Chinese-American artist has been profoundly influenced by many forms of Asian art. It also includes some of her rarely exhibited drawings and encourages you to see her three-dimensional artworks as drawings in space. Implicitly, it de-emphasizes the prosaic nature of her art materials: the cotton swabs, toothpicks, bottle caps and other throwaway objects that she fashions, with gee-whiz structural ingenuity, into rambling landscapes and galactic spirals. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
- Brooklyn Museum: 'African Innovations' (continuing) The museum has done some reshuffling on its first floor, and the African galleries, which once claimed a privileged spot next to the lobby, are now relocated a distance away and reduced in size. But the new display, ''African Innovations,'' is effective. It eliminates the graphic overkill of the former installation; sets out work with an easily graspable logic; and over all shows the African holdings to decent advantage. It would be pretty hard not to. The collection is spectacular, an institutional treasure. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture' (through Feb. 12) Like many events that are the first of their kind, this sampling of the roles of same-sex desire -- and unconventional notions of masculinity and femininity -- in over 100 years of American portraiture feels both overdue and a little behind the times. Despite exemplary works by Marsden Hartley, Jasper Johns and Robert Mapplethorpe, it is more sketchy overview than thorough examination and often errs on the side of mild-mannered caution. But it illuminates aspects of mainstream art that have long been hiding in the light, and it both makes and remakes history. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (through April 22) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (through April 29) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor to ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' (through May 6) Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed not as political activists, but as political heroes who fell into history by accident. The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether ''black or white, young or old, gay or straight.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion; the work of his competitors and peers; the evolution of tabloid journalism; and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)
- Jewish Museum: 'The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951' (through March 25) One of many artistic casualties of the McCarthy-era blacklists was the Photo League, a New York school and salon for amateur and professional photographers. Its members -- among them Weegee, Lisette Model and Aaron Siskind -- are now reunited in this stirring show, which traces the group's history through some 145 vintage photographs. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Art in an Age of Revolution: Fu Baoshi (1904-1965)' (through April 15) Serene on the surface but less so underneath, the museum's first full-dress retrospective of a 20th-century Chinese painter is as much about history as art history. It focuses on an artist, teacher and art historian who helped preserve the ancient tradition of ink painting and then struggled to make it relevant under the Communists, bending it toward propaganda, introducing a new degree of realism and making frequent use of the color red. While fascinating, the show leaves you wondering what he might have accomplished under less encumbered circumstances. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Infinite Jest: Caricature and Satire From Leonardo to Levine' (through March 4) It is not nice to make fun of other people, but it is hard to resist. This fascinating and often amusing show presents about 160 drawings and prints from six centuries in which men and women appear ugly, weird, venal and foolish. The show shies away from troublemaking work by contemporary artists, but examples of exceptional draftsmanship and satiric imagination from the past abound. Watercolors by the great British cartoonists James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson alone make a visit rewarding. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Renaissance Portrait From Donatello to Bellini' (through March 18) This magisterial, intensely thought-provoking show presents about 160 works by the most celebrated masters of 15th-century Italian painting and sculpture. It was a time when ancient Greek and Roman precedents inspired artists to create extraordinarily lively images of people in two and three dimensions. The dialogue between painting and sculpture is especially intriguing. Desiderio da Settignano's marble bust of a lovely young woman with a strikingly expressive, coquettish expression creates an illusion of fleeting real life that painters could only envy. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. ( Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' alone is a must-see: its five hand scrolls constitute one of the Met's greatest paintings and have never before been shown together. Return visits are merited, especially after several substitutions on Wednesday for conservation reasons. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: Sanja Ivekovic: 'Sweet Violence' (through March 26) This timely and resonant survey familiarizes American audiences with the spare, selfless achievement of this pioneering Croatian artist, born in Zagreb in 1949. Conceptual in style, photo- and performance-based in approach, political in motivation, ardently and precisely feminist, her work makes use of materials at hand -- personal photographs, women's magazines, state-sponsored television, even government surveillance -- to dissect different forms of power and illuminate the plight of the powerless, while also presaging familiar developments in appropriation art and relational aesthetics to a startling degree. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-32 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Cecil Beaton: The New York Years' (through Feb. 20) A British dandy in the Wildean mold, Beaton photographed fashion for Vogue and Vanity Fair; made photographic portraits of rich, famous and glamorous people; drew and painted cartoons, caricatures, fashion illustrations and theatrical sets with a deft hand; published six volumes of his diaries; and won two Oscars for his costume and set designs, for the Hollywood movies ''Gigi'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' He spent much time in New York, and this entertaining exhibition surveys what he did here during his five-decade career. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'The Ronald S. Lauder Collection: Selections From the 3rd Century B.C. to the 20th Century/Germany, Austria and France' (through April 2) Since it opened 10 years ago, the Neue Galerie has stayed true to its narrowly focused mission: to showcase German and Austrian art and design of the early 20th century. But its anniversary exhibition of the collection of the co-founder Ronald S. Lauder covers much more territory. In the dark-wood-paneled gallery on the second floor, for instance, six paintings by Cezanne preside over an imposing installation of arms and armor and 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish portraiture. And a third-floor gallery of Picasso, Matisse and Brancusi amounts to a mini-Museum of Modern Art improbably wedged into a Carrere-and-Hastings town house. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
Noguchi Museum: 'Civic Action: A Vision for Long Island City' (through April 22) Several artists suggest their visions for the future of Long Island City, ranging from site-specific to silly. Natalie Jeremijenko's ''feral robots'' sniff out pollutants in contaminated soil, and she suggests hula hoops filled with wildflower seeds. Rirkrit Tiravanija proposes growing ''drivable'' grass along a section of Broadway, and Mary Miss focuses on four giant smokestacks that tower over the area and imagines them as an eco-feedback center registering environmental changes visible to the community. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
- Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Bearden Project' (through March 11) Of the many New York City events celebrating the Romare Bearden centennial year, the Studio Museum has come up with the best in this sparkling cross-generational shout-out to the artist. In addition to a small handful of superb works by Bearden himself, the show is made up of tributes by a hundred contemporary artists, old and young, who together extend Bearden's cosmopolitan, griot-to-the-global-village spirit into the future. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
- Swiss Institute Contemporary Art: 'Jean-Frederic Schnyder' (through Feb. 26) The first New York show of this lapsed Swiss Conceptualist, who was born in 1945 and represented his country at the 1993 Venice Biennale, is a characteristic mix of benign and barbed, as well as of painting, sculpture and video. The 35 small, delectable paintings of ''Landscape'' bivouac at the border of art and kitsch, tackling themes of hearth and home, taste and cliche, while a video parade of bottles of schnapps implicates the tourist industry. It's deceptively tidy, deeply Swiss satire. 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, swissinstitute.net. (Smith)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Real/Surreal' (through Feb. 12) Seeing this exhibition is like visiting your grandmother's attic and finding it loaded with forgotten treasures. The lonesome Romanticism of Edward Hopper and Joe Jones; the Magic Realism of Peter Blume and Paul Cadmus; the nightmarish urban visions of George Tooker and Louis Guglielmi; Yves Tanguy's otherworldly blobs in space; and Andrew Wyeth's dead crow in a winter field: these and many more vividly realistic and surrealistic works from the 1930s to the early '50s capture a mood of dreadful unease that gripped the mid-20th-century American psyche and that, in many ways, still does. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Uptown
Lee Bontecou: 'Recent Work: Sculpture and Drawing' (through Feb. 11) If Terry Gilliam were to make a movie based on Thomas Pynchon's ''Against the Day,'' he might consider Ms. Bontecou's recent suspended sculptures as models for the airship Inconvenience. They have bowed, sail-like parts that seem as if filled by a steady, ethereal wind and slender, soldered wire structures like sleds attached below. On paper, Ms. Bontecou envisions submarine worlds where bug-eyed, toothy fish are refracted by watery swirls. Freedman Art, 25 East 73rd Street, (212) 249-2040, freedmanart.com. (Johnson)
'Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones' (through April 15) This wide-ranging survey was assembled by one of the leading milliners in Britain and draws heavily on the incomparable collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It includes fascinating historical material; a survey of 20th- and 21st-century headgear at its most creative (and often most frivolous); and rather too many efforts by the show's organizer. But what's good is great: for example, a platterlike feather number from 18th-century London. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
- Jordan Wolfson (through Feb. 18) This brilliant New York gallery debut consists of ''Animation, masks,'' a 12-minute 29-second digital animation that rivets the ear and the eye while perturbing the mind, not unlike an exquisite Faberge egg that explodes in your face. It turns its medium inside out, rejuvenates appropriation art with richly contrasted images and roils sundry stereotypes, starting with a high-definition Shylockian lover boy. The color alone is extraordinary; the totality is an extensively barbed classic for our stubbornly sentimental, tragically materialist times. Alex Zachary Peter Currie, 16 East 77th Street, (212) 628-0189, azpcgallery.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
- Damien Hirst: 'The Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011' (through Feb. 18) The formerly young British artist's spot-painting summation may be spread throughout the 11 emporiums of the worldwide Gagosian franchise, but New York is bearing the brunt, with 115 of the total 331 distributed among three galleries, one of which (980 Madison) could count as four shows on its own. Despite the consistency of the formula, a typically Hirstian range of quality, from good to atrocious, prevails. Some are engaging paintings; others aren't really paintings at all. Similarly, at least one installation -- at West 21st Street -- is ravishing; others are oppressive, best suited for the artist's most hard-core fans. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, (212) 744-2313; 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea; (212) 741-1111; and 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)
- 'Interiors: Pierre Bonnard, Marc Camille Chaimowicz, William Copley, Edouard Vuillard' (through Feb. 11) ''Interiors'' lets some fresh air into the ''Intimist'' rooms of Bonnard and Vuillard, with help from the contemporary installation artist Marc Camille Chaimowicz and the late-Surrealist painter William N. Copley. Mr. Chaimowicz's untitled wallpaper makes an excellent backdrop for Bonnard's ''Breakfast Room'' (1925), on loan from the Brooklyn Museum; the broad, squiggly contour lines in Mr. Copley's paintings confuse figures and interiors, as does a small Vuillard oil of a matronly woman whose green jacket matches the drapes on her French windows. Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Rosenberg)
- James Nares: '1976: Movies, Photographs and Related Works on Paper' (through Feb. 11) Lower Manhattan in the 1970s is part laboratory, part playground in this show of wildly experimental early films and photo-conceptual documents by Mr. Nares. At the time these works were made, he hadn't developed his signature single-brush-stroke paintings, but he was honing his intensely physical formula by swinging giant pendulums through desolate alleys. The ball moves with a metronomic steadiness, but Mr. Nares's camerawork is restless and unpredictable; the combination is totally gripping. Paul Kasmin, 515 West 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Rosenberg)
- Joyce Pensato: 'Batman Returns' (through Feb. 25) In her latest show of perky cartoon characters gone over to the dark side, the painter Joyce Pensato embraces installation art with the deranged determination of a supervillain -- surrounding her canvases with heaps of plush toys and assorted props from the studio. Although the exhibition is titled ''Batman Returns,'' perhaps in homage to the 1992 Tim Burton film, Ms. Pensato's vision of the caped crusader is all her own. Her drippy enamel-on-linen paintings of the hero's mask strip away his trust fund and cave full of bat-gizmos, making him into a mythic, messy presence. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Rosenberg)
Weegee: 'Naked City' / Vivian Maier (through Feb. 25) Two careers in street photography -- markedly different in sensibility and visibility -- are contrasted in side-by-side shows. The raw, exuberant tabloid art of the famous Weegee (1899-1968) is manifest in a display of 125 images from throughout his career. Meanwhile, the secretive, recently discovered photographer Vivian Maier (1926-2009) took pictures ceaselessly, pursuing a style as unobtrusive as Weegee's is loud and in your face, but no less assured. Steven Kasher Gallery, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 966-3978, stevenkasher.com. (Smith)
- Doug Wheeler (through Feb. 25) Stepping through the fourth wall into Mr. Wheeler's luminous, futuristically titled installation ''SA MI 75 DZ NY 12'' (2012) is like entering a giant marshmallow. Because all surfaces are snowy white, corners seamlessly coved and the whole brightly lighted, it seems as if you are in a space of possibly infinite extent. It might be a preview of the universal divine light into which each of us will merge, according to some mystics, when we die. David Zwirner, 519 West 19th Street, (212) 517-8677, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
Matt Hoyt: '2006-2011' (through Feb. 12) Displayed on wooden shelves in groups of two to six, Mr. Hoyt's sculptures look like nondescript found objects. Some resemble pieces of plastic plumbing; others are like small, rounded rocks. One could be a braded bracelet, another a piece of chicken bone. Learning that he made them out of clay, putty, paint and other materials turns them into epistemological thought experiments: what is real when appearances deceive? Bureau, 127 Henry Street, Lower East Side, (212) 227-2783, bureau-inc.com. (Johnson)
- 'Marble Sculpture From 350 B.C. to Last Week' and 'Portraits/Self-Portraits From the 16th to the 21st Century' (through Feb. 25) Filling nearly four floors of pristine gallery space, these two exhibitions romp in lively, even wicked ways through a succession of periods and styles, with continuity provided by what's called the ''ideal'' sculptural material in one case and the human visage in the other. The result is a deliciously nonacademic exercise in looking and a robust reminder that, wherever we may think we are in terms of art, the past is rarely far behind, nor irrelevant. Sperone Westwater, 257 Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com. (Smith)
'Soto: Paris and Beyond: 1950-1970' (through March 31) Once a figure of international renown, Jesus Soto is now mostly remembered as a minor Modernist who worked in the overlap among hard-edge abstraction, kinetic art and Op Art. This show will not precipitate a run to revive his reputation, but it does open an intriguing window on the mid-20th-century philosophical landscape of modern art. Still perceptually arresting are constructions from the '50s, in which you view abstract compositions through similarly painted plexiglass panels. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
'Luminous Modernism: Scandinavian Art Comes to America, 1912' (through Feb. 11) In 1912 a big exhibition of contemporary art from Scandinavia opened in New York to much acclaim. Revisiting that show, ''Luminous Modernism'' presents 48 paintings and drawings mostly from the first decade of the 20th century. Twenty of the artists and eight of the works that were in the 1912 exhibition are included. Highlights include gloomy, Vermeer-like paintings by Vilhelm Hammershoi, of Denmark, and Edvard Munch's explosive ''Girl Under the Apple Tree,'' which alone is worth the visit. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
Out of Town
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Zoe Strauss: Ten Years' (through April 22) In 2001 the artist Zoe Strauss came up with an unusual idea for an exhibition. It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, ''I-95,'' is at the core of ''Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,'' an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape.

Two exhibitions drawn from the Guggenheim's collection show how differently this sentiment could manifest. ''Surface, Support, Process'' features Mary Corse, Tadaaki Kuwayama, Agnes Martin, Robert Mangold and Brice Marden. ''Pop Objects'' includes Andy Warhol's ''Orange Disaster #5'' (1963) and a micro-retrospective of Roy Lichtenstein paintings, along with works by Robert Rauschenberg, John Chamberlain and Richard Hamilton. It also includes a 1997 James Rosenquist painting commissioned by Deutsche Bank, in conjunction with the Guggenheim, that pays curious ''tribute to industrial growth and capitalism.'' 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org.

It will be especially eye-opening for the casual museumgoers who still think of Degas as a polite Impressionist, a painter of dancers and jockeys and hygienic groomers. On view are some 140 works by Degas and 20 more by his influencers, contemporaries and successors. 465 Huntington Avenue, Boston, (617) 267-9300, mfa.org. (Rosenberg)

HEADLINE: Mayor of Providence Seeks Urgent Steps in City's Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD and ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
The mayor of Providence, R.I., on Thursday laid out a series of steps he said were crucial to shoring up the city's finances. He warned that it would otherwise run out of money in June.
Mayor Angel Taveras, a Democrat, outlined plans to reduce pensions for retired municipal workers and vowed to appeal a recent state court ruling preventing the city from forcing its retirees to switch to the federal Medicare health insurance program when they turned 65. He also called for bigger contributions from major tax-exempt universities and hospitals in Providence.
''The worst-case scenario is bankruptcy,'' Mr. Taveras said in a phone interview after a news conference at City Hall. ''This will be the consequence if we are not able to accomplish our goals.'' 
Providence, the state capital, is only one player in the municipal crisis gripping the state: collectively, Rhode Island's cities and towns are facing an estimated $2 billion in unfinanced pension liabilities. The city of Central Falls is in receivership and declared bankruptcy last year; this week, the state legislature approved a $12.6 million advance to struggling East Providence, which is also under state supervision.
Mr. Taveras said he would meet with retirees in March to discuss pension cuts. He said he would ask state lawmakers to allow him to suspend annual cost-of-living increases, which are between 5 and 6 percent, for the city's retirees. ''It's unsustainable,'' Mr. Taveras said.
In addition, he said a Superior Court ruling this week that Providence could not move some retirees from the police and fire departments to Medicare could cost the city $8 million. The mayor's spokesman, David Ortiz, said the city would appeal to the State Supreme Court, asking for an expedited review and a reversal of the ruling.
Mr. Taveras said a supplemental tax increase would be a last resort. But he added, ''During a recession, in a state with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, in a city suffering from a lot of foreclosures, that would be devastating as well.''
Mr. Taveras called on the city's major tax-exempt institutions -- which include four independent colleges and universities and three hospitals -- to contribute an additional $7.1 million to the city budget. He added that he would push for legislation to increase what colleges and universities pay for city services.
''They need the city to be successful in order to be successful,'' Mr. Taveras said. The institutions include Brown University, Providence College and the Rhode Island School of Design. ''We are engaged in dialogue with them, and I'm very hopeful that will be something we can do very soon.''
Daniel P. Egan, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Rhode Island, said that colleges in Providence want the city to explore other options, like profiting from university expansion on land made available by a highway project, and going to other nonprofit sectors for support.
''Seven million is not feasible for one sector alone,'' he said, adding that the private educational institutions had agreed to a 20-year, $50 million contribution to the city, starting in 2003.
''Right now, it's difficult for anyone,'' Mr. Egan said. ''It's not like 2003, when we could just reach in and find that money.''
He added, ''It's a different fiscal time.''

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Approves Potentially Toughest Penalty Yet Against Iran's Wallet

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved a new regimen of anti-Iran sanctions on Thursday that would for the first time threaten to punish the global financial telecommunications network that nearly all banks rely on to conduct their daily business.
The legislation's banking provision, aimed at forcing the telecommunications network to expel Iranian banks that have already been blacklisted, would be financially catastrophic for Iran if carried out fully, according to proponents and sanctions experts. Expulsion from the network -- the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, known as Swift -- would deny to Iran many billions of dollars in revenue from abroad that is routinely routed into its domestic banking system. 
Iran's central bank is already subject to a particularly tough American measure, signed into law last month, that threatens to undermine the Iranian economy by penalizing foreign banks and other companies that transact business with the central bank. But the Swift provision in the new legislation, which some advocates of sanctions have described as a silver bullet, could be far more onerous.
''The Senate Banking Committee has sent a strong message,'' said Mark D. Wallace, the president of United Against Nuclear Iran, an advocacy group based in New York that has been pushing for such a provision. He has argued that Swift, which based in Belgium, is already in violation of other sanctions against Iran as well as its own rules. ''Swift must end its business in Iran,'' he said.
The legislation does not specify what action would be taken against Swift if it did not comply.
There was no immediate comment by Swift on the legislation. But officials of the network, mindful of pressure from Mr. Wallace's group and others that have increasingly advocated stricter sanctions against Iran, denied it was acting illegally, in a statement posted earlier Thursday on the network's Web site.
''Swift complies fully with all applicable sanctions laws of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, and we will continue to do so,'' the network said in its statement, noting that its activity is overseen by regulators of major powers, including the Federal Reserve in the United States. ''We operate our network in a manner that is transparent to these regulators and maintain frequent consultations with them, as well as other governmental authorities in the E.U., U.S. and other jurisdictions.''
The Senate legislation, known as the Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Human Rights Act, would also eliminate other loopholes in earlier sanctions, force all companies with stock traded in the United States to publicly disclose any dealings with sanctioned Iranian businesses and individuals, and basically prohibit the granting of visas to Iranian students who wish to study energy-related fields in the United States.
The legislation now goes to the full Senate, where the likelihood of passage is considered strong. It reflects the rising tone of confrontation between the West and Iran over the country's uranium enrichment program, as well as what vocal opponents of Iran have called its support for international terrorism and repressive tactics at home.
''With these new sanctions, we are giving Iran's leaders a clear choice,'' Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, who is chairman of the Banking Committee, said in a statement. ''Iran can end its suppression of its own people, come clean on its nuclear program, suspend enrichment and stop supporting terrorist activities around the globe. Or it can continue to face sustained, intensifying multilateral economic and diplomatic pressure deepening its international isolation.''
Iran has rejected Western accusations that it is seeking the capability to build nuclear weapons through its uranium enrichment program, insisting the program is peaceful. In what amounts to a mirror image of the Western indictment of its behavior, Iran has countered by accusing the United States and Israel, the main American ally in the Middle East, of warmongering and terrorism.
Iranian leaders have acknowledged that their economy is under strain because of the sanctions, and have recently expressed a new willingness to discuss their uranium enrichment with Western powers. But the Iranians have maintained a defiant position over the nuclear issue for years, a stance that has increased fears that Israel, which considers Iran a major threat to its existence, would pre-emptively attack suspected nuclear sites in Iran.

HEADLINE: Deepening Cuts Raise Threat Of the Land Of Less Lincoln

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON. 
sycamoredirk@aol.com

 BODY:
Illinois's economy is so bad that virtually nothing is sacred: even historic sites connected to Abraham Lincoln could face significant cuts in the coming state budget.
State preservation officials warn that expected deep reductions, coming after decreases of 15 percent and 16 percent in the past two years, threaten the closing of some locations and reducing of staff and hours at others.
David Blanchette, the spokesman for the state Historic Preservation Agency, said there were no guarantees that even the most prominent Lincoln attractions would be spared, including the acclaimed Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield. ''Like every state agency, we're staring down the barrel of a loaded gun, and wondering what will happen when the trigger is pulled,'' he said. 
The state's preservation agency, with a budget of about $20 million, administers some 60 historic sites and monuments, including 26 that are staffed by employees. Others are served by volunteers.
In the last two years, the state has reduced access to old courthouses where Lincoln practiced law, including Mount Pulaski and Postville in Lincoln, as well as the Cahokia Courthouse, a French log structure built in the late 1700s.
The Galesburg birthplace of Carl Sandburg, the writer who called Chicago ''the city of big shoulders'' and thereby gave the city an internationally known nickname, has been closed for the winter. Its scheduled reopening in the spring is uncertain, pending the budget.
Catherine Shannon, the acting director of the preservation agency, said other sites that could be vulnerable in a reduced budget include Bishop Hill in western Illinois, the 1840s utopian commune that was a major, early Swedish settlement in America. Bishop Hill is considered so historically significant that it attracts a strong following from people in Sweden. King Carl XVI Gustaf has visited at least twice.
''We have an obligation to keep our history alive,'' said Ms. Shannon, adding that ''old places deteriorate so much more quickly when they are mothballed -- and become much more expensive to repair.''
Illinois prides itself on having particularly rich historical treasures. The state has long billed itself as ''The Land of Lincoln,'' and it has sought to capitalize on the celebrated president.
''Illinois is ground zero for anyone who wants to see and experience authentic Lincoln,'' said Mr. Blanchette. Some important Lincoln sites, of course, draw scarcely as many people as those who want to gaze at their reflections in the shiny bean at Millennium Park.
Some 2.6 million people visit Illinois historic sites annually, including nearly 1 million who tour the major Lincoln sites in Springfield and nearby New Salem, Mr. Blanchette said.
Kelly Kraft, a spokeswoman for Gov. Patrick Quinn, acknowledged the importance of the historic sites, but said the agency could not expect to be spared from deep cuts. The governor's budget would impose reductions that average 9 percent on most state agencies. The governor plans to present his budget to the General Assembly on Feb. 22. Lawmakers must approve a new spending plan by May 31.
Besides the historic importance of the sites, the major Lincoln attractions are estimated to generate more than $100 million in tourist revenue per year, Mr. Blanchette said.
State Rep. Donald L. Moffitt, Republican of Galesburg, has called for increased spending to market historic treasures. He noted that the Lincoln Presidential Museum, which opened in 2005 and showcases artifacts like the original handwritten Gettysburg Address, has helped revitalize the core of a sagging Springfield.
''We're always looking for ways to stimulate the economy,'' said Mr. Moffitt, ''and here we have this opportunity to invest in a clean industry.''
If the state cannot afford to maintain and operate historic sites, Mr. Moffitt said, it should give nonprofit groups the option to serve as custodians. He said that Knox College in Galesburg, the last standing site of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, could be asked to staff the Sandburg site as a way for young scholars to learn about history.
Pride in the state's Lincoln assets has fostered good will by some artists. A copper sword that disappeared from the Lincoln Tomb Site in November was later recovered, broken in two. The 16-year-old boy who was charged in the theft said he had grabbed at the sword and was surprised when it snapped.
It was unclear whether the state could afford to repair or replace the old sword, but some artists have come to the rescue.
''We have some sculptors who have stepped forward to donate their time,'' Mr. Blanchette said. ''They have promised that it will be repaired or replaced, whatever it takes.''

HEADLINE: New Treasury Rules Ease 401(k) Annuity Purchase

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
It is one of the biggest conundrums of an aging society: Americans have salted away $11 trillion in retirement plans, yet millions still risk running out of money in old age.
On Thursday the government said it had some new tools to deal with the problem. The Treasury issued several new regulations intended to make it easier, and maybe cheaper, for middle-class people in retirement to transfer the money they accumulated in their 401(k)s into an annuity that would guarantee monthly payments until they die.
''Having the ability to choose from expanded options will help retirees and their families achieve both greater value and security,'' said Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. 
The Labor Department also said it had completed rules to let workers learn about the fees various financial firms charge for helping to run 401(k) plans. Labor officials said they thought employers could negotiate better terms if the details were more easily available.
The risk of outliving one's assets has moved front and center in recent years, as companies have frozen or ended their traditional, defined-benefit pension plans and replaced them with 401(k) plans. Traditional pension plans offer what is, in fact, an annuity, a stream of guaranteed payments from retirement to death. But fewer and fewer employers want to be running an annuity business on the side.
Insurance companies, on the other hand, are eager to wade into what they consider a big and attractive market of graying Americans with I.R.A. and 401(k) balances and little idea of what to do with them. But they have held back, in part, because of tax rules, which Treasury is easing.
One of the changes proposed Thursday would make it easier for employers to work with annuity providers, so that workers can learn about their annuity options at work, rather than having to go to a financial planner or broker.
''I'm trying not to jump up and down in my office, actually,'' said Jody Strakosch, national director of annuities for MetLife, who was asked about the new rules while she was reading the 47-page tome from Treasury.
She said MetLife had had suitable annuity contracts available since 2004, but had been selling them mostly to the retail market and not to employers who offer retirement savings plans.
J. Mark Iwry, an official at the Treasury department, said the department hoped in particular to foster a workplace market for ''longevity insurance,'' something much discussed in policy circles but that employers rarely make available to workers when they retire.
Longevity insurance consists of an annuity whose stream of payments does not start until the retiree is well into retirement -- say, 80 or 85 years old. That is the point where policy makers think many will need the money, because they will have exhausted their savings or developed costly health problems. The insurance would kick in and supplement Social Security. Like Social Security, the longevity insurance payments would keep coming every month until the retiree's death. But because the policy would pay nothing in the first 15 to 20 years of a person's retirement, it would cost much less than a conventional annuity.
A white paper by the Council of Economic Advisors estimated, for example, that a 65-year-old would have to pay $277,500 for a $20,000-a-year annuity that started immediately, but only $35,200 for one that started at age 85.
With a price so much lower than a conventional annuity, employees would be able to buy longevity insurance to cover their riskiest years with just a portion of their 401(k) account balance.
Most employers that offer annuities give retiring workers an either-or choice: the whole balance as a big check, or the whole thing to buy an annuity. Tax rules make it complicated to calculate the values if the amount is split, so those rules are being relaxed.
When the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan let people spend just part of their balance on longevity insurance, there was an increase in participation.
''They found a dramatic pickup in the number of people who were able to take a partial annuity,'' said Ms. Strakosch. (MetLife provides the Thrift Savings Plan's annuities.)
The Treasury also capped the maximum amount of retirement plan money that could be spent on longevity insurance at 25 percent of the account balance, up to $100,000. Mr. Iwry said that would keep high earners from improperly sheltering money, and minimize any effect of the changes on federal tax revenue.
Treasury is also changing the way of calculating required minimum distributions -- the amounts that people over 70 are required to withdraw from their 401(k) plans every year. The new method would exclude any money that went to an insurance company to buy longevity insurance or an annuity.
Some of the rules take effect immediately; other changes are in the public comment period.

HEADLINE: Stagnant Job Growth Is Expected In Report

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
7:57 p.m. Updated The economic pie is growing, but the share going to American workers is at a record low. Friday's jobs report is expected to show that Americans are not on their way to getting a bigger cut.
Much is at stake in the Labor Department report, which economists predict will reflect unemployment stagnating at 8.5 percent in January. Lackluster job growth could bolster the Republican argument that President Obama's economic policies are leaving American workers behind. 
The economy has been growing now for 10 straight quarters. It has even made up the ground lost from the recession, and the United States now churns out more goods and services than it did before the downturn began in 2007. But that output is being produced with six million fewer workers, despite population growth.
As a result, the share of income produced in the country that is flowing to workers' bank accounts has been steadily shrinking.
Of every dollar of income earned in the United States in the third quarter of 2011 - the latest period for which data is available - just 44 cents went to workers' wages and salaries. That is the smallest share since the government began keeping track in 1947, according to the Commerce Department, and it continues a trend that predates the Great Recession. The average share of national income going to wages and salaries over the last 50 years has been about 57.6 cents on the dollar. If you include workers' benefits in the calculation for the third quarter, the share of national income received by workers rises to 54.5 percent. But that measure is also at its lowest level since 1955.
On the other hand, American businesses are doing extremely well.
Tepid job growth, stagnant wages for existing employees and growing international demand for American products have all helped corporate profit margins reach all-time highs, according to two different measures from the Department of Commerce and from earnings per share in the S.&P. 500.
As a result, it is primarily corporations and their shareholders, rather than workers, who are benefiting from the American recovery.
Of every dollar in income earned in the United States, more than 10 cents goes to corporations. That's up from 7.3 cents per dollar of income when the recession began at the end of 2007.
The economy is not a zero-sum game; when the overall economic pie grows, the size of each slice can become bigger too. That means corporate gains and worker gains can be complementary, and in the United States they usually are. After all, companies need workers to help them make all the stuff that earns them profits.
What is happening, though, is that many companies are sitting on their cash or investing it in capital equipment rather than investing it in new workers.
This trend cannot go on forever, of course; there are only so many additional goods and services that can be squeezed out of an existing work force, even with new technologies that make workers more productive.
The question is how long it will take for companies to pick up the pace of hiring and raising wages, and by extension - though not for altruistic reasons - help workers get a bigger share of the pie.
Friday's report on hiring in January should provide some enlightenment on this question.
The nation has had a net gain in jobs for 15 consecutive months - or five quarters, exactly half as long as it has been expanding its output. In those 15 months, the country has averaged a net gain of 137,000 jobs a month. That is about the number needed just to keep up with population growth.
It is also almost exactly the number that economists expect Friday's report to show for January. The median forecast is 135,000 jobs, compared with 200,000 jobs added in December.
If the forecasts are accurate, then, in January the nation's employers did nothing to shrink the backlog of unemployed workers. And if so, they did nothing to narrow the gap between the recovery gains going to labor and those going to the corporate sector.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Philippine Officials Say Raid Killed Militants

BYLINE: By FLOYD WHALEY

 BODY:
MANILA -- Philippine military officials said Thursday that an early-morning raid had killed one of the top leaders of a regional terrorist network with links to Al Qaeda, as well as other senior terrorism suspects wanted by the United States.
The officials said that government forces killed Zulkifli bin Hir, considered to be a senior leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorism network. The United States had posted a $5 million reward for his capture or killing. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation lists Mr. Zulkifli, a Malaysian who also uses the name Marwan, among its most wanted terrorists, identifying him as a member of Jemaah Islamiyah's central command. Trained as an engineer in the United States, Mr. Zulkifli has been accused of conducting bomb-making training for terrorist organizations, including the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines.
Philippine officials said that the strikes also killed Abdullah Ali, a Singaporean who goes by Muawiyah. Mr. Ali carried a $50,000 reward from the United States and was also considered a leader of Jemaah Islamiyah.
An Abu Sayyaf leader, Umbra Jumdail, as well as more than a dozen other local militants, were also said to have died in the operation.
''These are notorious terrorist leaders,'' Lt. Col. Randolph Cabangbang, a military spokesman in the area, said by telephone. ''Their deaths will weaken the capabilities of the Abu Sayyaf.''
The predawn raid in a densely forested area near the town of Parang, on Jolo Island, came about after informants alerted the military and the police to the presence of a large number of militants, including foreigners, in an area known as a hide-out for Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah, Colonel Cabangbang said.
Security analysts in the region were cautious about speculating on the implications of the deaths of the high-profile figures, noting that there were only field reports at this point and no confirmation of their identities.
''Our sources say that government security forces are still trying to validate the identity of those killed, as the military could not immediately recover the bodies from the forested area,'' said Mars Buan, a senior analyst with the Manila-based risk consultancy Pacific Strategies and Assessments.
She continued: ''It is still uncertain whether the bodies even included the three personalities. The Abu Sayyaf group reportedly took with them some of the casualties.''
Colonel Cabangbang confirmed that while the verification of who was killed was continuing, the Philippine military was confident, based on field reports, that the high-profile figures were among them.
Ms. Buan noted that even if the strikes were confirmed to have killed the senior leaders, it was not clear that Abu Sayyaf, which has been conducting kidnappings, bombings and beheadings for two decades, would be weakened.
''The Abu Sayyaf group remains a resilient force,'' she said. ''They continue to attract new recruits from among family members, as well as from the disenfranchised, poor and unemployed people of Sulu who believe they have no other option but to join the militant group.''
Bryony Lau, an analyst with the International Crisis Group who is based in Jakarta, Indonesia, was similarly skeptical about the impact of the raid on Thursday.
''The Abu Sayyaf group is quite decentralized,'' Ms. Lau said. ''When high-profile figures have been killed in the past, you still have the Abu Sayyaf operating. As to whether or not this is a significant blow to the group, that would be an extremely difficult judgment to make at this point.''

HEADLINE: Message of a New Crop of Republican Candidates: It's Not Just About Cuts

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Two years ago, the Republican primary was teeming with angry conservatives stirred up by federal fiscal policy. Not all of them were Tea Party members, but all of them seemed to get labeled that way. Whatever the description, their effect on last year's legislative session was clear.
Nobody was going to talk positively about spending, and nobody was going to lift a finger on a new tax. 
That's what the voters apparently wanted, and that's what they got.
It didn't suit all the conservatives in Texas government and politics, and some of them are betting that voters, now that they are seeing the results, won't like it, either. The hypothesis here -- and an election is a fast way to test it -- is that even conservatives want government to function. Maybe they don't like the state's cuts in education and health and human services, or sitting in crowded traffic on underbuilt highway systems, or watching grass wilt in the face of a record drought in a state whose government won't finance its water plan.
Maybe they don't mind, and government in Texas is doing just what the voters want. Either way, the test is coming. The primary ballots -- such as they are in the current redistricting sandstorm -- are sprinkled with conservative Republicans who have served on school boards or who say they are running to re-emphasize the government's responsibility in that realm.
Businesses are looking, too, wondering how to get things done in a Legislature preoccupied with money. Some are forming the Texas Conservative Roundtable, an advocacy organization trying to apply business answers to legislative problems. The group's president, Julie Caruthers Parsley, and its executive director, Bryan Hebert, said they wouldn't have a political action committee but would weigh in, lobbying and stirring grass-roots support, on issues like taxes, regulations and government spending. ''You can't just say no to everything,'' Ms. Parsley said.
Other groups have used some of those same tools -- speeches, social media, advertising, e-mail campaigns -- to promote budget cuts and small government. Ms. Parsley said that they were not in opposition to that, but there was room for another voice.
It's a tack you've probably heard from legislators. It's easier to talk about financing a water plan, for instance, when lakes all over the state are ringed by barren shorelines that are normally underwater. Lawmakers can talk about how a persistent refusal to raise gasoline taxes has choked construction of new highways and delayed maintenance on existing ones. Much of the budget is untouchable, and legislative cuts most often come from programs lawmakers really don't want to cut, like public education.
But the pressures of campaigns -- and perhaps the hearts of Texas voters -- are still with the knife. Cuts are good. Growth in spending is bad. It's true in both primaries, but it's especially true in the Republican primary.
''We have the same tensions that are going on at a national level, and fights over who is pure or not,'' said Representative Burt Solomons, Republican of Carrollton, who is not running for re-election. ''Everybody is trying to out-adjective each other. I got in when all you had to be was a Republican. Now, being a Republican isn't good enough anymore -- you have to be a conservative Republican.''
At a forum for United States Senate Republican candidates on Wednesday, Ted Cruz, a former state solicitor general, took aim at Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, one of his opponents. ''If you think what we need is a moderate and a conciliator, then you want him,'' Mr. Cruz told the group. ''But if you think what we need is a fighter, vote for me.''
That works with some part of the Republican primary electorate. The ''Let's stop fighting and get something done'' line espoused by people like Tom Leppert -- another candidate in that primary -- resonates with another.
Which group is bigger? That's the first question, and there's an old rule in civics that says you don't get to govern if you don't win the election. The corollary is that you have to govern according to what you did to win that election. If your government doesn't function, voters will throw you out for your lousy management instead of for your dubious orthodoxy.
''You've got to have some reasonable people to be able to govern,'' Mr. Solomons said. ''You can't just scream at each other.''

HEADLINE: Turbines in the Backyard: The Sound and the Strobes

BYLINE: By ANDY WEBSTER

 BODY:
We can all agree that energy independence is a worthy objective, right? Alternative energy sources like solar power can help free the United States from fossil fuels and the grip of unstable Persian Gulf states. And wind power -- wait, not so fast, says ''Windfall,''Laura Israel's urgent, informative and artfully assembled documentary. An account of rural Meredith, in upstate New York, when wind turbines came to town, the film depicts the perils of a booming industry and the bitter rancor it sowed among a citizenry. 
In 2004 residents of this once-flourishing dairy center were approached by companies offering to pay a nominal fee to erect turbines on their property while insisting on confidentiality agreements (to keep competitors ignorant of costs). Economically beset, some people, like Ron and Sue Bailey, jumped at first. But others, like Keitha Capouya, now the town supervisor, dug into the research and sounded an alarm.
Turbines are huge: some are 40 stories tall, with 130-foot blades weighing seven tons and spinning at 150 miles an hour. They can fall over or send parts flying; struck by lightning, say, they can catch fire. Their 24/7 rotation emits nerve-racking low frequencies (like a pulsing disco) amplified by rain and moisture, and can generate a disorienting strobe effect in sunlight. Giant flickering shadows can tarnish a sunset's glow on a landscape.
People in Lowville, N.Y., farther north, express despair on camera at having caved to the wind companies' entreaties; Bovina, N.Y., banned turbines entirely. Meredith is riven by the issue, which pits the Planning Board against the Town Board and neighbor against neighbor. Former city dwellers escaping urban anxieties are surprised to see themselves as activists. Concerns like setback (the distance of turbines from a property line) are debated.
Government officials are seen only in glimpses of television talk shows. Conspicuously absent are representatives of corporations like Airtricity, Enxco or Horizon Wind Energy (though the financier and wind advocate T. Boone Pickens comes off as a wolf in good-old-boy clothing). And despite Ms. Israel's inspired use of a local demolition derby as a metaphor for Meredith's struggles, her accelerated pacing almost overheats.
But the film's implications are clear: The quest for energy independence comes with caveats. Developers' motives must be weighed, as should the risks Americans are willing to take in their own backyard. Despite BP's three-month blanketing of Gulf of Mexico beaches in crude oil; the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan; and the possible impact of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) on the water table, energy companies remain eager to plunder nature's bounty in pursuit of profit.
Windfall
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Directed by Laura Israel; narrated by Chuck Coggins; director of photography, Brian Jackson; edited by Ms. Israel, Stacey Foster and Alex Bingham; music by Hazmat Modine and Barbes Records; produced by Ms. Israel and Autumn Tarleton; released by First Run Features. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 23 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Class in America: Exploring the Divide

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Great Divorce'' (column, Jan. 31):
If, as David Brooks predicts, there is not ''another book this year as important as Charles Murray's 'Coming Apart,' '' it will mean that we are as intellectually bereft as Mr. Murray says we are socially. Mr. Murray documents what may be important social and economic phenomena, but interprets them, predictably, as the fault of the so-called welfare state.
Had he analyzed them more thoughtfully and less politically, it would have been hard to avoid implicating market forces, which have driven the loss of working-class jobs; supply-side economics, which has driven the loss of progressivity in the tax system; deregulation, which has caused a whole series of economic disasters; and right-wing ideology, which has helped destroy unionism. 
Mr. Brooks mocks the importance of these changes by suggesting that it can all be fixed by a National Service Program, which would force members of these divergent classes to spend some quality time together.
The gap between rich and poor is real, and growing. The solution is not in fraternization, and it is certainly not in blaming those who have suffered most. The solution, as President Obama suggested in his State of the Union address, is closing the gap.
DAVID BERMAN New York, Jan. 31, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks's idea for education of the ''lower tribe'' is admirable. He should, however, expand the concept. Members of the ''upper tribe'' should, for a period of not less than five years, be required to live on a salary of approximately $30,000 per year, without benefits, while supporting two children. The spouse must work a part-time, minimum-wage job in the service economy, preferably the night shift in a convenience store.
It's very possible that the upper tribe would learn that the social disintegration that Mr. Brooks attributes to the lower tribe is the effect, not the cause, of its members' daunting economic condition.
The view from the bottom might redefine ''class warfare'' as being something other than asking the upper tribes to pay a slightly higher marginal income tax rate. The upper tribe might view entitlements as necessities rather than costs that must be cut to reduce the national debt. Universal health care, child care, reasonable higher-education costs, job training, affordable housing and a livable minimum wage would become national priorities.
ASHER R. FRIED New York, Jan. 31, 2012
To the Editor:
Reading David Brooks's column evoked social analyses from late 1800s America that depicted immigrants, such as the Irish and the Italians, as lazy, slovenly and lacking in virtue. The ethnic appellations have been dropped, but the same portrait is drawn of the ''lower tribe.''
Ah, if only they could benefit from rubbing shoulders with the industrious, virtuous ''upper tribe'' instead of being subjected to the siren song of food stamps and unemployment insurance. We don't need a social safety net; we need finishing schools on ''1950s traditionalist values and practices.''
That our economic crisis was brought on by members of that ''virtuous'' upper tribe might trouble those of us parsing what Mr. Brooks and Charles Murray mean by virtue.
LEILA KIPP Seattle, Jan. 31, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks argues for a National Service Program that would bring together the upper and lower classes. He states, ''If we could jam the tribes together, we'd have a better elite and a better mass.'' A well-financed, integrated public school system that pulls together students from different neighborhoods would serve the same purpose.
GERARDINE CARROLL Seattle, Feb. 1, 2012
The writer is a public high school teacher.
To the Editor:
David Brooks is right that national service is a vital tool for building bridges between different ''social tribes.'' National service programs such as the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps also do far more: they deliver real benefits to communities while forging a stronger civil society.
And today, in a time of alarmingly high unemployment and underemployment rates among America's young people, a strong emphasis on national service can help the next generation build necessary leadership and employment skills, regardless of which ''social tribe'' they come from.
Despite our current economic woes -- in fact, because of them -- a renewed commitment to expanding national service opportunities should be a major bipartisan goal and a key element of American policy.
JON ROSENBERG New York, Jan. 31, 2012
The writer is chief executive of Repair the World, which promotes service opportunities for American Jews.

HEADLINE: A New Resource for Hiring Programmers Has Become Entirely Too Successful

BYLINE: By SHANE SHIFFLETT. 
sshifflett@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
When Brandon Bickford was helping to hire software developers to fill Minted.com's office, he and his colleagues had to divert attention away from an expensive and time-consuming process of sifting through dozens or hundreds of resumes and then sending tests to the best applicants in the stack. 
Finding the best software developers in the hotly competitive Bay Area is ''a full-time job,'' said Mr. Bickford, 31, one of the first developers at Yelp and, until last November, the chief software architect of Minted.com.
Competition for software talent is so fierce that some companies have resorted to buying smaller start-ups in order to absorb their best employees. But buying entire companies to get a handful of talented programmers is a pipe dream for most Bay Area start-ups, so a new class of job sites is emerging to help companies identify the best candidates.
''One bad hire can really cripple a small business,'' said Krista Canfield, senior manager of corporate communications at LinkedIn.
GitHire is one of a few tech-job sites that home in on talent by analyzing a programmer's code available on the Internet and online presence and then assigning a rank relative to his or her peers. The goal is to find ''diamonds in the rough,'' said Rhett Creighton, who co-founded the site with Dane Jensen -- talented but obscure candidates an employer might never otherwise discover.
When GitHire, based in Austin, Tex., began operations three weeks ago, it did so with a bold promise: it would find five talented programmers, who could be interviewed by phone -- for a $1,000 fee.
Instantly, it was flooded with more orders than it could handle and raised the fee to tamp down interest.
''They're hoping we are the answer to finding talent easier,'' Mr. Creighton said of his clients.
If GitHire's rankings gain a reputation for being reliable, they could have an impact similar to a credit score's effect on lending decisions, Mr. Creighton said. But for now the scores are based primarily on a simple metric: popularity. In a method that is similar to the way Google originally ranked Web sites, GitHire elevates a programmer's status based on the attention that other developers are paying to his or her profile.
Because of the high demand for its services, GitHire has run into a snag on delivering on its five-qualified-candidate promise in the Bay Area because of a dearth of specialized programmers here.
According to data from the California Employment Development Department, more than 8,000 developer jobs have been added in the Bay Area since April 2009, bringing the total to nearly 40,000 -- a pace not seen since the dot-com bubble.
But the tech industry's top companies are still hungry for qualified candidates to fill a surplus of vacancies.
GitHire did not exist when Mr. Bickford was in need of programmers at Minted.com. But he appreciates the need for its services and its novel approach to finding talent.
''Top programmers are like a race car,'' he said. ''Once you get them you don't want to lose them and you want to get as many as you can.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Is Avoiding Tough Sanctions For Large Banks

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as the Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped up its investigations of Wall Street in the last decade, the agency has repeatedly allowed the biggest firms to avoid punishments specifically meant to apply to fraud cases.
By granting exemptions to laws and regulations that act as a deterrent to securities fraud, the S.E.C. has let financial giants like JPMorganChase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America continue to have advantages reserved for the most dependable companies, making it easier for them to raise money from investors, for example, and to avoid liability from lawsuits if their financial forecasts turn out to be wrong.
An analysis by The New York Times of S.E.C. investigations over the last decade found nearly 350 instances where the agency has given big Wall Street institutions and other financial companies a pass on those or other sanctions. Those instances also include waivers permitting firms to underwrite certain stock and bond sales and manage mutual fund portfolios.
JPMorganChase, for example, has settled six fraud cases in the last 13 years, including one with a $228 million settlement last summer, but it has obtained at least 22 waivers, in part by arguing that it has ''a strong record of compliance with securities laws.'' Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which merged in 2009, have settled 15 fraud cases and received at least 39 waivers. 
Only about a dozen companies -- Dell, General Electric and United Rentals among them -- have felt the full force of the law after issuing misleading information about their businesses. Citigroup was the only major Wall Street bank among them. In 11 years, it settled six fraud cases and received 25 waivers before it lost most of its privileges in 2010.
By granting those waivers, the S.E.C. allowed Wall Street firms to have powerful advantages, securities experts and former regulators say. The institutions remained protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which makes it easier to avoid class-action shareholder lawsuits.
And the companies continue to use rules that let them instantly raise money publicly, without waiting weeks for government approvals. Without the waivers, the companies could not move as quickly as rivals that had not settled fraud charges to sell stocks or bonds when market conditions were most favorable.
Other waivers allowed Wall Street firms that had settled fraud or lesser charges to continue managing mutual funds and to help small, private companies raise money from investors -- two types of business from which they otherwise would be excluded.
''The ramifications of losing those exemptions are enormous to these firms,'' David S. Ruder, a former S.E.C. chairman, said in an interview. Without the waivers, agreeing to settle charges of securities fraud ''might have vast repercussions affecting the ability of a firm to continue to stay in business,'' he said.
S.E.C. officials say that they grant the waivers to keep stock and bond markets open to companies with legitimate capital-raising needs. Ensuring such access is as important to its mission as protecting investors, regulators said.
The agency usually revokes the privileges when a case involves false or misleading statements about a company's own business. It does not do so when the commission has charged a Wall Street firm with lying about, say, a specific mortgage security that it created and is selling to investors, a charge Goldman Sachs settled in 2010. Different parts of the company -- corporate officers versus a sales force, for example -- are responsible for different types of statements, officials say.
''The purpose of taking away this simplified path to capital is to protect investors, not to punish a company,'' said Meredith B. Cross, the S.E.C.'s corporation finance director, referring to the fast-track offering privilege. ''You're not seeing the times that waivers aren't being granted, because the companies don't ask when they know the answer will be no.''
Others, however, argue that the pattern is another example of the government being too soft on Wall Street as it has become a much larger part of the economy in recent decades.
President Obama, in his State of the Union address, asked Congress last week for tougher laws that make ''the penalties for fraud count.'' Federal judges in New York and Wisconsin recently criticized the S.E.C. for its habit of settling cases by allowing companies to promise not to violate the law in the future.
The commission has frequently turned the other cheek when the companies again settle similar fraud cases. S.E.C. officials have defended that practice by saying they do not have the resources to take cases to court rather than settle. They recently asked Congress to toughen laws and to raise financial penalties for fraud violations.
But the repeated granting of waivers suggests that the agency does in fact have tools it often does not use, critics say. Close to half of the waivers went to repeat offenders -- Wall Street firms that had settled previous fraud charges by agreeing never again to violate the very laws that the S.E.C. was now saying that they had broken.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who serves on committees that oversee the S.E.C., said he was baffled that the agency had recently asked Congress for more enforcement powers when it had ceded much of the power it already had.
''It's really hard to see why the S.E.C. isn't using all of its weapons to deter fraud,'' he said. ''It makes already weak punishment even weaker by waiving the regulations that impose significant consequences on the companies that settle fraud charges. No wonder recidivism is such a problem.''
The Times analysis found 11 instances where companies that had settled fraud cases had actually lost the special privilege for fast-track stock or bond offerings, versus 49 times that the S.E.C. granted waivers from the punishment to Wall Street firms since 2005. The analysis counted 91 waivers since 2000 granting immunity from lawsuits, and 204 waivers related to raising money for small companies and managing mutual funds.
The S.E.C. does not maintain a central database of how many companies lose special status or are denied waivers. Its records of granted waivers are scattered across several databases on its Web site.
JPMorganChase is among the big Wall Street firms that have been granted multiple waivers with nearly every settlement of S.E.C. fraud charges. Last July, it agreed to pay $228 million to settle civil and criminal charges that it cheated cities and towns by rigging bids with other Wall Street firms to invest the money raised by several municipalities for capital projects.
JPMorgan received three waivers related to that case for privileges that it otherwise would have lost. But the S.E.C. said the company's fraudulent actions didn't involve misleading investors about JPMorgan's business.
''That distinction doesn't do it for me,'' said Richard W. Painter, a corporate law professor at the University of Minnesota and the co-author of a casebook on securities litigation and enforcement. ''If a company has trouble telling the truth to investors in one batch of securities it is underwriting, I would not have confidence that it would tell the truth to investors about its own securities.''
Despite six securities fraud settlements in 13 years, JPMorgan rarely if ever lost any special privileges. It has been awarded at least 22 waivers since 2003, with most of its S.E.C. settlements generating two or more. In seeking the reprieves, lawyers for JPMorgan stated in letters to the S.E.C. that it should grant a waiver because the company has ''a strong record of compliance with the securities laws.'' The company declined to comment for this article.
Citigroup is one of the rare Wall Street giants that has lost significant privileges recently. In October 2010, the bank paid $75 million to settle charges that it misled investors in 2007 about the size of its holdings of assets backed by subprime mortgages. The company told investors that it had about $13 billion of those risky investments on its balance sheet, when it really had more than $50 billion, according to the S.E.C.
Because those accusations involved Citigroup's statements about its own financial well-being, the company lost for three years the ability to insulate itself from lawsuits over mistaken predictions about its business. It also lost, for the same three years, the exemption for ''well-known seasoned issuers,'' which allowed it to quickly raise capital in the securities markets. As a result, Citigroup has had to file thousands of pages of new documents with the S.E.C. and wait weeks for the agency's approvals to make itself eligible to sell stocks, bonds and other securities to the public.
Citigroup declined to comment on whether the sanctions have had any effect on its business.
Wrangling over waivers is an important part of the negotiations when companies accused of fraud discuss a settlement with the S.E.C., and sometimes it can involve a form of corporate plea bargaining to a lesser charge.
In 2009, the S.E.C. was negotiating with Bank of America over charges that it had failed to disclose to shareholders that billions of dollars in bonuses were being paid to Merrill Lynch executives just as Bank of America was bailing out the firm.
Because the S.E.C. charges involved fraudulent statements by both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch about their financial status, the merged company was in danger of losing its special privileges for both offerings and forecasts. According to a report by the then-S.E.C. inspector general, H. David Kotz, the waiver issue ''was of such importance to B. of A. that the settlement became contingent on B. of A.'s receipt of the waiver.''
Bank of America apparently won the argument but would not comment on it. It settled the case by agreeing to a $150 million payment. The S.E.C., however, decided not to charge the bank with fraud, which could have endangered the bank's special status. Instead, the S.E.C. charged Bank of America with violating disclosure rules for shareholder materials and proxies, and Bank of America kept its privileges.
S.E.C. officials said they would not discuss how they arrived at specific settlements and declined to comment on the Citigroup, JP Morgan or Bank of America settlements.
Thomas Lee Hazen, a securities law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that it is understandable that the S.E.C. might relax some potential sanctions on Wall Street firms -- where it appears that lessons have been learned, or when a fine is thought to be sufficient punishment.
''The ripple effect of having a sanction that could shut them down or could seriously impede a company's operations would seriously affect a lot of innocent customers,'' he said.

 MANDEL NGAN/A.F.P. -- GETTY IMAGES) (A3) CHARTS: Giving Wall Street a Break: Companies that have settled securities fraud cases with the government are excluded from certain benefits by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But an analysis of S.E.C. documents by The New York Times found that the commission routinely waived those exclusions for Wall Street firms. In total, the S.E.C. issued at least 344 waivers. Those shown below allowed the banks to keep their status as ''well-known seasoned issuers,'' and to be protected when making forward-looking statements. (Source: N.Y.

10:30 A.M. (Nickelodeon) MIKE THE KNIGHT This new computer-animated series invites preschoolers into an enchanted medieval world of castles, dragons and trolls while teaching about friendship, loyalty and determination as they follow the adventures of Mike, a knight in training, above left. His motto is ''Be a knight, do it right,'' which he accomplishes with the help of his trusty steed, Galahad, and the friendly dragons Squirt and Sparkie. The series, which will be broadcast weekdays at noon starting Monday, was created by Alexander Bar (''Lunar Jim'') and written by Marc Seal (''Bob the Builder''). 
2:25 P.M. (Sundance) PARIS (2008) Romain Duris plays Pierre, a dancer at the Moulin Rouge who is awaiting a heart transplant that could save his life. Juliette Binoche is Elise, his older, divorced sister, a social worker who moves into his apartment with her three children to care for him -- and in the process opens his eyes to the city's possibilities. A subplot follows the romantic misadventures of a history professor (Fabrice Luchini) who becomes so besotted with a beautiful student (Melanie Laurent) that he sends her anonymous text messages, some in cyberspeak -- ''U R awesome. I'm 2 hot 4 U.'' -- and others quoting the love poetry of Baudelaire. ''In 'Paris,' Cedric Klapisch's sumptuous Gallic comedy, the camera, whether surveying the landmarks from on high or peering out of an apartment window at the passing parade, becomes a surrogate for a first-time visitor to the City of Light,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''Both a Parisian answer to Woody Allen's 'Manhattan' and a multicharacter mosaic in the mode of Robert Altman's 'Short Cuts,' the movie sprawls invitingly across the screen like a glowing Impressionist painting.''
2:30 P.M. (AMC) JEREMIAH JOHNSON (1972) An ex-soldier, portrayed by a scruffily golden Robert Redford, right, opts out of civilized society in the 1850s to live alone in the Colorado wilderness, where he unwittingly violates an Indian burial ground and loses his wife and adopted child to vengeance. Parts of this stark meditation on the American West, directed by Sydney Pollack, were shot near the Utah ski area Mr. Redford eventually bought and named Sundance, after his character in ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.''
8 P.M. (NBC) WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? Martin Sheen, below, traces his ancestry in this Season 3 opener. Traveling to Ireland, he learns of an uncle's ties to the Irish Civil War and discovers a shared passion: his devotion to activism. Moving on to Spain, Mr. Sheen uncovers another relative who fought against social injustice and was imprisoned during Franco's regime. And delving back into the 1700s he unearths a family secret.
8:30 P.M. (13) NEED TO KNOW The monthly ''Help Wanted'' segment visits Nevada on the eve of the Republican presidential caucuses and reports on the foreclosure problem in the state, which has had the highest rate for more than four years. In ''American Voices'' the writer Marcos Villatoro argues that work creates happiness, and that President Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to establish the Civilian Conservation Corps saved a generation of unemployed Americans, including Mr. Villatoro's father.
9 P.M. (DIY) MAN CAVES Jason Cameron and Tony Siragusa begin a new season of giving men what they really want: a room of their own. First up is Mitch McGuire, a former Marine intent on staking out his turf in a house filled with women. At 9:30 Mr. Cameron and Mr. Siragusa create a hyper-masculine bedroom and lounge for Kris Humphries, the Nets player and spurned husband of Kim Kardashian.
10 P.M. (TBS) THE HOUSE BUNNY (2008) An exiled Playboy bunny in stilettos (Anna Faris) stumbles into a gig as the house mother to misfit sorority sisters and finds her calling as their expedition leader through the land of men. But first, makeovers.

HEADLINE: Fourth-Quarter Profit and Revenue Declined at The New York Times Company

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported on Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit declined 12.2 percent as rising subscription and digital advertising revenue at its largest newspapers could not offset the continued drop-off in print advertising.
Net income was $58.9 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with $67.1 million, or 44 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 
For the full year, the company reported a net loss of $39.7 million, or 27 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $107.7 million, or 71 cents a share, in 2010.
Revenue for the fourth quarter declined 2.8 percent, to $643 million. For the year, revenue at the Times Company was $2.32 billion, down 2.9 percent. Operating profit fell 4.5 percent, to $106.7 million, for the quarter and dropped 75.8 percent, to $56.7 million, for the year.
The results reflected the continuing struggles of print advertising throughout the industry, as marketers and readers continue to migrate online. Across the company, advertising revenue declined 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Print advertising was down 7.8 percent and digital advertising declined 4.9 percent, dragged down by a 25.9 percent revenue drop-off at the company's About.com property.
The results were brighter at the company's News Media Group, which includes The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune. There, digital advertising was up 5.3 percent and circulation revenue was up 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting the growth of online subscriptions at The Times.
Still, every main advertising category spent less at the company's newspapers in the most recent quarter than they did in the period a year earlier, led by real estate classified advertising, which fell 17.3 percent.
In a continued effort to shed its peripheral assets, the Times Company also said on Thursday that it had agreed to sell an additional part of its stake in the Fenway Sports Group, owner of the Boston Red Sox, for $30 million, pending the approval of Major League Baseball. Last July, the company sold more than half its stake to three separate buyers for $117 million.
The $39.7 million loss for 2011 includes a $161.3 million write-down, largely from the company's smaller regional newspapers in Florida, Alabama and elsewhere. The Times Company announced in December that it had agreed to sell its regional newspapers for $143 million to Halifax Media Holdings, but that sale is not reflected in the 2011 figures.
The results come as the Times Company begins its search for a chief executive to succeed Janet L. Robinson, who left the company after seven years in the post when the issue of a leadership change was raised by the company's chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. Her departure cost the company $4.5 million in a retirement and consulting agreement, or 2 cents a share. Ms. Robinson's total exit package could reach five times that amount, according to people with knowledge of her severance package who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
Last March, the company introduced its digital pay subscription service at NYTimes.com, viewed by many analysts as a risky, but potentially crucial, factor in the company's financial future.
In the six months ended Sept. 30, The Times had 324,000 digital subscribers, making it the second-largest paid subscription Web site among newspapers behind The Wall Street Journal's 537,469 subscribers, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Sulzberger said digital subscriptions represented ''a robust new revenue stream,'' though the company declined to disclose how many new digital subscribers its flagship newspaper had gained in the quarter.
Despite a tough economic climate, Mr. Sulzberger said the company remained committed to financing a ''large and robust news organization.'' He added that ''quality journalism and content are at the core of our brand strategy.''
He thanked Ms. Robinson and Martin A. Nisenholtz, a senior vice president who helped shape The Times's Web strategy and who also recently left the company. The Times Company's search for a new chief executive will focus on candidates with ''digital and brand-building experience,'' Mr. Sulzberger said.
Michael Golden, previously the chief executive of the Regional Media Group, will serve as the interim chief executive of the New England Media Group, which includes The Boston Globe, Mr. Sulzberger said.
Analysts said they expected a prolonged search for a new chief executive to lead the Sulzberger family-owned company. ''Can they find someone who can get along with the family? Can they get along with the union? Can they get along with the arrogant journalists who are paid a lot of money and don't like being told what to do?'' said Douglas Arthur, a publishing and media analyst at Evercore Partners.
Mr. Sulzberger said the ''economic environment remained challenging'' but added that the company would continue to look for ''new innovative approaches to expand our reach on new devices, in new markets and through social media.''
In a sign of the economic future newspapers will confront, digital advertising in 2011 accounted for a larger piece of overall advertising revenue -- about 27.7 percent compared with 26.3 percent in 2010. The company projected high single-digit circulation revenue growth in the first quarter of 2012, because of a 4 percent price increase on home delivery of The Times and a 50-cent increase on Monday-to-Saturday newsstand sales.
Online Correction: February 2, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the earnings per share for 2010. It was 71 cents, not 74 cents. The article also misstated the time period for the increase in digital advertising's share of overall advertising revenue. The figures are annual, not quarterly. A description of the 50-cent price increase for newsstand copies of The New York Times was incorrect, based on information from the Times Company. The price increase was for Monday through Saturday issues, not Monday through Friday. Finally, the company also referred imprecisely to the number of digital subscribers to NYTimes.com at the end of December. The number provided -- 390,000 -- included digital subscriptions to The International Herald Tribune, which were offered beginning in November. (That figure has been deleted from the article.)

HEADLINE: Incoming Sony Chief Inherits a Diminished Company

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- When Kazuo Hirai first joined the Sony family in 1984, the proud electronics maker was the definition of cutting-edge.
At the time, the Sony Walkman, the world's first portable music player, had been a global hit and game-changer for five years. Sony had just introduced the compact disc, and its Trinitron color televisions had become an industry standard. Shortly thereafter, Sony, flush with cash, acquired Columbia Pictures and CBS Records, declaring that it would build the ultimate electronics and entertainment company.
The Sony of today, of which Mr. Hirai is to take the helm, is a shadow of its former self, mirroring a decline in the wider Japanese consumer electronics industry. Sony has long lost its dominance in portable music players, unable to translate its Walkman success into the digital era. Its TV business, which has not been able to recover from a delay in developing flat-panel models, has not posted a profit in years. 
The company warned Thursday that it expected to post a fourth consecutive annual loss in the year ending in March, estimating a net loss of <5>220 billion, or $2.9 billion, as sluggish sales in markets overseas and a series of natural disasters weighed on its bottom line.
''I hold a very severe sense of crisis,'' Mr. Hirai said at a news conference Thursday, a day after being tapped to succeed Sony's president and chief executive, Howard Stringer, in April. ''Without a faster sense of speed, Sony cannot win.''
Staging a turnaround at Sony will be a daunting task. Unlike Apple, which is highly profitable -- in part because it outsources much of its manufacturing and hires a relatively small work force at home in the United States -- Sony has long protected employment in Japan and been slow to outsource production.
Mr. Stringer has started to change some of that.
He pushed aggressively to cut costs, to streamline Sony's sprawling businesses and to outsource more of the company's manufacturing. In December, Sony sold its stake in a flat-panel screen venture with Samsung Electronics, a move that is expected to expand Sony's outsourcing options further.
Mr. Stringer has also tried to better combine the company's hardware business with its music, movie and video game offerings, by investing in platforms like the popular PlayStation Network, which lets users download content onto Sony gadgets.
But the global economic crisis, which hurt Japanese exports and caused a severe recession in Japan, has helped foil a comeback at Sony. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan last March disrupted production at 10 Sony plants in the northern part of the country and severed vital supply chains. Severe flooding in Thailand, a manufacturing hub, also curtailed production last year, and a stubbornly strong yen continues to hurt Sony's competitiveness overseas.
Those woes knocked Sony to a net loss of <5>159 billion in the last three months of 2011. The company's chief financial officer, Masaru Kato, said Sony was aiming to return to profitability in the next fiscal year.
Mr. Stringer, who is set to become chairman of Sony's board, remains upbeat. ''The stage is set for recovery. The worst is nearly over,'' he said. ''We are shifting gears, and when you shift gears, you can go faster.''
Mr. Hirai, who is credited with resuscitating Sony's struggling video game unit, said he would focus on bolstering the company's core strengths, like digital cameras and video games. He also wants to increase investment in mobile technology, to focus on rebuilding the company's television business, and said he would abandon unprofitable product lines.
Of those goals, a turnaround in the television unit, which has lost money for years, may be Sony's toughest challenge. Sony has long suffered from rivals like Samsung and LG Electronics of South Korea, which have used their production prowess to flood global markets with far cheaper models.
But asked whether Sony might abandon its TV business altogether, Mr. Hirai was adamant: The company would not abandon a product still so central to home entertainment, he said. ''Sony will not retreat so easily.''

HEADLINE: White House Offers Plan To Lure Jobs To America

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In his State of the Union address, President Obama called for a wide-ranging package of policies to help create American manufacturing jobs, including trade enforcement measures, business tax breaks and worker training programs.
In many ways, the proposal is surprising, as few economists now consider manufacturing a potent engine for job growth in the United States. Manufacturers have added about 330,000 jobs in the country in the last two years. But the growth followed three decades of decline, during which companies like automakers and textile companies slashed payrolls by about 7.5 million. That has led many economists to say the recent turnaround might be nothing more than a correction from the depths of the recession.
But the administration argues that big trends -- like rising wages in developing countries, falling wages in America and a weaker dollar -- have made moving work to or keeping work in the United States a much more viable option. And they say that manufacturers will continue to add jobs domestically, especially with a little help from Washington. 
''We have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back,'' Mr. Obama said in his address to Congress. ''But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.''
The proposal stems from a belief that after ''a long period where people felt the wind was in our face, the wind is with us,'' said Gene Sperling, director of the White House National Economic Council. ''It's not fighting against the trends. It's actually working with them.''
Workers might command relatively high wages in the United States, but wages are climbing rapidly in countries like China and Brazil. High energy prices have increased shipping costs. And manufacturers argue that American workers frequently produce higher-quality goods and that American factories are closer to the markets for more sophisticated goods.
Those trends have led some companies to repatriate manufacturing jobs in the last few years, a development called on-shoring. General Electric has decided to move production of a water heater to Louisville, Ky., from China, for instance. NCR, a maker of self-service kiosks and automated teller machines, has shifted jobs to Columbus, Ga.
It is difficult to determine how many jobs American manufacturers are sending overseas or bringing back. But in a November survey by MFG.com, a site that connects manufacturers with suppliers, one in five North American manufacturers said they had brought production back from a ''low-cost'' country, up from about one in 10 manufacturers in early 2010.
Economists said that the administration could help sustain the trend. But they warned that the administration's proposal seemed unlikely to lead to major job growth, and said that many businesses would still hire lower-cost workers overseas.
''We're not going to get very labor-intensive, relatively low-skilled jobs in America, and I don't think we want them,'' said A. Michael Spence, a professor at New York University and Nobel laureate in economics. ''But sometimes it makes sense to have a little help developing technologies that will make us competitive. And sometimes public support for upgrading workers' skills makes sense.''
''The best we could possibly get is continued modest growth in manufacturing jobs,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington.
Mr. Bergsten noted that manufacturing continued to become more efficient, meaning companies needed fewer and fewer workers. American manufacturers produced roughly the same amount of goods in 2010 as they did a decade before, but they did so with six million fewer employees on their payrolls. Mr. Bergsten also argued that sending jobs to other countries continued to make sense for many global firms. ''You're trying to buck two major trends,'' he said.
Some economists also questioned whether Washington should be giving manufacturing a hand at all.
''It's totally implausible to think that there's going to be a surge in manufacturing jobs,'' said Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard. Broader measures to improve American infrastructure and education, he said, would be more effective in creating middle-class jobs.
But the White House says that manufacturing offers significant potential for new jobs -- jobs that require more skills and offer better pay than the assembly lines 30 or 40 years ago. And it says that even modest incentives might make a difference.
To that end, the administration has put together a far-ranging set of proposals: cutting taxes for manufacturers that produce goods in the United States, taking away tax breaks for businesses that move jobs offshore, doubling a tax deduction for makers of high-tech goods, providing support to businesses investing in areas where factories are closing, expanding worker training programs and creating a new task force to better enforce trade rules and intellectual property rights. Closing a loophole that allows companies to shift profits abroad would pay for the tax credits, the White House says.
It all adds up to what economists might call an industrial policy, the out-of-favor practice of using tariffs, taxes and other measures to help a particular industry. The White House avoids the term because it implies that the government is picking winners and losers. It argues that its proposals are a moderate plan to aid businesses deciding whether to move jobs overseas.
Countries like Germany, Japan and China offer far larger tax breaks and financing support to their manufacturers, the administration argues. Such countries have ''been in a bear hug'' with manufacturers, said Fred P. Hochberg, president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a federal agency. ''We've held them at arm's length.''
Mr. Hochberg said a focus on manufacturing and exports might lead to more sustainable growth. ''For the last three decades, we've relied on the U.S. consumer for growth,'' he said. ''But now we're seeing growth coming from an investment in infrastructure happening in the emerging economies,'' where American companies should be selling their wares and expertise.
The administration also called for a focus on manufacturing because of its spillover effects on the economy. ''We do believe that manufacturing punches above its weight economically,'' said Mr. Sperling of the National Economic Council. ''Advanced manufacturing is critical to your innovative capacity as a country.''

HEADLINE: In a Focus On Gold, History Repeats Itself

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
As it was in 1980, could it be again in 2012?
The 1980 presidential election was fought by a Democratic incumbent weakened by a poor economy amid worries that the United States had lost its ability to compete in the world. Gold prices had risen to unprecedented levels as the election approached, and the Republican nominee hinted he might propose a return to a gold standard.
That Republican, Ronald Reagan, won the election and soon appointed a commission to study the role of gold in monetary systems. To gold bugs, it appeared to be the best chance in decades to move the country toward gold and away from what they like to call ''fiat money,'' a currency anchored by nothing more than government dictates.
Last month, Newt Gingrich, seeking to widen his support in the days leading up to the South Carolina primary, promised that he would appoint a new gold commission. ''Part of our approach ought to be to re-establish something Ronald Reagan did in 1981 and that is to have a commission on gold to look at the whole concept of how do we get back to hard money,'' he said in a speech. 
''Hard money is a discipline,'' he added. ''It is very important for us to understand in finance that the entire contraption that has been built up over the last thirty or forty years has so much paper in it, so much debt, so much leverage, that we probably have a fifteen- or twenty-year period of working our way out of it. And yet, the alternative is to get sicker and sicker and sicker.''
That call may have helped him in South Carolina, where he scored a victory over Mitt Romney, but it did not do much for him in Florida, where he finished a distant second in this week's primary. His strategy now is to present himself as the only conservative with a chance, and thereby persuade supporters of Rick Santorum and Ron Paul to unite behind him. Support for a gold standard is a major part of Mr. Paul's platform.
Mr. Gingrich, it should be noted, did not promise to support a gold standard, only to appoint a commission. If he is serious about following Mr. Reagan's precedent, there may be little chance of a move to gold even if Mr. Gingrich does win the Republican nomination and the November election. In office, Mr. Reagan showed no inclination to buck the collected wisdom of most economists, whether Keynesian or monetarist.
The 1980 Republican platform denounced ''the severing of the dollar's link with real commodities in the 1960s and 1970s,'' which it blamed for inflation. ''One of the most urgent tasks in the period ahead will be the restoration of a dependable monetary standard,'' it added.
As Anna Schwartz, an economist who served as the gold commission's staff director, later wrote, that section could be seen as a ''veiled reference to a prospective return to a gold standard.''
Under a gold standard, the dollar would be valued at a certain number of grams of gold, and the government would be ready to buy or sell gold to anyone based on that value.
The commission's report was delayed and when finally released called for a continuance of the monetary status quo, albeit with the possible issuance of American gold coins to compete with the South African krugerrand. The platform plank turned out to have no real meaning, and gold bugs were outraged.
The commission, Murray N. Rothbard, a libertarian economist, later complained, was ''overwhelmingly packed with lifelong opponents of gold who buried any call for a hard currency.'' Ms. Schwartz noted that Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, who was the commission's chairman, and Murray Weidenbaum, a member who was Mr. Reagan's top economic adviser, ''did not tip their hands until the final two meetings of the commission.''
Mr. Gingrich did send a signal that his commission would be different. He said the co-chairmen would be Lewis Lehrman, the author of a recent book titled ''The True Gold Standard,'' and James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
''The fundamental conclusions of a Lehrman-Grant commission to consider a gold standard may be foregone: We're for it,'' Mr. Grant wrote in the latest issue of his publication.
Mr. Lehrman, in fact, was one of the two dissenters to the Reagan commission report. The other dissenter was a Texas congressman named Ron Paul.
More than almost any other dispute in economics, gold often seems to be a matter of theology. To supporters, gold has been money for thousands of years, and a return to it is the only way to keep politicians from debasing currencies. To most current economists, gold is a commodity, subject to the normal fluctuations of supply and demand. To them, the supply of money should be controlled based on economic principles. With a gold standard, the amount of gold available to back money could grow only at the same rate that gold stocks increased, something that depends on mining successes, not on the needs of an economy.
The University of Chicago last month asked a panel of 40 economists, including former advisers to both Democratic and Republican presidents, if they agreed that ''price-stability and employment outcomes would be better for the average American'' if the dollar's value were tied to gold. Every one of them disagreed, some with more than a little incredulity that such a question was worthy of discussion.
''Why tie to gold?'' asked Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago professor. ''Why not 1982 Bordeaux?''
''Eesh,'' responded Austan Goolsbee, a Chicago colleague and former adviser to President Obama. ''Has it come to this?''
Even economists with some sympathy to gold opposed the idea. ''The gold standard adds credibility when a country lacks discipline,'' said Edward Lazear of Stanford, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. ''The cost is monetary policy flexibility. The trade-off is unclear in the U.S.''
Nowhere was the chasm in perception about gold clearer than at a Congressional hearing in July, when Mr. Paul asked Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, ''Do you think gold is money?''
The Fed chairman appeared to be surprised by the question and paused for a few seconds before replying, ''No.''
Then why, asked Mr. Paul, did central banks hold gold reserves? Why not diamonds?
''Well,'' Mr. Bernanke replied, ''it's tradition.''
It is no coincidence that gold is back as an issue now, more than 30 years after its last significant appearance in presidential politics. It was the vanquishing of inflation by the Federal Reserve in the early 1980s under Paul A. Volcker that led to a collapse in the price of the precious metal and to the widespread belief in the wisdom of central bankers.
That reputation suffered badly in recent years. There is little doubt that the Fed, under Alan Greenspan, helped bring on the housing bubble through a combination of easy money and loose regulation of banks. But to most economists, the fact that central banks can err does not prove they should be replaced by an inflexible gold-based regime, which many think contributed to the Great Depression.
''A gold standard would have avoided the policy mistakes of the 2000s,'' conceded Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. in his response to the Chicago survey. But, he added, ''discretionary policy is useful during recessions.''
At the Congressional hearing in July, Mr. Paul pointed out that the gold price had doubled over the previous three years. ''When you wake up in the morning,'' he asked Mr. Bernanke, ''do you care about the price of gold?''
''I pay attention to the price of gold,'' the Fed chairman replied, ''but I think it reflects a lot of things. It reflects global uncertainties. I think the reason people hold gold is as a protection against what we call tail risk -- really, really bad outcomes -- and to the extent that the last few years have made people more worried about the potential of a major crisis, then they have gold as a protection.''
Mr. Bernanke has a point. The price of gold in recent decades has been a reflection of the waxing and waning of fears of ''really, really bad outcomes.'' When the Reagan gold commission issued its report in March 1982, the economy was in a severe recession but gold cost about half what it had gone for when the 1980 Republican platform was being written. The country was regaining its confidence.
In the current cycle, gold peaked at $1,900 an ounce last fall amid worries that the American economy was headed for a double-dip recession and that the euro zone would collapse. Those fears have since receded, although gold has climbed back over $1,700 since Mr. Gingrich called for a gold commission.
You don't have to be a conventional economist to hope that gold prices are going to decline over the next few years, just as they did after the 1980 peak.

HEADLINE: Romney's Tough Immigration View Is at Odds With His Church

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
While Mitt Romney is taking a hard line on immigration even as the Republican primaries head toward the heavily Hispanic states of Nevada, Colorado and Arizona, the Mormon Church to which he belongs has become a decisive player in promoting policies that are decidedly more friendly toward immigrants.
The church was instrumental last year in passing controversial legislation in Utah that would provide ''guest worker'' permits to allow illegal immigrants with jobs to remain in the United States. The church also threw its weight behind the Utah Compact, a declaration calling for humane treatment of immigrants and condemning deportation policies that separate families, which has been adopted by several other states.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is known for its reluctance to be seen as meddling in politics. But on immigration, the church actively lobbied legislators, sent Presiding Bishop H. David Burton to attend the bill signing and issued a series of increasingly explicit statements in favor of allowing some illegal immigrants to stay in the country and work.
The church's endorsement helped shift the debate on immigration in a Republican state where more than 80 percent of legislators are Mormons. It was the church's most overt involvement in politics since 2008, when it joined other conservative churches in the campaign to pass Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. 
''They were the defining factor in passing that immigration legislation,'' said Ronald Mortensen, a Mormon who is co-founder of the Utah Coalition on Illegal Immigration, which opposed it. ''It was probably the most obvious intervention by the Mormon Church on any piece of legislation up here for years. They're usually a lot more subtle.''
Mormons in Utah who back an accommodating approach to immigrants say they have been disturbed to see Mr. Romney align himself with his party's anti-immigration flank and with Tea Party members. Mr. Romney has dismissed as ''amnesty'' any proposal to create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He at first said he would veto the ''Dream Act,'' which would offer legal status to young illegal immigrants in the United States if they earned a college degree or serve in the military. He later revised his position to say he favored legal status for those who serve in the military.
In contrast, the Mormon Church has said that any immigration reform must balance the principles of loving one's neighbor and keeping families intact with the imperative to secure the nation's borders and enforce its laws.
Church officials have made no effort to reach out to Mr. Romney to discuss their differences on immigration and do not plan to do so, said Michael Purdy, director of media relations for the church, who declined to be interviewed but answered questions by e-mail. (Two officials with the Romney campaign did not return several e-mails asking for a response.)
Mr. Purdy wrote, ''The Church's position on political neutrality states: Elected officials who are Latter-day Saints make their own decisions and may not necessarily be in agreement with one another or even with a publicly stated Church position.''
Mormon immigration advocates who know Mr. Romney personally said they did not know where his heart was on the issue. They noted that when he served as a Mormon bishop and area leader in Boston in the 1980s and '90s, he ministered to struggling immigrants from Asia and Latin America. (He later had to explain why he hired a lawn care company that employed illegal immigrants.) But they said they understand that to get the nomination, Mr. Romney has to appeal to the Republican Party's right wing. And they said it may behoove him to demonstrate that he departs from his church's position on important issues.
Mark Shurtleff, the Utah attorney general and a Mormon who helped draft the Utah Compact, endorsed Mr. Romney's candidacy and recently attended an event with him but did not bring up immigration. ''I wish I could sit down with him and explain,'' he said. ''I would tell him there are very good law enforcement and public safety reasons to support the Utah Compact, besides that it's right.''
Mr. Romney's chief rival for the nomination, Newt Gingrich, has struck a softer tone on immigration, but he too is not entirely in step with his own Roman Catholic Church. Catholic bishops support the Dream Act and advocate broad immigration reform, including citizenship for the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants; Mr. Gingrich said he supports only ''half'' the Dream Act -- the part about military service.
The Utah Compact was conceived as a counterpunch to the stringent immigration law passed in Arizona in 2010, which gave the police broad power to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally. The compact's principles call for federal solutions to immigration reform, policies that support families and individual freedom, acknowledgment of the contribution of immigrants in the economy, and local law enforcement focus on crime, not immigration laws.
In Utah, the Chamber of Commerce and the Roman Catholic church were the first to champion the compact, but after many discussions, Mormon Church leaders eventually supported it too, Mr. Shurtleff said. The church has faced the ire of some of its members, including legislators, who are strongly opposed
The main proponent of the Arizona law was Russell Pearce, a Mormon who served as State Senate president. In November, Mr. Pearce was recalled and replaced by Jerry Lewis, who is also a Mormon but who had spoken out against the immigration law. Mormons in Arizona said their church's support for the Utah Compact was the turning point in the recall election.
The Mormon Church has a variety of motives for its immigration stand: it is eager to be perceived positively by Hispanics in the United States, and in Mexico and Latin America, where it is making new converts; it identifies with the immigrant experience, having fled persecution before settling in Utah; and it places a strong premium on keeping families intact, in this life and the next.
Paul Edwards, editor of The Deseret News, a church-affiliated newspaper in Utah, said, ''Latter-day Saints, because of their history of persecution and forcefully being dispossessed of their livelihoods and properties, do have compassion and understanding'' for immigrants.
Charlie Morgan, a sociologist who studies immigration at Brigham Young University, a church-affiliated school in Provo, said: ''One doctrine that separates the L.D.S. church from others is an eternal family. You get married in a temple and you're sealed for all time and eternity.''
The issue is not purely spiritual. Estimates are that 70 percent of Latino converts in Utah are illegal immigrants, said Tony Yapias, director of an immigration advocacy group, Proyecto Latino de Utah, and a Mormon.
''In the last year, we had some very high-profile members, a stake president -- a branch president -- who were deported,'' he said. ''People have been living in fear, and finally there's a ray of hope for them.''

HEADLINE: A Corporate Executive With Roots

BYLINE: By DAVID GREISING. 
dgreising@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
David Greising writes a column for The Chicago News Cooperative.
The man at the lectern boasted about his company's performance record, criticized the mishmash of government regulations controlling his operations and explained his industry with help of a Venn diagram.
Yet in his speech at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday, he also quoted Alexander Pope, Mark Twain and Huey Long. He made a biting remark about Jon Corzine and told a good Enron story. 
In both respects, he was quintessentially John W. Rowe.
Utility executives can be as dull as beige paint, and Mr. Rowe can wonk with the beigest of them. But Mr. Rowe, the outgoing chairman of Commonwealth Edison's parent company, Exelon Corp., also can paint in broad, colorful strokes. He conjures literature or history to make his points, and he has an earthy humor, perhaps born of his upbringing on a southern Wisconsin farm.
Explaining why Exelon has not invested more aggressively in new-energy technologies like windmills and solar cells, Mr. Rowe deadpanned: ''A dinosaur cannot save itself from extinction by mating with a rodent.''
Given the scale of Exelon's coal- and nuclear-plant infrastructure, some of it decades old, Mr. Rowe said, it would be unrealistic to expect that wind or solar power would be material to Exelon's business any time soon.
Mr. Rowe is one of a dying breed of Chicago chief executives. At a time when executives are transients, often unwilling to delve into the details of civic life, he has stayed put, led his company through crises, and invested not just Exelon's treasures but also his personal wealth and time back into the community.
With his wife, Jeanne, Mr. Rowe has founded two charter schools and spent enough time at them so that the challenges of urban education, he said, ''get into your skin.''
Not long ago, such types were commonplace in Chicago's boardrooms. Sara Lee was run by John Bryan, Standard Oil by John Swearingen and Commonwealth Edison by James O'Connor. Lester Crown is one of the few such civic-minded throwbacks who remain active.
Mr. Rowe has left his mark, using grace or muscle, depending on the circumstances. He fixed Exelon's array of broken-down nuclear-power reactors and pushed through a deregulation agenda that has left his company better off -- at the cost of giving the public less say in what customers pay. In his last full year of work, he steamrolled Smart Grid legislation through Springfield and put together the $8 billion purchase of Constellation Energy.
At his valedictory at the Economic Club, Mr. Rowe spoke with the ease of an executive at the end of a 14-year tenure who will not shade what he says just to be politic.
Mr. Rowe extolled his company's environmental record in one breath. But in the next, he rhapsodized about the unlimited promise of hydraulic fracturing -- the environmentally dubious process of using high-pressure liquid to crack bedrock, extracting oil and gas from it.
And while many of his industry peers choose to deny that climate change is a threat, Mr. Rowe acknowledges the science, then correctly points out that politics will prevent any action in the foreseeable future.
Another example: Mr. Rowe is politically conservative, yet he parts company with fellow conservatives on immigration policy. When he mentors young immigrants, he said, he finds it difficult to explain why they should go to college in a country where they will not be able to work legally, even with a college degree.
''When the hell did it become conservative to say people can't work and can't pay taxes?'' he asked the audience. ''I don't get it.''
Mr. Rowe acknowledged that few things are certain in the chief executive's corner office. And he did so, typically, with an extended metaphor drawn from literature. He quoted Mark Twain's description of the riverboat captain negotiating the bends and sandbars of a river.
Bright light and dark shadows each create their own problems and risks, the author explained. But the most treacherous times come when the world is cast in shades of gray.
''You take a night when there's one of these grisly, drizzly, gray mists, and then there isn't any particular shape to a shore,'' Twain wrote. ''A gray mist would tangle the head of the oldest man who ever lived.''
Mr. Rowe's is one gray head whose thinking -- and leadership -- are rarely tangled.

HEADLINE: As Fiscal Cloud Lifts, Mayor Offers a Budget Free of Tax Increases or Broad Layoffs: Placid Proposal Whose Cuts Have a Familiar Veneer

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Kate Taylor contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, seeking to stabilize New York City's finances after years of budget crunches and economic woes, proposed on Thursday a spending plan that was as routine and as free of drama as any in recent memory, with no tax increases or layoffs of teachers, police officers or firefighters.
Even the most contentious elements of Mr. Bloomberg's proposed budget -- his plans to close 20 fire companies and slash millions of dollars in funding for libraries and after-school programs -- had a veneer of the familiar, given that he had proposed similar cuts last year. 
The budget he proposed -- $68.7 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1 -- is about 2 percent higher than the budget for the current year. The budget is balanced, as is required by law.
''No tax increase, no layoffs of teachers or uniformed workers and no walking away from our long-term investments,'' Mr. Bloomberg said during a budget briefing at City Hall. The most colorful element of his proposal was his blue V-neck sweater -- a nod, he said, to the Super Bowl-bound Giants.
Mr. Bloomberg said costs that the city could not control, like those of pensions, health care, Medicaid and debt service, would increase by $2 billion, or 7.5 percent. But he said he would balance the budget in part by drawing on money from a health care reserve fund and money expected from the sale of new taxi medallions. City expenditures would shrink by $437 million.
The mayor's budget relies on a $29 million increase in revenue from fees and fines. He would increase fees for street activity permits, generating nearly $1 million, he said. And he would establish a new fee for building inspections from the Fire Department, generating an expected $8.4 million.
Mr. Bloomberg also projected that the Finance Department would increase tax revenue by $25 million through more aggressive auditing of high-end tax returns.
The budget did not include many of the proposals that had caused controversy in previous years. Last year, for instance, Mr. Bloomberg proposed to lay off 5,400 teachers, 5 percent of all teachers, setting off a tense battle with the City Council and other parties. Ultimately, a deal was reached that averted layoffs.
Mr. Bloomberg also seemed much less anxious about the city's future financial health on Thursday than he had in previous years. Indeed, when asked whether he was concerned about a projected deficit of $3 billion in the fiscal year following his new proposal, he said: ''I don't know. It's a year away. I'm always optimistic.''
But the mayor used the occasion of his proposal to repeat a familiar warning: that the city's pension costs have skyrocketed in recent years and are now a ''ticking time bomb.'' Although he did not mention that his own generous contracts to labor unions had compounded those costs, he did praise, on several occasions, the efforts of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to control the costs.
''Now is the time to help the governor,'' he said.
The city's elected officials reacted guardedly to Mr. Bloomberg's proposal. Some said they were relieved that there would be no layoffs of teachers or uniformed officers, though the mayor did propose 140 layoffs, chiefly in the transportation and health departments. Others expressed concern that the mayor did not propose to raise taxes on the wealthiest as a way to spare cuts to programs that benefit the poor.
The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, citing concerns about proposed cuts to firehouses, cultural institutions and after-school programs, said in a statement, ''We are fully committed to protecting the essential services that New Yorkers depend on.''
John C. Liu, the city comptroller, commended the mayor for avoiding layoffs but cautioned that ''the use of short-term financial maneuvers doesn't reduce real cost but simply defers costs to future administrations.''
And James Parrott, deputy director and chief economist of the labor-backed Fiscal Policy Institute, said he liked the city's audit initiative, but said the mayor was shying away from tackling difficult issues, like poverty.
''What it reflects, I think, more than anything else is that the mayor is just running out of gas,'' he said. ''The budget itself is in good enough position that there's not a budget crisis, but the mayor is also not initiating anything to address some of the lingering problems that are out there.''
Mr. Bloomberg's proposal is the first step in the annual budget process, which requires hearings and a vote by the City Council. The mayor is also expected to update his budget proposal in May, after the Legislature makes the state budget final.
The budget presentation on Thursday was Mr. Bloomberg's 11th as mayor, and he was very much in charge.
When, in an unscripted moment, he struggled to locate on his PowerPoint slides a statistic about education spending, his longtime budget director, Mark Page, found it and got up from his seat to point it out. Mr. Bloomberg brushed him aside.
''I can do it,'' he said.
By the Numbers
Number of proposed fire company closings: 20
Number of proposed layoffs: 140
Projected pension costs: $8 billion
Proposed budget: $68.7 billion

HEADLINE: Republicans Sharply Question Bernanke for Fed's Focus on Job Market

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans criticized the Federal Reserve on Thursday for working to reduce unemployment and revive the housing market rather than maintaining a single-minded focus on inflation.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was sharply questioned by members of a House committee about the Fed's announcement last week that it planned to hold short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, a measure that the Fed described as necessary to support a faster pace of economic recovery.
''I think this policy runs the great risk of fueling asset bubbles, destabilizing prices and eventually eroding the value of the dollar,'' said Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
''The prospect of all three,'' Mr. Ryan said, ''is adding to uncertainty and holding our economy back.''
Mr. Bernanke was calm and careful in his responses, but he did not back down. He told the committee that the economy, and the housing market in particular, would need help for years to come from the Fed and Congress.
Mr. Bernanke repeated the Fed's assessment, released last week, that the pace of growth would increase modestly this year, but that the economy still faced significant challenges, including the depressed state of the housing market and the risk that problems in Europe would infect the rest of the world.
In his testimony, Mr. Bernanke urged Congress in particular to confront ''the urgent issue of fiscal sustainability'' by enacting a plan to reduce the federal debt.
Mr. Bernanke repeated his familiar caution that Congress should not cut spending or raise taxes too quickly, because doing so could undermine the economic recovery, but said that a credible plan to make such changes in the long term could spur growth by improving the confidence of businesses and consumers.
The hearing was the latest opportunity for Republicans to vent their frustration with the Fed chairman, also a Republican, who in their view is undermining the nation's long-term financial health in his efforts to spur a short-term recovery.
Congress has charged the Fed with two goals, maintaining price stability and maximizing employment; Republicans are concerned that the Fed's huge efforts to spur job growth will eventually result in unmanageable inflation.
These concerns were heightened last week by the Fed's publication for the first time of a formal interpretation of its Congressional mandate. The Fed said that it would seek 2 percent annual inflation and try to limit unemployment as much as possible, and that sometimes one goal would be a priority over the other.
''My interpretation is that the Fed is willing to accept higher levels of inflation than your preferred rate in order to chase your unemployment mandate,'' said Mr. Ryan. ''Is that not what we should interpret out of this?''
Mr. Bernanke responded that the Fed would ''not actively seek'' to raise inflation but if inflation and unemployment both rose above its targets, it could choose to reduce inflation more slowly in order to reduce unemployment more quickly.
''We are not seeking higher inflation,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''We do not want higher inflation and we're not tolerating higher inflation.''
But Mr. Ryan pressed on, noting this was not a denial.
''I don't know how else to interpret this -- that the result of this balanced approach is that higher-than-preferred inflation may be tolerated,'' he said.
Democrats on the committee rushed to defend Mr. Bernanke, arguing that the Fed should be focused on unemployment because 24 million Americans cannot find full-time work.
''To deprive you of the tools necessary to boost employment would be a big mistake,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, the committee's ranking Democrat. ''Indeed, without those tools, the economy today would be in much worse shape.''
Republicans also excoriated the Fed for its publication of a ''white paper'' last month describing issues that are weighing on the housing market and encouraging Congress and the administration to address those issues.
Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, said the Fed overstepped its bounds by giving unsolicited advice to Congress about fiscal policy.
''You have two mandates in the areas of employment and fiscal policy,'' Mr. Garrett said. ''That's obviously a lot. We have a mandate in the area of fiscal policy and we would like to retain that.''
Mr. Bernanke appeared taken aback.
''We are trying to provide useful background,'' he said. ''I apologize if it was misinterpreted. Our goal was just to be helpful.''
Under subsequent questioning from Democrats, who asked why the Fed was not taking an even stronger position on housing issues, Mr. Bernanke rallied further, saying that the Fed maintained its opinion that Congress should do more.
''I think it would repay your efforts,'' Mr. Bernanke said, ''to remove some of the barriers to a recovery in housing.''

HEADLINE: To Fix Image, House G.O.P. Thinks Small

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Unpopular and divided, the once mighty House Republicans are laboring to repair their image and frame a new agenda.
Absent for now is a big, contentious docket similar to last year's, which included the goal of writing new health care legislation to replace the Obama administration's law. A long-promised overhaul of the tax code seems out of reach. When Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader, issued a memo this week laying out the body's initial legislative agenda, a centerpiece was a modest tax cut for small businesses.
With their poll numbers sinking and President Obama attacking them -- and poking fun in a weekend speech at the infighting among their leaders -- House Republicans long to establish a reputation as the party of job creation and to blunt the notion that they are recalcitrant and combative.
Senior Republicans are eager to minimize the drama, letting the party's presidential candidate, when he is finally chosen, take the lead. 
''Most of us expect the major decisions aren't going to be made this year,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a former chairman of the House Republican campaign committee. ''It's a very political year. The big thing for us is to not be part of the conversation instead of trying to inject ourselves into it.''
But attracting positive attention while avoiding confrontation is proving to be a challenge in an election year, particularly for a group that in 2011 seemed to relish showdown after showdown.
Members are still struggling to sing from the same legislative hymnal. Many want to do bigger things, like a tax code overhaul and changes to the Medicare program. Others, including Mr. Cantor, knowing they will get no help from Senate Democrats, seem to favor more incremental steps.
Many of the more conservative members, particularly some freshmen, want to continue taking the good fight to Democrats.
''We should focus on standing for principle and put the politics aside,'' said Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, who is in a Republican primary fight for a seat in the Senate. ''You have to keep doing what you think is the right thing to do.''
Others desperately want to find bipartisan compromises that can become law. ''The system is designed to make things difficult,'' said Representative John Campbell of California. ''You just have to persevere. Agreements take time, and they're supposed to.''
Outside pressures from each end of the political spectrum, which have dogged the House all year, are myriad: a five-year transportation bill, a major priority of Speaker John A. Boehner, is already being attacked by the left, for including new oil drilling as a way to pay for the bill, and the right -- Heritage Action for America, a conservative group, is urging Republicans to reject new highway spending.
Further, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor, whose strained relationship recalls the days of the intraparty intrigue that bedeviled Newt Gingrich as speaker, have had to spend time trying to stamp out perceptions that they are working at dangerous cross-purposes.
Their tensions are so well known that Mr. Obama joked about the two at a black-tie banquet Saturday night. (''Speaker Boehner, it is good to see you at the head table. I know how badly Eric Cantor wanted your seat.'') Members grouse regularly about the seeming divisions, and Mr. Cantor's staff felt it necessary this week to extensively explain that their two staffs had called a truce.
''As you're clearly aware,'' Mr. Boehner said Thursday, ''there have been some staff rumbles from time to time, but that's to be expected when you're doing big things. And members and our staffs, they're passionate about what they do. Sometimes that leads to some disagreements.''
Also, a tangle in December over extending the payroll tax cut pitted House Republicans against Senate Republicans, who argue that their House colleagues need to settle down and find a uniform message with them.
''A body of 535 doesn't sing easily in one chorus,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. ''I would get up in the morning, look in the mirror and say three words: 'the Obama economy,' '' he said, ''Then say, 'They've been in charge, they made it worse, we can make it better.' And remember all three messages.''
Defense is not a position that House Republicans of the 112th Congress are accustomed to playing. The group had remarkable leverage last year, setting the agenda on spending -- reining it in beyond what even Mr. Boehner would have dreamed -- and beating back Democrats on a variety of policy areas in the process.
But the public audience was not always wowed by their accomplishments. Polls showed that many Americans, even those who agreed with the Republican fiscal agenda, found the process, which included nearly shutting down the government, too messy. And among hard-core conservatives, the Republican gains were often too slight to win them applause.
At their retreat in January, Republicans tried to get back on the same page. They are now trying hard to demonstrate where they agree with Democrats, like in the area of small business, while still hammering away at Mr. Obama on unemployment and energy policy, subjects they think resonate with voters.
Should the Supreme Court find fault with some or all of the health care law, Republicans will be ready with a replacement, they say, and will push a bill banning stock trades by lawmakers and staff members with conflicts of financial interests.
House and Senate negotiators are already locked in talks to extend the payroll tax cut through the rest of the year, as well as to extend unemployment compensation and stop a deep cut in payments to doctors treating Medicare patients.
''We've had a lot of positive discussions about the year ahead,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, ''and our members are united against the president's policies, which are making the economy worse, and united in our efforts to offer better solutions to help middle-class families and small businesses.''
House Democrats, for all their excitement over the other party's missteps, have their own problems, including retirements by members in districts tilting Republican.
Small, for now, may be best, Republicans say. ''We are worried about trying to produce a result, make incremental progress and find common ground here,'' said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor. Time and time again, he said, ''when you try to go big and grand and do grand bargain-type deals, it collapses of its own weight.''
''When that happens over and over again,'' he continued, ''what do you do? You try something new.''

HEADLINE: Online Campaign Prompts Sallie Mae to Change Fee Policy for Loan Suspensions

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Score two for online consumer advocates -- or, as they might be called, Occupy Online.
On Thursday, three months after Bank of America backed down from imposing a $5 monthly debit card fee in response to an online Change.org petition that collected 300,000 signers, Sallie Mae, the nation's largest private student-loan provider, changed its fee policy in response to an online petition.
For years, Sallie Mae had required unemployed people who could not afford their monthly payments to pay a $50-per-loan fee every three months to suspend their payments temporarily, even as interest charges mounted. 
Sallie Mae called this forbearance fee a ''good faith deposit'' -- but it was neither credited to the borrower's account nor refunded.
Stef Gray, 23, a New Yorker who owes $600 a month on four loans, saw it as a predatory effort to squeeze blood from a generation of turnips -- graduates already buried under a mountain of student debt. In November, she started a petition, ''Tell Sallie Mae: Stop the Unemployment Penalty'' with Change.org., a group based in San Francisco. ''Sallie Mae is preying on people like me and cashing in on the fact that we need more time to find work before we can repay our student loans,'' it said.
Ms. Gray, who has paid $300 to Sallie Mae in forbearance fees, had another $150 due for January. (Although she has four loans, she said, the top Sallie Mae fee is $150.) She did not pay the fee, and this week her loans became delinquent.
On Thursday morning, wearing a cap and gown and accompanied by Molly Katchpole, 22, the nanny who started the Bank of America petition, Ms. Gray visited the Washington offices of Sallie Mae to hold a news conference and deliver the petition, which had attracted 77,000 signatures.
Thursday afternoon, Sallie Mae blinked.
''We have been giving careful consideration to our policy for some time, and we are changing it to apply the good-faith payment to the customers' balance after they resume a track record of on-time payments,'' it said in a statement.
Patricia Christel, a Sallie Mae spokeswoman, said that about 4 percent of its private student loans are in forbearance. The new policy will be retroactive to forbearances started Jan. 1.
Ms. Gray was pleased, if cautious.
''It's a partial victory,'' she said. ''They're still charging a forbearance fee, which they don't for federal loans. I'm glad they're not pocketing the fee, but they're still charging it. And I still can't pay it.''
By comparison with Sallie Mae, she said, her credit-card companies seem pleasantly responsive.
''With Sallie Mae harassing me with collection calls while they're tacking on $1,100 in interest every three months, and refusing to work with me, it's ridiculous to say, but it's made me hold up credit card companies as kind to consumers,'' she said.
Ms. Gray, who held a job in school, said her $40,000 in loans have ballooned to more than $65,000. In a better economy, she said, her master's degree in geography and expertise in geographic information systems would make her a good candidate for a job working with census or health statistics. But so far, she said, nothing has been forthcoming.
Back when she was borrowing, said Ms. Gray, whose parents died when she was young, no one explained the difference between federal and private loans.
''I was under the impression that Sallie Mae was a governmental agency, a nonprofit, with the same terms as federal loans,'' she said.
But with federal loans, there is no forbearance fee, and sometimes there is even an opportunity to put off not just loan payments but interest accrual. Even better, with federal loans, she might have been eligible for income-based repayment, in which borrowers make up to 25 years of payments based on their income -- payments of zero for those who are unemployed or earn very little -- and have any remaining federal debt discharged.
''Private student loans have been so grossly under-regulated that this is just one of many issues that need to be addressed on a broader level,'' said Lauren Asher, a founder of the Project on Student Debt. ''Private loan borrowers are at the mercy of their lenders if they hit hard times.''
Ms. Gray said that her biggest worry is default -- and the prospect of having her credit ruined so she would be unable to buy a house or car, or perhaps, since many employers check credit, even to land a job.
''Student debt has sort of stalled my generation in a state of arrested development,'' she said. ''You can discharge gambling debt or child support obligations in bankruptcy, but not student debt, so I guess in the eyes of the law, it's better to be a deadbeat dad than an unemployed graduate with loans.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 8, 2012

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a decision by Sallie Mae, the nation's largest private student-loan provider, to change its forbearance fee policy in response to an online petition, included a quotation by the petition's author, Stef Gray, that misstated one aspect of personal bankruptcy. Child support obligations cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy; it is not the case, as Ms. Gray said, that ''You can discharge gambling debt or child support obligations in bankruptcy, but not student debt.''

HEADLINE: Wow. But Is the Number Real?

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: This is a recovery led by the private sector. And while seasonal adjustments may have made January look better than it really was, job growth appears strong. 

 BODY:
How many jobs did the American economy add in January?
The Labor Department estimated today that the economy gained 243,000 jobs.
The department also estimated that the economy 2,689,000 jobs in the month.
The difference in the two numbers is in seasonal adjustment. Employment always falls in January, as temporary Christmas jobs end. So the government applies seasonal adjustment factors in an effort to discern the real trend of the economy apart from seasonal fluctuations. The actual survey showed the big loss in jobs. The seasonal adjustments produced the reported gain of 243,000 jobs.
A reason to doubt the number is that there has been a tendency in this cycle for the seasonal factors to overstate moves, in both directions. Labor mobility is down, as fewer workers quit to seek better jobs and employers both hire and fire fewer people than they used to do. If the seasonal adjustment was too large, then the gain should be smaller.
But there are plenty of signs that gains are real. Consider the annual change in non-farm payrolls. Seasonal factors should have no effect there. Over the past 12 months, the economy added nearly two million jobs, more than in any similar period since early 2007. These numbers do make it appear that the economy is gaining momentum, even if the January gain does turn out to be overstated.

For the 12 months, here are some of the changes.
Total +1.5%
Private Sector +2.1%
 Construction +2.1%
 Manufacturing +2.0%
 Information Services -1.7%
 Financial Activities +0.3%
 Professional and Business Services +3.5%
 Education and Health Services +2.1%
 Leisure and Hospitality +2.7%
Government -1.2%
 Federal government -1.5%
 State governments -1.4%
 Local governments -1.1%
Imagine that. A recovery in which the private sector grows and the government shrinks. Even construction jobs are finally going up.
There are still significant risks, largely from Europe. But it is beginning to look as if the economy will be better come fall than many expected it to be.

HIGHLIGHT: Wealthy investors are wiring millions of dollars to New York to snatch up a piece of 157 West 57th Street - what will be New York City's tallest residential building, with 90 floors overlooking Central Park. 

 BODY:
New York real estate can bring out even the most dormant phobias of potential buyers. With so many options, apartment hunters can easily be paralyzed by decidophobia (yes, it's a real term, and means the fear of making decisions).
That doesn't seem to be a problem for the wealthy investors who are wiring millions of dollars to New York to snatch up a piece of 157 West 57th Street - what will be New York City's tallest residential building, with 90 floors overlooking Central Park.
A bigger worry for these buyers may be acrophobia (fear of heights) or batophobia (fear of being near an object of great height, like a skyscraper).
The views, captured in a virtual tour shown off by the developer in a media event this week, are indeed stunning. From the double-height windows facing north, Central Park rolls out like a long green carpet. 
The building (One57, as it brands itself) is not expected to open until the fall of 2013, but sales are already brisk, thanks in large part to interest from buyers from Russia and China, said Gary Barnett, the president of Extell Development Company, which is building the tower. Mr. Barnett said the willingness of foreign buyers to open their wallets for New York real estate "gave us the confidence to do layouts the way I would like them to be, with large, gracious spaces and volume, and not so many bedrooms."
Buyers have appeared from all over the globe, including South America, and there have been multiple sales to people from China, Mr. Barnett said. He declined to comment on rumors reported on some real estate blogs that one Chinese buyer had bought four $20 million apartments. But he did confirm that there have been multiple sales to the same buyers.
Fact sheets for the building have been translated into Russian and Mandarin. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian translations are in the works.
Americans, including New Yorkers, are buying as well, though they are a little late to the party. "Some want to buy, and we don't have the exact product they want anymore," Mr. Barnett said.
The duplex penthouse of 10,923 square feet, currently listed at $115 million, is still available. If the six-bedroom home closes at anywhere near that price, it will be the most expensive apartment ever sold in New York, eclipsing the recent $88 million sale of a penthouse at 15 Central Park West by Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman. Ekaterina Rybolovleva, the 22-year-old daughter of a Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, bought that gem. She apparently will use it as her Manhattan crash pad while attending college. (Her security detail reportedly will live in a smaller, $8 million apartment in the building.)
On Wednesday, the developers of One57 and Christian de Portzamparc, the French "starchitect" on the project, as the builders called him, explained their vision for the 1,004-foot-tall building at a mimosa-and-bellini-fueled event. Mr. Portzamparc said he tried to design the building's exterior "like a staircase of curved roofs."
The lighted and vented top will make the building a beacon at night. The architect said he designed the east-west facade in a pixelated pattern with three colors of glass.
The interior designers said - perhaps predictably - that they wanted to rethink the meaning of luxury in New York. There are small touches, like dedicated wok burners, silverware drawers lined in faux ostrich skin, built-in wine chillers and sleeves for Nespresso capsules in the drawers.
The kitchen cabinetry custom designed by Smallbone of Devizes is intended to achieve a classic modernism. Many master bathrooms will have tubs of hand-carved stone from Italy and televisions next to the bidet.
Dan Tubb, One57's sales director, used an iPad to show me floor plans on the enormous screen in the One57 sales center. The building's library will have a 24-foot-wide fish tank. A screening room and concert space 300 feet above 57th Street will have a grand piano, seat 25 and overlook Carnegie Hall.
Cue the short sales video: String music soars as the building flows up like water into its final shape. A slender woman in a flowing black dress, so at ease, walks in front of her floor-to-ceiling window in the penthouse's grand salon and stares leisurely at the park. She makes a last-minute adjustment in her master bathroom, glancing out a window at a spectacular view of Midtown Manhattan. Then she is in the elevator. The red digital readout reads 90, then 89. In the lobby, she strides through the front door and a doorman ushers her to a waiting black sedan. And she's gone.
I've seen this kind of movie before. I come from Chicago, a city of extra-tall buildings. I remember covering the announcement in 2005 of the "Spire" in Chicago, the stunning birthday candle-shaped residential structure designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The project was supposed to be 2,000 feet tall, with 150 floors. It was abandoned in 2008 due to ongoing financial struggles and the global recession.
The difference is New York, of course, where Wall Street's collapse seemed to barely land a glancing blow to the cheek of high-end residential real estate. "People still see New York as a fantastic place to put their money," Mr. Tubb said.
Mr. Barnett said that after just two months, more than 30 percent of the 95 apartments at One57 were either in contract or out for signature. The residences, in floors 39 through 90, sit atop a Park Hyatt.
Sales managers said they received 1,000 inquiries for the building and responded to all of them. That led Jeannie Woodbrey, a senior sales executive at One57, to a 14-year-old boy from a town outside of Buffalo who called a few weeks ago to inquire about the six-bedroom penthouse.
"Can you buy the apartment now?" she asked patiently. "No, but I will be able to in a couple of years," he responded, sharing with her his plans to open a chain of hotels and "a bunch of Internet companies."
She said nothing would make her happier than to be able to sell him the $115 million home with four fireplaces and almost 58 feet of frontage on the park.
He said he would be in touch.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Find Gray Lining in Brighter Jobs Report

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Friday's better-than-expected jobs report may have sent stock prices higher, but Republicans found the gray lining in that silver cloud. 

 BODY:
House Republicans have their message on the economy, and they are sticking to it.
Friday's better-than-expected jobs report, with 243,000 new payroll positions added in January and another decline in the unemployment rate, may have sent stock prices higher, but Republicans, speaking at a news conference on Friday, found the dark gray lining in the silver cloud.
"Today is an indication of another failure of this president's policies, 36 months in a row of 8 percent-plus unemployment," lamented Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
"The president's team is gonna trot out their happy faces today," Representative Bill Flores of Texas, warned. "But the American people are gonna say, 'not so fast.'"
And Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington compared the current recovery with the recovery of the early 1980s recession under President Ronald Reagan, a party icon. She asserted that the Reagan recession was deeper and worse (a debatable assertion given the sudden and severe collapse in 2008).
Given the improving economy, Republicans had a choice. They could stick with their message or they could follow what Congressional Republicans in 1996 did - grabbing some of the credit. The latter choice may well help President Obama's re-election as it helped that of President Bill Clinton, but it could also help incumbent Republicans with their own difficult re-election campaigns. 
Some veteran Republicans want their party to take a more positive spin and talk up their successes like holding down spending, passing free trade agreements and putting deficit control at the top of the political agenda.
"Our problem is our own people cannibalizing their own success because it's not as good as they wanted," Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma and a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in an interview this week. "The only criticism I would have of some of the newer members, and some of the senior members, too, is they score points against their own team. They make themselves look good by making everybody else look bad. That's not particularly helpful."
After some hesitation Friday, lawmakers at the news conference made clear the choice they made.
"The American people are still asking, 'Where are the jobs?'" said House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.

HEADLINE: The Great Mirage: Las Vegas and Casino Capitalism

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Nevada primary is on Saturday, but you don't hear much from the candidates about what's gone wrong economically in Las Vegas. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS - Before you write off Vegas, which looks like the American Dream in a pawn shop at 3 a.m., the irrepressible Oscar B. Goodman wants to make a case.
"We're opening up the new Mob museum later this month, and that's special, you know, because our heritage came from the Mob," says Goodman, who was three-term mayor of this town, until his wife, Carolyn, took over last year. Before that he was a Mob lawyer, who, upon entering politics, said it was unwise to call him after 5 p.m., because there was a good chance he'd be drunk.
Dare to dis Vegas, with its yellowed, tattered edges showing everywhere, its billboards for "discount bankruptcy" more ubiquitous than Wayne Newton signs, the urban face for a state with the nation's highest unemployment rate and percentage of homes in foreclosure, and you get a Goodman mouthful.

HEADLINE: Comparing Recessions and Recoveries: Job Changes

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at how far the United States economy has to go before it fully recovers from the Great Recession. 

 BODY:
The Labor Department delivered a pleasant surprise today, reporting that the nation's employers added 243,000 jobs in January, compared with 203,000 in December. That's the fastest job growth in nearly a year. Perhaps even more impressive, the unemployment rate, at 8.3 percent, fell to its lowest level in three years.
Job gains were widespread across the private sector. Manufacturing, business services, health care and leisure and hospitality had the biggest growth. Downsizing at federal and local governments continued.
This is an exceptionally good report, but remember that employment still has a long way to go before returning to its pre-recession level.
The chart above shows economywide job changes in this last recession and recovery compared with other recent ones, with the black line representing the current downturn. Since the downturn began in December 2007, the economy has had a net decline of about 4 percent in its nonfarm payroll jobs. And that does not even account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy we should have more jobs today than we had before the recession.
There are now 12.8 million workers who are looking for work and cannot find it; the figure nearly doubles if you include workers who are part-time but want to be employed full-time, and workers who want to work but have stopped looking.

HEADLINE: W.P.S.: Once Again, Hope Triumphs Over Despair

BYLINE: YAEL AVERBUCH


HIGHLIGHT: Women's Professional Soccer has suspended operations for this season, but the Atlanta Beat's Yael Averbuch is staying positive about the future. 

 BODY:
A few mornings ago, Nikki Krzysik, Rebecca Moros and I showed up to play pickup with a bunch of guys. We entered the indoor facility in Clifton, N.J., excited about our preparation for another professional season. We left heartbroken, feeling as if we had nothing to play for. In the instant I saw the e-mail that W.P.S. 2012 would not be taking place, my motivation was zapped. I had a lump in my throat. Even worse was seeing the faces of the two other women who were there with me. Our livelihood had been taken away from us all at once.
What now? Who should I contact? Where can I play? What are my options?
Yes, I knew that the league was fragile, but my optimism made me sure that I'd be suiting up for the Atlanta Beat in a couple of months. On Jan. 30, I lay in bed, looking at the comments on Twitter and attempting to brainstorm my next move. I was emotionally drained. Distraught. Confused. Angry. Very angry. For about three hours.
Somehow, though, no matter how many knocks I take personally, or women's soccer takes as a whole, I cannot help but feel an extraordinary amount of hope in the bigger picture. What kept popping into my mind, amidst some tears and the nagging urge to just let myself give up, was the "resume in 2013" part of what I had read.
There has been a lot of discussion about the resources that are lacking in order to make this league work as we had hoped. But maybe this year will be a good time to step back, assess, and consider the resources that we DO have. We have a very successful U.S. Women's National Team, which is chasing an Olympic gold medal. We have marketable players who are known outside of the soccer world. We have five owners, and potentially more interested ones, who are committed to W.P.S. We have talented women training every day to compete for roster spots. We have families and young players hoping to be able to watch games and one day possibly participate themselves. This is what we DO have.
I don't mean to diminish the hardship that this last-minute season suspension has caused many people. It is devastating that there will be no W.P.S. this year. Personally, I am now unemployed and scrambling to find playing opportunities abroad. But wouldn't it be a shame to waste even one day hanging our heads when we can begin working toward making W.P.S. work in 2013? Maybe this year is a blessing in disguise - a time to step back, gather our resources, and realize just how important W.P.S. is to a lot of us. Let's start preparing for the 2013 season now!

HEADLINE: Reviewing the Range Rover Evoque

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: With the Range Rover Evoque, Land Rover makes a play for buyers looking for a lighter, more fuel-efficient sport utility vehicle. 

 BODY:
In Sunday's Automobiles section, Christopher Jensen reviews the Range Rover Evoque, a relatively lithe sport utility vehicle from a marque traditionally associated with chunky, if plush, utility machines.
The Evoque is aimed at a style-conscious driver who wants access to the Range Rover mystique without the dear prices and profligate thirst of the company's other vehicles. As Mr. Jensen writes:
The least expensive four-door model is $43,995 and the least-expensive coupe is $1,000 more. That is about the same as a heavily optioned Land Rover LR2, previously the company's cheapest model, and roughly $5,700 less than the most basic LR4.
The Evoque tries to be both a spirited pavement performer and a stout off-road ambler. Ultimately, Mr. Jensen finds that the S.U.V. splits the difference, which is no bad thing. Stuart Schorr, a brand spokesman, told him the Evoque could become the best-selling Range Rover in the United States, an altogether plausible outcome, Mr. Jensen writes:
Given the new model's combination of chic style, all-around capability, relative affordability and more acceptable fuel economy, such a degree of popularity would not come as a surprise.
Read the entire review, check out the slide show and share your thoughts on the 2012 Evoque in the comments.

HEADLINE: Coral, Part II: Is the Cold or Heat More Lethal?

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: Researchers find that extreme cold induces acute stress in coral but that heat is ultimately more lethal. 

 BODY:
There's no shortage of coral news this week. In addition to the research off the coast of western Australia described here by Justin Gillis, a second study emerged this week delving into climate change and coral's fragile future.
More frequent extreme weather events, both hot and cold, are predicted to freeze and fry coral in coming decades. But are these two climate extremes equally detrimental for coral survival?
Melissa Roth, a marine biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and other researchers set out to explore how corals' responses differ depending on whether they are subjected to hot or cold temperatures. 
"Given that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of both hot and cold events, it's important to compare these effects," said Dr. Roth, the lead author of a paper that appeared on Thursday in Scientific Reports.
Dr. Roth, who led the study while working at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, separated individual branching corals into three groups. One group was kept at normal, healthy temperatures, and the other two were exposed to temperatures that were either 9 degrees above or below the norm for 20 days.

As expected, both the cold and the heat negatively affected the corals. But the researchers were surprised to find that the opposite extremes elicited different responses depending on the timing. Over the first five days, the decrease in temperature caused more stress to the coral, whereas the heat caused more damage after the first five-day period had passed. 
Those differences can be attributed to the reactions of tiny algal organisms called dinoflagellates, which provide corals with energy through photochemistry. Without them, branching coral cannot survive. 
The corals in turn shelter the dinoflagellates. When dinoflagellates experience overly extreme temperatures or too much sunlight irradiance, this symbiotic system collapses, and the corals then decline or die. The phenomenon is known as coral bleaching. 
In both corals subjected to the extremes, dinoflagellate populations were reduced. But the heat-stressed coral dinoflagellates declined to less than 1 percent of their normal numbers, whereas the cold-stressed ones leveled off at around 40 percent of the control population. 
The heat-treated corals were "clearly under severe irreversible stress," the researchers write. But the cold-treated corals seemed to stabilize during the final phase of the experiment, suggesting that they are able to acclimate somewhat. "It definitely seems like they would grow and continue to live," Dr. Roth said, "but probably with a reduced fitness and at slower rates. There would definitely be a cost." 
Branching corals used in the experiment depend on dinoflagellate-driven photosynthesis for survival, Dr. Roth explained, so corals that glean their nutrition by catching plankton might perhaps have a better chance for surviving extreme temperatures - but only to a point. Too much heat will take a toll on any coral species. 
The researchers wrote that while a temporary decrease in temperature is detrimental to coral health, prolonged increases in temperature would ultimately be more harmful. 
Around 86 degrees Fahrenheit seems to be the critical threshold for breakdown between symbiotic coral and dinoflagellates, the researchers write. Scientists have determined that certain waters, especially those around the tropics, have the potential to reach or exceed that threshold. 
Coral bleaching is already occurring on reefs around the globe. In 2010, corals off the Florida coast experienced one of the coldest winters on record, while those off Indonesia suffered through one of the hottest summers. Preliminary reports indicate that large-scale bleaching occurred at both sites. 
"All corals are affected by climate change -- it's a global problem," Dr. Roth said. "Even if we have a pristine, perfectly managed reef, it will still be affected." 
Along with climate change comes a predicted rise in sea level and in ocean acidification, both of which are bad news for corals, especially when paired with pollution or coral disease.
As one of the world's most diverse and productive ecosystems, coral reefs house unique animals and provide a nursery for many economically important fish species. 
On the small scale, Dr. Roth said, managers can try to mitigate the impacts of climate change by making sure that reefs are protected from pollution and fishing. The fewer environmental stresses, the greater the chance the reef has of surviving climate change scenarios, she said. 
Still, in the grand scheme of things, "the best way to prevent all of this would be to reduce the potential for climate change," she said.

HEADLINE: Movement to Banish Copper From Brake Pads Gains Momentum

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: Copper brake pads produce metal dust that environmental advocates say reaches waterways and harms aquatic life. 

 BODY:
Government at the state and federal levels has been preoccupied with improving the fuel economy of the nation's fleet. Smaller environmental causes are also in the mix, including mercury in car switches and lead weights used to balance auto wheels. 
Add to these copper brake pads, which produce metal dust that environmental advocates say reaches waterways and harms aquatic life.
The issue has gained traction in the legislatures of California and Washington, where bans on the pads were enacted in 2010. These victories have inspired bills introduced recently in Rhode Island, New York and Oregon.
Manufacturers use copper because it effectively transfers away the heat produced when brake pads rub against rotors. But with the legislative movements gaining momentum, companies are exploring alternatives to copper and other potentially hazardous materials.
"Each time a driver uses their brakes, a small amount of copper and other metals are deposited on roadways from the brake pad," according to literature on the Web site of the Ecology Department in Washington State. "These metals then wash into our streams and rivers. With millions of drivers using their brakes each day, these small amounts significantly impact our waterways, including Puget Sound." The state says that brake pads "account for up to half of the copper entering our water from urban areas."
By 2021, brake pads containing more than 5 percent of the metal will be banned in Washington. Pads made as original equipment for cars built before 2021 are exempt from the law. The California ban is similar, though it also requires the use of pads with 0.5 percent copper or less by 2025. Pending a 2015 review of available alternatives to copper, Washington may eventually enact a 0.5 percent ban of its own.
The bills in Washington and California also require manufacturers to stop selling pads with more than minute amounts of asbestos, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury by 2014.
Manufacturers have adopted a collaborative approach to the problem through the Brake Pad Partnership, a consortium consisting of the Brake Manufacturers Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, Ford Motor Company, General Motors and various state water agencies. "We ended up supporting both pieces of state legislation," Ann Wilson, a senior vice president at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, the parent group of the manufacturers council, said in a telephone interview.
Ms. Wilson said she thought that additional state bans were unnecessary because existing legislation would lead to an industrywide change in brake pad formulations. "It's important to recognize that what these two states have done will impact vehicles around the country, from cars to heavy trucks," she said. "Our members are not going to design California-only brake pads."
But Kathryn Phillips, California director of the Sierra Club, said in a telephone interview that this was not this time to abandon the quest for more state bans.
"Catalytic converters came to California first, and it took a while for them to go national," she said. "The auto industry is more willing to do the right thing today than it was 40 or even 10 years ago, but it's helped that states have taken the lead and made clear they expect good behavior."
Others are looking beyond state regulations. FDP Friction Science, which makes copper-free brake pads, is a sponsor of a coming petition campaign, called Give Water a Brake, that would seek nationwide bans of copper brake pads in the United States and Canada. The campaign is organized in part by Earthgarage.com, an informational site that also promotes green auto products, including FDP's EcoStop brake pads. 
"The copper ban is a sleeper of an issue," Bob Leonard, the chief executive of Earthgarage, said in an interview. "Many of the environmental groups I've approached, some fighting water pollution, aren't aware of the brake pad problem."

HIGHLIGHT: A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance. 

 BODY:
A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
Mergers & Acquisitions
ABB TO BUY ELECTRONICS MAKER The Swiss company agreed to buy Thomas & Betts, an American maker of electrical connectors, for about $3.9 billion in cash. Michael J. de lad Merced reported that "the takeover of Thomas & Betts is one of the largest friendly transactions announced this year."
 EXXON TO SELL JAPANESE ARM Exxon Mobil said that it had agreed to sell its Japanese subsidiary to TonenGeneral Sekiyu, a major refinery operator in Japan, for about $3.9 billion, Mr. de la Merced reported. The move is "part of a revamping of the oil giant's operations in that country."
EXCHANGES TO CALL OFF MERGER Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext said that they were in talks to call off their planned merger, after European antitrust regulators formally opposed the deal, Mr. de la Merced, James Kanter and Jack Ewing reported.
GLENCORE AND MINER IN TALKS Glencore International, the biggest commodities trading company in the world, has approached the mining company Xstrata about a takeover. Mark Scott and David Jolly reported that the "long-anticipated deal that would create a company with a market value of about $80 billion."
Investment Banking
U.S. BANKS TALLY EXPOSURE IN EUROPE United States banks are betting that their insurance is going to pay out, Peter Eavis reported. "Five large American banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have more than $80 billion of exposure to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece," according to a New York Times analysis of the banks' financial disclosures.
R.B.S. AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD WEEK

        
The Royal Bank of Scotland's chief executive, Stephen Hester, will not accept a 1 million ($1.5 million) bonus that drew criticism from the British public and politicians. 
        
The British government announced that Frederick A. Goodwin, a former chief executive of the bank., now nationalized, would be stripped of his knighthood, Mr. Scott reported.
NEW FUND FOR OUTSPOKEN ANALYST Christopher Whalen of Tangent Capital Partners says the strongest banks are the ones without exposure to Wall Street. William Alden reports that he is setting up a fund focused on small and midsize banks.
GOLDMAN SACHS AT P.R. CROSSROADS News of Goldman's courtship of Richard Siewert Jr., a former counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner., has had Wall Street buzzing. It increased speculation that Lucas van Praag, the head of the company's public relations department, was being shown the door, Susanne Craig reported. The news also "highlighted the often cozy relationship between Wall Street and government organizations like the Treasury Department."
Private Equity
DEAL PROFESSOR Collateralized loan obligations, an important source of capital for many businesses, have made a modest comeback since the financial crisis. Steven M. Davidoff argues that their revival is under threat from well-intentioned regulators.
"New C.L.O.'s are crucial to support the corporate loan market. Without them, banks will be hampered from originating credit since they will be unable to sell these loans off their balance sheet."
DEFENDERS EMERGE FROM SHADOWS As the political attacks on Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital have intensified, many have wondered when the private equity industry would try to mount a full defense of its practices. After months of quiet complaining, some buyout defenders are punching back, Kevin Roose reported.
"Hamilton E. James, the president of the Blackstone Group and one of the highest-ranking titans of the private equity industry, spoke in full-throated support of the business," the same day Blackstone reported its fourth-quarter earnings.
I.P.O./Offerings
FACEBOOK GOING PUBLIC

        
What is the value of personal data? Somini Sengupta and Evelyn M. Rusli report that Facebook is set to find out. The social network's stock offering, expected to value the company at $80 billion to $100 billion, is bound to raise even more concerns about privacy and other issues.
        
Facebook's public offering will make a lot of billionaires and millionaires, Nick Bilton and Ms. Rusli reported. Some of them are prominent people and others not. David Choe, a graffiti artist, may make $200 million when the social network goes public.
        
Now investors get the chance to assess Facebook's potential, Mr. Eavis and Ms. Rusli reported. The giant social network said in a filing that it was seeking to raise up to $5 billion through its I.P.O. 
        
It's not about the money. Really. That's what the billionaire Mark Zuckerberg says in a letter to potential investors that was part of Facebook's filing, Ms. Sengupta and Claire Cain Miller reported.
        
As the lead underwriter on Facebook's initial public offering, Morgan Stanley will reap not only millions of dollars in fees, but more important, the bragging rights that come with what bankers described as a once-in-a-generation event, Mr. de la Merced and Andrew Ross Sorkin reported.
        
"Mr. Zuckerberg had managed to hold on to more than one-fourth of the shares in the company, and his agreements with other investors enhanced his voting power to almost 60 percent of total shares," Ms. Sengupta reported.
        
"With Facebook on the verge of listing on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq, the secondary market is faced with the prospect of losing its golden goose," Peter Lattman and Ms. Rusli reported.
Legal/Regulatory
FAIR GAME President Obama's new mortgage task force has a fancy name, but Gretchen Morgenson is skeptical it will get tough. The Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group has much to tackle in the mortgage mess - and soon, if it wants to allay suspicions that the authorities have given powerful institutions a pass.
"The S.E.C. is clearly proud of its financial crisis cases. But comparing its tally with the mountainous evidence produced in private lawsuits shows how much more work there is to be done."
GUPTA'S INSIDER TRADING TRIAL 

        
Ajit Jain, a top lieutenant at Berkshire Hathaway, is a potential witness in the insider-trading trial of Rajat K. Gupta, Mr. Lattman reported.
        
Federal prosecutors expanded their case against Mr. Gupta, filing a new indictment that broadens what they claim was a conspiracy between Mr. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs, and Raj Rajaratnam.
REVOLVING DOOR "Greg D. Andres, a senior Justice Department official, is leaving the government to join the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell," Mr. Lattman reported.
DEALBOOK COLUMN Usually, it is the banks that are fighting efforts to impose new regulations on the industry. Mr. Sorkin notes that now, it is foreign governments fighting against bank regulations in the United States. 
"The rule says that United States banks - and possibly certain foreign banks that do business in America - would be restricted in trading foreign government bonds. Yet the rule, conveniently, provides an exemption for United States government securities. Every other country is out of luck."
EX-UBS TRADER PLEADS NOT GUILTY Kweku M. Adoboli has been charged with fraud and false accounting that led to a $2.3 billion trading loss at UBS last year, Julia Werdigier reported. Mr. Adoboli faces up to 10 years in prison. The judge said the trial would start Sept. 3. 
MF GLOBAL INQUIRY 

        
"Investigators have determined what happened to nearly all of the customer money that disappeared from MF Global around the time of its bankruptcy last Oct. 31," Ben Protess and Azam Ahmed reported. People briefed on the investigation said authorities "have not publicly disclosed their progress, fearing that doing so might cripple efforts to recover the cash and pursue potential wrongdoing."
        
At the fourth Congressional panel to focus on MF Global, lawmakers accused the rating agencies and one of the firm's chief risk officers of failing to sound alarms.
CREDIT SUISSE FRAUD CHARGES 

        
The government charged three former Credit Suisse traders with inflating the value of mortgage bonds as the housing market collapsed. Mr. Lattman and Mr. Eavis reported that the case was a rare criminal prosecution of Wall Street executives for their conduct during the financial crisis.
        
The case is among the government's first criminal prosecutions involving a bank's valuation of complex securities called collateralized debt obligations.
S.E.C. AVOIDING TOUGH SANCTIONS FOR LARGE BANKS Even as the Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped up its investigations of Wall Street, the agency has repeatedly allowed the biggest firms to avoid punishments, Edward Wyatt reported.
S.E.C. FRAUD SETTLEMENT APPROVED A federal judge in Wisconsin who challenged the S.E.C. last year over the adequacy of a proposed fraud settlement approved the deal this week without requiring substantial changes, Mr. Wyatt reported.
SWISS BANK INDICTED Wegelin & Company, the 270-year-old Swiss private bank, was indicted in New York on federal charges that it had helped Americans evade taxes.

HEADLINE: Volkswagen Beetle TDI: Oil-Burning Bug to Have Debut at Chicago Auto Show

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: The diesel Beetle uses the same 2-liter turbocharged engine that appears in TDI versions of the Passat, Golf and Jetta. 

 BODY:
Volkswagen previewed a diesel-powered Beetle TDI Thursday, scheduled to be officially introduced at the Chicago auto show next week. The automobile is the third model of the redesigned Beetle, which went on sale last fall with 2.5-liter and turbocharged 2-liter gasoline-engine versions.
The Beetle TDI is powered by the same 2-liter turbodiesel currently available in the Jetta, Golf and Passat, rated at 140 horsepower. Low-speed torque is abundant, with 236 pound-feet available at less than 2,000 r.p.m. Volkswagen projects fuel economy of 29 miles per gallon in city and 39 m.p.g. in highway driving. Such numbers, though competitive with compact models like the Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra and Chevrolet Sonic, would not make the vehicle a contender for the small-car economy crown, let alone among the other diesel models produced by VW. 
Volkswagen did not offer projected sales figures for the TDI, but Corey Proffitt, a spokesman for VW, said in a telephone interview that the model was expected to account for a similar portion of total Beetle sales as the Passat TDI does for overall Passat sales, about 20 percent.
Pricing has not been announced, but Volkswagen's other diesel models command a premium of roughly $2,500-$3,000 over their comparably equipped gasoline-burning siblings. Should the same hold true for the Beetle TDI, a sticker topping $24,000 would be likely.
Like most modern oil burners, the Volkswagen engine relies on direct-injection and turbocharging to generate power far in excess of the normally aspirated diesels of yesteryear. An iron cylinder block, forged-steel crankshaft and piston oil cooling help manage the high cylinder pressure and combustion temperature inherent to diesels.
To meet the stringent nitrogen oxides emission standards of the United States, the engine utilizes an exhaust after-treatment system consisting of three catalytic converters and a particulate filter. The need for after treatment and stout underpinnings contribute to the premium price typically commanded by diesel-powered automobiles in America.
The Beetle TDI will be available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or Volkswagen's dual-clutch 6-speed automatic. 
Redesigned for the 2012 model year, the Beetle is wider and longer than its immediate predecessor, known as the New Beetle and sold between 1998 and 2011. Gone are the arched roof and circular shapes of the front and rear fenders. Volkswagen says the look is more masculine. 
Given the trucking and heavy-equipment associations with diesel engines, the TDI badge on the Beetle's rear lift gate could help reinforce VW's talking points.
The Beetle TDI will be offered in three packages when it arrives at dealerships this summer: TDI, TDI with Sunroof and TDI with Sunroof, Sound and Navigation. (The sound option doesn't refer to diesel rattle, but rather a premium audio system.) All Beetle TDI models are equipped with power windows, keyless entry, Bluetooth and other premium features.
A previous version of this post said a Beetle TDI would cost roughly $4,500-$6000 over a gas-powered model, without taking into consideration the higher level of standard equipment typical of VW TDI models. The cost has been adjusted accordingly.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $19,000,000

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: An apartment at the Trump International Hotel and Tower, opposite Central Park, was bought anonymously through a limited liability company. 

 BODY:
A condominium at Trump International Hotel and Tower that sold for $19 million was the biggest sale of the week, according to city records.
The black-and-gold-clad Trump high-rise, on the southern edge of Central Park, has seemed something of a wallflower in recent years, watching as neighboring buildings racked up multimillion-dollar sales week after week, shattering notions of what people would pay for luxury. But this sale indicates that the building, which opened in 1997, is still a player in this rarefied market. 
The purchase was made anonymously through a limited liability company. The seller was listed as the Cormorant Investment Company, which owned the property for 15 years. The apartment was never listed for sale publicly. 
Cormorant made out well in the deal, having bought the apartment for $3.68 million when the building opened, according to public records.
The area around Columbus Circle, on the southern and western edges of Central Park, has gained a number of buildings aimed at the spectacularly wealthy in the years since Donald J. Trump put his stamp on the neighborhood.
Apartments in buildings like 15 Central Park West and the Time Warner Center are some of the most coveted in the city - even if many of those buying the trophy apartments would rather no one knew who they were.
Big Ticket includes closed sales from the seven days ending Wednesday.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Losing a Goose That Laid the Golden Egg | Not everyone on Wall Street is giddy over Facebook's initial public offering of stock.
A group of private exchanges has popped up in recent years to accommodate a fast-growing trading market in the private shares of the Internet companies like Twitter and LinkedIn. Facebook has driven much of this growth, emerging as the most actively traded private company by a wide margin.
At SecondMarket, one of the largest of such exchanges, the trading of Facebook shares accounted for about a third of the firm's total revenue last year.
Now, with Facebook on the verge of listing on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq, the secondary market is faced with the prospect of losing its golden goose. Not to mention that Zynga, Groupon and LinkedIn, all of which were actively traded on private exchanges, have recently gone public.

HIGHLIGHT: House Republicans are working to revamp their image with a smaller agenda, and the Senate voted to ban insider trading by lawmakers. 

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
Hoping to revamp their image in the face of low approval ratings, many House Republicans are favoring incremental steps in lieu of a big agenda like last year's, looking to improve their reputation for being recalcitrant and combative, Jennifer Steinhauer and Jonathan Weisman report.

        
Riding a new wave of support for the measure, the Senate voted Thursday to ban insider trading by members of Congress, a law that will also require the disclosure of stock transactions by lawmakers and officials in the executive branch, Robert Pear reports.

        
Following a proposal laid out in the president's State of the Union address last week, the White House is trying to lure jobs back to the United States, noting that trends abroad are making the idea of keeping workers in the country a more viable option, Annie Lowrey reports.

        
Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney in his Las Vegas hotel Thursday, an event that promised spectacle but delivered more run-of-the-mill politics, Mark Leibovich writes.

        
In the wake of the confusion over the winner of the Iowa caucuses, everyone from the governor to the editorial page of the state's largest newspaper has drawn the distinction between a state-run primary and a volunteer-staffed caucus, dealing a blow to a process that has already been criticized for being undemocratic, A.G. Sulzberger reports.

        
With Mr. Romney calling the decision to end the combat mission in Afghanistan early "misguided," President Obama seems eager to debate him and his other critics on a withdrawal timetable that is politically popular, Mark Landler and Helene Cooper report.

HEADLINE: For Romney, the Perils of Protection

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The moment a political campaign is assigned a Secret Service detail -- for Mitt Romney, it was Thursday -- tends to be a turning point, with a political downside as well as an upside. 

 BODY:
10:21 a.m. | Updated 
LAS VEGAS - Most campaigns have a handful of pivotal moments - Barack Obama's race speech in 2008, John McCain's choice of running mate - but the appearance of a team of dark-suited, ramrod straight, hyperprofessional-looking Secret Service agents is an undeniable sign of success. For Mitt Romney, that happened on Thursday, and though it is still early, his campaign will need to manage the potential ramifications carefully.
The most important side effect will be on Mr. Romney's interaction with supporters, whose access to the candidate at events is likely to diminish now that agents have been assigned to protect him.
Reid Cherlin, who is covering the Republican primaries for GQ magazine and worked on President Obama's first campaign and in his White House, said that having a Secret Service detail "complicates things" for everyone involved.
"Especially in retail-focused states, all of a sudden roads are closed, there are traffic jams, people can't get close to the candidate, the local press feels mishandled," he said. "So there you are cruising down a two-lane blacktop in a tiny town at 80 miles per hour in these black S.U.V.'s. It can be a fun spectacle in a bigger city, but in tiny towns where people want to meet the candidate, it can be a problem."
"It can create sort of a P.R. challenge," he added.
Grandmothers who simply want their books signed might be accidentally jostled, and local donors cannot always be taken backstage to meet the candidate. People will have to be screened - often passing through a metal detector - to enter campaign events, creating yet another layer of hassle and frustration for potential supporters along with enhanced safety and isolation for the candidate. (Being glitter-bombed - protesters showered Mr. Romney with cans full of glitter as he took the stage in Minnesota on Wednesday - might not have happened with the Secret Service on the job.)
The press feels the agents' presence as well. In the summer, when Mr. Romney's campaign was still fresh, it was possible to walk up to him and tap him on the shoulder. As the crowds grew, reporters were pushed farther back, but were still close enough to hear Mr. Romney's interactions with voters.
For a politician like Mr. Romney, who is remarkably disciplined in public, those moments on the rope line offered brief glimpses into the impromptu and unscripted candidate. It was there that we learned about his penchant for guessing voters' ages and heritage - often incorrectly - and where a reporter spotted Mr. Romney handing a wad of cash to a woman who said she was unemployed. All of those moments will become more difficult to see and hear as the security buffer around him expands.
A spokesman for the Secret Service, which started protecting presidential candidates in 1968, stressed that the agents work to balance security and openness as much as possible.
"We understand that protectees of ours want to get out and meet people," said Ed Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service. "I think at this point we understand fully what candidates' expectations are, and we try to meet candidates' expectations in as safe a way as possible."
No one knows yet what Mr. Romney's Secret Service code name is, but a few weeks ago over a long dinner, his traveling press corps came up with their own suggestions. The Secret Service's custom is to choose a letter and then assign the candidate and each family member a name starting with that letter. For Mr. Romney, the reporters went with "S."
Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, who is known as the "Mitt-stabilizer" for her abilities to calm her husband, was "Serenity." His oldest son, Tagg, was "Scion." Ben, his doctor son, was "Scalpel."
And Mr. Romney himself was named in homage to his campaign theme song, Kid Rock's "Born Free," which includes the verse, "Wild, like an untamed stallion." Mr. Romney, at least to his traveling press corps, will always be "Stallion."

HEADLINE: 'Keep It Going,' Obama Says of Economic Recovery

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama used an appearance at a firehouse near Washington to highlight encouraging jobs data before laying out plans to create jobs for veterans. 

 BODY:
President Obamaseized on the rosier employment numbers on Friday, telling firefighters in Arlington, Va., that "we've got to do everything in our power to keep it going" and warning Republicans in Congress not to "muck it up" by refusing to extend the cut in payroll taxes.
Mr. Obama, who has reacted cautiously to previous gains in the job market, struck a more sanguine tone after the announcement earlier in the day that the economy had added 243,000 jobs in January. "The economy is growing stronger," he said, before laying out plans to create jobs for returning veterans. "The recovery is speeding up."
But the president used the promising news to renew his pressure on Congress, urging lawmakers to pass the tax cut and suggesting that if they did not, they could be held accountable for hindering the recovery.
"Now is not the time for self-inflicted wounds to the economy," Mr. Obama said. "So I want to send a clear message to Congress: Do not slow the recovery that we are on; do not muck it up; keep it moving in the right direction." 
Speaking at a firehouse near Washington that sent some of the first firefighters to the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Obama promoted a package of initiatives, including a Veterans Jobs Corps, to generate opportunities for returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.
The $1 billion program, which the president announced during his State of the Union address, would employ up to 20,000 veterans for five years repairing roads and bridges and working as park rangers.
The president also reiterated his administration's proposal of $5 billion in incentives, contained in the American Jobs Act, for cities and towns to hire veterans as firefighters and other emergency responders.
"Of course, Congress needs to fund these projects," Mr. Obama said. "Congress should take the money that we're no longer spending on war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building here at home."
Two days after his defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, said he hoped to wind down the combat role of American troops in Afghanistan by the middle of next year, Mr. Obama left little doubt that he, too, was turning the page on a decade of war.
"The war in Iraq is over," he said. "The war in Afghanistan is moving to a new phase: we're transitioning to Afghan lead."

HEADLINE: Nevada Tip Sheet: A Vegas Reporter's Must-Reads

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: A primer on Nevada politics, from the tumultuous 2010 elections to its quirky caucus rules, the Mormon vote to Yucca Mountain, from The Las Vegas Review-Journal's politics reporter. 

 BODY:
We tapped Laura Myers (@lmyerslvrj) of the Las Vegas Review-Journal to give us a local's perspective on the state of the race in the Silver State. A native Nevadan, Ms. Myers has been covering politics for The Review-Journal for the past two years, following a long tenure at The Associated Press that included a stint as political editor during the Bush-Gore race in 2000. Her list of must-reads is below (and also available to go, on our Election 2012 mobile app, which has more of the best, hand-picked politics coverage from around the Web).
Along with her list of essential reading, Ms. Myers told us what she'll be watching for on Saturday: 
The key factors to watch for in Saturday's GOP caucus are whether Mitt Romney holds his Mormon voting bloc, which gave him a victory here in 2008; whether Ron Paul's loyal troops have expanded into a force big enough to threaten Romney's expected win; and whether tea party folks swing toward Newt Gingrich, giving him a boost that propels him past Paul, or whether Rick Santorum peels enough off to split the conservative vote and ensure a one-two finish for Romney and Paul.
Nevadans aren't used to caucusing and so there might be a bit of chaos on Saturday. The state party allowed each of Nevada's 17 counties to set their own rules basically. That means different start and finish times. And Clark County -- where 60 percent of Republicans live in Las Vegas and the outskirt cities -- will hold a special 7 p.m. [Pacific time] caucus after sundown for observant Jews and Seventh-day Adventists. That will hold up reporting of the results until 8 p.m. or so.

        
2010: Nevadans Declare Independence, The Las Vegas Review-Journal
After a grueling midterm campaign, Nevadans -- many of them disgusted -- voted to keep the unpopular Senator Harry Reid over Sharron Angle, a Tea Party-backed Republican who gained national notoriety, while electing the state's first Latino governor, a Republican.
        
2010: Nevada Power Brokers Flex Muscles, The Las Vegas Review-Journal
Many of Nevada's kingmakers have day jobs as lobbyists for the state's gambling, mining and tourism industries who often write bills for the part-time legislature and back candidates who might favor their interests.
        
2011: First Hispanic Governor, Brian Sandoval, Is the Rising Hope of G.O.P., The Las Vegas Review-Journal
When Brian Sandoval entered office in January 2011, "leaders on the national and state levels point to the popular and telegenic Sandoval as a promising standard-bearer" who could help the Republicans in 2012.
        
Mormon Votes Targeted in G.O.P. Presidential Campaign, The Las Vegas Review-Journal
"While Romney's campaign uses the personal touch, Paul's operation is wooing Mormons with policy," writes Ms. Myers of Representative Ron Paul's aggressive push in Nevada. "Paul's libertarian ideals attract LDS supporters, but require a leap of faith."

HEADLINE: The Dark Art of Legislative Hostage Taking

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The House G.O.P. has attached an anti-environmental wish list to the must-pass transportation bill. 

 BODY:
To get controversial, often terrible, ideas enacted into law, members of Congress use a clever trick: They attach them to otherwise unobjectionable, must-pass bills that fund crucial government services.
Bills raising the debt limit, extending unemployment, paying for the military and renewing a payroll tax cut, all of which should have been routine, were turned into political brawls with the addition of measures that were unlikely to pass on their own.
Now House Republicans have waylaid the transportation bill, which provides funding to maintain roads and bridges, and appended an ideological wish list primarily intended to benefit their big donors in the oil and gas industry.

Robert B. Semple, our board's expert on environmental matters, reached into the G.O.P.'s baddie bag. He said additions to the bill would:

        
Require oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and in long-protected, off-limits areas off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
        
Tie highway construction, which is now funded by user fees such as fuel taxes and tolls, to fees from oil and gas drilling - a huge change from accepted practice that would hold transportation hostage to drilling.
        
Slash Amtrak funding by 25 percent, expose mass transit generally to further cuts and eliminate funding entirely for small, useful programs like Safe Routes to School.
        
Dramatically reduce or delegate to state agencies necessary environmental reviews for road projects.
If Speaker John Boehner has his way, the bill will also include a provision green lighting the controversial and environmentally risky Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. Congressional Republicans have tried to force through Keystone in this manner before: They took an unrelated bill-the payroll tax cut extension-and attached a measure requiring Mr. Obama to make a decision on Keystone within six months. He complied. He said no.
This bill is destined to pass the House. After a floor vote, it will be sent to a conference committee for reconciliation with a more conventional, less dangerous Senate bill. The Senate must make sure that the House's radical, in some cases thoroughly nutty ideas, do not actually become law.

HEADLINE: Obama's Magic Number? 150,000 Jobs Per Month

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Reports that more than 150,000 jobs have been created can be seen as good news for President Obama's re-election prospects. 

 BODY:
10:37 a.m. Friday | Updated 
The unemployment report on Friday will give us the most tangible read to date on how the economy is performing in 2012. It might also represent the most important number yet for President Obama's prospects of winning re-election.
Here's a spoiler: reports that say more than 150,000 jobs have been created can generally be interpreted as good news for Mr. Obama. Reports that come in at under 150,000 jobs could put him on a trajectory toward defeat. 
However, the matter is worth examining in more depth.
No economic indicator is the holy grail. The American economy is a hard thing to measure, and initial estimates of economic performance are subject to significant revisions. Different aspects of the economy affect different people in different ways (the political science literature on exactly how economic performance affects voter behavior comes to some diverse conclusions). And there are a number of non-economic variables pertinent to predicting presidential elections -- wars, candidate quality and ideology, turnout, scandals and so forth. 
But if you want to focus a single economic indicator, job growth during the presidential election year -- especially as measured by the series called nonfarm payrolls -- has a lot going for it.
For one thing, data related to the change in the level of employment have had among the highest correlations with electoral performance in the past. The correlations aren't perfect by any means. But if you perform a true apples-to-apples comparison (that is, looking at the economic indicators alone rather than muddying them with other sorts of extraneous variables), they do at least as well as anything else in predicting elections, and slightly better than some other commonly used metrics.
Just as important, there are a lot of qualitative reasons to focus on the jobs numbers. They measure something tangible and important. They receive much attention from economists, investors, political campaigns and the news media, and therefore inform the public discussion. They are released every month after only a minimal lag. They are subject to revision, and the revisions can be significant, but they aren't quite as bad as those for other economic series like G.D.P. or personal income growth. The jobs numbers are calculated in a comparatively straightforward way, and are usually in pretty good alignment with other economic measures. They don't need to be adjusted for inflation.
These qualitative factors are important because a sample size of 16 elections since World War II is insufficient to provide for persuasive statistical evidence as to which economic indicators (from among dozens or hundreds of credible candidates) are really best for predicting election outcomes in the long-run. Still, that the statistical relationship between job growth and re-election has been comparatively good in the past is reassuring.
In the table below, I've listed the annualized rate of payroll growth from January through October in the 16 presidential election years since World War II, then compared it to the margin of victory or defeat for the incumbent party. 
Because these growth rates are not commonly reported, I've used a little algebra to translate them into something I call "equivalent monthly jobs." This represents how many jobs would be added or subtracted per month using today's figure of 131.9 million payroll jobs as a baseline. 
In 1984 under Ronald Reagan, for instance, jobs grew at an annualized rate of 4.43 percent, which worked out to an average of 340,000 new jobs added per month from January through October. That's already a very good figure. But it's even better when you translate it into today's terms, since the adult population is now larger. Were payroll jobs to grow at 4.43 percent this year, that would translate to about 487,000 new jobs per month. (With numbers like that, you might be able to win re-election against George Washington, let alone Walter Mondale.)
In the three election years where the economy was actually shedding jobs, the incumbent party lost - badly in 1980 and in 2008, and in a close election in 1960. And George H.W. Bush lost in 1992 when the rate of job growth was under 1 percent, below the rate of population growth.
Overall, the relationship between job growth and electoral performance is good but not great. 
Roughly speaking, there were 10 election years in which you could make a pretty good prediction about the election outcome from knowing the jobs numbers alone: 1948, 1960, and then the eight elections from 1980 onward. 
The year 1992 is something of a borderline case - job growth was sluggish enough that you might have expected a loss for Mr. Bush, but not necessarily a clear loss. Still, there were some other things going on that year - Bill Clinton was a highly skilled and relatively moderate candidate, Ross Perot was in the race and Republicans had held the White House for three consecutive terms.
In six other elections, you would have needed to look beyond the jobs numbers to come to a good prediction about the outcome.
In 1964 and 1972, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon had strong jobs numbers and were clear favorites for re-election on that basis, but their huge margins of victory also came about in part because they were running against extremist opponents who had little appeal to swing voters.
In 1956, Dwight D. Eisenhower won an overwhelming victory despite the economic numbers being fairly average - perhaps a testament to his personal popularity, especially against a milquetoast Democratic opponent in Adlai Stevenson.
Meanwhile, there were three times that the incumbent party lost despite fairly strong jobs numbers. Gerald Ford was weighed down by Watergate and Richard Nixon's resignation in 1976. Hubert Humphrey in 1968 was running in the shadow of Johnson, who had become unpopular amid an environment of racial tension and protests over the Vietnam War. Stevenson, in 1952, had a number of things working against him: Democrats had occupied the White House for five consecutive terms, the Korean War had become fairly unpopular and he was running against one of the strongest opponents ever in Eisenhower.
A bit of common sense, in other words, can usually explain these outliers. (I won't go on another diatribe about this, but be wary of models that substitute data dredging for common sense.)
But what about Mr. Obama? 
If Mitt Romney is the Republican nominee, it doesn't seem as though the outcome is likely to be an outlier. Mr. Romney is, by most measures, a fairly average challenger - neither a bridge-building moderate like Eisenhower, nor someone far outside of the political mainstream like George McGovern.
Meanwhile, Mr. Obama has no major scandals or foreign policy debacles to deal with. 
Yes, there are little things that could matter around the margin - for instance, an unmotivated Democratic or Republican base, or Mr. Romney's mediocre favorability ratings. But those are things that might shift the outcome by a percentage point or two rather than producing a radical deviation from the economic fundamentals.
One way to estimate how many jobs Mr. Obama would need to create to win re-election is to look at the red regression line in the charts above. It crosses the horizontal axis at a figure of about 107,000 jobs per month.
What this means is that if we knew nothing else about the election but how many jobs were created between January and October 2012, we would deem Mr. Obama to be a favorite if the economy created more than 107,000 jobs per month and an underdog otherwise. Basically, this would represent job creation at about the rate of population growth.
However, there is no need for us to be so ignorant about some of the other evidence - and that evidence implies that Mr. Obama is not likely to get off quite so easily.
For one thing, we know that job creation was extremely poor during the first two years of Mr. Obama's tenure in office, and mediocre during the third year. How much does that matter?
Actually, it may matter less than you might think. The public has tended to give greater weight to recent job growth, discounting earlier performance when the trajectory seems positive.
In fact, if you run a regression analysis that looks at the payroll growth rate in the fourth year of a president's term alongside the rate in the first three years, the coefficient on the first three years is negative - seeming to imply that less job creation early in the term helps a president - although not to a statistically significant degree.
I would advise against taking this result too seriously. If you break it down in more detail, you'll find that job growth during the third year of a president's term has a positive effect on his re-election odds, while the coefficients attached to the first two years are negative. 
But none of these results are statistically significant or particularly close to it; only job growth during the fourth year of a president's term has a clear effect. 
We can get much more sensible results if we account for a president's approval rating. This allows us to see exactly what the public thinks about a president, rather than trying to reverse engineer that result through statistical means.
Mr. Obama's approval rating is now 46.5 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average. 
That isn't terrible -- it's in the range where Mr. Obama might be able to eke out a victory in the Electoral College -- but it's somewhat below average. From 1948 through 2008, the average president had an approval rating of 52 percent as of Feb. 1 of the election year, according to the Roper Center archives. 
If Mr. Obama has an approval rating of 52 percent by November, he will almost certainly win re-election. He'd also be a favorite if he's at 50 percent. And 48 percent or 49 percent might also do the trick, since at that point Mr. Obama's approval rating would likely exceed his disapproval rating.
But Mr. Obama is not quite there yet. The surest way for him to improve his approval rating will be to create jobs at a rate that exceeds the rate of population growth.
We can come up with an estimate of just how many jobs this might be if we put a president's approval rating as of Feb. 1 and the payrolls numbers into a regression equation.
I'll spare you the math (although it is straightforward), but this works out to a break-even number of 166,000 jobs per month - not a huge number, but more than the 107,000 that we had estimated before accounting for Mr. Obama's middling approval rating.
There are two other factors that are worth considering, one of which works for Mr. Obama and the other against him.
The favorable factor is that population growth is slower than at most points in the recent past, which puts somewhat less pressure on the job market. Specifically, the growth rate in the adult civilian population was about 0.9 percent in 2011, somewhat lower than the average of 1.3 percent since World War II. 
To clarify, this reflects the growth rate in the adult population and what the government defines as the labor force. I am not a fan of using calculations like the unemployment rate that rely on the definition of the labor force because entry and exit into the labor force can be counter-cyclical: more people exit the labor force when they perceive the economy to be weak, which "helps" a president given the way the unemployment rate is calculated, and vice versa. However, the growth in the adult population is relatively exogenous from economic performance and is probably worth considering.
The factor that works against Mr. Obama is a more detailed evaluation of his approval rating. Opinions about Mr. Obama are very polarized - his approval rating is 46.5 percent but his disapproval rating is 47.9 percent, according to Real Clear Politics. Very few people are undecided about Mr. Obama. (In contrast, Gerald Ford had an approval rating of 46 percent in Feb. 1976, but a disapproval rating of 40 percent - a lot of voters weren't quite sure what to think about him.)
If you run another version of the analysis that considers a president's net approval rating, along with the rate of payroll growth net of population growth, you come up with a break-even number of 151,000 jobs per month.
This is, in my view, a highly intuitive figure. When the payrolls number has come in below 150,000 jobs, most of the economists whose views I trust regard it is bad news. Above 150,000 jobs, and they regard it as a hopeful sign on balance.
What's more, current forecasts of job growth are very close to that 150,000 jobs figure. Last month's Wall Street Journal forecasting panel predicted payroll growth of 155,000 jobs per month through the end of 2012. 
Economic forecasts are frankly pretty mediocre, so take that with a grain of salt. With that said, consensus forecasts are better than individual forecasts, and I am certainly not claiming that I could do any better myself.
I also do not mean to suggest that the jobs numbers are the only thing that will matter. If payrolls growth averages 175,000 per month, Mr. Obama will probably be a favorite, but not a prohibitive one. If it averages 125,000 per month, he will be a modest underdog.
Still, the current forecast for labor growth points toward an extremely close election - one in which every job above or below that 150,000 threshold could be critical.

HEADLINE: What Will China Demand in Exchange for Helping Europe?

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: China has more than $3 trillion in foreign currency reserves, far more than any other nation, and for two years Europe has been begging Beijing to use some of that money to buy troubled European debt. Has China's economic might already reordered the global pecking order? Are European concessions, both economic and political, inevitable? 

 BODY:
China has more than $3 trillion in foreign currency reserves, far more than any other nation, and for two years Europe has been asking Beijing to use some of that money to buy troubled European debt. But in exchange for help, China has always demanded concessions Europeans found unsavory, such as dismantling European Union barriers to low-price Chinese goods.
As Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, made the pitch once more to Prime Minister Wen Jiaboa, Keith Bradsher and Liz Alderman report, an opinion article in the official China Daily newspaper "suggested that the European Union should also make political concessions - like lifting a longstanding ban on arms exports to China. 'As a Chinese saying goes, one does not visit the temple for nothing,' the column warned."
Perhaps Europe has already understood that; Mrs. Merkel was not pushing for China to allow its currency to rise, which would make its goods less competitive around the world. "Germany has joined the United States in the past in supporting a stronger renminbi," Keith and Liz write, "But Mrs. Merkel was circumspect on the subject Thursday, saying only that she supported the Chinese goal of working together to make the renminbi more convertible on global currency markets."
Has China's economic might already reordered the global pecking order? Are European concessions, both economic and political, inevitable, given China's power and Europe's weakness? Or has China actually used its power more conservatively on the world stage than Western powers have been using theirs for decades?

HEADLINE: Health Care Payers Push Back Against Costs

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The opacity surrounding prices and the practice of charging different buyers different prices for identical goods or services contribute mightily to the cost of health care, but at the least the former may be on the way out, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
In a paper, "Divide et Impera: Protecting the Growth of Health Care Incomes (Costs)," published this month in the British journal Health Economics, I summarize themes touched on here and there in several earlier posts on this blog.
My argument in the paper is that what is often called overuse of health care by what are often described as excessively insured Americans - especially their use of high-cost, high-tech procedures - is at best a partial explanation for the high cost of American health care. 
Yet cost-containment initiatives like high deductibles and co-insurance have taken use of health care as their chief target. These efforts will be only partly successful in controlling national health spending.
Equally important contributors to our high health spending, and probably more so, have been two other factors.
The first is the much higher administrative overhead costs loaded onto the American health system. David Cutler and Dan Ly, both of Harvard University, illuminate this proposition in their recent paper, "The (Paper) Work of Medicine: Understanding International Medical Costs," in which they compare health spending in Canada and the United States.
Earlier, in a 2003 paper, "Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada," Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, Terry Campbell and Dr. David Himmelstein estimated that in 1999 total administrative costs of health insurers and all other parties in health care, save patients, accounted for 31 percent of health care expenditures in the United States and 16.7 percent of health care expenditures in Canada.
A second major factor accounting for high health spending per capita in the United States is the significantly higher prices Americans pay for virtually all health care services and products.
My thesis on this issue - expressed in the title of my paper - is that these much higher prices are the product of a deliberate strategy, hashed out in our political bazaars between the supply side of health care and state and federal legislators, always to keep the payment side of our health system fragmented and relatively weak vis  vis the supply side of health care.
The vehement opposition to a public option in the health care reform law of 2010, for example, can be interpreted as a manifestation of that strategy.
This strategy is enhanced by the opacity of prices in American health care. As the Government Accountability Office noted in its September 2011 report to Congress on "Health Care Price Transparency" (see Table 5): "Meaningful price information is difficult for consumers to obtain prior to receiving care." This opacity shields the providers of health care from the price competition typical of other markets.
The opacity of health care prices in the United States is rooted in two additional features of our health system.
First, there is the still-heavy reliance on fee-for-service payment, which relies on price schedules (so-called "charge masters") including up to 20,000 items for hospitals and a government-approved fee schedule for physicians with 9,000 items.
It would be enormously difficult to make these huge price lists visible in a meaningful way to prospective patients. Here, for example, is a link to what appears to be the charge master of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Would price lists like that really help prospective patients shop prudently for health care?
California requires hospitals to quote uninsured prospective patients prices for standard procedures. A study by the Rand Corporation concluded, however, that this requirement is often breached and that "uninsured patients in California are unable to successfully obtain information about the cost of medical care at hospitals despite recent state legislation intended to improve price transparency."
A second feature that facilitates price opacity is the pervasive price discrimination that pervades the health care system in the United States.
Indeed, it is the practice of price discrimination - charging different customers different prices for identical goods and services - that compels both insurers and providers to treat the actual prices paid as a closely kept trade secret.
To an economist it is astonishing that Americans have been content for so long to allow an economic sector that has absorbed an increasing portion of their incomes - 18 percent of their gross domestic product now and 20 percent before too long - to operate without any meaningful price transparency. The question is how long this indifference can last.
My answer is not very long. Indeed, the best advice I could give members of the supply side of health care in the United States is to prepare themselves for operating increasingly in a statistical fishbowl that will flush information on the prices and the quality of their services onto Web sites accessible to the public. It has already begun.
Government agencies and private health insurers in recent years have begun at long last to make available comparative pricing data for different providers in specified market areas, sometimes for total prices, at other times only for the out-of-pocket payments that patients are likely to face (see Tables 1 and 4).
An interesting Web site on prices for health care appears to have been established by a physician who, as the father of a sick child, was appalled by the price opacity he confronted.
But better, publicly accessible price transparency is only one of the emerging pushbacks from the payment side of health care in the United States. Both private and public payers are experimenting with alternatives to the time-hallowed fee-for-service payment method that has long been thought to be the root of many problems in modern health systems.
I shall look at some of these initiatives in subsequent posts.

HEADLINE: A Bleak Outlook for Long-Term Growth

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy on nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
OVER the long term, the United States economy has been growing at its slowest rate since the Great Depression. Most other major developed countries have also experienced unusually slow growth over the last 10 years.
The American economy's reported 2.8 percent growth in the fourth quarter, at an annual rate, was seen as mildly encouraging. But it meant that over the previous 10 years, the economy had grown at a compound annual rate of just 1.7 percent. Until the current cycle, there had been no similar prolonged period of slow growth since the Depression.
The International Monetary Fund's latest forecasts indicate that there is not likely to be a pickup in growth anytime soon, either in the United States or other large industrialized countries. 
As the accompanying charts indicate, if the fund's forecasts of 1.8 percent real growth in 2012 and 2.2 percent in 2013 prove to be accurate, the 10-year American rate at the end of 2013 will have fallen to 1.5 percent, lower than any figure shown on the chart. But it will still be a little above the 0.9 percent compound growth rate in the decade from 1929, the year the Depression began, to 1939.
The charts show 10-year growth rates in the six other countries that used to make up the Group of 7 industrialized nations that would hold regular international summit meetings. Comparable data is available for all the countries only back to 1981, so the charts begin with the decade that ended in 1991.
If the I.M.F. forecasts are accurate, France, Italy and Britain will end 2013 with 10-year growth rates below any shown on the charts. Canada will hit a new low in 2012 before rising a bit in 2013. Its forecast 10-year growth rate of 1.8 percent would have seemed very low a few years ago. But it is the best of any of the countries shown.
For Britain, which endured a horrible decade in the 1970s that led to talk of the ''British disease,'' the previous postwar low, not shown in the charts, was in the 10 years ending in the second quarter of 1983, an annual rate of 0.95 percent. The figure for the 10 years through 2011 is 1.4 percent, but the I.M.F. predictions indicate the 2013 figure will fall to just 0.94 percent. The fund expects the British economy to grow by just 0.6 percent this year and by 2 percent in 2013.
The situation is even worse in Italy, where the fund expects the economy to contract by 2.2 percent this year and 0.6 percent the following year. If that happens, Italy's economy will be smaller at the end of 2013 than it was 10 years earlier. The French economy is forecast to have grown at a 1 percent annual rate over the same 10-year period.
Germany, which has prospered in part because other euro zone economies have lost competitiveness, now has a 10-year growth rate higher than it was a couple of years ago. But at 1.1 percent, forecast to rise to 1.2 percent by the end of 2013, it is hardly showing robust growth.
All the figures cited above are for so-called real growth, which includes adjustment for inflation. But the charts also show actual gross domestic product figures without the inflation adjustment. If nominal G.D.P. is rising rapidly, that can make it easier to repay long-term loans like mortgages even if most of the growth is due to inflation.
In Japan, where deflation has been persistent, there has been reported real growth only because of the adjustment. On a nominal basis, the Japanese economy is smaller than it was in 2001. In the other countries, nominal growth rates have been falling in recent years, a development that has made dealing with the housing crisis in the United States and Britain even more difficult.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: In Many Countries, G.D.P. Growth May Continue to Slow: Throughout the major industrial countries, long-term growth rates have been falling, and they may keep doing so. The latest forecasts by the International Monetary Fund point to slow growth over the next two years in most major countries, and to a shrinking economy in Italy. If the I.M.F. forecasts prove to be accurate, Italy's economy will be smaller at the end of 2013 than it was 10 years earlier. The charts show 10-year cumulative annual growth rates for gross domestic product in seven countries. The nominal figures show growth before inflation is considered
the real numbers show the rates after adjusting for inflation. G.D.P. growth is typically presented in real terms.: 10-year cumulative annual growth rate in G.D.P.

HEADLINE: 3-Year High For the Dow As Wall St. Cheers Data

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
It was just what the stock market needed. When one of the most closely watched data reports showed a generally strong picture of the United States economy on Friday, stocks on Wall Street picked right up and surged throughout the day, sending the Dow to its best closing level since 2008.
The catalyst for the gains, which extended the strong start to 2012, was the government's monthly snapshot of the jobs market, which showed some acceleration in the United States economy in January. Aside from the performance of the Dow, the markets responded with milestones of other sorts, with the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index pushing ahead by 6.94 percent for the year to date, its best such showing since the 13.97 percent gain in the similar period in 1987. 
In addition, the Nasdaq composite index turned in its best close since December 2000, when the boom in Internet stocks was turning to bust.
With recent economic reports having already painted a picture of a slow economic recovery, the Labor Department report -- a gain of 243,000 jobs in January, and the lowest unemployment rate since early 2009 -- gave equities a bit more fuel for improving sentiment among investors.
David Joy, the chief market strategist with Ameriprise Financial, said the ''tremendously robust'' jobs report ''reinforced the view that economic momentum is real and as a result it perhaps has some legs here.''
On Friday, the S.& P. was up 1.46 percent, or 19.36 points, at 1,344.90, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.23 percent, or 156.82 points, to 12,862.23, its best close since May 19, 2008, before the financial crisis. The Nasdaq surged by 1.61 percent, or 45.98 points, to 2,905.66, its highest close since Dec. 12, 2000.
That meant Wall Street finished off the five-day period with a gain of about 2 percent in the broader market, a 1.6 percent increase in the Dow and a 3 percent rise in the Nasdaq.
The gains extended what has been one of the best starts to a year in decades. The three major indexes each ended January higher, with the broader market as measured by the S.& P. up more than 4 percent, its biggest January gain since 1997.
The financial markets have been working through months of uncertainty over global economic growth and the volatility connected to the sovereign debt troubles in the euro zone. But so far this year there has been something of a reprieve, with investors trying to shake off some of the downside and pricing in the risks of the debt crisis, while also perhaps feeling emboldened about the prospects for economic growth, both in the United States and globally.
Financial stocks surged Friday by more than 2.7 percent, while energy, industrial, consumer discretionary and materials shares were up by more than 1 percent, showing the footprint of the Labor Department report on sectors seen as benefiting from economic growth.
Bank of America rose 5.2 percent, to $7.84. Citigroup was up 4.9 percent, to $33.54.
Mr. Joy said a rise in the financial sector could signal possible increased credit quality and earnings improvements in banks.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury fell 29/32 to 100 22/32, and its yield rose to 1.92 percent, from 1.82 percent on Thursday.
Michael Hood, the global markets strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management, said the 10-year Treasury had been fluctuating within its trading range of around 2 percent since November.
He also noted that United States and global markets were increasingly diverging, compared with the second half of last year in which major markets were more or less moving in step with one another in a risk-off, risk-on trading. But he said investors' concerns over fiscal policy, the euro zone and weakness in economic sectors like housing in the United States could potentially resurge.
''We have got tail winds coming from what looks like genuine improvement in the economic climate in many parts of the world,'' he said. ''For the time being we are trading off much better sentiment.''
The jobs report was the latest in a series of economic reports that have given the United States equities market cause for optimism and provided an important counterpoint to the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone.
In addition, the Commerce Department said factory orders rose 1.1 percent in December, although that was below forecasts of 1.5 percent and compared with the upwardly revised 2.2 percent jump in November.
Another report, from the Institute for Supply Management, showed that economic activity in the nonmanufacturing sector grew in January for the 25th consecutive month.
Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy at Glenmede, an investment and advisory firm, said that helped smooth the way for the crucial jobs report.
''Overall economic activity has definitely picked up in the right direction,'' he said. ''Today's is another data point on that trend.''

HEADLINE: Car Policy For Less, But Only If You Call

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
After you hear the tale of Thomas Mitchell, a retiree living in Arizona, you may suddenly have the urge to run to the phone and call your auto insurer. And perhaps even your life insurer. And your cable company. And anyone else you may do business with.
Most consumers know that they aren't going to get a courtesy call from their service providers telling them they qualify for a better deal. Yet they still fail to review their policies or contracts each year to make sure they're getting the lowest rates possible.
Well, Mr. Mitchell's accidental victory may provide just the needed incentive.
After retiring last summer from a long career as a programmer, Mr. Mitchell said he knew he should review his expenses and try to trim whatever he could. His hefty auto insurance premium on his two cars -- he was paying $2,537 a year -- seemed a juicy potential target. But he said he ''dillydallied,'' and didn't call his insurer, Liberty Mutual, until a couple of weeks ago, shortly after AARP contacted him by mail and urged him to call The Hartford for a free quote on his auto insurance. 
And it was a good thing he decided to call. The Hartford told him it could offer him a policy with the same coverage for just half -- yes, half -- the amount he was paying Liberty Mutual, or about $1,267. Mr. Mitchell said he contacted Liberty Mutual with the news. And wouldn't you know, the representative told him that it had revised its underwriting standards and he would now qualify for a premium of $1,207.
''I was happy to get the reduction, but I was dismayed to learn that the burden was on me, which means there are probably thousands of policy holders who are eligible for this but don't know what they don't know,'' said Mr. Mitchell, who was insuring a 2002 GMC Envoy and a 2010 Toyota Prius. ''It is a rip-off.''
Even more maddening, he said, was the conversation that ensued with a Liberty Mutual branch manager. Mr. Mitchell said he was really irked that the company was perfectly content to let him continue paying twice as much as he needed to, so he asked the manager if the company would have bothered to notify him of the ''underwriting changes'' when his policy came up for renewal this summer. ''To my astonishment, he admitted that the premium reduction would not have been brought to my attention unless I asked for it,'' he said.
Mr. Mitchell, who lives in Cave Creek, Ariz., is exactly the kind of customer you would expect Liberty Mutual would want to keep. A loyal client since 1973, he said he had a clean driving record with no accidents -- just a few broken glass claims -- and a credit score above the enviable 800 mark. Besides the auto coverage, he also has a homeowner's insurance policy with the company, which Mr. Mitchell thought might have worked in his favor to secure the reduced rate, since insurers often offer multipolicy discounts.
Liberty Mutual, not surprisingly, declined to get into specifics with me about Mr. Mitchell's situation, and provided a corporate-stamped response: ''We continually refine and enhance our ability to most accurately price each customer to reflect their individual risk, based on a large number of factors, and as a result a customer's price could move up or down,'' Glenn Greenberg, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual, said in an e-mail. ''We regularly advise our customers upon policy renewal that they may call us to discuss their coverage, benefits and discounts.''
And that drives home the point: the onus is always on you, the consumer, to do the heavy lifting, whether it's a big-ticket item like auto insurance or smaller bills from your cellphone or cable provider. It's a simple lesson, yes, but one that is worth remembering every so often. Of course, even when you make the time, finding the best deal isn't necessarily easy.
J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group, said he wasn't at all surprised by Mr. Mitchell's experience. After all, insurers aren't required to let you know when you're eligible for a lower rate, and it's hard to know if you're getting the best deal (though in California, insurers must sell their lowest-priced policies to those deemed ''good drivers,'' or people who have been driving for at least three years and have no more than one violation and no serious accidents on their record). ''If you shop for insurance, it is quite easy for one insurer to be half the price of another, even in the same group of insurers,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''It is very difficult to be sure you have the best price,'' he added, noting that many agents are working on commission, where higher premiums might translate into more income for the agent.
(Sales people typically collect roughly 8.5 percent of the premium, on average, said Robert Hartwig, president and economist at the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, but noted that direct-to-consumer companies often spend much more on advertising).
With the exception of New Hampshire, all states require drivers to have liability insurance, which pays for the other driver's medical expenses, car repairs and other costs when the policyholder is at fault. (Florida requires drivers to buy insurance that covers the occupants in the driver's car.) The minimum amount you must carry is set by state law, but many drivers choose to buy more coverage to protect their assets in the event of a costly accident.
Still, about 14 percent of drivers went uninsured in 2009, according to the Insurance Research Council, at least in part because some drivers cannot afford the insurance (Mississippi takes the prize for the state with the highest estimated rate of uninsured drivers at 28 percent, while Massachusetts and Maine have rates of only 4.5 percent. New York doesn't trail too far behind, at 5 percent).
Your insurance rate is probably based on a variety of factors, including your age, gender, marital status, education level, occupation, the type of car you're driving, where you live and your credit score. Of course, your driving record is also taken into account, as well as how much you drive. (A recent report, co-written by Mr. Hunter of the consumer group, contends that these pricing methods often work against lower-income drivers.)
As you shop around for a new (or better) quote, you should also consider factors beyond price alone, including the insurer's rating and responsiveness to claims, Mr. Hartwig said. You can typically find that information, including price comparisons and local consumer guides, on your state's insurance commissioner's Web site. New York State's Department of Financial Services, for instance, ranks 40 insurance companies by the number of complaints upheld against them as a percentage of their premium.
The average premium paid per car -- for liability, comprehensive and collision coverage -- was about $901 in 2009 (the latest figure available), according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. But judging from Mr. Mitchell's situation, you're likely to encounter a wide range of prices.
Mr. Hunter said that consumers should specifically ask the insurer -- not the agent -- whether they were being offered the lowest rate they qualify for, or they should ask the agent to ask the insurer. And he suggested asking for it in writing.
''I was working on the assumption that they were all the same,'' Mr. Mitchell said.

HEADLINE: Google Is Asked to Delay Privacy Shift

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- European governments, supported by the top justice official in the European Union, are pressing Google to halt coming changes to its privacy policies while they investigate the implications for personal data protection.
The move is a shot across the bow for a range of companies, including Facebook, that rely on the European market of 500 million people for a hefty chunk of their business. It comes amid a new drive to make privacy protection in Europe -- where people are generally more wary than Americans about surveillance by companies and governments -- more coherent and efficient.
Viviane Reding, the E.U. justice commissioner, called on European authorities Friday ''to ensure that E.U. law is fully complied with in Google's new privacy policy.'' 
She was backing a request sent Thursday by national data protection authorities to Google, asking that the search engine company suspend its plans to change its privacy policies on March 1 while they conduct an inquiry into the implications for citizens and users.
The authorities wrote to Larry Page, the chief executive of Google, to ''call for a pause in the interests of ensuring that there can be no misunderstanding about Google's commitments to information rights of their users and E.U. citizens.''
Ms. Reding said Friday that the investigation would help give ''legal certainty for citizens and businesses.''
The European action follows the announcement by Google in late January that it would combine about 60 privacy policies for separate products to create a simple system for users that also satisfied the wishes of regulators.
The changes also would mean that Google could use information shared on one Google service in other Google services for people logged into a Google account. For example, Google could guide a user who had looked for recipes using the Google search engine to relevant cooking videos the next time that person signed in to YouTube, which is also owned by Google.
The company said Friday that it was prepared to answer any questions raised by the investigation but gave no indication that it would delay the changes. Instead, it suggested that any delay instituting the new policy would harm rather than help the 350 million users it had already notified about the changes.
''As part of announcing our new privacy policy, we've made the largest communication to users in our history,'' said Alistair Verney, a Google spokesman in Europe. ''Delaying the new policy would cause significant confusion.''
The French data privacy regulator, known as CNIL, is conducting the investigation on behalf of 26 other E.U. governments. CNIL said Friday that there was no formal deadline for completing the inquiry. ''Of course, we're going to try to do it as quickly as possible,'' said Gwendal Le Grand, an official at CNIL.
He said the timing would depend on how long it took investigators to sift through the changes and evaluate the implications, and on how long it took Google to respond to further questions.
The investigation is the clearest sign so far of a new drive to streamline privacy protection in Europe. That effort, led by Ms. Reding, would require national authorities to delegate a single country, most likely where a company is based, to conduct privacy investigations.
Google has opened a large office in Paris, but the company said its European headquarters were in Dublin.
Mr. Le Grand, the French official, said his agency had the power to fine companies up to --100,000, or about $132,000, for a first offense and up to --300,000 for repeat offenses.
But the fact that a member state is conducting the inquiry, rather than E.U. authorities in Brussels, illustrates how European laws remain a hodgepodge, particularly in the area of justice and home affairs.
Under a new law proposed by Ms. Reding, which still must be approved by the European Parliament and E.U. governments, member states still would lead such investigations.
Ms. Reding would get added power under the new law to sue a member state that conducted an inquiry improperly, for example by failing to delegate an investigation to a single authority in Europe, like the French agency, or by failing to take into account her opinion or the opinions of other governments.
The investigation into Google also seems to reflect a degree of coordination with like-minded counterparts in the U.S. Congress.
Eight members of the House of Representatives, including Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, and Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, sent Mr. Page a formal request for information about Google's new privacy policy on Jan. 26. The letter contained 11 questions about the new policy, including whether consumers could opt out of the new system, either globally or on a product-by-product basis.
The privacy policy investigation is just the latest challenge to Google in Europe. The European Commission, the E.U. executive agency, already is investigating the giant Internet search and advertising company for possible breaches of antitrust laws. The commission could send formal charges to Google this spring.
The commission also is considering whether to approve the purchase by Google of Motorola Mobility, a maker of smartphones.
In recent years European authorities have also been disturbed by the way Google has treated privacy issues in Germany and in other countries related to its Street View mapping service and by the ramifications of Google's project to digitize books.
The letter sent to Google on Thursday came from a so-called Article 29 Working Party representing the 27 national data protection authorities across the Union. The group's name comes from the E.U. directive on data protection that established it.
''Given the wide range of services you offer, and popularity of these services, changes in your privacy policy may affect many citizens in most or all of the E.U. member states,'' Jacob Kohnstamm, the chairman of the working party and of the Dutch Data Protection Authority, wrote to Mr. Page. ''We wish to check the possible consequences for the protection of the personal data of these citizens in a coordinated procedure,'' Mr. Kohnstamm wrote.
In a three-page response posted on Friday afternoon on Google's Web site, Peter Fleischer, the global privacy counsel for Google, wrote that there had been ''misconceptions that have been spread about these changes by some of our competitors.''
Mr. Fleischer explained that the company had briefed data authorities across the European Union before the announcement and that at ''no stage did any E.U. regulator suggest that any sort of pause would be appropriate.''
David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.

HEADLINE: Debt Help for Middle Class

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
More middle-income consumers are seeking help through formal debt-reduction plans, according to an Atlanta-based credit counseling outfit.
In 2007, the average income for clients entering debt-management plans through the agency, CredAbility, was $43,000, and their average credit-card debt was roughly $22,000, said Mark Cole, executive vice president. 
Last year, though, their average income was $54,000, and their average credit card debt was $24,000, he said. (The median income in the United States is about $50,000, he noted.)
Mr. Cole said the housing debacle and continued high unemployment rates were probably behind the trend. Middle-income borrowers are more likely to own homes, but they are now unable to borrow against the equity of their houses, because home values have fallen and lending requirements have tightened. They must increasingly turn to credit cards for emergency spending, and so are running up debt on plastic.
And, although it might seem as though borrowers with higher incomes should find it easier to get out of debt, that's not necessarily the case, he said. ''Often, what we see is they are much slower to make lifestyle changes than blue-collar or lower-income people,'' he said. They have become used to driving new cars and having the latest cellphone, so ''there are appearances they want to keep up.''
The agency compiled the statistics as it enters its busy season. Typically, consumers begin flocking to debt-counseling centers in mid-January, when they start getting the statements showing their holiday credit-card spending. The agency and others like it negotiate lower interest rates with credit card companies, if the borrower agrees to make regular payments to pay off the debt - typically, over three to five years.
Were you shocked by your holiday credit-card statements? How are you planning to pay off the debt?

HEADLINE: With Opposition Mounting, Florida Mega-Casino Bill Is Withdrawn

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- The richly financed push to bring three mega-casinos to South Florida fizzled in the Legislature on Friday, defeated for the time being by mounting opposition across the state and the uncertainty of election-year politics.
''It was one of these ideas that the longer it sits around and the more it is scrutinized, the smellier it becomes,'' said Dan Gelber, a former member of the State House and the South Florida chairman of No Casinos, an advocacy group that fought the bill. ''At least this proves that money can't buy you love sometimes.'' 
Major casino operators, including Genting Berhad, a Malaysian conglomerate that bought bayfront property in Miami on which to build a mammoth resort, unleashed a torrent of political contributions and lobbyists on Florida's Capitol. Their job was to convince lawmakers that casinos would churn out jobs and revenue, and help dispel the state's economic gloom.
But powerful forces aligned quickly against the bill. Led by Disney World and the Florida Chamber of Commerce, opponents argued that Florida's wholesome family-friendly image would suffer. Other critics soon joined them, including Norman Braman, an auto dealership magnate in South Florida, religious groups, the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association and the mostly conservative Legislature, which is generally opposed to gambling. The groups expressed worries about crime, the impact on local businesses and hotels, and traffic, among other things.
Support began to erode, not build, over the past few months. A poll in late January by Bendixen & Amandi International showed Miami-Dade County voters evenly divided about the prospect of casinos at their doorstep, with 46 percent opposed. Several months ago, a survey of likely voters found 38 percent opposed to casino gambling.
The bill faced its first test before a committee in the State House on Friday but lacked the votes to progress. Rather than lose the vote, Representative Erik Fresen, the Miami Republican who sponsored the House bill, pulled the measure and postponed the vote. There is next to no chance that it will come up for another vote this year.
Both sides agree that the battle is far from over. A retooled casino bill is expected to make a comeback during the 2013 legislative session, when redistricting skirmishes and election wrangling will no longer be a factor.
''I'm sure it will be back,'' said Nick Iarossi, a lobbyist for Las Vegas Sands, one of the companies pushing the bill. ''There are lots of embedded interests who want to see it happen and who are in it for the long haul.''
Mr. Gelber agreed. ''This is Round 1,'' he said.
Jessica Hoppe, the senior vice president for government affairs and general counsel of Genting's Resorts World Miami, said in a statement that the company remained ''committed to the vision of world-class destination resorts in the South Florida community.''
After the vote was postponed on Friday, Mr. Fresen said it was important to withdraw the bill ''to continue the conversation.'' He said he knew that getting the bill through the conservative Legislature would be difficult. If anything, he said, this year's attempt served as a curtain-raiser, exposing voters and lawmakers to the idea of resort casinos.
Mr. Iarossi, who said the bill would have failed in committee by one vote, acknowledged that the legislation was swamped by layers of competing special interests. They include the Seminole tribe, which runs several large casinos in the state; the ''racinos,'' or racetrack-gambling parlors in South Florida, which wanted equal treatment; tourism titans and large out-of-state casino companies. All of them sought revisions in the bills to suit their needs. If the bill had been approved, the casinos were required to bring $2 billion each in investment to their projects.
The two bills -- one in the Senate and one in the House -- tried to bring greater regulation and oversight to gambling in Florida. But in a bid to draw support the bills morphed into two divergent proposals, with the Senate bill vastly expanding gambling in the state, a move that further complicated efforts.
''This is just a very difficult issue with a lot of moving parts,'' Mr. Iarossi said. ''I don't think any one opponent could stop it. I think it's a combination of factors.''
The fact that redistricting is taking place this year, leaving a number of lawmakers uncertain about which districts they will run in and who will run against them, also contributed to the bill's downfall, Mr. Iarossi said.
''The safe vote is no,'' Mr. Iarossi added.
But Mr. Gelber said that gambling proponents tried to sugarcoat the impact that large casinos would have had on South Florida, inflating the benefits. The tactic, he said, ultimately backfired and bolstered the opposition.
''There was a lot of deception in how they sold it initially,'' Mr. Gelber said. ''They said it was not an expansion of gambling, yet they are building the largest casino in the world, and they are saying it's not going to change the texture of our quality of life.''
As Mr. Gelber geared up to raise money for the effort to stop the bill, he found it was quite easy. Mr. Braman and Tony Goldman, the real estate developer, were the first to write big checks. Soon, homeowners' associations in Miami were railing against the bill and testifying before the Legislature.
''They thought people would just say, 'Oh, what a pretty picture,' and line up for it,'' Mr. Gelber added. ''They got a community that was thoughtful, that said this isn't who we want to be.''

HEADLINE: Job Gains Reflect Hope A Recovery Is Blooming

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The front wheels have lifted off the runway. Now, Americans are waiting to see if the economy can truly get aloft.
With the government reporting that the unemployment rate and the number of jobless fell in January to the lowest levels since early 2009, the recovery seems finally to be reaching American workers.
The Labor Department's latest snapshot of the job market, released on Friday, makes clear that employers have been hiring more in recent months, with 243,000 net new jobs in January. The unemployment rate now stands at 8.3percent, down from 8.5 percent a month earlier and from 9.1 percent as recently as last August.
Economists were encouraged, though they expect some fits and starts along the road to recovery. 
''I do think we're at the point where we're in a self-sustaining, positive reinforcing picture,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Financial Services Group.
Stocks rallied on the brightening outlook, reaching multiyear highs.
The report revealed job gains not just for the last month but for previous months. December job growth was revised to 203,000, from the original 200,000. The job gains for November, originally 100,000 jobs, were revised upward to 157,000, creating a picture of a job market that has been gathering steam.
The private sector remained the engine of growth. While federal agencies and local governments continued to lay off workers, businesses added 257,000 net new jobs in January. The biggest gains were in manufacturing, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality.
Despite the promising numbers, various indicators create an ambiguous picture of the overall economic recovery.
Layoffs appear to be slowing as fewer people are filing claims for unemployment benefits, and factory orders have picked up.
Small businesses, though, are still not hiring much. And while sales of existing homes have started to rise, home prices continue to fall. Incomes are not growing and consumer spending is still restrained, and could come under further pressure with gas prices edging higher in recent months and as consumers revert to building up savings.
Seasonal factors may have inflated January hiring numbers in some industries, like restaurants or construction.
Steve Blitz, senior economist for ITG Investment Research, said the report nevertheless revealed strong increases in manufacturing and related job categories, like transportation and warehousing and wholesale trade. ''You've got to give credit when things are moving in the right direction,'' said Mr. Blitz, who has been cautious in heralding a recovery. ''This is not a process that is going to be done in a month or two months or a year. It could take five or 10 years to get there.''
Others were unconvinced that the recent pace of job growth would be sustained, pointing to moderate consumer spending and mild economic growth, 1.7 percent last year.
''The problem is that there is this bifurcation here in the numbers,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''On the one hand we see rather impressive job growth, but on the other hand we're also seeing other economic indicators that are telling us that the economy is fundamentally weak.''
Mr. Baumohl added, ''We're going to have to really very carefully dig deep below the surface for these and a lot of other economic statistics to find a consistency of what is happening in the U.S. economy.''
The unemployment rate appeared to be falling because people were genuinely securing jobs rather than merely leaving the work force. The Labor Department adjusted its data to account for new population estimates from the 2010 Census.
Accounting for those adjustments, the labor force had a net gain of 250,000 people in January from a month earlier. Although the pool of unemployed people has been shrinking, the number remains high -- 12.8 million -- about equal to the population of Pennsylvania, and long-term unemployment is one of the most crushing legacies of this recent recession. For January, the Labor Department reported that 5.5 million people had been out of work for six months or more, about 43 percent of the jobless.
And according to an analysis of December's job numbers released this week by the Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative, nearly a third of the jobless have been unemployed for a year or more.
Underemployment is another stubborn problem. The number of people working part time because they cannot find full-time work was 8.2 million in January. Including that group and the 1.1 million who stopped looking for work altogether, and the broader measure of unemployment was 15.1 percent.
''You have an interesting situation where you have some permanent part-time workers,'' said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. ''These people are in jobs and the jobs are not likely to become full time.''
Sandy Pochapin, a 54-year-old former marketing manager, was laid off for the second time last May from a small business in Newton, Mass. Just before the start of the year she picked up a part-time job as a media consultant at an advertising agency. Her husband, a real estate lawyer, has also experienced severe cutbacks in his income.
The couple, who are now paying three times what they were paying for health care before Ms. Pochapin lost her job, have cut back on dinners out, and she said that replacing her eight-year-old Toyota Highlander was ''not in the cards.'' More painfully, the couple have dipped into their college-age son's educational fund to keep up with mortgage payments and other expenses.
Ms. Pochapin, a member of several networking groups, compiles job leads and recently sent out a list with more openings than she had ever seen. ''I would say things are picking up,'' she said. ''But where they're picking up is not where people who have been unemployed long term have skills.'' She noted many openings for jobs in mobile marketing and for digital media specialists.
Indeed, one of the perennial complaints of employers is that they cannot find qualified workers. Ancestry.com, a genealogy Web site in Provo, Utah, has openings for 150 engineers, data mining specialists and developers of mobile apps. ''While we find a lot of people who are unemployed,'' said Eric Shoup, a senior vice president, ''they are not the people who bring the skill sets we need for our business.''
He said the company did virtually all its hiring away from other companies.
Economists are beginning to worry about the self-fulfilling nature of long-term unemployment. ''It's almost starting to look like there are two job markets,'' said Cliff Waldman, the economist at the Manufacturers Alliance, a trade group. ''Long-term unemployment is very sticky.''

HEADLINE: Can Egypt Avoid Pakistan's Fate?

BYLINE: By MICHELE DUNNE and SHUJA NAWAZ. 
Michele Dunne, a former White House and State Department official, and Shuja Nawaz, the author of ''Crossed Swords: Pakistan, Its Army, and the Wars Within,'' are the directors of the Middle East and South Asia centers, respectively, at The Atlantic Council.

 BODY:
Washington
ONE year after the revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian military is closing down civil society organizations and trying to manipulate the constitution-writing process to serve its narrow interests. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, where the military has also held sway for more than half the country's existence -- for much of that time, with America's blessing -- a new civil-military crisis is brewing.
For the United States, the parallels are clear and painful. Egypt and Pakistan are populous Muslim-majority nations in conflict-ridden regions, and both have long been allies and recipients of extensive military and economic aid. 
Historically, American aid tapers off in Pakistan whenever civilians come to power. And in Egypt, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both resisted pressure from Congress to cut aid to Mr. Mubarak despite his repression of peaceful dissidents.
It is no wonder that both Egyptians and Pakistanis express more anger than appreciation toward the United States. They have seen Washington turn a blind eye to human-rights abuses and antidemocratic practices because of a desire to pursue regional objectives -- Israeli security in the case of Egypt, and fighting Al Qaeda in the case of Pakistan.
The question now is whether the United States will, a year after the Egyptian revolution, stand by and allow the Pakistani model of military dominance and a hobbled civilian government to be replicated on the Nile.
Pakistan and Egypt each have powerful intelligence and internal security agencies that have acquired extra-legal powers they will not relinquish easily. Pakistan's history of fomenting insurgencies in neighboring countries has caused serious problems for the United States. And Egypt's internal security forces have been accused of involvement in domestic terrorist attacks and sectarian violence. (However, Washington has long seen Egypt's military as a stabilizing force that keeps the peace with Israel.)
The danger is that in the future, without accountability to elected civilian authorities, the Egyptian military and security services will seek to increase their power by manipulating Islamic extremist organizations in volatile and strategically sensitive areas like the Sinai Peninsula.
Despite the security forces' constant meddling in politics, Pakistan at least has a Constitution that establishes civilian supremacy over the military. Alarmingly, Egypt's army is seeking even greater influence than what Pakistan's top brass now enjoys: an explicit political role, and freedom from civilian oversight enshrined in law.
Egypt's army was once considered heroic for siding with peaceful demonstrators against Mr. Mubarak, but it has badly mishandled the country in the past year. The riot at a soccer match on Wednesday that killed around 70 people underscored the leadership's failure to undertake badly needed police reform and restore security. The economy is teetering, peaceful demonstrators have been tried in military courts, anti-Christian violence has spiked and ministers appointed by the military have hounded civil society groups that advocate government accountability, budget transparency, human rights and free elections.
A dismayed Congress has attached conditions to future military assistance to Egypt (now $1.3 billion a year), requiring the Obama administration to certify that the military government is maintaining peace with Israel, allowing a transition to civilian rule and protecting basic freedoms -- or to waive the conditions on national security grounds -- if it wants to keep aid flowing.
The Egyptian military is clearly not meeting at least two of those three conditions right now. Consequently, the Obama administration should not certify compliance, nor should it invoke the national security waiver by arguing that Egyptian-Israeli peace is paramount and that Egypt's military is the only bulwark against Islamist domination of the country -- because both of these arguments are deeply flawed.
First, hardly anyone in Egypt favors war with Israel, and a freeze or suspension of American aid would not change that. Second, continuing support to an Egyptian military that is bent on hobbling a liberal civil society would only strengthen Islamist domination. Islamist groups won some 70 percent of seats in the recent parliamentary elections, but they will now face tremendous pressure to solve the deep economic and political problems that caused the revolution.
In Egypt, as in Pakistan, the ultimate solution is a peaceful transfer of power to elected, accountable civilians and the removal of the military's overt and covert influence from the political scene. At a minimum, Egypt should establish the clear supremacy of the civilian government over the military and allow an unfettered civil society to flourish.
Washington should suspend military assistance to Egypt until those conditions are met. Taking that difficult step now could help Egypt avoid decades of the violence, terrorism and cloak-and-dagger politics that continue to plague Pakistan.

HEADLINE: U.N. Nuclear Inspectors' Visit to Iran Is a Failure, West Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH and DAVID E. SANGER; Robert F. Worth reported from Dubai, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Reporting was contributed by William J. Broad, J. David Goodman and Rick Gladstone from New York, and Elisabeth Bumiller from Ramstein Air Base, Germany.

 BODY:
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- American and European officials said Friday that a mission by international nuclear inspectors to Tehran this week had failed to address their key concerns, indicating that Iran's leaders believe they can resist pressure to open up the nation's nuclear program.
The assessment came as Iran's supreme leader lashed out at the United States, vowing to retaliate against oil sanctions and threats of military action and warning that any attack ''would be 10 times worse for the interests of the United States'' than it would be for Iran. 
While the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who returned to Vienna after a three-day mission in Tehran, said nothing substantive about their trip and were planning to return to Iran later this month, diplomats briefed on the trip said that Iranian officials had not answered the questions raised in an incriminating report issued by the agency in November.
That report cited documents and evidence of experiments with detonators that strongly suggested Iran might have worked on technologies to turn its nuclear fuel into working weapons and warheads. Tehran has insisted its uranium enrichment activities are peaceful and has dismissed the evidence suggesting otherwise as fabricated or taken out of context, and has refused to engage in substantive discussions or inspections.
Members of the I.A.E.A. delegation were told that they could not have access to Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an academic who is widely believed to be in charge of important elements of the suspected weaponization program, and that they could not visit a military site where the agency's report suggested key experiments on weapons technology might have been carried out.
''The agency expressed interest in all the areas of concern,'' said a diplomat based in Vienna, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''The team asked for access in the future to different types of sites and personnel, and that was denied.''
One senior American official described the session between the agency and Iranian nuclear officials as ''foot-dragging at best and a disaster at worst.'' But a diplomat at the agency's headquarters in Vienna said ''disaster is too strong a word.'' He added: ''Iran has refused to address the issue for three years now. To be fair, you have to give them credit for at least discussing it. The dialogue is continuing, and that's a good sign.''
In Tehran, the speech by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made during Friday Prayer and broadcast live to the nation, came amid deepening American concern about a possible military strike on Iran's nuclear enrichment sites by Israel, whose leaders delivered blunt new warnings on Thursday about what they called the need to stop Iran's nuclear program. Israel considers a nuclear-armed Iran a threat to its existence.
Israeli leaders have issued mixed signals regarding their intentions, suggesting that they are willing, for a short time at least, to wait and see if increasingly strict sanctions, including a European oil embargo, will force Iran to give in to inspectors' demands, and to cease the production of at least some of the uranium that outside experts fear could be turned into bomb fuel.
The ayatollah also issued an unusually blunt warning that Iran would support militant groups opposing Israel, an action that some analysts said could be held up by Israel as a casus belli.
Reinforcing the concern, ABC News reported on Friday that Israeli consular officials were warning of possible attacks on Israeli government sites abroad and synagogues and Jewish schools. ABC quoted an internal Israeli document as saying, ''We predict that the threat on our sites around the world will increase.''
Without being specific, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Iran ''had its own tools'' to respond to threats of war and would use them ''if necessary,'' the Mehr news agency reported.
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the sanctions as ''painful and crippling,'' according to Iranian news agencies, acknowledging the effect of recent measures aimed at cutting off Iran's Central Bank from the international financial system. But he also said the sanctions would ultimately benefit his country. ''They will make us more self-reliant,'' he said, according to a translation by Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency.
In recent weeks, senior American and European officials have visited Israel to counsel patience, warning that a military attack could backfire and strengthen what they called Iran's determination to acquire nuclear weapons.
Two senior Israeli officials, including the head of the Mossad, the intelligence agency believed to be responsible for the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists, visited Washington over the past week, for what officials described as sometimes contentious meetings. Israeli officials say they are worried that Iran may soon be immune to the threat of airstrikes as its enrichment facilities are moved into deep mountain bunkers.
Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, said at a conference in Israel on Thursday that if sanctions failed to stop Iran's nuclear program, Israel would need to ''consider taking action,'' according to the newspaper Haaretz.
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Friday, echoed the sentiment.
''My view is that right now the most important thing is to keep the international community unified in keeping that pressure on, to try to convince Iran that they shouldn't develop a nuclear weapon, that they should join the international family of nations and that they should operate by the rules that we all operate by,'' he said. ''But I have to tell you, if they don't, we have all options on the table, and we'll be prepared to respond if we have to.''
In Washington, there was evidence on Friday that a new Senate bill for tougher sanctions, which could effectively sever Iranian banks from a global financial telecommunications network, was having an effect, even before a full Senate vote.
The network, known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, would face unspecified penalties under the legislation if it failed to sever sanctioned Iranian banks. Swift, based in Belgium, said in a statement on Friday that it ''fully understands and appreciates the gravity of the situation,'' and was working with banking regulators ''to find the right multilateral legal framework which will enable Swift to address the issues.''
Expulsion from Swift could be catastrophic for Iran's economy by blocking a major conduit for foreign revenue.

HEADLINE: Man Admits To Selling Pesticides Ruled Illegal

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
A man charged with distributing illegal and potentially lethal Chinese pesticides like ''The Cat Be Unemployed'' -- apparently a reference to the poison's rodent-killing ability -- pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors on Friday. 
The man, Jia Ping Chen, admitted that he sold at least 2,000 packets of a cockroach killer called Mie Zhang Qing that was not registered with the Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr. Chen, a Chinese citizen who lives in Queens, looked downward and spoke softly in Federal District Court in Manhattan, his words translated by an interpreter.
''Last year I sold these pesticides,'' he told Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck, adding, ''That was not authorized.''
Each charge of distributing unauthorized pesticides carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison. Mr. Chen, whose name was originally given as Jai by prosecutors, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 11.
Federal prosecutors said that Mr. Chen was one of a dozen defendants who had sold and delivered thousands of packets of ''unregistered and mislabeled'' pesticides and rodent-killing substances to undercover agents in or near Chinatown in Lower Manhattan between May and August.
The pesticides had names like ''Fuzhou Control Termite Company Cockroach Killer Bait'' and ''The Cat Be Unemployed,'' the name emblazoned on a bright yellow label with an illustration of a pleased-looking white cat.
Officials said the packages did not bear the warning or instruction labels that are customary in the United States.
An investigation by several agencies began after a woman ingested blue-green liquid from a ''Cat Be Unemployed'' container in December 2010, believing it was medicine. She became gravely ill, court papers said.
The authorities determined that the liquid contained nearly 61 times the amount of brodifacoum, a powerful rodent killer, permitted by the E.P.A. The substance is an anticoagulant, causing internal bleeding in rodents. The chemical is so dangerous, officials said, that its use is illegal in urban areas unless licensed professionals wearing protective gear apply it.
Federal regulators have recently moved to restrict its use further, in part because its ingestion could kill a small child.

HEADLINE: House Approves 4 Years of Funds for Aviation Programs

BYLINE: By ASHLEY SOUTHALL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House on Friday approved $63 billion to pay for federal aviation programs through 2015, acting after five years of dispute and 23 short-term extensions of financing that the Federal Aviation Administration said made it harder to carry out its mandate. 
The bill provides money for airport construction and expansion, for upgrading air traffic control systems to use Global Positioning System technology, and for an expansion of the use of unmanned drones in domestic airspace, among other things.
The measure, a compromise between the Republican-controlled House and Democrat-controlled Senate, passed on a 248-169 vote. A majority of Republicans supported the bill, while Democrats overwhelmingly opposed it. The Senate is expected to approve the bill next week, sending it to the White House for President Obama to sign.
''This bipartisan long-term blueprint for aviation programs is nearly five years overdue,'' said Representative John L. Mica, the Republican chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. ''Democrats failed to pass a reauthorization and address needed reforms during the four years they controlled the House and Senate. Twenty-three short-term hiccup extensions later, Congress is now acting to ensure that the U.S. aviation system remains a strong and vital part of our economy.''
The bill is the first long-term extension for the aviation agency since 2007. Negotiators from both parties struck an agreement to finance the agency on Tuesday after years of debate that jeopardized long-term projects and forced a partial shutdown of the agency last summer. The shutdown cost the government $350 million in lost taxes on airline tickets.
The financing would speed the agency's transition to GPS technology as it prepares for a sharp increase in air traffic. The program, called NextGen, would allow pilots to know exactly where other planes and obstacles are, facilitating closer, more frequent landings and takeoffs and fewer delays and diversions.
Twenty-four Democrats supported the bill despite their objections to some of its provisions, such as a requirement that at least 50 percent of an airline's employees support a vote on organizing a union before that vote can take place, up from 35 percent.
The labor provisions are ''unnecessary language that would inject politics in what otherwise should be a clean bill to make the skies safer,'' said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, a Democrat who voted against the bill.
The bill does not include passenger protections that Democrats favored, like ensuring that planes do not wait more than three hours on an airport tarmac before takeoff or after landing.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Jump 1.1% as Businesses Invest in Heavy Machinery

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to factories rose in December, supported by a rebound in business investment in capital goods. In addition, service companies grew at the fastest pace in 11 months in January as companies started hiring to keep up with rising demand. 
Factory orders rose 1.1 percent in December after gaining 2.2 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported Friday. For the year, total orders were up 12.1 percent after a gain of 12.9 percent in 2010. Orders had plunged 22.1 percent in the 2009.
For December, orders for so-called core capital goods, which are viewed as a good measure of business investment plans, rose 3.1 percent to a record high. That gain was driven in part by a rush by businesses to take advantage of expiring tax breaks.
The advances in 2011 pushed orders for the year up to $5.36 trillion, still slightly below the peak of $5.44 trillion set in 2008.
For December, orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, rose 3 percent, a figure that was unchanged from a preliminary report last week. Orders for nondurable goods slipped 0.4 percent, reflecting declines in petroleum products.
The orders category that signals business investment plans, nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, climbed to a high of $68.9 billion in December.
While some of that surge most likely reflected a rush to order before investment tax breaks expired at the end of last year, many economists say they believe the boom in spending on new equipment will continue even without the tax breaks because there is a large amount of pent-up demand on the part of businesses to modernize their operations.
Separately, the Institute for Supply Management said on Friday that its index of nonmanufacturing activity jumped to 56.8 percent in January from 53 percent in December. The survey's employment index soared to its highest level since February 2006. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The trade group of purchasing managers surveys businesses, including restaurants, hotels, retailers, financial services firms and construction companies. The service sector employs nine out of 10 American workers.
Nearly every component of the I.S.M. index suggested that business for nonmanufacturing companies was picking up. Companies said business activity, new orders, exports and imports all rose. Inventories shrank more quickly, indicating solid sales, and deliveries from suppliers slowed down.
Economists say the service sector received a boost from strong new orders the previous month. In January, new orders grew for the fourth consecutive month, at the fastest pace since last March.
The report ''provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is strengthening,'' Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. But he warned that the economic momentum might fade quickly, as it did after strong starts to 2010 and 2011.
''As the unwinding of the previous fiscal stimulus starts to bite and as global demand falters, something similar may be on the cards this year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Las Vegas, Making Sure The Caucuses Accommodate

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- When Nevada held its first Republican caucuses in 2008, Philip A. Kantor walked to the library next door to his synagogue. He took in the spectacle, watching others ballot for their chosen candidate. But he could not take part -- as an Orthodox Jew, he was forbidden from writing on the Sabbath.
Frustrated, he promised himself to prevent a similar setup in the next election. But by the time state party officials announced the date of this year's caucuses, Mr. Kantor realized that he would be barred again, unless they made special provisions. 
Mr. Kantor placed several calls to friends and colleagues he knew were influential in G.O.P. circles, including to his longtime friend Sheldon Adelson, a Jewish philanthropist and Republican donor. Within weeks, Mr. Kantor had a meeting with the Clark County party chairman. After considerable back and forth, Mr. Kantor was assured that he and other Orthodox Jews would be welcome during a special caucus Saturday night, hours after others would end.
Even by the most generous estimate, Jews make up just 3 percent of the population in Nevada. But they have a long history in Las Vegas -- many of the pioneer developers were Jews, as are both the current and former mayor -- and the number of Orthodox Jews has grown steadily over the last two decades.
Suddenly, those Orthodox Jews have been thrust into the spotlight, and come Saturday night all eyes will be on the special caucus that is expected to draw, at most, a few hundred Sabbath observers. Rabbis in several congregations are urging their Republican congregants to show up, lest the public dismiss the caucus as a needless accommodation.
''It's an important moment and milestone for us,'' said Rabbi Eliyahu Davidowitz, who moved here with his family from Queens three years ago to help set up a full-time adult religious school known as a kollel.
In New York, with a considerable Orthodox population, it would strike many politicians as inconceivable to even propose holding a major vote on a Saturday, Rabbi Davidowitz said, but here, it was hardly surprising that Republican leaders had not considered the Sabbath.
''We're small in number, that's just the fact,'' he said, ''but we are getting bigger and people notice us.''
Indeed, there are signs of a growing population everywhere -- kosher restaurants dot the landscape from just off the Strip to the suburbs. Three new Jewish schools, including one named for Mr. Adelson with a sprawling, luxurious campus, have opened in the past several years. The Venetian Hotel, owned by Mr. Adelson, keeps a set of kosher dishes for special events.
And last year, a group of friends from one of the seven Orthodox synagogues in town formed a Jewish cigar and gun club (the group has yet to have an official outing to the shooting range).
''You get a different kind of person moving here,'' said David Kruger, 70, who moved from West Bloomfield, Mich., nearly seven years ago and boasted that his hometown was the only other place with a Jewish gun club. ''We have an independent streak, and we don't want to be told what to do.''
When word spread last week of the special caucus, some were outraged that it would be held at the school named for Mr. Adelson, who has spent millions of dollars supporting Newt Gingrich's presidential bid. But most of the Orthodox Jews who were interviewed here said they planned to support Mitt Romney because they believed he had a better chance of defeating President Obama.
For the most part, Mr. Kruger and others say, Orthodox Jews here are eager to elect a Republican president. Even if their numbers are small, many see themselves as potentially an important voting bloc in a swing state.
Some criticize Mr. Obama as insufficiently supportive of Israel, but they are even more critical of his efforts to improve the American economy. ''We get people who are pioneers here, they don't need anybody to coddle them -- that means both religiously and politically,'' Mr. Kantor said. ''People who move to a place like this come here because they know they can make it on their own.''
Orthodox Jews have moved to Las Vegas for one of the same reasons as so many others: cheap housing. While a three-bedroom house in many Jewish neighborhoods in larger cities can easily cost about $500,000, a larger home here could easily be found for less than half that -- even before the housing market crashed.
There are no official counts, but most estimates put the number of Orthodox families at 300, a small fraction of the 70,000 Jews in the city. The new arrivals have slowed since the economic downturn. But still, more families come, figuring they will need less money for expenses.
Rabbi Shea Harlig moved to Las Vegas from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in 1990 to open up a Chabad Lubavitch outreach center; at the time, he and his wife were among the first Orthodox Jews in town. Although Chabad emissaries were being sent all over the country, the leader of the group, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, had been reluctant to send a permanent representative to a place not known for holiness.
Even as Rabbi Harlig embraced the task, he opted to name his center Chabad of Southern Nevada, avoiding the Vegas name. (His motto, he likes to say, is ''Taking the sin out of Sin City.'')
Since living here, Rabbi Harlig has fought many religious battles, among them, ensuring that students in public schools could take off for Jewish holidays and that there is kosher food available in the state prisons.
But although he is an active Republican, he was not prepared to fight to change the caucus date to accommodate the Sabbath.
''I figure I have to choose my battles, and this wasn't something that was going to hurt my religious freedom,'' he said. But he was delighted once he heard the party had created a special caucus. He asked a congregant throwing a party at the synagogue Saturday night to push back the start time to 9 p.m., so that people would have time for a civic calling first.
As soon as the sun sets and evening prayers end, he said, he will rush from the synagogue to pick up his wife to drive across town to caucus.

HEADLINE: Tax Break Increases Deficit, but May Have a Silver Lining

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A corporate tax break for buyers of computers, engines and other equipment is proving surprisingly popular, depriving the federal government of tens of billions of dollars in expected revenue and increasing the amount it will need to borrow this year.
The Congressional Budget Office said this week that corporate income tax receipts were $10 billion below its expectations in the fiscal year that ended in September, and that it had reduced the anticipated amount that the government would collect for the current fiscal year by $29 billion. 
The shortfall is a main reason the budget office projects the federal deficit will reach $1.08 trillion this year, $105 billion more than it estimated last August.
But there may be a silver lining. The tax break aims to stimulate investment, and it seems to be working. Corporate spending on equipment has grown faster than any other category of economic activity over the last two years, raising the pace of overall growth. And the government projects it will eventually recoup about 80 percent of the money because companies that benefit now often face higher taxes later.
The surprising results highlight the difficulty that policy makers face in predicting both the costs and the benefits of government policies. Efforts to stimulate the economy have been particularly contentious, with critics arguing that the government has little power to influence businesses, and that the costs would be greater than expected. In this case, it appears that those critics were only half right.
Werner Enterprises, a large trucking and logistics company based in Omaha, said in November that it spent $225 million buying trucks in 2011, almost twice as much as it spent in 2010, to take advantage of the tax break.
Ameren Missouri, a St. Louis utility, said the tax break was a major reason that it increased 2011 capital expenditures by 30 percent, to $1.3 billion, installing equipment ahead of schedule at two power plants.
Other companies, however, said the only result was a smaller tax bill.
Nicholas DeBenedictis, chief executive of Aqua America, a Pennsylvania water utility, described the tax break as ''a gift.'' At an investment conference in December 2010, he said, ''It didn't make us spend one extra dime than we would have spent.''
The tax break is called bonus depreciation. It amounts to a subsidy for equipment purchases. In general, when a company pays a worker, the cost reduces its taxable income. When it buys a computer, however, only a fraction of the cost counts against taxable income in the first year, because the computer is an investment. The company spent money, but in return it got something of value for years to come.
The government suspended this distinction from September 2010 through the end of 2011, allowing companies to count the entire cost of such equipment purchases as an expense that reduced their taxable income. Companies were allowed from 2008 to September 2010 to count 50 percent of purchases as expenses, and that lesser tax break remains in effect now until the end of 2012.
The administration estimated in the fall of 2010 that the expanded tax break would cost the government about $100 billion.
The actual bill will not be certain for some time, until corporations file detailed tax returns. But there is growing evidence that the cost will be higher than expected. The budget office calculates that the government collected a smaller share of corporate profits last year than at any time in the last 40 years -- just 12 percent of the money earned from domestic activities -- in large part because of the tax break.
Receipts increased during the first three months of the current fiscal year, but not nearly as much as the budget office had expected.
The budget office's director, Douglas W. Elmendorf, described the trend as ''a little puzzling'' this week.
The Treasury Department, which prepares its own estimates of tax revenue as part of the administration's annual budget, declined to comment ahead of the forthcoming release of those projections. But a senior administration official said the Treasury also had overestimated corporate income tax payments. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue, said that the administration had concluded that the unexpected popularity of the tax break on corporate investment was the primary reason for the shortfall.
Other factors also may be contributing. Companies lost a lot of money in recent years, and in some cases they can deduct those losses from their taxable income. Domestic financial doldrums also have led companies to expand overseas, so that less of their income is subject to federal income taxes. The budget office maintained its projection that corporate tax receipts would rebound completely by 2014.
But both the Obama administration and House Republicans want to restore the full 100 percent break for the entirety of 2012.
And some experts warn that what began as a bonus is becoming a permanent break. The government has now offered a version of this tax break in seven of the last 10 years: from 2001 through the end of 2004, and again beginning in 2008.

HEADLINE: Activists Fight Green Projects, Seeing U.N. Plot

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN and KATE ZERNIKE; John A. Montgomery contributed reporting from Roanoke, Va.

 BODY:
Across the country, activists with ties to the Tea Party are railing against all sorts of local and state efforts to control sprawl and conserve energy. They brand government action for things like expanding public transportation routes and preserving open space as part of a United Nations-led conspiracy to deny property rights and herd citizens toward cities.
They are showing up at planning meetings to denounce bike lanes on public streets and smart meters on home appliances -- efforts they equate to a big-government blueprint against individual rights.
''Down the road, this data will be used against you,'' warned one speaker at a recent Roanoke County, Va., Board of Supervisors meeting who turned out with dozens of people opposed to the county's paying $1,200 in dues to a nonprofit that consults on sustainability issues. 
Local officials say they would dismiss such notions except that the growing and often heated protests are having an effect.
In Maine, the Tea Party-backed Republican governor canceled a project to ease congestion along the Route 1 corridor after protesters complained it was part of the United Nations plot. Similar opposition helped doom a high-speed train line in Florida. And more than a dozen cities, towns and counties, under new pressure, have cut off financing for a program that offers expertise on how to measure and cut carbon emissions.
''It sounds a little on the weird side, but we've found we ignore it at our own peril,'' said George Homewood, a vice president of the American Planning Association's chapter in Virginia.
The protests date to 1992 when the United Nations passed a sweeping, but nonbinding, 100-plus-page resolution called Agenda 21 that was designed to encourage nations to use fewer resources and conserve open land by steering development to already dense areas. They have gained momentum in the past two years because of the emergence of the Tea Party movement, harnessing its suspicion about government power and belief that man-made global warming is a hoax.
In January, the Republican Party adopted its own resolution against what it called ''the destructive and insidious nature'' of Agenda 21. And Newt Gingrich took aim at it during a Republican debate in November.
Tom DeWeese, the founder of the American Policy Center, a Warrenton, Va.-based foundation that advocates limited government, says he has been a leader in the opposition to Agenda 21 since 1992. Until a few years ago, he had few followers beyond a handful of farmers and ranchers in rural areas. Now, he is a regular speaker at Tea Party events.
Membership is rising, Mr. DeWeese said, because what he sees as tangible Agenda 21-inspired controls on water and energy use are intruding into everyday life. ''People may be acting out at some of these meetings, and I do not condone that. But their elected representatives are not listening and they are frustrated.''
Fox News has also helped spread the message. In June, after President Obama signed an executive order creating a White House Rural Council to ''enhance federal engagement with rural communities,'' Fox programs linked the order to Agenda 21. A Fox commentator, Eric Bolling, said the council sounded ''eerily similar to a U.N. plan called Agenda 21, where a centralized planning agency would be responsible for oversight into all areas of our lives. A one world order.''
The movement has been particularly effective in Tea Party strongholds like Virginia, Florida and Texas, but the police have been called in to contain protests in states including Maryland and California, where opponents are fighting laws passed in recent years to encourage development around public transportation hubs and dense areas in an effort to save money and preserve rural communities.
One group has become a particular target. Iclei -- Local Governments for Sustainability USA, an Oakland, Calif.-based nonprofit, sells software and offers advice to communities looking to reduce their carbon footprints. A City Council meeting in Missoula, Mont., in December got out of hand and required police intervention over $1,200 in dues to Iclei.
At a Board of Supervisors meeting in Roanoke in late January, Cher McCoy, a Tea Party member from nearby Lexington, Va., generated sustained applause when she warned: ''They get you hooked, and then Agenda 21 takes over. Your rights are stripped one by one.''
Echoing other protesters, Ms. McCoy identified smart meters, devices being installed by utility companies to collect information on energy use, as part of the conspiracy. ''The real job of smart meters is to spy on you and control you -- when you can and cannot use electrical appliances,'' she said.
Ilana Preuss, vice president of Smart Growth America, a national coalition of nonprofits that supports economic development while conserving open spaces and farmland, said, ''The real danger is not that they will get rid of some piece of software from Iclei'' but that ''people will be too scared to have a conversation about local development. And that is an important conversation to be having.''
In some cases, the protests have not been large, but they are powerful because officials are concerned about the Tea Party.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Gingrich has called Agenda 21 an important issue and has said, ''I would explicitly repudiate what Obama has done on Agenda 21.''
The Republican National Committee resolution, passed without fanfare on Jan. 13, declared, ''The United Nations Agenda 21 plan of radical so-called 'sustainable development' views the American way of life of private property ownership, single family homes, private car ownership and individual travel choices, and privately owned farms; all as destructive to the environment.''
Other conservatives have welcomed the scrutiny of land-use issues, but they do not agree with the emphasis on Agenda 21.
Jeremy Rabkin, a professor of law at George Mason University specializing in sovereignty issues, said there were ''entirely legitimate concerns about international standards that come into American law without formal ratification by the Senate.''
But some local officials argue that the programs that protesters see as part of the conspiracy are entirely created by local governments with the express intent of saving money -- the central goal of the Tea Party movement.
Planning groups, several of which said they had never heard of Agenda 21 until protesters burst in, are counterorganizing.
Last year, the Board of Supervisors in Albemarle County, Va., ceased payment of dues to Iclei and withdrew its support from a national agreement on climate change in which counties can participate. Summer Frederick, the project manager for the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission in Charlottesville, Va., now conducts seminars on how to deal with Agenda 21 critics. (Among her tips: remove the podium and microphones, which can make it ''very easy for a critic to hijack a meeting.'')
Roanoke's Board of Supervisors voted 3 to 2 to renew its Iclei financing after many residents voiced their support.
''The Tea Party people say they want nonpolluted air and clean water and everything we promote and support, but they also say it's a communist movement,'' said Charlotte Moore, a supervisor who voted yes. ''I really don't understand what they want.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 8, 2012

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about conservative activists who battle efforts to control sprawl and conserve energy misidentified an entity that ceased paying dues to Iclei, a nonprofit organization that offers advice on environmental sustainability, and withdrew from a national program related to dealing with climate change. It was Albemarle County in Virginia -- not the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission in Charlottesville, Va. The article also described the planning commission incorrectly. It involves climate change efforts by counties, not by mayors.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Falls to 8.3%, Altering Face of Campaign

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Jonathan Weisman and Mark Landler contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The burst of job growth in January gives President Obama a fresh -- but tricky -- opportunity to revise the grim economic narrative of his presidency while offering Mitt Romney a choice: embrace a new optimism or campaign against a sinking economy even as it shows signs of turning around.
The Labor Department reported on Friday that the unemployment rate had fallen all the way back to the level of President Obama's first full month in office, to 8.3 percent, from a high of 10 percent in late 2009. Yet unemployment also remains higher than it has been for any presidential election since the Great Depression.
Those dueling realities -- an improving economy that remains very weak -- create serious risks for the top political advisers to President Obama and Mr. Romney as they begin to grapple with the impact of Friday's report. The image of an overly optimistic president could feel discordant and disconnected to voters who are still struggling with unemployment and foreclosures. For Mr. Romney, the improving economy puts at risk his central message as the business executive who can fix a stalled economy. 
Economists were surprised by the strength of the new numbers, which showed a gain of 243,000 jobs last month and larger gains in earlier months than previously reported. Over the last year, the economy has added almost two million jobs for the best 12 months in five years. Stocks surged, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closing only slightly below its high since Mr. Obama took office.
The economy has now been gaining strength for almost six months, according to a broad array of data, offering some reason for hope that the effects of the deep financial crisis are finally starting to fade.
Still, the economy will need several more years of strong job growth to return to anything resembling full health. And although many forecasters are growing more hopeful about this year, several factors -- including Europe's financial troubles and the turmoil in Iran -- could change the situation quickly.
Aides to Mr. Obama said Friday that they remained wary of declaring a full-blown comeback, having trumpeted the beginnings of a recovery in early 2010 only to see it stymied by factors like persistent weakness in housing, reverberations from the BP oil spill and the Greek debt crisis.
In remarks on Friday, Mr. Obama laid out the theme that will be at the center of his re-election campaign, reminding voters how bad an economy he inherited and hailing the recent progress while being careful to add that there was still a long way to go.
''The economy is growing strongly. The recovery is speeding up,'' Mr. Obama said. But he conceded: ''These numbers will go up and down in the coming months.''
Mr. Romney -- the Republican front-runner, whom White House officials view as their likely opponent -- also faces the danger of looking oddly out of step if he presses ahead, as he did on Friday, with his accusation that Mr. Obama had made the recession worse.
''This recovery has been slower than it should have been. People have been suffering for longer than they should have had to suffer,'' Mr. Romney said, at a supply company in Sparks, Nev., before Saturday's caucus in that state. ''Will it get better? I think it'll get better,'' he added. ''But this president has not helped the process. He's hurt it.''
Mr. Romney's aides offered few signals on Friday that he was preparing to abandon his line of attack. Top advisers said that any declaration of economic victory by Mr. Obama would be received poorly in places like Nevada, where unemployment remains above 13 percent.
Mr. Romney has based much of his campaign around attacks on Mr. Obama's economic record and on the promise that, as someone who understands the private sector, Mr. Romney can do better.
When he announced his campaign at a farm in New Hampshire in June, he sounded many of the same overall themes that Bill Clinton did when running against George H. W. Bush in 1991: the president has failed, and somebody else deserves a chance.
Having beaten Newt Gingrich and his other rivals soundly in the Florida primary on Tuesday, Mr. Romney has returned to talking mostly about Mr. Obama.
Senior advisers to Mr. Romney said he would continue to argue that the economy should be far better than it is. Regardless of the economy, the advisers said, Mr. Obama will not be able to run away from criticism about the size of the federal government and the nation's soaring debt.
''Voters remain worried that this slow rate of economic growth could become the new normal with Obama at the helm,'' said Kevin Madden, an adviser to Mr. Romney. ''Also, President Obama's spending policies have racked up record deficits, and his big government regulatory approach has stunted growth in the business sector.''
Mr. Romney may have little choice but to stick with Plan A. Events could still change between now and November, but most Americans continue to hold generally positive views of Mr. Obama personally. The president has also had several big foreign policy successes, including the killing of Osama bin Laden.
White House officials say the president is prepared to counter the attacks from Mr. Romney and Capitol Hill with the evidence of a slow but sustained turnaround that has added nearly as many jobs in the last two years as were lost in the first few months of Mr. Obama's administration.
But aides say they remain wary of global forces outside their control that could stall or even reverse economic gains. So Mr. Obama and his campaign continue to emphasize other issues, like the Republican stance on tax increases for the affluent and his foreign policy record.
The president has also tried to portray himself as an enemy of government waste, having recently sought Congressional permission to pare federal departments.
Since Mr. Obama took office, federal employment has grown, but at a slower rate than the nation's population. Mr. Obama's advisers are also aware that the overall direction of the economy can mask different realities in swing states in the presidential campaign in November. As a whole, swing states appear to have higher unemployment than the rest of the country.
Florida, for example, has an unemployment rate just shy of 10 percent. In Michigan, meanwhile, unemployment has dropped to 9.3 percent from a high of nearly 14 percent early in Mr. Obama's presidency.
But Mr. Obama's aides note that Americans' overall impression about the direction of the economy is beginning to turn around. A New York Times/CBS News survey released in early October found only 12 percent who said the economy was getting better. A similar survey released in mid-January found 28 percent who said the same thing.
Shifts in public opinion on the economy often happen slowly and sometimes out of sync with the political process at the time. In 1984, unemployment remained elevated, but it had fallen enough from its 1982 peak to ensure Ronald Reagan's re-election.
Eight years later, when George H. W. Bush sought a second term, the economic slump of 1990 was starting to turn around. But the public did not feel the impact in time for the election, and Bill Clinton defeated Mr. Bush.
Mr. Romney and his allies on Capitol Hill are betting this year will be more like 1992.
Some Republicans want their party to take a more positive tack and say that the new Republican House majority has helped by holding down spending, passing free trade agreements and fighting to lower the deficit.
''Our problem is our own people cannibalizing their own success because it's not as good as they wanted,'' Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said in an interview this week.
But the more common position for Republicans was to continue their criticism of Mr. Obama's economic policies.
Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Republican Conference, essentially ignored the positive economic news. ''Today is an indication of another failure of this president's policies -- 36 months in a row of 8 percent-plus unemployment,'' he said.
John Boehner, the House speaker, said at a news conference, ''The American people are still asking, 'Where are the jobs?' ''

HEADLINE: Romney, the Rich and the Rest

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
No one should be surprised that the Tin Man has a tin ear.
After all, Mitt Romney is the same multimillionaire who joked that he was ''unemployed'' while he was ''earning'' more in one day than most Americans earn in a year and paying a lower rate on those earnings than most Americans do.
This is the same man who bragged last month that he liked to fire people at a time when nearly 13 million people are out of work and who accepted the endorsement this week of Donald Trump, who has made ''You're Fired!'' his television catchphrase.
This is the same man who in November claimed that federal employees are making ''a lot more money than we are.'' What?! We? What we? Please direct me to the federal employees with the $20 million paychecks. In fact, The Washington Post pointed out in November that federal employees on average ''are underpaid by 26.3 percent when compared with similar nonfederal jobs, a 'pay gap' that increased by about 2 percentage points over the last year while federal salary rates were frozen.'' 
And who could forget his remark that ''corporations are people.'' Classic.
But this week when Romney said that he wasn't concerned about the very poor in this country, he jumped in the pickle barrel and went over the waterfall.
First, his statement:
''I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich. They're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of America -- the 90-95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling.''
Romney went on to say that his campaign was focused on ''middle-income Americans'' and that ''we have a very ample safety net'' for the poor.
He later tried to clarify, saying that his comments needed context. Then he said that the comments were a ''misstatement'' and that he had ''misspoke.'' Yeah, right.
Where to begin?
First, a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities last month pointed out that Romney's budget proposals would take a chainsaw to that safety net. The report points out that cuts proposed by Romney would be even more draconian than a plan from Representative Paul Ryan: ''Governor Romney's budget proposals would require far deeper cuts in nondefense programs than the House-passed budget resolution authored by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan: $94 billion to $219 billion deeper in 2016 and $303 billion to $819 billion deeper in 2021.''
What does this mean for specific programs? Let's take the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, since ''food stamps'' have been such a talking point in the Republican debates. The report says the Romney plan ''would throw 10 million low-income people off the benefit rolls, cut benefits by thousands of dollars a year, or some combination of the two. These cuts would primarily affect very-low-income families with children, seniors and people with disabilities.''
Does that sound like a man trying to ''fix'' our social safety nets? Absolutely not. Romney is so far up the beanstalk that he can no longer see the ground.
Then let's take the fact that a report last month by the Tax Policy Center found that his tax plan would increase after-tax income for millionaires by 14.5 percent while increasing the after-tax income of those making less than $20,000 by less than 1 percent and of those making between $30,000 and $40,000 by less than 3 percent.
For a man who's not worried about the rich, he sure seems to want them to rake in more cash.
This has nothing to do with context. This has everything to do with a caviar candidate's inability to relate to a chicken-soup citizenry.
Then there is the ''ample safety net'' nonsense. No one who has ever been on the low end of the income spectrum believes this, not even Republicans. According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in October, even most Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who make less than $30,000 a year, which accounts for about a quarter of all Republicans, say that the government doesn't do enough to help the poor. Only a man who has never felt the sting of poverty or seen its ravages would say such a thing.
But perhaps the most pernicious part of his statement was the underestimating of the rich and poor and the elasticized expansion of the term ''middle income'' or middle class. Romney suggests that 95 percent of Americans are in this group. Not true.
According to the Census Bureau, the official poverty rate in 2010 was 15.1 percent.
And that's the income poor. It doesn't even count the ''asset poor.'' A report issued this week by the Corporation for Enterprise Development found that 27 percent of U.S. households live in ''asset poverty.'' According to the report, ''These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income.''
On the other hand, the definition of ''rich'' is more nebulous. However, according to a December Gallup report, Americans set the rich threshold at $150,000 in annual income. And according to the U.S. Census Bureau 8.4 percent of households had an income of $150,000 are more in 2010.
So at the very least, nearly a fourth of all Americans are either poor or rich.
That would leave about three-fourths somewhere in the middle, but not all middle class. Tricking the poor to believe they're in it, and allowing the wealthy to hide in it, is one of the great modern political deceptions and how we've arrived at our current predicament.
According to a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last month, nearly a fifth of families making less than $15,000 said that they were middle class and nearly two-fifths of those making more than $100,000 said that they were middle class.
Romney is not only cold and clumsy, he's disastrously out of touch, and when talking about real people, out of sorts. If only he had a heart, and if only that heart was connected to his brain.

HEADLINE: Job Number That Makes The Magic For Obama

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
No economic indicator is a political holy grail. The American economy is a hard thing to measure, and initial estimates of economic performance are subject to significant revisions. Noneconomic matters -- wars, candidates, scandals and so forth -- matter, too.
But if you want to focus on a single economic indicator, job growth during the presidential election year has a lot going for it. The job-growth numbers do at least as well as any other economic number in predicting elections, and slightly better than some other commonly used metrics, like the gross domestic product. 
So the news that the economy added 243,000 jobs last month was very good for President Obama. That pace is well above the minimum level -- about 150,000 jobs -- that he would seem to need to increase his chances of re-election.
Beyond the history, there are a lot of common-sense reasons to focus on the jobs numbers. They measure something tangible and important. They receive much attention from economists, investors, political campaigns and the news media, and therefore inform the public discussion. They are released every month after only a minimal lag. They are not subject to as much revision as some other economic numbers.
These qualitative factors are important because a sample size of 16 elections since World War II is insufficient for persuasive statistical evidence. But the statistical patterns are still striking.
In the three election years where the economy was actually shedding jobs, the incumbent party lost -- badly in 1980 and in 2008, and in a close election in 1960. George H. W. Bush lost in 1992 when the rate of job growth was under 1 percent, below the rate of population growth.
On the flip side, in the election years when job growth was strongest -- 1956, 1964, 1972, 1984, 1988 and 1996 -- the incumbent party won the election fairly easily.
And in the three years in which growth was positive but modest -- 1948, 2000 and 2004 -- the races were close. A bit of common sense can explain these outliers. (Be wary of statistical analysis that substitutes data dredging for common sense.)
What about Mr. Obama?
If Mitt Romney is the Republican nominee, the outcome does not seem likely to be an outlier. Mr. Romney is, by most measures, a fairly average challenger -- neither a bridge-building moderate like Eisenhower, nor someone far outside of the political mainstream like George McGovern.
Meanwhile, for now, Mr. Obama has no major scandals or foreign policy debacles.
An analysis based solely on the historical patterns would suggest that Mr. Obama would be the favorite if the economy created at least 107,000 jobs a month until the election. Basically, this would represent job creation at about the rate of population growth.
But Mr. Obama is not likely to get off quite so easily. Job creation was extremely poor during his first two years in office, and mediocre during the third year, which has weighed on his approval ratings. Slightly less than 50 percent of Americans approve of his performance, polls show.
That isn't terrible -- it's in the range where Mr. Obama might be able to eke out a victory in the Electoral College -- but it's somewhat below average.
From 1948 through 2008, the average president had an approval rating of 52 percent on Feb. 1 of the election year, according to the Roper Center archives. If Mr. Obama has an approval rating of 52 percent by November, he will almost certainly win re-election. He will also be a favorite if he is at 50 percent, because some portions of voters do not express an opinion in such polls.
The surest way for Mr. Obama to improve his approval rating will be to create jobs at a rate that exceeds the rate of population growth. Taking into account population size and his approval rating, an analysis by The Times's FiveThirtyEight blog produces a break-even number of 151,000 jobs a month.
If we knew nothing else about the election but how many jobs were created from January to October 2012, we would deem Mr. Obama to be a favorite if the economy created more than 151,000 jobs a month and an underdog otherwise.
This is, in my view, a highly intuitive figure. When the payrolls number has come in below 150,000 jobs, economists tend to view it as bad news. A report above 150,000 jobs they regard as a hopeful sign, on balance. What's more, current forecasts of job growth are close to that 150,000 jobs figure.
I do not mean to suggest that the jobs numbers are the only thing that will matter. If job growth averages 175,000 a month, Mr. Obama will probably be a favorite, but not a prohibitive one. If it averages 125,000 a month, he will be a modest underdog.
Still, the current forecast for labor growth points toward an extremely close election -- one in which every fluctuation above or below that 150,000 threshold could matter.

HEADLINE: Gingrich's Ties to Mortgage Giants Go Back to His Time in Congress

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU; Jack Styczynski contributed research.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On a trip to Ireland in 1998, Speaker Newt Gingrich researched his Irish roots, discussed the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland and entertained speculation about his presidential ambitions. He even donned work gloves and blue jeans to help build a home in Belfast for a good-will project.
Two of the sponsors for part of the Ireland trip were frequent partners of Mr. Gingrich: Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae -- the government-backed housing industry giants that Mr. Gingrich has denounced as he fights to stay in contention against Mitt Romney in the Republican primaries.
Mr. Gingrich has faced many questions recently about the more than $1.6 million in consulting fees he got from Freddie Mac since leaving Congress in 1999. But part of the relationship started years earlier, as records and interviews show that Mr. Gingrich, as House leader in the 1990s, aligned himself with Freddie and Fannie on a number of key issues -- defending them in Congress against political attacks, joining with them on housing projects and seeing top aides go work for them. 
While Mr. Gingrich has minimized his past connections to the two closely related companies on the campaign trail, his Congressional record shows that his political and financial ties to the firms run deeper and farther back than he has acknowledged publicly and, in fact, set the stage for the lucrative consulting work that followed.
Mr. Gingrich, whose campaign declined to comment on his ties with Fannie and Freddie while in Congress, has been blistering in his recent criticism of the mortgage finance companies. He has blamed them in part for the 2008 housing collapse, said they should now be ''broken up,'' and in an October debate he declared that Representative Barney Frank should be ''in jail'' for associating with lobbyists close to Freddie.
But while in Congress, Mr. Gingrich had kind words for the companies. Announcing a housing partnership in Atlanta in 1995, for instance, he held up Fannie as ''an excellent example of a former government institution fulfilling its mandate while functioning in the market economy.''
He was far from Fannie and Freddie's only Congressional supporter in those years; before the stain of the 2008 housing collapse, the companies' allies were legion.
But Mr. Gingrich's help was seen as particularly crucial after the Republicans took control of the House in 1994, as Freddie and Fannie tried to turn back rising hostility from some Republicans over their mission, structure and financing.
Once he became speaker in 1995, Mr. Gingrich's support loomed large as the companies sought to shore up flagging confidence among the Republicans and bolster the case for home ownership, officials said.
''Whenever you could get Republicans who supported you, it was important, and the more prominent the Republican, the better,'' said William Maloni, a senior vice president at Fannie Mae until 2004. ''Newt would have been important.''
Mr. Gingrich's senior advisers were important as well, with a handful of his aides and confidants going on to work for Freddie and Fannie or for lobbying groups that represented them. Of particular significance, several officials said, was Fannie's hiring of Arne L. Christenson, Mr. Gingrich's chief of staff, as a top executive and lobbyist in 1999.
''From their perspective, hiring someone who could beef up their Republican credentials made perfect sense,'' said Jack Howard, policy director for Mr. Gingrich at the time. Mr. Christenson did not return a call seeking comment.
In a showdown critical to the companies' fortunes, Mr. Gingrich played an important behind-the-scenes role in helping block a proposal in 1995 that would have forced Fannie and Freddie -- rather than taxpayers -- to pay potentially billions of dollars in increased fees, according to interviews and press accounts at the time.
At the time, Representative Jim Leach, a senior Republican from Iowa who led the House banking committee and was a fierce critic of Fannie and Freddie, wanted the companies to pay the bulk of about $4.8 billion to finance a reserve for ailing savings and loan institutions.
Through their lobbyists, Freddie and Fannie fought hard against the plan, and Mr. Gingrich made his opposition to it clear in a meeting with Mr. Leach on Capitol Hill. By the time the two men emerged, the proposal was dead.
''Newt was quite a pragmatist,'' said a Republican official who was involved in the fee increase debate and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid becoming embroiled in the current Republican race. In coming to the defense of Freddie and Fannie, Mr. Gingrich ''was going with the consensus of his party -- of both parties, really,'' the official said.
A separate attempt within the House budget committee in 1995 to raise fees on Freddie and Fannie by hundreds of millions of dollars also died without a vote after Mr. Gingrich rejected it. The speaker asserted that raising fees would violate the Republicans' oft-cited no new tax pledge.
Fannie and Freddie each declined to comment on the companies' relationships with Mr. Gingrich in the 1990s.
Beyond his role in thwarting legislative threats, Mr. Gingrich also worked with Fannie and Freddie on a number of housing projects in the United States and overseas.
The visit to a Belfast neighborhood in 1998 to start building a home for a low-income family was part of a foreign extension of an American program called ''The House that Congress Built.''
The Belfast project was sponsored principally by Fannie and Freddie, along with Habitat for Humanity and the National Association of Realtors. The Realtors' association called the housing project ''a truly unique partnership'' between lawmakers and the housing industry.
Marianne Gingrich, Mr. Gingrich's wife at the time, joined him in Ireland, as did other members of Congress. Public money was apparently used for portions of the trip, considered Congressional business, but the breakdown on the financing, and what part was covered by Fannie and Freddie, could not be determined. Congressional records indicate that Mr. Gingrich did not file a financial disclosure statement for 1998 that would show gifts and trips provided by outside groups that year, although House rules appear to require him to have filed a report within 30 days after he left Congress under an ethics cloud in January 1999.
The Gingrich campaign said he was invited on the trip by Habitat for Humanity. ''Improving access to home ownership has long been an aim of his public policy,'' the campaign said.
Mr. Howard, the former Gingrich aide, said he associated the housing projects more with Habitat for Humanity, a nonpartisan Christian group headquartered in Mr. Gingrich's home state of Georgia, than with the corporate sponsors Fannie and Freddie.
''It was a feel-good thing,'' he said of the projects. ''I think Newt probably saw this as just a good opportunity to do something for Habitat for Humanity.''
In general, Mr. Howard said, issues connected to Fannie and Freddie -- whether legislative, political or civic -- ''were not a priority'' for Mr. Gingrich during his time as speaker. ''I don't remember him being directly involved at all,'' he said.
But months after Mr. Gingrich left Congress, his direct involvement became clear, as his consulting company signed a $25,000-a-month contract with Freddie. In 2006, he signed a second contract with Freddie as a strategic adviser, a role he described initially as a ''historian.'' Mr. Romney has branded the work as ''influence peddler.''
Defending the contracts, Mr. Gingrich has contrasted the work he did for Freddie as a consultant with the work he did in Congress, when he said he was aligned with those seeking industrywide changes in housing policies.
''There's a huge difference between what you do when you're in public office and you're dealing with the public trust,'' he said on Fox News, ''and what you do as a private business person who has no direct power and no direct responsibility and you're sitting there offering advice.''
Some of Mr. Gingrich's defenses have fallen flat, however, as when he attacked Mr. Romney in a debate last month for holding mutual fund investments in Freddie and Fannie.
''Have you checked your own investments?'' Mr. Romney retorted, pointing out that Mr. Gingrich also held investments in them through mutual funds.
''All right,'' Mr. Gingrich responded, falling silent.

HEADLINE: Trading Threats With Iran

 BODY:
The posturing and saber rattling from both Iran and Israel are getting frightening.
Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz after the European Union and the United States tightened sanctions. On Friday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said his country will assist any nation or group that ''confronts'' Israel, describing it as a ''cancer.'' He vowed to retaliate -- especially against the United States -- for tough new oil sanctions and Western military threats. 
On Thursday, Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, told a security forum that time is running out for halting Iran's nuclear advance. ''Whoever says 'later' may find that later is too late,'' he said. Moshe Yaalon, a deputy prime minister, warned that Iran was developing a missile with a range of about 6,000 miles that could hit the United States.
There should be no illusions. Iran's nuclear ambitions are real and dangerous. But there is no proof that it has made the decision to move from producing fuel to building a bomb. American officials say that reports of a missile with a 6,000-mile range are premature and wildly exaggerated.
The costs of an Israeli military strike -- with or without American support -- would be huge. It would likely only set Iran's nuclear program back for a few years. It would unite Iranians around their government at a time when it is fast losing popular support. It would also shatter the international coalition for sanctions and direct more anger against Israel and the United States.
President Obama has spent three years rallying the toughest sanctions ever on Iran -- including a European Union oil embargo. Tehran is increasingly isolated; its economy is reeling. The administration was right to warn Iran against any attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz. We hope it is also looking to privately persuade Iran of the need for a negotiated solution.
American officials say they have counseled Israel on the need for patience and warned that a military attack could backfire. They need to keep pressing on both fronts.
Washington still believes there is ''time and space'' for sanctions to work. But there is a frightening scenario going around Washington and several European capitals that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel may attack Iran before the summer -- believing that President Obama will not try to stop him in the middle of a re-election campaign.
Israel must defend itself. This country's alliance with Israel is crucial. We hope for everyone's sake that Israel's leaders weigh all of the consequences before they act. A military attack would almost certainly make things worse. Tough sanctions and a united diplomatic front are the best chance for crippling Iran's nuclear program.

HEADLINE: Campaign Memo: Secret Service Comes, Access Goes

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
10:21 a.m. Updated LAS VEGAS - Most campaigns have a handful of pivotal moments - Barack Obama's race speech in 2008, John McCain's choice of running mate - but the appearance of a team of dark-suited, ramrod straight, hyperprofessional-looking Secret Service agents is an undeniable sign of success. For Mitt Romney, that happened on Thursday, and though it is still early, his campaign will need to manage the potential ramifications carefully.
The most important side effect will be on Mr. Romney's interaction with supporters, whose access to the candidate at events is likely to diminish now that agents have been assigned to protect him. 
Reid Cherlin, who is covering the Republican primaries for GQ magazine and worked on President Obama's first campaign and in his White House, said that having a Secret Service detail ''complicates things'' for everyone involved.
''Especially in retail-focused states, all of a sudden roads are closed, there are traffic jams, people can't get close to the candidate, the local press feels mishandled,'' he said. ''So there you are cruising down a two-lane blacktop in a tiny town at 80 miles per hour in these black S.U.V.'s. It can be a fun spectacle in a bigger city, but in tiny towns where people want to meet the candidate, it can be a problem.''
''It can create sort of a P.R. challenge,'' he added.
Grandmothers who simply want their books signed might be accidentally jostled, and local donors cannot always be taken backstage to meet the candidate. People will have to be screened - often passing through a metal detector - to enter campaign events, creating yet another layer of hassle and frustration for potential supporters along with enhanced safety and isolation for the candidate. (Being glitter-bombed - protesters showered Mr. Romney with cans full of glitter as he took the stage in Minnesota on Wednesday - might not have happened with the Secret Service on the job.)
The press feels the agents' presence as well. In the summer, when Mr. Romney's campaign was still fresh, it was possible to walk up to him and tap him on the shoulder. As the crowds grew, reporters were pushed farther back, but were still close enough to hear Mr. Romney's interactions with voters.
For a politician like Mr. Romney, who is remarkably disciplined in public, those moments on the rope line offered brief glimpses into the impromptu and unscripted candidate. It was there that we learned about his penchant for guessing voters' ages and heritage - often incorrectly - and where a reporter spotted Mr. Romney handing a wad of cash to a woman who said she was unemployed. All of those moments will become more difficult to see and hear as the security buffer around him expands.
A spokesman for the Secret Service, which started protecting presidential candidates in 1968, stressed that the agents work to balance security and openness as much as possible.
''We understand that protectees of ours want to get out and meet people,'' said Ed Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service. ''I think at this point we understand fully what candidates' expectations are, and we try to meet candidates' expectations in as safe a way as possible.''
No one knows yet what Mr. Romney's Secret Service code name is, but a few weeks ago over a long dinner, his traveling press corps came up with their own suggestions. The Secret Service's custom is to choose a letter and then assign the candidate and each family member a name starting with that letter. For Mr. Romney, the reporters went with ''S.''
Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, who is known as the ''Mitt-stabilizer'' for her abilities to calm her husband, was ''Serenity.'' His oldest son, Tagg, was ''Scion.'' Ben, his doctor son, was ''Scalpel.''
And Mr. Romney himself was named in homage to his campaign theme song, Kid Rock's ''Born Free,'' which includes the verse, ''Wild, like an untamed stallion.'' Mr. Romney, at least to his traveling press corps, will always be ''Stallion.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Republican Candidates Wrangle Over Nevada

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and ASHLEY PARKER; Trip Gabriel reported from Las Vegas, and Ashley Parker from Sparks, Nev.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Images speak loudly in politics, and a day before the Nevada caucuses, Mitt Romney, accompanied by his new Secret Service detail, seemed to be auditioning for the White House, aiming all his criticism at its current occupant.
Newt Gingrich, meanwhile, continued to cast himself as the insurgent spoiler, holding a rally Friday in a cowboy bar with a mechanical bull, as he blazed away from all angles at Mr. Romney, the perceived Republican front-runner. 
The momentum Mr. Romney picked up after his resounding victory in the Florida primary shows no signs of waning through the many contests this month in Western states, where Mr. Romney finished strongly in 2008. Many states, like Nevada, have significant Mormon populations and conservative voters, especially in Arizona, who like his hawkish views on illegal immigration.
With polls showing a double-digit lead over Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Romney confidently met with business leaders in northern Nevada. He never mentioned his rival, turning his focus to President Obama. ''If I become president of the United States, I commit to be a friend of working people and employers and entrepreneurs and innovators,'' he said.
He greeted the big economic story of the day -- that unemployment had fallen to 8.3 percent, a three-year low -- as ''good news,'' but he did not let up on Mr. Obama. ''I know the president didn't cause this downturn, this recession,'' he said, ''but he didn't make it better either. He made it worse.''
It was a dubious statement, because the unemployment rate fell to precisely what it was during Mr. Obama's first full month in office, February 2009, and nonideological economists agree that the stimulus actions taken by the administration and the Federal Reserve kept the recession from being worse.
Mr. Romney did not return to a remark earlier in the week that he was ''not concerned about the very poor'' because they would be helped by a safety net of government programs. He had already walked back the phrase, saying that he ''misspoke.'' But Mr. Gingrich -- hoping for a second-place finish in the caucuses to pick up delegates to the Republican convention, a result by no means assured given the superior organizing effort of Representative Ron Paul of Texas -- was not done with the ''very poor'' issue.
He equated Mr. Romney's attitude with the worldview of Mr. Obama, contrasting it with his own ''genuine conservative'' position, namely that what the poor really need from government are pro-growth, pro-job policies.
''We think it is the left which has abandoned and betrayed the poor, because its safety net is actually a spider web, and it traps people in dependency,'' Mr. Gingrich said during a rally at Stoney's Rockin' Country bar in Las Vegas. ''My goal is the exact opposite of Governor Romney's. My goal is to turn the safety net into a trampoline to allow the poor to rise and be like the rest of us.''
Mr. Gingrich updated one of his signature attacks on Mr. Obama -- that he is a ''food-stamp president'' -- to include Mr. Romney. The president, he said, is ''big food stamp'' and Mr. Romney is ''little food stamp.''
And he added to the theme that Mr. Romney is a moderate, closer to the president than what the conservative base of the Republican Party wants. He described a new video his campaign released on Friday that uses recent comments by George Soros that ''there isn't all that much difference'' between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney.
Mention of Mr. Soros, a billionaire whose support of liberal causes has made him a caricature villain in conservative circles, elicited boos and catcalls from the crowd of about 200. That delighted Mr. Gingrich, who offered, ''See, at least you have an idea who George Soros is.''
The new video, he said, compared how close Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama were on health care, which he labeled ''Obamneycare,'' a phrased coined by the former presidential hopeful Tim Pawlenty.
''It isn't good enough for the Republican Party to nominate Obama Light,'' Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Gingrich's supporters were enthusiastic, but the big question for him in Nevada, as well as in the other caucus states of Colorado, Maine, Minnesota and Wyoming, will be how many voters will actually turn out, given that his organizing is minimal and pulled together on the fly.
In Colorado, which holds a nonbinding caucus Tuesday, a recently appointed state spokesman for the Gingrich effort, Tom Lucero, did not know if the campaign was running any advertisements on television or radio.
Mr. Romney managed to fit in a stop in Minnesota on Wednesday, and on Saturday, he was scheduled to visit Colorado before returning to Nevada.
But Mr. Romney's campaign, which prides itself on self-discipline, allowed a little internal tension to spill over after Politico reported that Brett O'Donnell, Mr. Romney's well-regarded debate coach, had left the campaign. His growing public profile, Politico reported, had made some Romney campaign aides uneasy.
Mr. O'Donnell did not return calls or e-mails, and the campaign neither confirmed nor denied Politico's account. ''Brett was helpful in the lead-up to the last two debates,'' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a top Romney adviser. ''We'd be open to working with him again down the line.''

Final Fantasy XIII-2 has been released in North America this week by Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This latest edition of the role-playing game series seems to be an overreaction to criticisms of its predecessor, writes Seth Schiesel. Page C1

HEADLINE: From Success at Putin's Side to Exposing Corruption

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
SERGEI KOLESNIKOV is a soft-spoken biophysicist who once thought he would spend his career toiling in placid obscurity inside a secret Soviet military institute.
Then, as Communist rule collapsed, he became a prosperous businessman and part of the crony capitalist web surrounding Vladimir V. Putin, by his own account working with some success to rebuild Russia's primitive health care system.
But today he is a whistle-blower on the run, working to expose what he believes to be the defining corruption of the Putin era.
It is a risky personal campaign that Mr. Kolesnikov began 13 months ago with a splash, publishing an open letter to President Dmitri A. Medvedev that revealed a billion-dollar palace on the Black Sea that he said he had helped build secretly for Mr. Putin. 
Mr. Putin's aides denied that he had anything to do with the palace and the sprawling estate that surrounds it, whose owner of record was a company run by an old friend of the Russian leader.
But questions keep arising: a Russian version of WikiLeaks posted eye-popping photographs that rocketed around the Web; Russian activists and journalists who tried to visit the site said they were stopped and questioned by the Russian equivalent of the Secret Service; and Novaya Gazeta, the Russian newspaper most critical of Mr. Putin, reported that it had obtained a 2005 contract proving that the Russian president's office was involved in the construction. Last March, Russian news reports said the palace had been sold to another friend of Mr. Putin for $350 million.
By then, Mr. Kolesnikov had fled Russia, eventually settling in Estonia and providing journalists with documents that appear to support his account of his role in a network of businesses with purported Putin connections. He has also kept a wary eye out for agents of a government he believes would like to see him silenced.
''For me, I think it's dangerous everywhere,'' Mr. Kolesnikov, who wears rimless glasses and looks much younger than his 63 years, said in an interview in a Manhattan coffee shop last month during a brief visit to the United States. ''But, you know, if you could show the whole truth to the whole country, about this palace and all these machinations, Putin would be gone in two weeks.''
The sudden ferment in Russian politics, with two big anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in December and another set for Saturday, has given Mr. Kolesnikov's crusade a less quixotic feel. He said Russia was responding to the same combustible combination of Internet and video-armed smartphones that propelled the revolts of the Arab Spring.
''Today, it's impossible to hide anything,'' he said. ''It's getting harder and harder for politicians to lie.''
HE is scathing about the hurried political concessions offered up since December by Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Putin, currently the prime minister, who is running for a third presidential term in elections set for March 4.
''People think he's entering negotiations. No way. He has Qaddafi's mentality,'' Mr. Kolesnikov said, adding that he would cling to power with the tenacity of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the late Libyan leader.
Mr. Kolesnikov's family history and resume might have been invented by a novelist trying to reflect the distinctive periods of Russia's tumultuous recent history. His father was a military man who fought in World War II; his mother, still living, is a physician who as a teenager survived the brutal siege of Leningrad.
He earned a doctorate in biophysics in the early 1970s and spent more than 15 years conducting military research in Leningrad on ''biological defenses'' against cutting-edge weapons like lasers. He liked the work, which paid well by Soviet standards.
''There were good points to the Soviet system,'' Mr. Kolesnikov said. ''There was not such a huge gap between the top and the bottom. People didn't obsess about money. The state controlled too much, but many people could pursue their creative work.''
He married and had a son, who trained in physics and now runs an information technology business. His first wife died of cancer, a loss he described as ''the greatest tragedy of my life.'' He has since remarried.
In 1989, after private ventures were legalized under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika, Mr. Kolesnikov started a medical equipment business. His partner was a bureaucrat in Leningrad's health department who also was a K.G.B. officer and an acquaintance of Mr. Putin, himself a career K.G.B. man.
In 1991, the year Leningrad reverted to its old name, St. Petersburg, Mr. Kolesnikov said Mr. Putin, then a city official, invited him and his business partner to create a joint venture with the city to import and build medical equipment and renovate decaying hospitals. The firm was called Petromed, and it thrived.
When Mr. Putin was elected president in 2000, Mr. Kolesnikov was enthralled.
''He was young and smart, and immediately began to bring order,'' he said. ''Everyone was tired of drunken Yeltsin. Everyone was tired of oligarchs who were really thieves.''
A close associate of Mr. Putin proposed a curious but ambitious national role for the medical equipment company. Oligarchs supporting the government would be asked to donate large sums that the company would use to renovate and equip hospitals, with 35 percent of profits diverted to other investments across Russia, including a lumber company and a shipyard.
THE project was started with a $203 million contribution from Roman Abramovich, one of Russia's richest men, said Mr. Kolesnikov, who backed his story with a number of contract documents that appeared to be authentic.
He said some of the money went, mainly as loans, to companies operated by Mr. Putin's relatives or friends. ''I understood very well that Putin was helping his friends,'' he said. ''But I felt we were doing good work. We were investing in Russia.''
Mr. Kolesnikov said he met with Mr. Putin more than a dozen times, but usually dealt with aides. Over time, he said, the tone changed. The aides began to refer to their boss as ''the czar'' and directed money to the Black Sea villa, known as ''Project South.''
Costs ballooned to $500 million while he was involved, Mr. Kolesnikov said; with a new road, electric and natural gas service, and security installations, he said he believed that the price probably reached $1 billion.
When the global recession hit in 2008, and money ran short, Mr. Kolesnikov said Mr. Putin's associates ordered him to cut off all other projects and spend all available cash on the palace. Then he learned that costly construction materials were illegally bypassing customs. He protested, wrote his open letter and left the country.
Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin's spokesman, dismissed Mr. Kolesnikov's account, saying that to the best of his knowledge, Mr. Kolesnikov had fled Russia because he was in a conflict with his business partners over money that had been stolen from the company. In an interview this week, Mr. Peskov called the allegation about the palace ''absurd,'' and only one of many rumors that ascribe extraordinary riches to Mr. Putin.
''Have you heard about the fact that Putin owns 5 percent of Gazprom, that he owns half of the company called Gunvor, and that his personal wealth is more than $30 billion?'' Mr. Peskov said, laughing. He did not rule out that the building could have been built for the Kremlin.
''Look, we have congress halls built for the Kremlin, we have different sites for international events, for congresses, international negotiations, but if you call each of them 'Putin's palace,' it's absurd; it's nothing but absurd,'' Mr. Peskov said.
Mr. Kolesnikov says he wants to return to Russia as soon as he judges it safe -- presumably in a post-Putin era. And he all but rules out a political role for himself in Russia.
''I'm already pretty old,'' he said. ''There have to be new, young political leaders. Our job is to help them.''

HEADLINE: Reining In College Tuition

 BODY:
Higher education institutions are predictably cool to President Obama's proposal to shift federal aid away from colleges that fail to control rising tuition. Even though the details of his plan, which would require Congressional approval, will not be fleshed out until later this month, the idea behind it is sound. 
The federal government must do more to rein in tuition costs at the public colleges that educate more than 70 percent of the nation's students. By one estimate, the cost of four-year public college tuition has tripled since the 1980s, outpacing both inflation and family income. The increase in the tuition burden is largely caused by declining state support for higher education in the past three decades. In both good times and bad, state governments have pushed more of the costs onto students, forcing many to take out big loans or be priced out of once affordable public colleges at a time when a college education is critical in the new economy.
While financial aid is available to some low-income students, many are driven away by tuition sticker shock. At the same time, many colleges have failed to find more cost-effective ways to deliver education and get the average student to graduation in four years. President Obama was on the mark when he said that this needs to change.
A smart analysis by State Higher Education Executive Officers, a nonprofit group, shows clearly what has happened in public higher education since 1985. In Michigan, for example, the net tuition paid per student (after financial aid) rose from about $3,900 in 1985 to nearly $9,000 in 2010, in inflation adjusted dollars. A similar jump occurred in Pennsylvania, where net tuition per student has gone from about $4,500 in 1985 to more than $8,800 in 2010. In response, students have turned to loans. In the last decade, federal college loan debt has more than doubled from $41 billion to $103 billion, according to the College Board.
President Obama's proposed reform plan would require colleges that receive federal aid to create ''a scoreboard'' that gives actual costs, graduation rates and potential earnings for graduates. His idea for establishing a $1 billion fund to provide grants to states that improve graduation rates and reduce costs is a good one. He also calls for expanding campus-based aid -- mainly loans and work-study programs -- to more than $10 billion from the current $2.7 billion. And, for the first time, the government would punish colleges that failed to control tuition or that did not provide good value by shifting money to other schools that do a better job.
Determining what amounts to good value will be difficult, and persuading Congress to move forward on any of these ideas will be hard. But Mr. Obama is right that the federal government should begin leveraging its sizable investment in higher education for reform. He has set the stage for a long overdue discussion about what ails higher education and what might be done about it.
Correction: February 4, 2012, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this editorial misstated the increase in federal student loan debt. It more than doubled in the past decade from $41 billion to $103 billion, not from $41 million to $103 million.

HEADLINE: The One Percent Versus the Twenty Percent

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Follow the actual policy agenda. 

 BODY:
The good folks at EPI are upset by my colleague David Brooks's claims that the gap between the top 20 and the bottom 30, not the gap between the top 1 and everyone else, is what really matters.
As you might guess, I'm with Larry Mishel on this; but I thought it might be useful to have a calm discussion of what someone might mean by saying that the rise of the top 1 percent isn't important.
One thing such a person might mean is that it's unimportant in quantitative, dollars and cents terms. But this is just false. The CBO inequality report confirms what independent studies have been saying: the rise of the top 1 percent has absorbed a large fraction (almost half, by my reckoning), of economic growth, leaving a much smaller pie for everyone else. If we look at Gini indexes, a measure of overall inequality, CBO has calculated them both with and without the top 1 percent:
This says that inequality has risen about 0.11 overall, but only 0.06 if you exclude the top 1 percent; so by this admittedly imperfect measure, again around 45 percent of the story is about the rise of the top 1.
Now, David doesn't focus on any of these things; instead, he talks about the "social gap." I think we could argue about that; children of both the middle class and the elite may be borne in wedlock, but there are other ways in which the elite, more and more, lives in a different universe. The main point I'd make, however, is that social mores are not on the policy agenda; taxes and spending are.
And if you ask how the parties differ -- how the GOP agenda differs from the Democratic agenda -- it's all about the top 1 percent versus everyone else. The GOP wants to cut taxes on capital gains and the top tax bracket, issues that mean nothing even to Americans at the 95th percentile. It wants to privatize Medicare, which would create a lot of insecurity even among upper-middle class families, but wouldn't trouble the truly wealthy.
Put it this way: the actual policy agenda of American conservatives serves the interests of Mitt Romney, not the Bobos.Maybe you think they should have a different agenda, but the fact is that they don't.
And I guess I'd say that the attempts to shout down discussion of the 1 percent are in large part an attempt to distract our attention from that fact.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P. Landscape in Nevada

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Don't be fooled by the deserts and mountains, when it comes to elections, Nevada is an urbanized state. 

 BODY:
The Republican nominating train is in new terrain: the West. Saturday's caucus in Nevada will unfold against mountains and deserts, a far different backdrop from the first four states. 
But do not be fooled by the scenery. Where elections are concerned, Nevada is an urbanized state. Most Nevadans live in cities, and that holds true for Republicans and for Republican caucusgoers. In the state's 2008 Republican caucus, exit polls found just over half of voters were from urban communities, and another quarter was from the suburbs.
Where the Voters Are
Most Nevadans live in and around the state's two largest cities, Las Vegas and Reno. Sixty-two percent of the state's registered Republicans live in Clark County, home to Las Vegas. These are establishment Republicans, many are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
A fifth of the state's Republicans live in Washoe County, mostly near Reno. Washoe County is a swing area in general elections and is often described as fertile ground for retail, New Hampshire-style politicking. This contrasts with the Las Vegas area, where expensive ad buys are a must.
After Clark County and Washoe County there is a precipitous drop: no other county contains more than 4 percent of the state's Republicans. The rest of the state is sparsely populated and mostly rural. 
Rural voters in Nevada have unique concerns, like the federal government's management of local land (take for example the controversy over nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain). 
In fact, many of the issues unique to Nevada revolve around what residents see as a meddling Washington bureaucracy. Nevadans, particularly in the rural areas, are steeped in individualism, limited government and low taxes (Nevada has no personal income tax).
The candidates have been spending most of their time in Las Vegas and Reno, but Elko, Nev., in the Northeast, has seen visits by Mitt Romney and Ron Paul. The Elko area is a conservative enclave and a good sample of what Nevada is like outside its two big cities. Nevada is the country's largest gold producer, and the area around Elko is dotted with gold and other mineral mines. 
Who the Voters Are
Mining has been one of the only areas of the state's economy not to be completely ravaged by the economic downturn. Nevada consistently posts among the worst unemployment and foreclosure rates in the county, and the state's construction industry imploded with the housing market. In 2008, 37 percent of Republican caucusgoers said the economy was the most important issue. That number will most likely be higher this go around.
The dire economy may help explain the fractured support of Nevada's Tea Party, which has been one of the more active Tea Party groups in the country, but cannot seem to agree on a standard-bearer in the presidential campaign. Rick Santorum won the endorsement of Sharron Angle, a senatorial candidate backed by the Tea Party, but it might be too little too late. A poll commissioned by the Las Vegas Review-Journal found Tea Party support was split, with 37 percent going to Newt Gingrich, 27 percent to Mr. Romney and 20 to Mr. Santorum. 
Another important voting bloc, as has been widely noted, are Mormons. Twenty-six percent of 2008 Republican caucusgoers were Mormon, and Mr. Romney won 95 percent of their votes. Mr. Paul, however, has been trying to make inroads into that support. His focus on the Constitution is a natural fit for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which considers the document to be divinely inspired. And Mormonism has a history of conflict with the federal government.
In 2008, there was also a substantial share of caucusgoers - 8 percent - who were Hispanic. While a majority of Florida's Hispanics are of Cuban descent, Nevada's Hispanics are mostly of Mexican origin. Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Paul have reportedly courted this group's support more than Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum. 
All in all, Nevada is a unique state, but it will still offer a decent preview how other Western states, like Arizona and Colorado, may vote in their caucuses and primaries.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: More Jobs, More Risks

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at the president's weekly address. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
January's job growth numbers may help to transform the economic narrative of Barack Obama's presidency, but it provides political risks for both him and his competitor Mitt Romney, Michael D. Shear writes. The image of an overly optimistic president could seem disconnected to voters who are still unemployed, but it also threatens Mr. Romney's central message as the business executive who can fix a stalled economy.

        
Newt Gingrich has tried to minimize his connections to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae on the campaign trail, but as House speaker in the 1990s his support loomed large for the mortgage and finance companies, Eric Lichtblau reports. Records and interviews reveal an untold part of the relationship, with Mr. Gingrich aligning himself with Freddie and Fannie on a number of key issues as House leader - defending them against political attacks, joining them on housing projects and seeing top aides go work for them.

        
Orthodox Jews in Las Vegas will be able to vote during a special caucus Saturday night, hours after the others end, to accommodate Sabbath observers, Jennifer Medina writes. Although Jews make up just 3 percent of Nevada's population, many see themselves as a potentially important voting bloc in a swing state.

        
The most important side effect of Mitt Romney's new Secret Service detail will be on his interaction with supporters, whose access to the candidate at events is likely to diminish now that agents have been assigned to protect him, Ashley Parker writes.
Weekly Address

        
In his weekly address, President Obama named the housing crisis as "the single biggest drag" on the nation's recovery from the recession, blaming it on a country-wide diversion from American values like fairness and responsibility. "Lenders sold loans to families who couldn't afford them," he said. "And left millions of families who did everything right in a world of hurt." He admits that his first legislative solution aimed at helping struggling homeowners was not a success, "but that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep trying," he said. "That's why I'm sending Congress a plan that will give every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgages by refinancing at historically low rates." The plan is narrowly aimed at helping those who make their monthly payments, but couldn't refinance because their home values kept dropping or they got swaddled in red tape. The plan offers no help for those who bought multiple houses just to sell them, or people who purchased a house they couldn't afford and then walked away from. "The truth is, it will take time for our housing market to recover," he said. "But there are steps we can take, right now, to move this country forward."

HEADLINE: Nevada Caucus Updates

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans in Nevada are caucusing Saturday. We'll be bringing you occasional updates. 

 BODY:
Republicans in Nevada are caucusing today. The state's Republican party will begin to report results after 5 p.m., but final numbers will take several more hours. On the other hand, unofficial results are already being reported from some precincts. Throughout, we'll bring you occasional updates.
10:07 P.M. | Polls Look Ahead to Colorado and Minnesota
Although the exact margin has yet to be determined, Mitt Romney has been declared the winner in the Nevada caucuses tonight.
It appears that Mr. Romney may slightly outperform some expectations. Exit polls showed him winning about 55 percent of the vote in Nevada, versus his FiveThirtyEight forecast of 51 percent. So should Representative Ron Paul, who may get closer to 20 percent than the 15 his percent projected by the forecast. 
But the polls did not do badly as compared with 2008, when Mr. Romney's margin of victory was underestimated by 30 points in Nevada. Nor is it surprising when well-organized campaigns like Mr. Romney's and Mr. Paul's outperform their numbers in caucuses.
One of the organizations brave enough to poll the caucuses, Public Policy Polling, will also release surveys in Colorado and Minnesota, which are set to hold caucuses on Tuesday. Their early results, which they have been teasing on their Twitter feed, suggest that Mr. Romney is the favorite in Colorado but will probably not win by Nevada-like margins. Minnesota appears as though it could be quite competitive, however. Mr. Romney won both states in 2008.
- 
8:34 P.M. | Rural Counties Show Down Turnout
The five mostly rural Nevada counties to have completely reported all their results so far - Churchill, Eurkea, Mineral, Nye and Pershing - reported that a total of 2,111 votes were cast in this year's caucuses. That meant that turnout was down by about 20 percent from 2008, when a total of 2,600 votes were reported in the same five counties.
- 
6:35 P.M. | Romney Support Rises With Income
According to early entrance polls as published by CNN, Mitt Romney's support in Nevada was very closely correlated with the income of the voter.
The entrance polls estimate that Mr. Romney won 31 percent of the vote among those whose households made under $30,000 per year. But he won 48 percent among households between $30,000 and $50,000 per year, 58 percent among those making between $50,000 and $100,000 and 62 percent among those with six-figure incomes.
Nevada's electorate tonight was relatively well off. As many voters today made over $100,000 per year as under $50,000, according to the entrance polls.

5:40 P.M. | Entrance Poll Shows Higher Mormon Turnout Than Surveys
Early entrance polls show that 26 percent of voters there are Mormon. That's about the same as in 2008. But it's slightly higher than the most recent pre-election poll predicted: Public Policy's Polling survey projected 20 percent of voters to be Mormon.
If Mitt Romney dominates the Mormon votes, as he did in 2008 when he won 95 percent of the group, higher Mormon turnout than projected by the polls would make him a favorite to beat the pre-election surveys.
- 
5:10 P.M. | Nevada Could be Tough Hold for Obama in November
My view is that there is too much rather than too little attention paid to state-by-state polls at this stage of the general election race. The numbers can be volatile - and changes in the fundamental factors like the economy are almost certain to shake up the race from its present state. 
Still, sometimes there are states where the evidence seems to speak for or against the incumbent candidate. So far, in Nevada, the evidence seems to point to a potentially tough time for President Obama. 
Start with Mr. Obama's approval rating in the state. It was 41 percent in 2011, according to polling conducted by Gallup throughout the year. Mr. Obama's approval rating is now a few points higher throughout the country than it was for most of last year. But even if you look at his ratings in Nevada relative to the national numbers, they don't look so good for him. Mr. Obama's Gallup approval rating averaged about 44 percent in Gallup polling throughout 2011, so Nevada lagged 3 points behind the national trend. This stands in contrast to 2008, when Mr. Obama received 55 percent of the vote in Nevada - 2 points better than he did nationally. 
Why is Mr. Obama polling poorly in the Silver State? One obvious reason may be the housing crisis; by various estimates, somewhere between 50 and 70 percent of Nevada mortgages are underwater. Meanwhile, Nevada's unemployment rate was 13 percent as of November 2011, considerably above the national average. 
In addition, states in the interior West sometimes exhibit an anti-incumbent tendency, being more inclined to change horses than parts of the country like the Midwest. Bill Clinton, for instance, won both Colorado and Montana in 1992, when he was challenging George H.W. Bush. But he lost both states as the incumbent in 1996, even though he did slightly better nationwide.
On top of that, the demographics of Nevada aren't bad for Mr. Obama's most likely Republican opponent, Mitt Romney. Higher turnout among Mormon voters could help Mr. Romney a bit. And although the state has a high unemployment rate, it isn't necessarily low income - the median household income was $51,525 there in 2010, above the national average of $49,445. So even if there is a "class warfare" scenario in 2012 - and Mr. Obama gains ground among working-class voters while losing ground among higher-income voters - this is not one of those states where it would help him.
But one caution: polls in Nevada have underestimated Democratic performance of late. In 2008, most polls had Mr. Obama winning Nevada by 6 or 7 points - less than his actual margin of victory, which was 12.5 points. And in 2010, most polls had the Republican Sharron Angle winning the Senate race, but Harry Reid was re-elected instead.
Still, it's not just Mr. Obama's approval ratings that look poor in Nevada. His fundamentals aren't strong there, either.

HIGHLIGHT: Following the Nevada caucuses, the Republican contenders appear on the Sunday shows. 

 BODY:
Following the Nevada caucuses on Saturday, the contenders for the Republican presidential nomination will stop by the Sunday shows. Newt Gingrich makes appearances on NBC's "Meet the Press" and CBS's "Face the Nation," while Rick Santorum joins "Fox News Sunday" and Representative Ron Paul of Texas is on ABC's "This Week." And after his victory in the Florida primary, Mitt Romney will be featured on Telemundo's "Enfoque."
With the Republican candidates vowing to stay in the race until the convention, it's shaping up to be a long fight, state-by-state, for the nomination. CNN's "State of the Union" features Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, and Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, to talk about how governors see this race.
Mr. McDonnell will also join Fox this weekend, where he'll talk about his support for Mr. Romney with J.C. Watts, a former Oklahoma representative who favors Mr. Gingrich.
Also, CNN will ask Dick Armey, a former House majority leader and chairman of the Tea Party-linked FreedomWorks, and Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, about candidate support from the Tea Party and the religious right.
And with January's employment numbers offering further evidence the economy is recovering, two former Congressional Budget Office directors, Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Alice M. Rivlin, talk about the economy on CNN. Plus, Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, weighs in on tensions between Iran and Israel.
In addition to featuring Mr. Paul, ABC hosts an economic roundtable with three economists: Lawrence H. Summers, former economic adviser to President Obama; Glenn Hubbard, former economic adviser to President George W. Bush and current economic adviser to Mr. Romney; and Diane Swonk, economist at Mesirow Financial.
NBC has more on the Republican race, with Gov. Deval Patrick, Democrat of Massachusetts, Gov. Mitch Daniels, Republican of Indiana, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City. And Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, joins NBC's political roundtable discussion.
In addition to Mr. Gingrich, CBS features Rudolph W. Guiliani, former New York City mayor, as well as a former Republican presidential candidate.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota returns to the Sunday shows, joining Bloomberg's "Political Capital" this week.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, and Senator John McCain, Arizona Republican and former presidential candidate, will be on Univision's "Al Punto," talking about the Nevada caucuses and the economy.
C-Span's "Newsmakers" hosts Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, on his party's efforts to retake the House this year.
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida and chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Eliseo Vasquez Medina,secretary and treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, will be on Telemundo to talk about issues particularly important to Hispanic voters in the presidential election, including immigration and union rights. Also, Eric Olson, senior associate at the Woodrow Wilson Center, weighs in on the developments in Operation "Fast and Furious."
And Cecilia E. Rouse, former White House economic adviser and Princeton University professor, joins TV One's "Washington Watch" to discuss the economy.

6:55 P.M. | Ron Paul in Minnesota
Having already moved on from Nevada to Minnesota, Ron Paul on Saturday night continued to rail against the excesses of the federal government.
"They are stealing our liberty from us," Mr. Paul told a large, enthusiastic Minnesota crowd Saturday night, even as voters in Nevada were completing their caucuses.
"It sounds like the revolution has already come to Minnesota," Mr. Paul said after entering to loud applause.
Mr. Paul described his normal litany of problems that need fixing in Washington, including the monetary system, the Federal Reserve, the making of war, and government intervention in private business.
But he also said his campaign had revealed what he called a "change in sentiment" among the people that he has met while traveling around the country.
"Something pretty big is happening in this country," he said, saying that people are demanding "less government, less war, and a free market economy."
- 
6:34 P.M. | 2012 in Nevada Is Different From 2008
The Nevada where Republicans are voting today is a very different place from what it was during the caucuses four years ago.
In January of 2008, when Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul last campaigned in Nevada, the economy was doing well and unemployment was at just five percent.
That was a bit higher than the state's low of 4.2 nearly two year earlier. But hardly anyone in Nevada would have expected the rate to reach 14.9 percent by December of 2010. 
And yet, despite the differences in the economic terrain, Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul appear to be leading the pack in the state again. Polls ahead of the voting suggested that both men would likely come out on top in the contest on Saturday.
That suggests that political organization (both candidates have spent time here) and other factors (like the state's large Mormon population) may have trumped the economic situation when it comes to the election.

6:29 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Familiar Faces, Early Decisions 
Two of the four candidates in the race are quite familiar to Nevada caucusgoers. In 2008, Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul were the two top vote-getters, at 51 percent and 14 percent respectively.
Not surprisingly then, more than half of Nevada's 2012 Republican caucusgoers say that they decided their vote before seeing any of this year's other caucus or primary results.
This trend is particularly pronounced among supporters of Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul. Among those who said they were voting for Mr. Romney, 6 in 10 decided before January. Among those who said they were voting for Mr. Paul, nearly 7 in 10 decided before January.
In contrast, among those voting for Mr. Santorum, almost three-fourths decided since he won the Iowa caucus in early January. Gingrich supporters were about evenly split, with half deciding before January and half since then.
- 
6:17 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Electability 
In every nominating contest, a candidate's "electability" has been the top quality selected by Republican voters who want President Obama to lose his bid for re-election.
About 4 in 10 caucusgoers said today that defeating Mr. Obama was the issue that mattered most in deciding whom to support today. About 2 in 10 chose strong moral character as the most important, and about the same number said being a true conservative or having the right experience mattered most, according to early entrance polls.
Earlier this week in Florida, Mitt Romney decisively won the support of voters wanting foremost to see Mr. Obama defeated. But in South Carolina, Newt Gingrich was the favorite among voters concerned with electability. Earlier, in New Hampshire and Iowa, Mr. Romney claimed that mantle.

6:09 P.M. | As Nevadans Vote, Romney Campaigns in Colorado
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - As Nevadans headed to the polls for their caucuses on Saturday, Mr. Romney headed here for a rally in advance of Colorado's primary on Tuesday. 
Speaking to a crowd of more than 700 people, Mr. Romney offered a longer-than-usual speech - he spoke for nearly 20 minutes - during which he kept his focus on President Obama, never once mentioning any of his Republican rivals by name. 
Referring to the recent unemployment numbers, which were announced Friday to be at a three-year low, Mr. Romney tried to turn the tables back against the president.
"He's celebrating that it's at 8.3," Mr. Romney said. "That's still above the emergency line of 8 percent. And, by the way, he doesn't get credit for things getting better. I'm delighted things are getting better. But the people who deserve credit for making things better are people like Tom who build a place like this and employ people in this great state." (He was referring to Tom Neppl, the chief executive of Springs Fabrication, where Mr. Romney held his rally.)
Mr. Romney won the contests in Nevada and Colorado by a large margin four years ago, earning more than 50 percent of the vote in both states, and his campaign expects a similar outcome this time.
Mr. Romney also talked about his time turning around the Olympics in Utah, a nearby state. 
"We were draped in scandal," he stated, before recounting how more than 47,000 people volunteered to work for free to help resuscitate the problem-plagued games.
- 
5:56 P.M. | Entrance Polls: The Tea Party 
This year, a lot of people have been watching the Tea Party movement's influence on the Republican nominating contests, and the choices of conservative voters.
It turns out, according to today's early entrance polls, that Nevada has the highest percentage of Tea Party supporters than any of the previous states in this political season. Nearly three-quarters of caucusgoers say they support the Tea Party, and more than 4 in 10 strongly support it. In Florida, South Carolina and Iowa, about two-thirds of voters supported the Tea Party movement.
In Florida, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich pretty much split the Tea Party vote earlier this week. And it's important to note that people who say they identify with Tea Party principles may differ on certain issues from state to state.
More than 8 in 10 Nevada caucusgoers today said they were conservative on most political matters, with nearly half saying they consider themselves very conservative. The number of very conservative voters in Nevada is on a par with Iowa, where a plurality voted for Rick Santorum.
But with Nevada's dismal economy, voters in the Silver State may be more fiscally conservative than socially conservative. In Iowa, 13 percent of voters said abortion was the issue that mattered most to their vote, but in Nevada, that issue barely registered among today's caucusgoers, according to preliminary entrance-poll results.
- 
5:55 P.M. | Gingrich Will Hold Press Conference, and Rumors Swirl
LAS VEGAS - Because Mr. Gingrich has scheduled a press conference for Saturday night rather than a traditional rally after the caucus returns come in, rumors have been flying that he will announce his withdrawal from the race. They were fueled by his light schedule of public appearances since he arrived in Nevada after a decisive defeat in Florida.
To anyone who tuned in to Mr. Gingrich last summer, when he had no money and bounced along the bottom in single digits in polls, it seemed a far-fetched scenario. He has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race through early summer. A chief organizer of his South Carolina victory, Adam Waldeck, was passing through Las Vegas this week on his way to set up Mr. Gingrich's campaign in California, which holds it primary on June 5.
And at 2 p.m. local time, the campaign sent the press corps a tentative schedule of appearances for Mr. Gingrich next week in the caucus states of Colorado and Minnesota, and in Ohio, where early voting for the March 6 primary begins Feb. 7. On Friday he will be in Washington to address the Conservative Political Action Conference. 
It doesn't sound like a candidate preparing to drop out.
- 
5:48 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Focus on the Economy
Republican caucusgoers this year seem worse off financially than they were four years ago, a probable reflection of how hard the state was hit by the recession. 
For example, in 2008, 34 percent of those attending the Republican caucus reported a family income over $100,000. This year, only about 1 in 4 reported income above that level. 
Despite economic hardships, in a state where the unemployment rate is above the national average by about 4 percentage points, its voters were no more likely to rate the economy as the most important issue in deciding their vote than primary voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina or Florida. In each of those states, more than 60 percent of voters picked the economy. In Nevada, just over half picked this issue. In contrast, the issue of the budget deficit was slightly more important to Nevada's caucusgoers (one-third) than in any of these primary states (about 1 in 4), and about the same as it was in the Iowa caucus.
As in each previous contest, the social issues of abortion and immigration ranked far behind these economic issues, with fewer than 1 in 10 picking either of these as the most important in deciding their vote.
- 
5:30 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Religion
Nevada's actual caucus votes are still hours away from being released, but Edison Research of Somerville, N.J., did conduct entrance surveys of Republicans at random precincts around the state.
The questionnaire for the entrance polls is short, as it was for Iowa's caucuses, but the answers still give us a snapshot of each state's voters during these early nominating contests. Among the questions asked is religion, and for Nevada, there are interesting patterns not seen before in the other states.
For example, Mormons made up about a quarter of caucusgoers in Nevada today, according to preliminary results from those surveys. This is about the same number as in the 2008 Republican caucus, and 95 percent of Mormon voters supported Mitt Romney then.
Nearly 3 in 10 caucusgoers today said they considered themselves born-again or evangelical Christians. This is a smaller number of evangelical voters, compared with some of the other early nominating states. In Florida, nearly half of Republican primary voters were evangelicals, and they split their vote between Newt Gingrich and Mr. Romney. Evangelicals went strongly for Mr. Gingrich in South Carolina, where they made up nearly two-thirds of primary voters. And in Iowa, where nearly 6 in 10 caucus goers were evangelical, a plurality - about a third - supported Rick Santorum.
- 
5:25 P.M. | The Challenges of Results Reporting in Nevada
Even though Nevada Republicans have been voting at caucus sites around the state for hours now, we'll be waiting a long time before the state's Republican officials release any actual votes.
Caucusgoers have been meeting at more than 1,834 precincts within the state's 17 counties. Results from 16 of those - excluding Clark County, where Las Vegas is - will be released about 8 p.m. Eastern time, or 5 p.m. Pacific time.
The caucus tallies from Clark won't be released until about 10 p.m. Eastern time, because the state's Republican leaders decided not to issue those until a post-Sabbath caucus for observant Jews and Seventh-Day Adventists completes its meeting in the early evening.
Clark County generally houses two-thirds of the state's voters, and in 2008, its Republican caucusgoers made up 54 percent of the vote. Washoe County, where Reno is situated, made up 20 percent, and the rural counties made up a little more than one-fourth. 
Caucuses are always a little unwieldy, and this year has been no exception - remember how Iowa's results first gave Mr. Romney the victory but then shifted to Mr. Santorum? In Nevada, the caucus tallies are reported to the state's party officials, who then release them. (And this year, in addition to results issued by The Associated Press, the state's Republicans have decided to use Twitter (@NVvotecount) and Google to pump them out.
The A.P. issued a cautionary advisory about tonight's results, with additional language highlighting how caucus returns differ from the reporting of unofficial, early returns in primaries:
 This event is a party run, party administered affair. No voting equipment is being used, and professional election administration officials are not managing the process.
 In most state-run elections, The Associated Press can rely on the formats of results as they move from precinct to county to the state and/or directly to the AP, and we can make contact with the local election officials. This enables the AP to compare valid sources from various levels, correct or confirm unexpected results, provide real time information about the process, and to verify all totals.
 In party administered events, the AP's ability to provide these services is often constrained or precluded.
Michael Oreskes, senior managing editor for The Associated Press, told me earlier this week that The A.P. had added language because of the recent problems with caucuses. He said the updated advisory now goes into more detail on the party role and nature of these events.
You probably won't see projections for a winner before Clark County's vote is released, because it makes up more than half and there's a general understanding that no projections are made before the caucuses end.
We'll have some entrance poll results about the caucusgoers and their interests coming soon. Stay tuned.

4:56 P.M. | Following the 'Action' With Jon Ralston
Voting in the Nevada caucuses is under way, and it's a bonanza for political junkies.
Unlike in Iowa, where results were reported largely at the end of the evening, Nevada caucus locations have been reporting their results all day long.
People following the Twitter account of Jon Ralston, the state's veteran political reporter, have been able to follow the "action" happening all over the state as he passes along the results from different voting locations.
"RT @brianduggan: Reno 8100: Romney 26, Santorum and Paul 7 and Gingrich 6," said one tweet. "#nvcaucus that's where @BrianSandoval voted/Sandoval 4 Romney!"
Another read: "Coronado HS (Henderson): Romney 37 >> Gingrich 14 >> Santorum 6 >> Paul 3/#nvcaucus."

4:27 P.M. | Nevada Republicans Caucus in First Western Contest
LAS VEGAS - In a state where so many fortunes have changed on a roll of the dice, Mitt Romney is hoping for no surprises in Nevada, where Republicans began voting at caucuses Saturday morning in the first nominating contest in the West.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney blew out the Republican competition here, surprising analysts by winning the caucuses with just over half the votes, bolstered by overwhelming support from Mormons. This time he is counting on a similarly strong Mormon vote but also on his campaign's powerful "ground game," which, along with a barrage of advertising, helped propel him to victory in Florida on Tuesday.
The complete results from Saturday's caucuses were not expected until late in the night.

HEADLINE: Lessons From the Nevada Entrance Polls

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI and DAVID R. JONES


HIGHLIGHT: About a quarter of Nevada caucusgoers are Mormon, and tonight's caucuses feature a higher percentage of Tea Party supporters than the other early contests. 

 BODY:
Nevada's actual caucus votes are still hours away from being released, but Edison Research of Somerville, N.J., did conduct entrance surveys of Republicans at random precincts around the state.
The questionnaire for the entrance polls is short, as it was for Iowa's caucuses, but the answers still give us a snapshot of each state's voters during these early nominating contests. Among the questions asked is religion, and for Nevada, there are interesting patterns not seen before in the other states.
Religion

For example, Mormons made up about a quarter of caucusgoers in Nevada today, according to preliminary results from those surveys. This is about the same number as in the 2008 Republican caucus, and 95 percent of Mormon voters supported Mitt Romney then.
Nearly 3 in 10 caucusgoers today said that they considered themselves born-again or evangelical Christians. This is a smaller number of evangelical voters, compared with some of the other early nominating states. In Florida, nearly half of Republican primary voters were evangelicals, and they split their vote between Newt Gingrich and Mr. Romney. Evangelicals went strongly for Mr. Gingrich in South Carolina, where they made up nearly two-thirds of primary voters. And in Iowa, where nearly 6 in 10 caucusgoers were evangelical, a plurality -- about a third -- supported Rick Santorum. 

Electability
In every nominating contest, a candidate's "electability" has been the top quality selected by Republican voters who want President Obama to lose his bid for re-election.
About 4 in 10 caucusgoers said today that defeating Mr. Obama was the issue that mattered most in deciding whom to support today.

For example, in 2008, 34 percent of those attending the Republican caucus reported a family income over $100,000. This year, only about 1 in 4 reported income above that level.

David R. Jones is a professor at Baruch College and a polling analyst for The Times.
The Tea Party
This year, a lot of people have been watching the Tea Party movement's influence on the Republican nominating contests, and the choices of conservative voters.
It turns out, according to today's early entrance polls, that Nevada has the highest percentage of Tea Party supporters than any of the previous states in this political season. Nearly three-quarters of caucusgoers say they support the Tea Party, and more than 4 in 10 strongly support it. In Florida, South Carolina and Iowa, about two-thirds of voters supported the Tea Party movement.
In Florida, Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich pretty much split the Tea Party vote earlier this week. And it's important to note that people who say they identify with Tea Party principles may differ on certain issues from state to state.
More than 8 in 10 Nevada caucusgoers on Saturday said they were conservative on most political matters, with nearly half saying they considered themselves very conservative. The number of very conservative voters in Nevada is on a par with Iowa, where a plurality voted for Rick Santorum.
But with Nevada's dismal economy, voters in the Silver State may be more fiscally conservative than socially conservative. In Iowa, 13 percent of voters said abortion was the issue that mattered most to their vote, but in Nevada, that issue barely registered among today's caucusgoers, according to preliminary entrance-poll results. 

Familiar Faces, Early Decisions
Two of the four candidates in the race are quite familiar to Nevada caucusgoers. In 2008, Mr. Romney and Representative Ron Paul were the two top vote-getters, at 51 percent and 14 percent respectively.
Not surprisingly, then, more than half of Nevada's 2012 Republican caucusgoers say that they decided their vote before seeing any of this year's other caucus or primary results.
This trend is particularly pronounced among supporters of Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul. Among those who said they were voting for Mr. Romney, 6 in 10 decided before January. Among those who said they were voting for Mr. Paul, nearly 7 in 10 decided before January.
In contrast, among those voting for Mr. Santorum, almost three-fourths decided since he won the Iowa caucus in early January. Gingrich supporters were about evenly split, with half deciding before January and half since then. 
Older Voters
According to entrance surveys, voters over 64 make up a larger portion of Nevada Republican caucusgoers in 2012 (more than one-third) than they did in 2008 (26 percent).
This proportion is almost identical to that of last Tuesday's primary in Florida, a state with a very high population of older residents.
Tonight's turnout among aging voters is potentially good news for Mr. Romney, who has been doing the most consistently well with that subset. Mr. Romney won among voters 65 and over in Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida, and finished second to Mr. Gingrich in South Carolina.
In the 2008 Nevada caucus, Mr. Romney performed best among this older demographic, capturing 60 percent of their votes, compared with 51 percent overall.
Urban Voters
More than 6 in 10 caucusgoers hailed from urban areas, according to the early results from entrance polls.
Florida was the first of the early nominating contests to have a sizable population, 34 percent, of voters from metropolitan regions. Mitt Romney won the support of nearly half of voters from cities with 10,000 or more residents in Florida, and Newt Gingrich won about 3 in 10.
The first three early nominating states -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- had a significant percentage of voters from rural areas. In each of these states, at least a third of voters hailed from rural areas. In Iowa, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum split the rural votes. In New Hampshire, Mr. Romney won most rural voters, but in South Carolina, Mr. Gingrich did.
But Nevada's rural areas are mostly uninhabited desert and mountain areas, where mining is the major industry and prostitution is legal in most counties. And according to Nevada's entrance poll, just 1 in 7 voters Saturday came from these vast open areas.

9:55 P.M. | Romney Wins Nevada Caucus by Wide Margin
Mitt Romney scored a sweeping victory in Nevada today with a broad coalition of voters that included groups that he has struggled to win in previous contests, including very conservative voters, strong Tea Party supporters and evangelicals.
The victory extends the momentum Mr. Romney carried from his commanding victory in Florida last Tuesday, and pushed forward his march toward the Republican nomination.
Mr. Romney's rivals largely conceded the state before the results were known, with some leaving Nevada to campaign in Colorado and Minnesota. Mr. Romney, who won Nevada in 2008, had never given up the lead in polls here.
With nearly half of caucus voters in Nevada describing themselves as very conservative, the state's electorate was the most conservative since Iowa. 
It also had the largest share of strong Tea Party supporters (more than 4 in 10 of all voters) of any of the Republican nominating contests to date - a makeup that would have proven problematic for Mr. Romney in most of the other early states.
Concern about Mr. Romney among conservative voters has provided fuel for Rick Santorum and Newt Gingirich, who have cast themselves as the conservative alternatives to Mr. Romney.
But today Mr. Romney beat out the other candidates among these voters, winning about half of very conservative voters (more than double the support Mr. Gingrich received), and about 4 in 10 strong Tea Party supporters (compared with 3 in 10 for Mr. Gingrich).
Mr. Romney also won nearly half of evangelical voters, the best he has done with this group in the nominating contests to date. Evangelical voters accounted for just about a quarter of voters today, well below their share of voters in all the previous contests except for New Hampshire. 
Today marked the first contest this year featuring a substantial portion of Mormon voters. Mormons came out in large numbers, accounting for about a quarter of caucusgoers, similar to 2008. And also similar to 2008, they overwhelmingly supported Mr. Romney, with about 9 in 10 voting for him.
Mr. Romney's large victory also included a majority of Catholics. And he edged out the other candidates among Protestant and other Christian voters.
Mr. Romney won a majority of voters age 45 and older - a group that accounted for about three-quarters of caucus participants in Nevada. He won most men and women alike and also won across all education and income groups - except among those in households earning less than $30,000 - a group that divided their vote between Mr. Romney, Mr. Paul and Mr. Gingrich. 
The top candidate quality to caucusgoers was someone who can defeat President Obama, and three quarters of these voters supported Mr. Romney. The top issue to voters, as in all other contests so far, was the economy, and more than 6 in 10 of these voters backed Mr. Romney.

9:16 P.M. | Network Coverage of Nevada Slow to Get Going
It's been a slow start for coverage of the Nevada caucuses for the three big cable news networks, which were struggling to fill the gap left by a three-hour time difference between Las Vegas, where much of the action is, and New York, where the coverage is anchored.
Fox News was broadcasting an interview that Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, had conducted with Meryl Streep. What was his interest in Ms. Streep, who was not by any stretch a typical guest for his Saturday night show? Her role as Margaret Thatcher, a hero to the conservative movement and the subject of the new film "The Iron Lady." Fox planned to start its election coverage after Mr. Huckabee's show ended at 9 p.m. Eastern time.
MSNBC was airing live reports from its campaign embeds, the young journalists who travel with the candidates and document their every move but rarely get much air time. The network said it was being cautious and as a matter of policy would not forecast a winner until the polls had closed.
The first network to broadcast caucus results was CNN, which had teams of reporters at polling places who were gathering vote tallies and reporting them. That allowed CNN to have more than 3 percent of the total votes accounted for and reported on air by 8:30 p.m.
- 
9:11 P.M. | Santorum Pushes On 
Mr. Santorum said Saturday night that he expected "to win the nomination" and renewed his criticism of Mr. Romney as an inconsistent conservative.
Speaking from Colorado, where he campaigned Saturday, Mr. Santorum said on CNN that Mr. Romney "gives away three of the biggest issues of this campaign: health care, cap and trade and the Wall Street bailouts."
Mr. Santorum has struggled to regain traction after a surge in support in Iowa late last year. But he dismissed the idea of dropping out.
"This is where the race begins to turn a little bit," Mr. Santorum said. "This is our opportunity now, as the field widens a bit."
After The Denver Post endorsed Mr. Romney, saying that Mr. Santorum does not have "world experience," Mr. Santorum disputed that.
"I'm the father of seven children. I think that gives you a lot of world experience," he said.
- 
9:09 P.M. | Gingrich Staying in Race 
Though the fact that Mr. Gingrich had scheduled a post-caucus press conference instead of a rally had some questioning whether he would drop out, as we noted earlier, the Gingrich campaign had shown no signs of leaving the race.
The campaign now confirms that it plans to continue, regardless of the outcome in Nevada. 
A senior Gingrich official who has spent the last four days in planning sessions said, "The dropping-out stories can be explained in these simple terms: Up in Boston each week, they hope it's the end. Once again, they will be disappointed. This is going on to Tampa or until they drop out, whichever comes first."

8:33 P.M. | February Favorable for Romney
For Mr. Romney, a victory in Nevada seems likely. But the name of the game now is inevitability.
Mr. Romney's campaign is eager to march through February with a series of victories that help to cement the idea that his rivals are merely hanging in, with no real chance of winning.
That will allow Mr. Romney to continue to pivot his message toward President Obama, as he did at an event in Colorado on Saturday, a move that could be critically important as the president shifts more into campaign mode.
The February calendar looks friendly to Mr. Romney. In 2008, he won Colorado and Minnesota, both of which vote on Tuesday. And Michigan, which will vote on Feb. 28, is one of his home states. (His father was a governor there.)
Mr. Romney's campaign especially wants sweep as much of February as it can, because Mr. Gingrich may have some advantages on March 6, when Republican voters in 11 states go to the ballots.
Several of those states are in the South, where Mr. Gingrich could be stronger than Mr. Romney, though it's hard to predict this far ahead. If Mr. Gingrich is still in the race then, victories in those states could keep him alive for much longer.
- 
8:13 P.M. | No Debates for Nevada Ahead of Caucus
No debates.
Nevada is the first presidential contest of the 2012 campaign that has not had a debate just days before the voting begins.
In South Carolina, the debates clearly favored Mr. Gingrich, whose ability to whip up audience reaction helped propel him to a 12-point victory there. In Florida, Mr. Romney used two debates to fuel his 14-point win.
The lack of a televised debate has meant that the campaign in Nevada is playing out without the kind of national attention that was paid to the battles in Florida, South Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire.
That may have hurt Rick Santorum the most; he has far less money than his other rivals and depended on the debates to amplify his message in ways that paid television commercials normally do.
But Mr. Gingrich could suffer, too. Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul have spent time and money organizing their supporters in Nevada, leaving Mr. Gingrich little opportunity to compete on the ground. An unqualified win during a debate might have helped.

For those who want to follow along on Twitter with what the Nevada Republican Party issues beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern time, meaning all 16 counties outside of Clark County, it may be more readable to follow @NVGOP rather than @NVvotecount, which we mentioned earlier. @NVvotecount is apparently an automatic feed, which could be overwhelming for a little while once it gets rolling.
- 
7:51 P.M. | Nevada Will Be Battleground in General
Nevada may not place a decisive role in determining the Republican nominee. But it could become a serious battleground later this year as the Republican nominee fights with President Obama over the state's six electoral votes.
Mr. Obama won the state by 12 percentage points in 2008, adding to his overwhelming electoral victory. But aides to Mr. Obama believe the electoral race could be far closer in 2012, making that handful of electoral votes critical.
In the five "paths to victory" outlined by Jim Messina, the campaign manager for Mr. Obama, Nevada figures critically into two of them - the "West" path and the "Expansion" path.
In either scenario, if the state's six electoral votes were to swing from Mr. Obama to his Republican opponent, and everything else stays the same, he would lose re-election.

7:22 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Urban Voters
In a short while, Web and TV screens will light up with maps of Nevada, as the actual caucus votes are reported by the state's Republican party.
More than 6 in 10 caucusgoers hailed from urban areas, according to the early results from entrance polls.
Florida was the first of the early nominating contests to have a sizable population, 34 percent, of voters from metropolitan regions. Mitt Romney won the support of nearly half of voters from cities with 10,000 or more residents in Florida, and Newt Gingrich won about 3 in 10.
The first three early nominating states - Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - had a significant percentage of voters from rural areas. In each of these states, at least a third of voters hailed from rural areas. In Iowa, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum split the rural votes. In New Hampshire, Mr. Romney won most rural voters, but in South Carolina, Mr. Gingrich did.
But Nevada's rural areas are mostly uninhabited desert and mountain areas, where mining is the major industry and prostitution is legal in most counties. And according to Nevada's entrance poll, just 1 in 7 voters Saturday came from these vast open areas.
- 
7 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Older Voters
According to entrance surveys, voters over 64 make up a larger portion of Nevada Republican caucusgoers in 2012 (more than one-third) than they did in 2008 (26 percent).
This proportion is almost identical to that of last Tuesday's primary in Florida, a state with a very high population of older residents.
Tonight's turnout among the aging voter is potentially good news for Mr. Romney, who has been doing the most consistently well with that subset. Mr. Romney won among voters 65 and over in Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida, and finished second to Mr. Gingrich in South Carolina.
In the 2008 Nevada caucus, Mr. Romney performed best among this older demographic, capturing 60 percent of their votes, compared to 51 percent overall.
- 
7:13 P.M. | Easier the Second Time Around? 
The 2008 caucuses were a bit of a shock to some Nevadans, who were not used to voting so early in the nomination process. (The 2008 caucuses were held Jan. 19, the same day as the South Carolina primary.) As Jeff Zeleny and Patrick Healy reported,
"Telephone hot lines have been established across the state to answer voters' questions about their caucus locations. The Nevada Democratic Party could not find enough activists to run the 520 Democratic caucus sites, so out-of-state volunteers have arrived to help."
- 
6:55 P.M. | Ron Paul in Minnesota
Having already moved on from Nevada to Minnesota, Representative Ron Paul on Saturday night continued to rail against the excesses of the federal government.
"They are stealing our liberty from us," Mr. Paul told a large, enthusiastic Minnesota crowd Saturday night, even as voters in Nevada were completing their caucuses.
"It sounds like the revolution has already come to Minnesota," Mr. Paul said after entering to loud applause.
Mr. Paul described his normal litany of problems that need fixing in Washington, including the monetary system, the Federal Reserve, the making of war and government intervention in private business.
But he also said his campaign had revealed what he called a "change in sentiment" among the people that he has met while traveling around the country.
"Something pretty big is happening in this country," he said, saying that people are demanding "less government, less war and a free-market economy."
- 
6:34 P.M. | 2012 in Nevada Is Different From 2008
The Nevada where Republicans are voting today is a very different place from what it was during the caucuses four years ago.
In January of 2008, when Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul last campaigned in Nevada, the economy was doing well and unemployment was at just five percent.
That was a bit higher than the state's low of 4.2 nearly two year earlier. But hardly anyone in Nevada would have expected the rate to reach 14.9 percent by December of 2010. 
And yet, despite the differences in the economic terrain, Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul appear to be leading the pack in the state again. Polls ahead of the voting suggested that both men would likely come out on top in the contest on Saturday.
That suggests that political organization (both candidates have spent time here) and other factors (like the state's large Mormon population) may have trumped the economic situation when it comes to the election.

6:29 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Familiar Faces, Early Decisions 
Two of the four candidates in the race are quite familiar to Nevada caucusgoers. In 2008, Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul were the two top vote-getters, at 51 percent and 14 percent respectively.
Not surprisingly then, more than half of Nevada's 2012 Republican caucusgoers say that they decided their vote before seeing any of this year's other caucus or primary results.
This trend is particularly pronounced among supporters of Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul. Among those who said they were voting for Mr. Romney, 6 in 10 decided before January. Among those who said they were voting for Mr. Paul, nearly 7 in 10 decided before January.
In contrast, among those voting for Mr. Santorum, almost three-fourths decided since he won the Iowa caucus in early January. Gingrich supporters were about evenly split, with half deciding before January and half since then.
- 
6:17 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Electability 
In every nominating contest, a candidate's "electability" has been the top quality selected by Republican voters who want President Obama to lose his bid for re-election.
About 4 in 10 caucusgoers said today that defeating Mr. Obama was the issue that mattered most in deciding whom to support today. About 2 in 10 chose strong moral character as the most important, and about the same number said being a true conservative or having the right experience mattered most, according to early entrance polls.
Earlier this week in Florida, Mitt Romney decisively won the support of voters wanting foremost to see Mr. Obama defeated. But in South Carolina, Newt Gingrich was the favorite among voters concerned with electability. Earlier, in New Hampshire and Iowa, Mr. Romney claimed that mantle.

6:09 P.M. | As Nevadans Vote, Romney Campaigns in Colorado
COLORADO SPRINGS - As Nevadans headed to the polls for their caucuses on Saturday, Mr. Romney headed here for a rally in advance of Colorado's primary on Tuesday. 
Speaking to a crowd of more than 700 people, Mr. Romney offered a longer-than-usual speech - he spoke for nearly 20 minutes - during which he kept his focus on President Obama, never once mentioning any of his Republican rivals by name. 
Referring to the recent unemployment numbers, which were announced Friday to be at a three-year low, Mr. Romney tried to turn the tables back against the president.
"He's celebrating that it's at 8.3," Mr. Romney said. "That's still above the emergency line of 8 percent. And, by the way, he doesn't get credit for things getting better. I'm delighted things are getting better. But the people who deserve credit for making things better are people like Tom who build a place like this and employ people in this great state." (He was referring to Tom Neppl, the chief executive of Springs Fabrication, where Mr. Romney held his rally.)
Mr. Romney won the contests in Nevada and Colorado by a large margin four years ago, earning more than 50 percent of the vote in both states, and his campaign expects a similar outcome this time.
Mr. Romney also talked about his time turning around the Olympics in Utah, a nearby state. 
"We were draped in scandal," he stated, before recounting how more than 47,000 people volunteered to work for free to help resuscitate the problem-plagued games.
- 
5:56 P.M. | Entrance Polls: The Tea Party 
This year, a lot of people have been watching the Tea Party movement's influence on the Republican nominating contests, and the choices of conservative voters.
It turns out, according to today's early entrance polls, that Nevada has the highest percentage of Tea Party supporters than any of the previous states in this political season. Nearly three-quarters of caucusgoers say they support the Tea Party, and more than 4 in 10 strongly support it. In Florida, South Carolina and Iowa, about two-thirds of voters supported the Tea Party movement.
In Florida, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich pretty much split the Tea Party vote earlier this week. And it's important to note that people who say they identify with Tea Party principles may differ on certain issues from state to state.
More than 8 in 10 Nevada caucusgoers today said they were conservative on most political matters, with nearly half saying they consider themselves very conservative. The number of very conservative voters in Nevada is on a par with Iowa, where a plurality voted for Rick Santorum.
But with Nevada's dismal economy, voters in the Silver State may be more fiscally conservative than socially conservative. In Iowa, 13 percent of voters said abortion was the issue that mattered most to their vote, but in Nevada, that issue barely registered among today's caucusgoers, according to preliminary entrance-poll results.
- 
5:55 P.M. | Gingrich Will Hold Press Conference, and Rumors Swirl
LAS VEGAS - Because Mr. Gingrich has scheduled a press conference for Saturday night rather than a traditional rally after the caucus returns come in, rumors have been flying that he will announce his withdrawal from the race. They were fueled by his light schedule of public appearances since he arrived in Nevada after a decisive defeat in Florida.
To anyone who tuned in to Mr. Gingrich last summer, when he had no money and bounced along the bottom in single digits in polls, it seemed a far-fetched scenario. He has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race through early summer. A chief organizer of his South Carolina victory, Adam Waldeck, was passing through Las Vegas this week on his way to set up Mr. Gingrich's campaign in California, which holds it primary on June 5.
And at 2 p.m. local time, the campaign sent the press corps a tentative schedule of appearances for Mr. Gingrich next week in the caucus states of Colorado and Minnesota, and in Ohio, where early voting for the March 6 primary begins Feb. 7. On Friday he will be in Washington to address the Conservative Political Action Conference. 
It doesn't sound like a candidate preparing to drop out.
- 
5:48 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Focus on the Economy
Republican caucusgoers this year seem worse off financially than they were four years ago, a probable reflection of how hard the state was hit by the recession. 
For example, in 2008, 34 percent of those attending the Republican caucus reported a family income over $100,000. This year, only about 1 in 4 reported income above that level. 
Despite economic hardships, in a state where the unemployment rate is above the national average by about 4 percentage points, its voters were no more likely to rate the economy as the most important issue in deciding their vote than primary voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina or Florida. In each of those states, more than 60 percent of voters picked the economy. In Nevada, just over half picked this issue. In contrast, the issue of the budget deficit was slightly more important to Nevada's caucusgoers (one-third) than in any of these primary states (about one-fourth), and about the same as it was in the Iowa caucus.
As in each previous contest, the social issues of abortion and immigration ranked far behind these economic issues, with fewer than 1 in 10 picking either of these as the most important in deciding their vote.
- 
5:30 P.M. | Entrance Polls: Religion
Nevada's actual caucus votes are still hours away from being released, but Edison Research of Somerville, N.J., did conduct entrance surveys of Republicans at random precincts around the state.
The questionnaire for the entrance polls is short, as it was for Iowa's caucuses, but the answers still give us a snapshot of each state's voters during these early nominating contests. Among the questions asked is religion, and for Nevada, there are interesting patterns not seen before in the other states.
For example, Mormons made up about a quarter of caucusgoers in Nevada today, according to preliminary results from those surveys. This is about the same number as in the 2008 Republican caucus, and 95 percent of Mormon voters supported Mitt Romney then.
Nearly 3 in 10 caucusgoers today said they considered themselves born-again or evangelical Christians. This is a smaller number of evangelical voters, compared with some of the other early nominating states. In Florida, nearly half of Republican primary voters were evangelicals, and they split their vote between Newt Gingrich and Mr. Romney. Evangelicals went strongly for Mr. Gingrich in South Carolina, where they made up nearly two-thirds of primary voters. And in Iowa, where nearly 6 in 10 caucus goers were evangelical, a plurality - about a third - supported Rick Santorum.
- 
5:25 P.M. | The Challenges of Results Reporting in Nevada
Even though Nevada Republicans have been voting at caucus sites around the state for hours now, we'll be waiting a long time before the state's Republican officials release any actual votes.
Caucusgoers have been meeting at more than 1,834 precincts within the state's 17 counties. Results from 16 of those - excluding Clark County, where Las Vegas is - will be released about 8 p.m. Eastern time, or 5 p.m. Pacific time.
The caucus tallies from Clark won't be released until about 10 p.m. Eastern time, because the state's Republican leaders decided not to issue those until a post-Sabbath caucus for observant Jews and Seventh-Day Adventists completes its meeting in the early evening.
Clark County generally houses two-thirds of the state's voters, and in 2008, its Republican caucusgoers made up 54 percent of the vote. Washoe County, where Reno is situated, made up 20 percent, and the rural counties made up a little more than one-fourth. 
Caucuses are always a little unwieldy, and this year has been no exception - remember how Iowa's results first gave Mr. Romney the victory but then shifted to Mr. Santorum? In Nevada, the caucus tallies are reported to the state's party officials, who then release them. (And this year, in addition to results issued by The Associated Press, the state's Republicans have decided to use Twitter (@NVvotecount) and Google to pump them out.
The A.P. issued a cautionary advisory about tonight's results, with additional language highlighting how caucus returns differ from the reporting of unofficial, early returns in primaries:
 This event is a party run, party administered affair. No voting equipment is being used, and professional election administration officials are not managing the process.
 In most state-run elections, The Associated Press can rely on the formats of results as they move from precinct to county to the state and/or directly to the AP, and we can make contact with the local election officials. This enables the AP to compare valid sources from various levels, correct or confirm unexpected results, provide real time information about the process, and to verify all totals.
 In party administered events, the AP's ability to provide these services is often constrained or precluded.
Michael Oreskes, senior managing editor for The Associated Press, told me earlier this week that The A.P. had added language because of the recent problems with caucuses. He said the updated advisory now goes into more detail on the party role and nature of these events.
You probably won't see projections for a winner before Clark County's vote is released, because it makes up more than half and there's a general understanding that no projections are made before the caucuses end.
We'll have some entrance poll results about the caucusgoers and their interests coming soon. Stay tuned.

Voting in the Nevada caucuses is under way, and it's a bonanza for political junkies.
Unlike in Iowa, where results were reported largely at the end of the evening, Nevada caucus locations have been reporting their results all day long.
People following the Twitter account of Jon Ralston, the state's veteran political reporter, have been able to follow the "action" happening all over the state as he passes along the results from different voting locations.
"RT @brianduggan: Reno 8100: Romney 26, Santorum and Paul 7 and Gingrich 6," said one tweet. "#nvcaucus that's where @BrianSandoval voted/Sandoval 4 Romney!"

4:27 P.M. | Nevada Republicans Caucus in First Western Contest
LAS VEGAS - In a state where so many fortunes have changed on a roll of the dice, Mitt Romney is hoping for no surprises in Nevada, where Republicans began voting at caucuses Saturday morning in the first nominating contest in the West.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney blew out the Republican competition here, surprising analysts by winning the caucuses with just over half the votes, bolstered by overwhelming support from Mormons. This time he is counting on a similarly strong Mormon vote but also on his campaign's powerful "ground game," which, along with a barrage of advertising, helped propel him to victory in Florida on Tuesday.
The complete results from Saturday's caucuses were not expected until late in the night.

HEADLINE: How Nevada Republicans Voted

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: A breakdown of the caucusgoers' support for individual Republican candidates. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney gathered a strong coalition in Nevada, amassing a decisive win by persuading more conservative, Tea Party and religious voters to support him. But the entrance polls also showed which crucial groups voted for the other Republican candidates, and how some of them fell short. (See related graphic of the entrance poll results.)
Ron Paul
Mr. Paul, a Texas congressman, has had an active grass-roots operation in place since his convincing performance here in 2008, when he earned second place with 14 percent of the vote, just a percentage point ahead of Senator John McCain. This year he drew support in Nevada from younger voters, independents and among those who said they wanted a true conservative to be the nominee.
As in the earlier contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Paul was popular among younger voters. About 4 in 10 voters under the age of 30 supported him, about the same number who supported Mitt Romney. Unfortunately for Mr. Paul, Nevada has an older population, and voters under 30 made up a small percentage of the electorate, less than 1 in 13 caucusgoers.
Mr. Paul's libertarian message may have appealed to the independent voters of Nevada, with nearly half of them breaking for him, compared to 3 in 10 independents for Mr. Romney. But less than 2 in 10 caucusgoers were independents, and did not provide much of an overall lift. Mr. Paul did win nearly half of voters who said a true conservative mattered the most.
As he has in some earlier contests, Mr. Paul has the biggest gender gap among the candidates. He appeals more to men. He received the support of only about 1 in 7 women, but nearly a quarter of the men.
Newt Gingrich
Mr. Gingrich struggled to find support on Saturday night among caucusgoers. He was unable to get more than one-fourth of the support among groups of voters that he had claimed in South Carolina and other earlier contests.
In South Carolina, Mr. Gingrich won handily among conservatives, Tea Party supporters and evangelical Christian voters.
And even though he lost Florida over all, Mr. Gingrich won 4 in 10 of very conservative voters there, compared to 3 in 10 for Mr. Romney. But in Nevada, Mr. Romney won about twice as many very conservative voters, who made up nearly half of Saturday's caucusgoers.
Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney split the vote of Tea Party supporters and evangelical Christians in Florida. In Nevada, Mr. Gingrich failed to capture more than 1 in 4 Tea Party supporters or evangelicals - again.
And on two central issues to the 2012 election - electability and the economy - Mr. Gingrich failed to connect this time. Among half of caucusgoers who said the economy was the No. 1 issue affecting their vote, Mr. Gingrich had the support of less than 2 in 10 voters. Of those who said beating Mr. Obama was the most important quality for their candidate, less than 2 in 10 chose Mr. Gingrich.
Rick Santorum
Rick Santorum, who barely campaigned in Nevada, found very little backing among caucusgoers here. While Mr. Santorum won the Iowa caucus and has found encouragement among key groups in other states, he was unable to get much support in Nevada from essential voting blocs: conservatives, evangelicals, Catholics or Tea Party supporters.
He did receive one-fourth of the votes from those who said the most important quality for a candidate was a "true conservative," but many more voters said they wanted a candidate who could beat President Obama rather than the qualities of true conservatism or strong moral character.
In a state with a severe housing crisis and the highest unemployment in the country, voters may have been more focused on fiscal conservatism in Saturday's caucus. In addition, Mitt Romney and Ron Paul campaigned through Nevada four years ago, and have built up support in the state since then.
Romney Economics
Even among dedicated caucusgoers in a state favorable to his candidacy, Mr. Romney continues to struggle among low income voters.
Although Mr. Romney captured more than half of all votes in Nevada's caucus, he received only one in three votes of voters earning less that $30,000 a year (median family income in the United States was $49,445 in 2010)-no better than either Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Paul.
Even this is a bit misleading, since one quarter of Nevada caucusgoers are Mormons-a group that overwhelmingly supports Mr. Romney, who shares their religion. Looking only at non-Mormon voters, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Paul both win significantly more votes among low income voters (more than one third each) than does Mr. Romney (less than one quarter).
These results follow widely-publicized comments on Wednesday in which Mr. Romney said he was "not concerned with the very poor." Although Mr. Romney later said that he had misspoken, in the context of other recent statements they seemed to contribute to a growing an portrait of Mr. Romney as being out of touch with the economic struggles of many Americans.
The upside for the Romney campaign in the short term is that he continues to do very well among higher income voters. Six in ten voters with family incomes of $100,000 or more supported him-more than three times as many votes as any other candidate. Even among non-Mormons, he still had at least a 20-point lead over his rivals.
Higher income voters generally make up a larger proportion of the Republican primary and caucus electorate. So far, voters earning $100,000 have outnumbered voters earning under $30,000 by 2 to 1 or more. (By contrast, in the 2008 Nevada Democratic caucus, low income voters outnumbered upper income voters.) --

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HAWES

 BODY:
HAWES, Rosilla Hornblower. Died on January 27, 2012 at the age of 100. Most beloved mother of Lynden B. Miller, cherished mother-in-law of Leigh M. Miller and adored grandmother of Gifford, Marshall, Ethan, and Christian Miller, their wives and eight great-grandchildren whose lives she enriched with her kind, loving and generous nature and her wide-ranging knowledge of literature, public affairs and history. She was born in New York City in 1911 and attended the Chapin School and Vassar College, class of 1933. She was married in 1935 to Alan R. Breed who died in 1954. In 1979 she married Alexander B. Hawes who died in 1995. She lived in Washington, D.C. for many years before returning to her native New York almost a decade ago. 
Her New York roots went way back in New York history. Her ancestors ranged from Susannah Rutgers Marshall, a businesswoman in 18th century New Amsterdam, the Architect, Henry Rutgers Marshall, to Judge William B. Hornblower of the New York Court of Appeals, as well as many other New York architects and lawyers. Her family for many generations believed passionately in public service, and dinner conversation when she was growing up always centered on current events and politics. After Vassar, where she majored in sociology and economics, she worked at the National Consumers League, an organization dedicated to helping women in the workplace founded by Frances Perkins. From long family tradition, she was always a passionate Democrat and, as she put it, "a New Yorker to the bone," so she delighted in the public careers of her two grandsons, Gifford Miller, former Speaker of the New York City Council, and Marshall Miller, Chief of the Criminal Division at the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Though not a gardener herself, she was proud of her daughter, Lynden B. Miller, Public Garden Designer, in her role of beautifying the city they both loved. For those lucky enough to know her, she personified a LADY: elegant, gracious, thoughtful, tactful and sympathetic to everyone she met. She spent her life cherishing the many people she loved and supporting New York City causes and institutions like The New York Botanical Garden, The New York Public Library and The Community Service Society. Contributions in her memory could be made to any of those organizations.

HEADLINE: The Hamlet That Got Up and Went

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
ON a crisp fall day a decade ago, Rima and Brett Marschke and their sons left their apartment in Manhattan for a visit to Katonah, a hamlet in Bedford in northern Westchester, to go pumpkin-picking. That was all it took to persuade them to leave city life behind: a few hours in a quaint downtown of Victorian-style shops, amid picture-postcard homes and broad green spaces.
''We had fallen in love,'' Ms. Marschke recalled. At first it was with the beauty of the physical surroundings, then with the four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath colonial they bought for almost $700,000, and increasingly, over time, with the old-fashioned community where merchants know customers by name and neighbors get together.
The couple were also drawn to the cultural offerings, among them the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts and the Katonah Museum of Art, where Ms. Marschke, formerly an advertising executive, is now a trustee. 
For her husband, an executive at an investment banking firm in Manhattan, the presence of a Metro-North Railroad station within walking distance of their new home was also a major consideration. It meant that unlike many other suburbanites, he and his wife would need only one car.
As Ms. Marschke put it, ''Living here is like living in a beautiful bubble,'' and judging from a key detail in Katonah's history, she is not the first resident to feel such a strong attachment. In the late 1890s, when the creation of a reservoir system necessitated the flooding of the community's first site, a group of about 55 local families hoisted their houses up on logs and, with the aid of horses, rolled them a mile south to safer ground.
That spirit of determination endures, said Bruce Helmes, who was born in Katonah 90 years ago, and who as a young man opened an architectural office, designing and remodeling more than half of the newly reborn hamlet over the years, including the town hall and the firehouse.
In 1950, Mr. Helmes built a small single-story home for himself and his wife, Peggy, who is also 90, and like him born in Katonah. The couple expanded it as their family grew to include eight children. Today, three of Mr. Helmes's sons are partners in the architectural firm, the Helmes Group.
Explaining that his acquaintance with his wife dates to babyhood -- ''I guess you could say we go back a long way'' -- Mr. Helmes recalls the days when Katonah's only police officer rattled every door at night to make sure residents were safe inside.
Much has changed since then, of course, and today Katonah and its environs are known more for their well-to-do Manhattan transplants, as well as for public figures like Martha Stewart, Ralph Lauren and the philanthropist George Soros.
In fact the hamlet, which in 2010 was classified as a ''census-designated place'' by the United States Census Bureau, is fairly homogeneous, and that is not an asset in the eyes of some residents. Within the census designation -- which defines Katonah much more narrowly than many brokers and residents do -- 82 percent of the almost 1,700 people are white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3 percent Asian and 2 percent black. As much as Ms. Marschke appreciates living here, she said, ''In some ways I wish it were more representative of real life.''
Economically, however, the real world has made its presence felt. ''Insulated as Katonah is in most other ways,'' said David Raneri, an owner with his brother Jim of the Charles Department Store, ''the economy has taken its toll here as elsewhere.'' Some customers of the store, run by the same family for three generations, have lost jobs, he said, and business since 2008 has reflected that.
Twice a president of the local chamber of commerce, Mr. Raneri recently sent notes to landlords urging them to consider their tenants' plight, he said, ''because the reality is that if they can't afford the rent, merchants will have no choice but to close their businesses.'' The brothers, who own the two-story building they occupy, have seen several shops in town shut their doors.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Katonah, which is unincorporated, does not even have a traffic light. Turning south off Route 35 onto Bedford Road, one soon encounters a broad, tree-lined swath that is part of a historic district listed since 1983 on the State and National Registers of Historic Places. Some houses were moved here from the original site of the hamlet. Others -- elaborate Victorian-style ''painted ladies'' in hues of rose, yellow, lavender and green -- were built later. Katonah Avenue runs parallel to Bedford Road, echoing the architecture in its shops near the railroad station. Side streets are lined with smaller residences, many of them also Victorians.
Chain stores and the like are precluded by the presence of a state watershed area, which surrounds the hamlet and cocoons it geographically. For big-box shopping, the Jefferson Valley Mall in Yorktown Heights, and the Danbury Mall, across the Connecticut border, are both about 20 minutes' drive.
The precise boundaries of each of the Town of Bedford's three hamlets (the other two are Bedford Village and Bedford Hills) can sometimes be a point of contention, said Harry Girdlestone, Bedford's assessor. To go by the Katonah ZIP code, 10536, for instance, its area is larger than the census designation of just under a square mile. But the count for the Katonah-Lewisboro School District within Bedford is about 1,750 single-family parcels, including about 85 town houses and condominiums, he said.
According to Eileen McGrath, an agent for Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Katonah, there are 21 condos in the hamlet itself, no co-ops and a number of rentals above shops.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
The more expensive houses represent the best buys, Ms. McGrath said, ''because prices in that category have come down so much.'' The agency is seeing a broad range of buyers, from empty nesters to young families.
In a sampling of six single-family listings in the Katonah area, prices range from $435,000 to $2.695 million. Among them are a three-bedroom colonial on a 0.25-acre lot for $719,000, with taxes of $17,453; a four-bedroom colonial on a 0.31-acre lot for $965,000, with taxes of $22,755; and a five-bedroom contemporary on four acres for $1.289 million, with taxes of $30,727. In general, according to Ms. McGrath, the lower-priced homes need work, which does not appeal to most of today's buyers.
In 2011, the median sales price of a single-family home was $740,000 in Katonah, versus $600,000 countywide. The median locally in 2010 was $778,750; in 2007 it was $840,000. The average number of days on the market was 183 last year, 171 in 2010 and 189 in 2007.
THE COMMUTE
Grand Central Terminal is about 70 minutes away on the Metro-North Harlem line. A peak-hour round-trip ticket costs $28.50; a monthly is $315. The commute by car south on Interstate 684 and then the Hutchinson River Parkway also takes about 70 minutes, depending on traffic.
THE SCHOOLS
The Katonah-Lewisboro District has 3,574 in four primary schools, a middle school and a high school. The district also covers Cross River, Goldens Bridge, Lewisboro, North Salem, Pound Ridge, Purdys, South Salem, Waccabuc and Vista. On state tests, 88 percent of fourth-graders at Katonah Elementary met standards in English, 93 percent in math, said Jessica Godin, the principal.
At John Jay High School in Cross River, SAT averages in 2011 were 570 in math, 560 in reading and 560 in writing, versus 514, 497 and 489 statewide.
Of the 300 graduating last year, 92 percent went on to four-year colleges, 7 percent to community colleges, and the rest either to the work force or the military, said Ellen Doherty, the principal.
In sports, John Jay's Ultimate Frisbee team, Air Raid, was state champion last year.
WHAT TO DO
Since 1985, Susan and James Polos have lived in a three-bedroom farmhouse they bought for $160,000. They are empty nesters now. But Ms. Polos, a school librarian in Mount Kisco, and her husband, a financial adviser who commutes to Midtown, have no plans to leave. ''We moved here to raise our children,'' she said, ''but it's also a wonderful place to stay.''
For dinners out, they frequent the Blue Dolphin, an unassuming diner on Katonah Avenue. There are also movie nights at the Katonah Village Library, receptions and openings at the Katonah Museum, and concerts at Caramoor. Occasionally they travel to Manhattan for dinner and a show.
Ms. Marschke says her three sons play lacrosse in the spring, attend summer camp at Waccabuc Country Club 10 minutes away, and often spend time at Katonah Memorial Park, which has facilities for swimming, baseball, soccer, basketball and tennis.
THE HISTORY
The hamlet was named Katonah in 1852 after the Indian chief who sold the land to European settlers in the late 17th century, according to the chamber of commerce. In the mid-1800s, the area was a summer destination for boarders from Manhattan who cycled, played croquet, swam and fished in the cool of the countryside.

HEADLINE: Should Personal Data Be Personal?

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA. 
A technology reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
MAX SCHREMS, a 24-year-old law student from Salzburg, Austria, wanted to know what Facebook knew: He requested his own Facebook file. What he got turned out to be a virtual bildungsroman, 1,222 pages long. It contained wall posts he had deleted, old messages that revealed a friend's troubled state of mind, even information that he didn't enter himself about his physical whereabouts.
Mr. Schrems was intrigued and somewhat rattled. He wasn't worried about anything in particular. Rather, he felt a vague disquiet about what Facebook could do with all that information about him in the future. Why was it there at all, he wondered, when he had deleted it? ''It's like a camera hanging over your bed while you're having sex. It just doesn't feel good,'' is how he finally put it. ''We in Europe are oftentimes frightened of what might happen some day.'' 
Mr. Schrems's sentiment is emblematic of the discomfort sweeping through Europe about the ways in which Internet companies treat personal information. That discomfort has, in turn, prompted proposals for stricter regulation of online data across the continent. And Europe's moves to protect Internet privacy -- something Americans have not, as yet, actively agitated for -- have given rise to a thorny question: How do the laws and mores of different nations manage, if at all, the multinational companies that now govern our digital lives?
Personal data is the oil that greases the Internet. Each one of us sits on our own vast reserves. The data that we share every day -- names, addresses, pictures, even our precise locations as measured by the geo-location sensor embedded in Internet-enabled smartphones -- helps companies target advertising based not only on demographics but also on the personal opinions and desires we post online. Those advertising revenues, in turn, make hundreds of millions of dollars for companies like Facebook, which announced last week that it was going public in what is expected to be the largest I.P.O. in digital history. And those revenues help to keep the Web free of charge.
But there is a price: that data about our lives and wants are collected, scrutinized and retained, often for a long time, by a great many technology companies. Personal data is valuable. In the United States alone, companies spend up to $2 billion a year to collect that information, according to a recent report from Forrester Research.
The European media seized on Mr. Schrems's discovery. German newspapers published instructions on how to request personal data files from Facebook. Within a few months, 40,000 people had made similar requests. The data protection office in Ireland, where Facebook has its European data center, conducted an audit of Facebook's data retention practices; the company agreed to overhaul the way it collects data in Europe, including disposing of user data ''much sooner.'' German regulators have scrutinized facial recognition technology. The Netherlands is considering a bill that would require Internet users to consent to being tracked as they travel from Web site to Web site. And last month, the European Commission unveiled a sweeping new privacy law that would require Web companies to obtain explicit consent before using personal information, inform regulators and users in the event of a data breach and, most radical, empower a citizen of Europe to demand that his or her data be deleted forever.
''Europe has come to the conclusion that none of the companies can be trusted,'' said Simon Davies, the director of the London-based nonprofit Privacy International. ''The European Commission is responding to public demand. There is a growing mood of despondency about the privacy issue.''
Every European country has a privacy law, as do Canada, Australia and many Latin American countries. The United States remains a holdout: We have separate laws that protect our health records and financial information, and even one that keeps private what movies we rent. But there is no law that spells out the control and use of online data.
It would be tempting to say that history and culture on this side of the Atlantic make privacy a non-issue. That's not exactly the case. Privacy has always mattered in American law and to American sensibilities, but in a different way.
Anxieties over privacy came up when postcards were first sent in the late 19th century. The advent of photography prompted Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, in an 1890 article in The Harvard Law Review, to warn of the dangers of displaying private family wedding pictures in the pages of every newspaper. And in one of the most important privacy decisions in recent years, the Supreme Court in January ruled that police officers violated the Constitution when they placed a Global Positioning System tracking device on a suspect's car, to monitor its movements. ''Europeans are much more sensitive about controlling their image online,'' said James Q. Whitman, a Yale Law School professor who has written about the differences in jurisprudence between the United States and Europe.
Social mores around privacy vary widely across the globe. In Japan, Google was criticized for being intrusive when its self-driven cars cruised the streets with a camera snapping pictures for Google Street View.
In India, where I was a correspondent for this newspaper for more than four years, the notion of privacy seems foreign. A shopkeeper might casually ask a childless woman if she has gynecological trouble; school grades are posted on public walls; many people still live in extended families, literally wandering in and out of one another's bedrooms. But a project to issue biometric identity cards to every Indian citizen recently set off a flurry of concern over privacy, prompting the government to draft a new law that enshrines the right to privacy for the first time.
IN the United States, federal legislation on online privacy has languished, as lawmakers weigh the interests of consumers and companies in the battle for personal information.
Part of the difficulty in regulating online privacy is the speed of technological innovation. Just as it becomes remarkably easy for us to share our information with others, it also becomes cheaper and easier to crunch and analyze that information -- and store it forever, if necessary.
Stewart A. Baker, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, is among those who see enormous benefits for private companies and government agencies alike. To fight it on privacy grounds, he argued, would be largely futile. ''You can't really have a property interest in data,'' he argued. ''It's going to get cheaper to reproduce it. It's going to get reproduced and stored. It's going to get copied.''
Privacy advocates worry about the consequences. Most people may not have much to hide. For a few, not sharing personal information may be vital. They're the ones who need the protection of the law, argued Rebecca MacKinnon, a fellow at the New America Foundation and author of ''Consent of the Networked,'' a book about digital freedom.
''It may be victims of domestic abuse who don't want to be stalked or tracked, or it could be dissidents in Syria, or someone who has weird opinions and could mistakenly end up on a watch list when they don't deserve it,'' said Ms. MacKinnon. ''If you have a democratic society, the point is not to say whatever is good for the majority is all we need.''

HEADLINE: The High Price of Private Schools in the City

 BODY:
Hundreds of readers responded online to an article in last Sunday's Metropolitan section by Jenny Anderson and Rachel Ohm about the rising cost of private-school tuition in New York City, many expressing outrage -- at the excesses of private education, the weaknesses of the public school system and economic injustice in general. Some of their comments are below.
Riverdale Country School, which charges $40,450 for 12th grade, also responded to the article with a letter. Dominic A. A. Randolph, the head of school, was not available for an interview before the article's deadline. On Monday, Mr. Randolph and David N. Roberts, the chairman of Riverdale's board of trustees, sent the e-mail below to the SchoolBook blog. 
Riverdale's Response
We write in response to your recent article regarding private school tuition rates in the New York area. The article touched on many of the important issues facing private schools, including the challenge for families to afford tuitions and the need to provide competitive compensation and benefits for faculty and administrators.
Based on our experience at the Riverdale Country School, we thought it would be helpful to outline where a dollar of tuition at Riverdale generally goes. Out of each $1, approximately $0.15 goes to scholarship and $0.70 goes to pay for employee salaries and benefits. Another $0.25 goes primarily to maintain facilities and buy instructional materials as well as a host of other expenses necessary to running a school. The $0.25 of expenses is generally fixed and grows roughly in line with the rate of inflation.
So, we have about $1.10 of expenses vs. $1 of revenue. That $0.10 deficit is made up primarily through voluntary giving by our parents, alumni and other friends of the school.
As you can see, the main variable expenses of our budget are compensation and scholarship. Tuition increases are directly linked to our ability to increase compensation to our employees and to broaden the availability of a private school education. We believe both are worthy goals, and it is a constant balancing act to further those goals while attempting to restrain tuition increases.

Reader Reactions
Anyone who thinks a good education costs $40,000 a year has my pity. They are the same people who ''can't'' find a handbag for under $1,500 and ''can't'' find a hotel room outside the Ritz.

The fact is there are more than enough parents in the New York area who don't have to flinch at these tuition numbers. They would happily pay more to be guaranteed a spot. Why would any of these schools consider not raising their tuition?
Sam,

For all the commenters who don't live here, I can tell you that you don't get it. As one who's made a conscious, tremendous -- TREMENDOUS -- sacrifice to afford a private education for my kids, I don't regret it one bit. Had my kids not gotten into the school we couldn't afford (but did by both taking on second jobs and by doing without a lot else), we would have moved. Every child should have access to a quality public education. But it takes more than money to get that done. Until New York changes the way it goes about public education at every level, it will continue to fail the majority of its charges.
Amazed,
Bronx
Here's where the 1 percent begin their climb to the ''top.'' After 35 years in public education (kindergarten through college levels), I find the drive to discredit and privatize public schooling abominable!
What's really interesting about public schooling is that it exposes the majority of people in the U.S. to the human side of government, but the latter seems not what most politicians want to happen. Everything private is desirable, and everything public is bad: that's what the political elite want us to believe!
Howie Lisnoff,
undefined
Good God. As long as kids are generally happy and healthy -- and in a reasonably good school -- they are going to pretty much achieve the same wherever they go. The I.Q. they are BORN with is going to put them in a particular achievement spectrum. No extra amount of work and personal attention is going to change the raw material of their native intelligence.
I'm all for striving and excelling, but the mania over it is actually quite destructive of schools, families and, of course, children.
Publius,

I have taught at many of the most expensive elite ''private'' schools in N.Y. But I also have extensive experience with N.Y.'s public schools system, as both a teacher and having attended them growing up. If $35,000 - $40,000 is what it takes to afford all the elements of a top-notch education, then the only outrage here is that our society won't spend that kind of money in the public schools for children of the 99 percent.
BlameGame,
NYC
As a proud N.Y.C. public school grad, I particularly enjoy the academic pedigree of our three current female Supreme Court justices. None walked any of these elite halls. Justice Ginsburg attended James Madison High in Brooklyn; Justice Sotomayor attended Cardinal Spellman in, gasp, the Bronx; and Justice Kagan attended Hunter College High School.

Private school is not only about a bunch of rich folks educating their kids in a bubble. Before I entered independent school in the seventh grade, I was constantly picked on in my high-ranking N.Y.C. public elementary and middle school for being well read and for speaking and dressing a certain way. It was not fun, let me tell you.
I will say this -- for all people say about the so-called spoiled rich kids, I was NEVER tormented in my private school, and I was able to excel and grow and pursue subjects I really loved in addition to the core subjects.
And F.Y.I. -- among the elite professions occupied by my ''helicoptered'' classmates, some of the more privileged ones have chosen to become teachers -- in public schools.

The government does spend $35,000 to $40,000/year on individuals, but not on education, but on prisoners.

HEADLINE: I.P.O. Euphoria, Without Much Memory

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE financial system may not be in great shape, but why dwell on it? Stocks are rising and I.P.O. euphoria is in the air.
Facebook last week gave Wall Street something it really likes: a rough blueprint for the biggest initial public offering of stock in tech history. Instant billionaires and millionaires are being minted -- on paper, at least -- and there are riches galore for anyone able to grab them. Greed in the market is rising, and for some seasoned investors, there is an uneasy sense they've read this script before.
''It's like we're finally emerging from nuclear winter for I.P.O.'s but we've forgotten our history,'' said Harold Bradley, chief investment officer for the Kauffman Foundation and a former executive with the American Century mutual funds. ''If we don't start paying attention, we'll be making the same stupid mistakes all over again.'' 
That history is long, colorful and consequential, dating at least to the founding of the Dutch East India Company in 1602 -- an initial public offering that expanded global trading and led to the colonization of the American island where Wall Street is found.
At their best, I.P.O.'s embody creative elements of capitalism -- specifically, market allocation of capital for productive uses, and transformation of private enterprises into public ones. But hot offerings often foster capitalism's worst excesses -- manias, bubbles and, ultimately, crashes, with exploitation of naive investors.
We appear to be in an early stage in the I.P.O. cycle, says Jay Ritter, an I.P.O. expert at the University of Florida. Facebook's apparent valuation is frothy but ''possibly justifiable,'' he said. ''I wouldn't say at this point that it's a bubble price -- but for this valuation to make sense, everything has to go well for the company for years to come.'' Facebook is being valued as though it will replicate Google's trajectory, he said. ''That's possible,'' he observed, ''but I'm not buying the stock.''
At this stage, Facebook's offering has the formless allure of a lump of clay held by a sculptor who hasn't revealed his intentions. Big unknowns like the stock's offering price remain, and details like its $5 billion size can be revised. No wonder the S-1 filing -- the document Facebook submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission -- is customarily called a ''red herring.'' Like an odorous morsel placed to distract pursuing dogs, it may be largely intended to buy the company and its underwriters time to pursue their own designs.
In its meteoric early growth, Facebook resembles several companies with transformative technology: Microsoft and Netscape, as well as Google. Each is unique, of course. In last week's filing, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder, C.E.O. and controlling owner, highlighted the ''unique combination of reach, relevance, social context and engagement'' that the social network provides its users -- and makes available to advertisers for a tidy fee.
Facebook is also a platform for games like Farmville, from Zynga, and services like music offerings from Spotify. The document revealed that Zynga alone accounted for 12 percent of Facebook's revenue last year. Zynga's shares leapt nearly 17 percent the day after Facebook's filing.
Thomas Vandeventer, manager of the Tocqueville Opportunity fund, has been buying restricted shares of Facebook on secondary markets over the last year and expects to keep buying when the initial offering occurs, presumably in several months. The deep engagement of Facebook's users -- the countless status updates, wall posts and ''likes'' that glue them to it -- hasn't been adequately appreciated by the market, or fully monetized, he says.
Facebook also has room to grow globally. All this is why he says Facebook, like Google, is ''the kind of stock that you want to get in on early and hold for years to come.'' T. Rowe Price and Fidelity funds hold shares, too.
There are skeptics. Karen North, director of the Annenberg Program on Online Communities at the University of Southern California, says many Facebook users are already repelled by what they view as the network's creeping commercialization.
''There is a tension between the intimacy of the service and the efforts to monetize it,'' she said. ''It's not obvious that Facebook will be able to keep growing its revenues exponentially.''
On the other hand, many of the Facebook faithful are likely to crave a stake. Google's co-founders used an auction to put their shares into public hands, instead of letting Wall Street underwriters control distribution entirely. In last week's filing, Mr. Zuckerberg gave no hint that he was contemplating such measures.
Still, Reena Aggarwal, a Georgetown University finance professor, says she expects innovation. ''They could reserve some shares to be sold on a lottery on Facebook itself,'' she said. ''You'd expect something like that from a company like Facebook.''
William R. Hambrecht, who has pioneered I.P.O. auctions, says they ''help put shares in the hands of individual investors who actually believe in a company and intend to stick with it.'' Traditional distribution -- with Wall Street underwriters allocating shares to favored clients -- usually results in tremendous first-day turnover and profit-taking, Professor Ritter's data shows.
From 1980 to 2009, average I.P.O.'s gained 18.1 percent on their first day -- and only 21 percent in the subsequent three years, far less than the overall market. Unless you are lucky enough to get the opening price, I.P.O.'s usually aren't a great deal.
Google has been a glaring exception. Its shares gained 18 percent the first day -- and nearly 400 percent in the next three years, and they've kept rising. Facebook could be similarly successful, but Professor Aggarwal says she won't buy unless she can get the opening price.

HEADLINE: Killers' Families Left to Confront Fear and Shame

BYLINE: By SERGE F. KOVALESKI; Research was contributed by Jack Styczynski, Toby Lyles and Sheelagh McNeill.

 BODY:
PUEBLO, Colo. -- On a summer night not long ago, Maureen White sat alone in her living room staring at a DVD she had avoided watching for years.
On the screen was her older brother, Richard Paul White, the person who taught her how to ride a bike and who tried to protect her from their mother's abusive boyfriend when they were children. He was confessing to murdering six people.
Toward the end of the videotaped police interrogation, Ms. White reached for a razor blade and began to slice her left leg.
''I felt such rage and anger and so many emotions I did not know what to do,'' said Ms. White, 34. When she was done, she needed dozens of stitches and staples. 
Mr. White, 39, will spend the rest of his life in prison for three of the murders, to which he pleaded guilty in 2004. Ms. White, whose life has always been fragile, is still struggling.
Like relatives of other violent criminals, she has found herself ill prepared to deal with the complex set of emotions and circumstances that further unhinged her life after her brother's crimes. Under treatment for anxiety and depression, among other conditions, she has nightmares about serial killers and snipers. She is startled by loud noises and gets nervous around strangers.
And for more than a year after viewing the video, she continued to cut herself -- something she had never done before.
''By cutting myself,'' she said, ''I wanted people to see on the outside how ugly and bad I feel on the inside.''
In a society where headlines of violence are almost commonplace, the families of the perpetrators are often unknown and largely unheard from. But now some relatives have decided to share their stories. In interviews with members of numerous families of varying social and economic status, siblings, parents, partners, cousins and children of convicted killers recounted the hardships they have experienced in the years since their relatives' crimes.
In the flash of a horrifying moment, they said, their lives had become a vortex of shame, anger and guilt. Most said they were overwhelmed by the blame and ostracism they had received for crimes they had no part in.
Yet many of these families stay in close touch with their imprisoned relatives. Nat Berkowitz, the father of David Berkowitz, the New York City serial killer known as the Son of Sam, said he regularly talked to his son on the phone more than 34 years after his arrest. ''I am 101, and it still goes on,'' he said.
A Cousin's Livelihood
On Nov. 5, 2009, 13 people were killed and 32 others wounded at Fort Hood, Tex. By the next day, the repercussions had reached a small law office in Fairfax, Va. The head of the firm, Nader Hasan, is a cousin of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the man accused of carrying out the rampage, and the two had grown up together outside Washington.
''Our phones went completely quiet, dead,'' Mr. Hasan, 42, a criminal defense lawyer, said at a large oak table in his impeccably neat office, where a painting of the United States Capitol hangs above a fireplace. ''It was devastating since we relied on referrals. I lost dozens of prospective clients, and it still happens.''
Internet accounts reported that the two men were relatives. An interview Mr. Hasan gave to Fox News soon after the shooting in which he said his cousin ''was a good American'' created an impression to some that he was condoning what his cousin was accused of doing.
Soon after, Mr. Hasan said, a father in a custody dispute he was handling filed an appeal to a lawsuit against Mr. Hasan in which he referred to him as ''the cousin of the Fort Hood shooter.'' The appeal argued that Mr. Hasan should be removed as guardian of the two children in the case and highlighted his link to Major Hasan.
The petition was dismissed, Mr. Hasan said. But during the first few months after the shooting, he said, he felt such humiliation that he was loath to appear in court. ''We got continuances on a lot of cases until the next year because I did not want to be seen in the courthouse since I felt so embarrassed,'' he said.
The discomfort crept into his personal life. When he returned to a local school where he had been a volunteer assistant wrestling coach since 2000, he said, he was asked to leave because of his connection to the Fort Hood violence. He packed up.
By March 2010, Mr. Hasan's situation was improving. Referrals were on the rise, and his wife was pregnant with their first child. But he was agonizing about staying silent about religious extremism. With a lawyer friend, Kendrick Macdowell, he formed the Nawal Foundation, named after Mr. Hasan's mother, and set up a Web site to encourage moderate American Muslims to denounce violence in the name of Islam. It was not an easy thing to do.
''There was a tremendous amount of family pressure on him to do nothing public, to not remind the world we are related to the Fort Hood shooter,'' Mr. Macdowell said.
Late last year, Kerry Cahill, a 29-year-old woman who lost her father in the shooting, contacted Mr. Hasan to discuss the foundation, whose message she liked. They met at his home for several emotional hours. She said that Mr. Hasan was very apologetic and that she sensed he was burdened. She recently accepted his invitation to sit on the foundation's board.
''We are both angry at the same thing,'' she said.
A Lover's Remorse
Debra Kay Bischoff was not the woman who arranged for Ronnie Lee Gardner, a career criminal with a history of escapes, to get his hands on a gun in a Salt Lake City courthouse, a weapon that he used to kill a lawyer and wound a sheriff's bailiff in a failed escape.
But for the nearly 25 years that Mr. Gardner was on death row for that 1985 murder until his execution, Ms. Bischoff, who is his former girlfriend and the mother of two of his children, felt a sense of responsibility for much of his violence, including a previous killing of a bartender.
Ms. Bischoff cites her decision around 1982 to move from Utah to Idaho with their daughter and son to get away from Mr. Gardner and start a new life. Though she loved him deeply, she said, he had become terrifying to her.
Nonetheless, Ms. Bischoff, now 52, said: ''I felt such remorse leaving. What if? What if I hadn't? He lost it because he lost us, the only people who ever showed him love.''
In a letter she sent in June 2010 to the prison warden and the state parole board pleading for Mr. Gardner's life about two weeks before his execution, Ms. Bischoff wrote, ''You see, he opened his heart to us and then we broke it, and I honestly believe it was too much for him to take and he reacted in violent ways to release his anger and hurt.''
That Mr. Gardner died by firing squad -- a method he chose over lethal injection -- has left her with an even heavier conscience. And she says she has misgivings that her husband of 27 years knows how deeply she loved Mr. Gardner.
''I never did get over Ronnie, and I don't know it ever ended with him,'' she said, adding that she is pursuing a bachelor's degree in social work and volunteering at a youth program, all to help troubled youngsters so that they may have a better upbringing than he did.
Ms. Bischoff, her husband and the son she had with Mr. Gardner, Daniel, 31, live in a one-story house they built next to potato and grain fields in a middle-class neighborhood in Blackfoot, Idaho. Soon after the execution, Mr. Gardner's brother Randy and his daughter with Ms. Bischoff, Brandie, were allowed to observe the bullet wounds in his chest to make sure he had died as quickly as the authorities said he would.
''To look at his face and chest has haunted me,'' Randy said. ''I have night sweats and nightmares.''
As for Brandie, 34, who works at a bakery earning $8 per hour, the fact that her father had been absent virtually all her life has left her bitter and distrustful of men.
''I wanted to be a daddy's girl, but I did not have a guy to raise me or a first guy to love, and that affected my relationships with men,'' said Brandie, who had an eight-year marriage that fell apart. ''I have kept myself walled off so I won't get hurt again by any man.''
Brandie was in alcohol rehabilitation by the time she was 14, she said, and more recently was charged with felony domestic battery after fighting a man while drunk. ''I have been destructive like a tornado because I have been so mad,'' she said. Soon after the execution, Brandie said, she attempted suicide by downing large quantities of pills and washing them down with beer. She ended up in the hospital for about three days.
Less than a month later, she was drinking Jack Daniel's and swallowing more pills.
''The last time I tried to kill myself, honestly, I felt like I was done,'' Brandie said, standing in a bedroom of the worn bungalow she rents on a tree-lined street in Idaho Falls. In her hands was a plastic box containing some of her father's ashes.
A Brother's Fears
Ever since Aug. 18, 2005, Robert Hyde has been leery about what perils may lie outside, beyond his home near the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.
That was the day his older brother, John, long plagued by mental illness, embarked on a homicidal spree that spanned about 18 hours and left five people dead in scattered parts of the city, with two police officers among the victims.
Mr. Hyde had never known his brother to be violent or cruel. He understood that John, who like himself was adopted but from different biological parents, had been paranoid and odd, but he did not think John was prone to violence. Knowing now that John had descended into such savage behavior has changed the way Mr. Hyde perceives people.
''The world is darker to me now; I am more nervous when I go out,'' Mr. Hyde, 51, said as classical music softly played in the living room of his modest Pueblo revival-style house. ''Who knows who else is out there somewhere who could change so drastically?'' he said. ''Maybe anyone could.''
The first time Mr. Hyde traveled after the shootings, on a trip to a lake with his girlfriend, they feared that others there might assault them. ''It was paranoia,'' he said. ''It was a degree of post-traumatic stress.''
Then there was simply the matter of his last name. He was self-conscious when it was called at a doctor's office. His son, he said, a high school senior when the shootings occurred, endured nasty taunts from fellow students: ''Are you going to go Hyde on me?''
Not long after John, now 55, was arrested, he told his legal guardian that he wanted to kill Mr. Hyde and their cousin Christian Meuli, a recently retired physician. ''I was so scared John was shrewd enough to escape that I was prepared to flee from my home,'' said Dr. Meuli, 60. For the next four years, he carried a 3-by-5 index card on which he had written phone numbers and other critical information he would need in case he had to disappear.
Mr. Hyde used to work in the field of substance abuse research and now makes a living selling antiques and other collectibles. He has devoted time to speaking about the need for better access to quality behavioral health care and greater communication between providers. He says he believes that could have made a difference in his brother's mental health and possibly in preventing the crimes.
''I have tried to get more involved in this issue, but I don't have the power,'' Mr. Hyde said. ''My last name is a hindrance.'' A Sister's Guilt
In 2003, life looked promising for Danyall White, another sister of Richard Paul White. After a difficult childhood, everything seemed to be falling into place. She was studying to be a court reporter at a school outside Denver and had a job answering phones for a pay TV provider.
For about a year, though, her brother had been telling her that he had killed women throughout Colorado. But Mr. White, then 30, often ''said off-the-wall things,'' she recalled. She dismissed the morbid claims as fantasies.
One day Mr. White told her that he had fatally shot a close friend by accident, another tale that she considered imaginary.
That was until he showed her a newspaper article about his friend's death. The article said it might have been suicide, but Ms. White, imagining the guilt the victim's parents might feel, decided she should inform the police about her brother's claim. He was arrested on first-degree murder charges. Soon after, Mr. White confessed to killing five women he believed to be prostitutes (though the police found the bodies of only three of them).
Now, Ms. White is grappling with her own guilt. ''It wasn't just the guilt of my brother being behind bars, but the guilt of watching everybody's life falling apart because of what I did, the phone call that I made,'' said Ms. White, 37. ''Some of my family shunned me, and it ate away at me.''
Soon enough, Ms. White said, she found ''a friend and confidant'' who never left her side: alcohol. For several years, her days were soothed by Jack Daniel's and dozens of bottles of beer.
After the arrest of her brother, Ms. White abandoned her studies and was dismissed from her job because, she said, the company told her it could not assure her safety against colleagues' threats and insults.
When her ailing mother died, Ms. White could barely function. She said life's toll since turning in her brother had led her to attempt suicide four times.
In 2010, Ms. White entered an alcohol rehabilitation program and says she had been sober for 20 months before briefly relapsing recently. ''I told no one in rehab who I was, that I was R. P.'s sister,'' she said. ''In sobriety, I have realized that I was taking responsibility for someone else's actions. A lot of the guilt has subsided.''

HEADLINE: With Levees Rated 'Unacceptable,' Officials Along the Mississippi Fight Back

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. -- When the Army Corps of Engineers declared last year that the levees here were ''unacceptable,'' it kicked up a storm of protest from officials and residents of the broad Mississippi River flood plain known as the American Bottom.
Local officials said the corps, shaken by the widespread destruction from levee collapses after Hurricane Katrina, had raised its safety standards to unreasonable levels, overstated the risk and heaped millions of dollars of unnecessarily expensive repair and insurance costs on the community.
Similar disputes have been playing out in a number of cities in recent years as the corps has declared 10 percent of the levees in a new database of 2,200 federal levee systems ''unacceptable,'' including those protecting people in Dallas, Sacramento, St. Paul and Tulsa, Okla. About 80 percent are rated ''minimally acceptable,'' with many of those under orders to correct problems or risk falling into the unacceptable category. Just 9 percent of the levees in the database have been declared ''acceptable.'' 
The battles are a result of a major effort by the corps to fully report the state of the nation's levees. With stimulus money from the federal government, the agency increased the pace of its periodic inspections of the nation's flood control systems and last fall unveiled the new national database, with ratings of each levee under federal jurisdiction. Reports on the much larger network of nonfederal levees are planned as well.
''Unacceptable'' does not necessarily mean ''unsafe'' under most conditions, but the designation signals a heightened risk of failure under extreme flooding. The 65 miles of levees stretching along the eastern bank of the Mississippi here are intended to keep 112,000 acres and about 288,000 people dry; potential economic damages from a serious flood have been estimated at $12 billion.
Still, officials here said they believed that the corps was trying to shield itself from the embarrassment that followed Hurricane Katrina by issuing expensive and unreasonable requirements and oversight. ''Basically, the corps has said, 'We are not going to make those mistakes again,' '' said Les Sterman, the chief supervisor for the Southwestern Illinois Flood Protection District Council. ''It seems to me the risk that they're mostly protecting from is the risk to the bureaucracy, as opposed to the risk to the public.''
Col. Christopher G. Hall, the commander of the corps for the St. Louis district, said the corps had not changed its standards. Instead, he said, improved technologies for assessing risks help engineers get a more accurate picture of the condition of the soil in and underneath the levees. People ''don't like to hear that they have a level of risk,'' Colonel Hall said, adding, ''Everybody lives with some risk.''
Eric Halpin, the special assistant for dam and levee safety at corps headquarters in Washington, says the agency is enforcing its rules more consistently than it had. ''We're going to hold public safety paramount,'' he said. ''The people that work and live behind the levees are the most important thing.''
Local officials worry that the corps's action will cause the Federal Emergency Management Agency to alter its flood maps in ways that would require businesses and residents to buy millions of dollars in flood insurance. The classification of unacceptable also means that if a levee's deficiencies are not fixed and it is damaged in any future flood, the federal government is not obligated to pay for its repair.
''You're going to stop a lot of growth, and you're going to hurt a lot of residents and businesses,'' said Bill Mixon, an insurance agent in East St. Louis who often recommends flood insurance for his clients but opposes a FEMA-imposed requirement.
Moreover, said Mr. Sterman, the local levee official, the corps was hindering the community's efforts to meet the standards required by FEMA to keep it from changing the maps. Specifically, the levee boards want to raise the level of protection to withstand what is known as a 1 percent flood -- the kind of water levels that have a 1-in-100 chance of occurring in any given year.
(It is generally, but inaccurately, called 100-year protection. A flood one year is no guarantee of not having another just as bad the next, and a 1 percent probability translates to a 26 percent chance of a flood occurring over the life of a 30-year mortgage.)
To help achieve that goal, three counties in the Metro East region, which includes East St. Louis, passed a local sales tax, collected since 2009, to provide for the financing of $150 million or more for levee projects.
But the corps is also planning a more ambitious, longer-term project to bring the levees to the full level of safety authorized by Congress: withstanding the kind of flooding that has a 1-in-500 chance of occurring in any given year. It is trying to ensure that its work and the Metro East project are complementary, a goal that local officials say has not been successful so far.
''They are making projects that are already onerous impossible to do,'' Mr. Sterman said. ''It's impossible to get decisions made and get the project done.''
He said that conducting required reviews and writing reports would cost a half-million dollars, and that corps standards were beyond the reach of local financing. ''They say, 'Do it like the corps does it, and it will be fine,' '' Mr. Sterman said. ''We don't want to do it like the corps does it, because it will never be done.
''All we are asking is that the corps get out of our way.''
Mr. Sterman is not the only levee official who says that the corps is adding cost and impediments to levee projects through regulations, or that the local share of costs when working with the corps is too expensive.
David R. Human is a lawyer representing about 30 levee districts in the region. In one project, Mr. Human said, a community wants to add a 10-foot-deep layer of clay along the slope of a five-mile stretch of levee to fortify it against high water.
The town estimated the cost at $3 million. But the corps demanded a review of the project that would take 18 months and cost the community another million dollars -- conditions that Mr. Human said would not have been imposed just a few years ago. ''We're not going to proceed under today's conditions,'' he said.
Despite the local protests, problems with flood protection infrastructure in the American Bottom are easy to find. In the enormous flood of 1993, which inundated nearby Alton, water seeped under many Metro East levees and bubbled up on the other side, carving channels that during later floods have allowed more ''underseepage,'' which can eventually cause levees to fail.
With every new flood since 1993, said David R. Busse, the chief of the engineering and construction division for the St. Louis district of the corps, ''we are seeing the underseepage sooner than what we had before.''
There were also corrosion holes big enough to put a hand through in the steel gates that are used to close off openings in flood walls that roads and rail tracks pass through. Several pump stations were outmoded and in states of disrepair. Drainage culverts had collapsed, and relief wells, which control underseepage to keep it from damaging the levee, are spaced so closely in some areas that there is effectively no room to put in more.
The biggest problem, Colonel Hall said, is age. At 40 to 60 years old, the structures can no longer do what they were designed to do, despite the efforts to maintain them. Colonel Hall said his office was working with the upper tiers of the corps, trying to get ''doors beat in'' and projects moving more quickly. He said he hoped that by working directly with the Metro East levee groups, he was setting a model for doing things right the first time.
The point, he said, is long-term protection that should be measured in centuries. ''We don't build stick homes,'' he said. ''We build cathedrals.''

To the Editor:
In ''Higher Taxes Help the Wealthy, Too'' (Economic View, Jan. 29), Robert H. Frank described how tax increases could result in a better infrastructure and other benefits for all Americans, rich and poor. 
But let's also remember the behavioral economics concept of loss aversion -- the idea that people strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Thus, the resistance of the wealthy to higher taxes may have more to do with giving up what they have rather than gaining a larger mansion.
Loss aversion isn't limited to the wealthy. Here in Wisconsin, public workers protested vociferously when asked to give up some of their take-home pay to cover a portion of health and pension costs.
If the wealthy knew with certainty that their increased taxes would make the roads they drive safer, resistance might be less. Yet higher taxes have generally not been framed as such, but rather as a fairness issue -- that you make too much, so we'll take some of yours to give to others.

HEADLINE: Away Game

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Wilson Chandler was about six weeks into China, and having mostly acclimated to his strange new life, he wanted a tat. But even at 6-foot-8, Chandler had little available real estate -- he already had approximately 100 tattoos, including a tribute inked across his neck to his grandmother Olivia, who raised him in Michigan, which is memorialized on his forearm, not far from the gothic lettering of his nickname, Thrill, stripped across his bicep. So the Chinese tattoo artist had to search before he found a space near Chandler's left elbow. There he slowly etched ''Qian De Le,'' the Mandarin rendering of Chandler's name, into his skin. A few mildly painful minutes later, China was indelibly stamped onto Chandler. 
It is a souvenir from Chandler's unlikely Chinese adventure. He has visited the Great Wall and the Forbidden City in Beijing, ridden the bullet train to Shanghai and begun his own Chinese microblog (a version of Twitter, with Chinese censors) while playing forward for the Zhejiang Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Had this been a normal year, Chandler, 24, a restricted free agent and rising star with the Denver Nuggets, would have most likely spent last summer considering lucrative offers from the Nuggets and other teams in the National Basketball Association. But because of the N.B.A. lockout, and the prospect of losing an entire N.B.A. season, Chandler bolted overseas in September, among the first of several players to sign in China. Then in November, earlier than many anticipated, the lockout ended. Players who signed in Europe or elsewhere opted out of their contracts and returned, like swallows, to the familiarity and multiyear contracts of the N.B.A.
Not Chandler. If the Turkish league or the Spanish league was content to rent N.B.A. players for a few months, the Chinese league most definitely was not. China had demanded its own indelible stamp from the foreign players: a signature on a binding contract that forbade them to return to the N.B.A. before the end of the Chinese season, no matter what. They were trapped.
''I made a decision,'' Chandler told me when I visited him in Hangzhou in the middle of December. ''You make a decision, you live with it.'' The C.B.A. regular season ends on Feb. 15, but because the Zhejiang Lions are likely headed to the playoffs, Chandler's exile will probably last a few more weeks after that.
If Chandler is frustrated by his predicament, Commissioner David Stern can probably sympathize. Stern and the N.B.A. are confronting their own China trap, having misjudged what, for now, is possible there. Not too long ago, the N.B.A. had visions of empire: it formed a Chinese subsidiary, N.B.A. China, and made plans for an N.B.A. league in the country, complete with state-of-the-art arenas and retail N.B.A. stores selling licensed merchandise.
What made all this seem possible, even logical, was that the Chinese league was kind of a joke. I saw this firsthand when I spent the 2008-9 season following the Shanxi Brave Dragons, a team owned by an eccentric Chinese steel baron. The C.B.A. fervently wanted to emulate the N.B.A., but it was more like a crazy carnival instead. The refereeing was often shady, the coaching at best mediocre and the level of play sometimes downright awful. Even though basketball was one of China's most popular sports, several teams struggled to attract more than a few thousand fans. The N.B.A. was far more popular, with higher television ratings and a huge fan base crazy about Kobe Bryant and other stars. The N.B.A. also had Yao Ming, the Chinese center who became an All-Star with the Houston Rockets and was so popular in China that domestic television ratings doubled and tripled for Rockets games.
Those advantages are now fading. Unable to overcome injuries, Yao retired from the N.B.A. after last season and is a part of the C.B.A. as the owner and public face of its team in Shanghai. Television ratings for the Chinese league have jumped, partly because of the added star appeal of exiled N.B.A. players like Chandler, while ratings for the N.B.A. have declined since Yao's peak years. The C.B.A. has also received a boost from its most surprising star, Stephon Marbury, who has proved unexpectedly adroit at public relations in China after his tumultuous time in the N.B.A. Perhaps the N.B.A.'s biggest challenge of all is that the C.B.A. is part of the Chinese government, under the control of the ruling Communist Party.
Foreign companies doing business in China must inevitably navigate the country's distinctive brand of ''state capitalism,'' in which the invisible hand of the market is often hard to free from the tentacles of the authoritarian government. The companies that do best usually exercise patience, maintain a low profile and are careful not to give the state cause to regard them as a threat. When the N.B.A. revealed its ambitious plans for China, it was pursuing the logical next step to expand its already successful business there. But the logic of the Chinese state was very different. As Arthur Kroeber, the managing director of GK Dragonomics, a business consultancy in Beijing, puts it, ''Foreign companies that come in here with announced, large, grand strategies -- as well as these grand statements about what they are going to achieve -- rarely are going to get there.'' Stern and the N.B.A. owners were able to handle the players' union in the lockout. The People's Republic of China is proving much, much tougher.
Jiang Heping is arguably one of the most powerful figures in global sports as the head of China Central Television's all-sports channel, known as CCTV5 and sometimes described as China's equivalent to ESPN. Jiang's office is inside the old CCTV building on Beijing's bureaucratic west side. When I met him in December, it was a delicate moment. He was in a tough negotiation with the N.B.A. over the renewal of broadcast rights, with less than two weeks to go before the opening of the lockout-shortened N.B.A. season on Dec. 25.
''To be frank, I haven't found a solution,'' Jiang told me, conceding that failure to reach a deal would mean a blackout of the N.B.A. on the country's all-sports channel.
Jiang, whose office is decorated with photographs of him with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, seemed genuinely anxious about the stalemate. The problem was advertising: CCTV was demanding changes in an arrangement that for years allowed the N.B.A. to sell a share of ad time during games for its own corporate partners. ''I was instructed from above that we can't maintain such a business model,'' Jiang said, referring to the officials who run all the CCTV channels, which constitute the Communist Party's most influential propaganda mouthpiece.
The N.B.A.'s formal relationship with CCTV began in 1987 -- the year Wilson Chandler was born -- when David Stern visited Beijing with a demo tape in hand. Stern had no idea that China's economy would soon remake the world -- few people did -- but he realized earlier than most that globalization would change sports by transforming games and players into commodities that television could deliver across borders. He made a deal to provide CCTV with videotapes of N.B.A. game footage, sent weekly from New York, in exchange for a share of advertising revenues. Since advertising barely existed in China, Stern later said he assumed he was largely giving his highlights away in exchange for exposure to the vast Chinese audience. Basketball already had a long history in China, having been brought to the country by the Young Men's Christian Association a few years after James Naismith invented the game in 1891 in Springfield, Mass. Nearly a century later, rough highlights of N.B.A. games would begin appearing on a weekly CCTV sports program, and Chinese viewers would get their first glimpses of Magic, Bird and, most significant, Michael Jordan.
By the 1990s, when Jordan's Chicago Bulls were most dominant, CCTV was paying the N.B.A. to show its games, as were provincial and city TV stations. What's more, advertising revenues were starting to materialize, as the games became a popular way for companies to introduce themselves to the Chinese consumer. Today a major chunk of the N.B.A.'s revenues in China come from marketing partnerships with multinational corporations and Chinese companies.
The biggest boon for the N.B.A. came in 2002, when Yao was the first pick in the N.B.A. draft. CCTV5 soon began broadcasting live N.B.A. games throughout the week. Viewership soared, despite a time difference that meant N.B.A. games were on during the morning rush in China. Games between two ordinary teams might draw 10 to 15 million viewers (and perhaps three times as many if Yao was playing).
The N.B.A. had already opened an office in Beijing and inaugurated a series of annual preseason games in China when, in late 2006, Stern mentioned during the Reuters Media Summit in New York that the N.B.A. was also considering having its own league in China. Privately, N.B.A. officials were exploring how to incorporate an N.B.A. subsidiary company as a separate Chinese entity. In 2007, they made presentations to prospective investors and raised $253 million from some of China's most powerful private and state-owned companies, as well as from ESPN/Disney. Goldman Sachs said this $253 million stake represented about 11 percent of the new company, which suggested that the total value was about $2.4 billion. The new subsidiary, N.B.A. China, was announced in January 2008, and in August, the N.B.A. used the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a stage to show off its global dominance. N.B.A. stars were playing for several countries, and more than 150 million viewers watched an opening-round game pitting the American team against Yao and the Chinese team.
Then last year, within a matter of days, Yao retired and the N.B.A. owners locked out the players. ''The lockout was a blow to the N.B.A. brand,'' Jiang told me in December.
The timing of the lockout certainly was lousy for Wilson Chandler. After flourishing with the New York Knicks and being shipped to the Nuggets in the trade for Carmelo Anthony last season, Chandler entered the off-season hoping for a big payday and some professional stability. Instead, he was restless and adrift, shuttling between workouts as his agent, Chris Luchey, listened to offers from teams in Italy and then China. In the early days of the lockout, some of the N.B.A.'s biggest stars, including Bryant, Anthony and Chris Paul, contemplated deals with Chinese teams, including an unconfirmed offer to Bryant of a once-unthinkable $1.5 million per month from the steel-baron owner of the Brave Dragons. The spectacle of China's outbidding Europe for top American talent seemed to be a portent of a new age.
But the top official in the Chinese league is a creature of the old age, an old-school Communist Party bureaucrat named Xin Lancheng, who put his foot down, prohibiting Chinese teams from signing N.B.A. players who were already under contract at the time of the lockout. Only free agents would be eligible -- and they would have to sign that binding contract. This was partly about pride, and arrogance, but it was also consistent with an ethos that has prevailed since China opened itself to the outside world in 1978: foreigners are not invited to China to profiteer; they are invited to make the Chinese better. Even N.B.A. players.
After dozens of telephone calls, and a soul-searching getaway weekend in Miami with Luchey, Chandler chose China over Italy. The Chinese league is a hybrid in the same way China's economy is a hybrid, with some of its 17 teams still owned by local governments or sports bureaus and other teams privately owned by Chinese millionaires willing to spend for foreign talent. The Zhejiang Lions, a privately owned team, offered Chandler more than $2 million, far more than the Italian offer. The Chinese league also played a schedule similar to that in the N.B.A., with three games a week from November to February. Chandler preferred to play more games, because he had lost past off-seasons to rehabbing injuries and wanted to hone his skills. Chandler also was eager to work with the new head coach of the Lions, the longtime Los Angeles Lakers assistant and N.B.A. lifer Jim Cleamons, who moved to China for opportunity as well.
Italy did offer one distinct advantage: if the lockout ended, Chandler could return to the N.B.A. ''We had 15 different conversations about what happens when the lockout ends,'' Luchey says. ''I told him 100 times: 'The season is going to go. There is going to be a season.' '' But Luchey also reminded Chandler that he would be the first N.B.A. player in his prime to sign in China. ''Once you do this, you are going to be a trendsetter,'' Luchey promised. And soon enough, Luchey was right. J. R. Smith, Aaron Brooks, Kenyon Martin, Patrick Mills and a few other N.B.A. players signed with Chinese teams. Martin signed the biggest contract in league history, reported to be at least $2.5 million for the season.
Finally, China had one more crucial thing going for it. ''You have the fan base,'' Luchey says. An estimated 300 million people play basketball in China, roughly the population of the United States. Bryant, LeBron James, Steve Nash, Dwight Howard and other stars have visited China during past off-seasons, promoting sneakers or the N.B.A. or themselves. Playing in China meant exposure in a basketball market that seems certain to become the biggest in the world -- even if how best to capitalize on that market remains an open question.
Yao Ming now lives in Shanghai with his wife and infant daughter, near the city's fashionable Xintiandi neighborhood. He has become involved in a California winery venture focused on the Chinese market and is a spokesman for wildlife conservation, most recently campaigning to return pandas to the wild. He is also studying at Jiao Tong University, taking classes in algebra and English as well as a survey course called Topics in Modern Chinese History. Having grown up inside China's government-run sports system, one of his new priorities is pushing for an expansion of college sports. The C.B.A. still depends on the Soviet-style system that produced Yao, yet that system is failing -- not only in training elite players but also in producing enough players.''We have to build a bridge between the C.B.A. and college basketball that doesn't exist now,'' he told me. ''We need more players and good, quality players.''
By ''we,'' Yao was obviously no longer talking about the N.B.A. Most fans in the United States and even China identify him with the N.B.A., but the Chinese league never completely let him go. When I spoke with Bai Xilin, the C.B.A.'s director of basketball operations, he described Yao as a prodigal. ''He's someone who left the C.B.A. and has come back as an owner,'' Bai said, smiling. ''He's really influential.'' Now owner of the Shanghai Sharks, the team he played for before moving to the N.B.A., Yao had obvious star appeal at a home game I attended in December. When he arrived midway through the first quarter, fans stopped watching the game and rushed forward to snap his photograph or just gawk.
When I asked Yao about the challenges facing the N.B.A. in China, he smiled and teasingly asked, ''Besides losing me?'' He quickly emphasized that his retirement wasn't a ''big deal,'' because other N.B.A. superstars like Bryant and James are enormously popular in China. Still, he agreed that finding another Chinese star would help. ''Of course, that would be the best,'' he said. The N.B.A. once hoped it had found a successor in Yi Jianlian, but Yi has never risen above mediocrity, and the most promising young players currently in the Chinese league are not ready. The C.B.A. has still not found a formula to produce world-class players.
The Shanghai Sharks have struggled to sell tickets, and Yao said that Chinese fans, having watched the N.B.A. on television, are understandably impatient with the lower quality of play in the Chinese league. This is one reason why the idea of an N.B.A.-affiliated league in China made perfect sense. But that wasn't enough to prevent it from being a political miscalculation. Stern's comments at the Reuters Summit, delivered almost as an aside, were quickly picked up in the Chinese media and caught the attention of the man who then ran the C.B.A., Li Yuanwei. A former college professor, Li was known as a reformer who admired the N.B.A.'s business model. I spoke with Li during my season following the Shanxi Brave Dragons, and he recalled being stunned when he learned about Stern's plans for an N.B.A. league.
''He had never said this before to us,'' Li said. ''If he had said he wanted to cooperate with the C.B.A., then that would have been understandable. But he didn't say a word, which meant he knew nothing about China.''
Some C.B.A. officials told me that they wondered if the N.B.A. fully understood Chinese law, which made it very difficult to form a league without approval from the government, which, after all, ran the C.B.A. Stern and the N.B.A. seemed to recover fairly quickly, though, with talk of collaborating with the C.B.A. in any future league. Some sort of deal seemed possible, especially if the Olympics, as many predicted, ushered in a new wave of reform of the country's state-dominated sports system. By the opening ceremony, expectations were rising that an announcement might be coming.
It didn't happen. Months earlier, in an unpublicized meeting, Tim Chen, then chief executive of N.B.A. China, presented a proposal to Li Yuanwei, in which both sides would equally control a new eight-team league under the N.B.A. brand. C.B.A. owners would have the first right to buy a team for $50 million. Li Yuanwei, already distracted by preparations for the Olympics, flatly rejected the plan and postponed any further discussions until after the Games. Instead, when Stern returned to Beijing for an exhibition game, a month and a half after the Olympics, he discussed the N.B.A.'s plans to help develop and manage a network of new arenas across China. ''If we do get to the point where we have that cooperative league,'' he said, ''we'll have the buildings already.''
The N.B.A., however, has largely suspended those grand plans for the foreseeable future, while also stalling plans to build N.B.A. retail stores throughout the country. David Shoemaker, who became N.B.A. China's chief executive in June, said the N.B.A.'s agenda now involves several collaborations with the Chinese league, including exchanges in which Chinese coaches and referees receive training in the United States, as well as a basketball academy in southern China to develop elite players. As for a league? Shoemaker called it a distant possibility, if the conditions are right, and if cooperation can be achieved with the C.B.A. ''We're taking a long-term view,'' he told me, adding later that ''N.B.A. basketball is clearly the most popular sports league in the country.''
Shoemaker said he was now emphasizing the development of e-commerce to sell merchandise, while also expanding the league's thriving online presence, where more and more Chinese fans are watching games streamed on the Internet. In late December, the N.B.A. did conclude a new contract with CCTV5, avoiding what would have been an embarrassing absence on state television. Shoemaker declined to discuss the deal's specifics beyond saying it did have ''an advertising component.'' But given the tough line taken by CCTV officials, it seems very likely that the split in advertising is less generous than it was in the past. As a privately held entity, N.B.A. China does not issue public earnings reports, but Shoemaker said it is ''a cash-flowing and fast-growing company at present.''
Shoemaker did say he would love to collaborate with Yao, whose influence does seem to be growing. Last month, Yao was appointed to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference of Shanghai, which advises the city's government. The position is mostly ceremonial, but Yao is now part of the Chinese state, too.
Kenyon Martin, the former Denver Nugget, was the first to leave China. In late December, Martin's team, the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, allowed him to buy out his contract. His teammate, Patrick Mills, formerly of the Portland Trail Blazers, was released in early January, after the Xinjiang general manager accused him of faking a hamstring injury, a charge Mills denied. The catch for Mills and Martin is that their exile continues: Xinjiang refused to grant them the required letters of clearance, meaning neither can sign with an N.B.A. team until after the Chinese season. Everyone else seems to have gotten the message: J. R. Smith, another former Denver Nugget, opened the season by getting in a public spat with his general manager but has since mostly toed the line while putting up big numbers for his team in southeastern China.
The voice of reason, the man counseling Smith and other frustrated N.B.A. players, is Marbury, the former Knicks guard whose behavior often infuriated coaches and fans in the United States. Having found that N.B.A. teams either no longer wanted him or no longer wanted to pay him what he thought he was worth, Marbury moved to China three seasons ago and is now the country's most beloved foreign player, starring for the Beijing Ducks, professing his love for the country, riding the Beijing subway to show the common touch (and posting photographs of himself doing so on his microblog). Marbury has proved himself a good citizen and a shrewd marketer; he is now promoting his discounted line of Starbury sneakers in the Chinese market. When I mentioned Marbury's name to Bai Xilin, the C.B.A. official, Bai jumped out of his chair and pantomimed Marbury -- Ma Bu Li! -- directing lay-up drills, as he has been reported doing by the Chinese press. ''The other foreign players are just sitting on the bench in warm-ups and don't take part,'' Bai said. ''It looks arrogant, extremely arrogant. He knows how to be part of the culture of a Chinese team and with Chinese society.''
In Hangzhou, Chandler has consulted with Marbury, who told him to stay positive, though Chandler had already reached out to his Chinese teammates. A team in the Chinese league could be compared to a tenuous geopolitical coalition. Each team is usually allowed two foreign players, whose playing time is restricted, because their stated purpose is to provide better competition for domestic players without taking all the minutes. Yet it is a formula that distorts the game: because foreigners make the most money, they are expected to score the most points or grab the most rebounds, which means they often hog the ball during their time on the court, sometimes annoying their Chinese teammates. There are other demarcations too: on most teams, the Chinese players live together for much of the year in drab dormitories, while the foreigners live in nice hotels with room service and other amenities. As a season wears on, resentment can easily arise.
Not long after he arrived, Chandler asked the general manager's permission for a one-night waiver of the curfew and took the entire team, including the team interpreter, to dinner and a night of karaoke. Luchey says he probably calls Liu Hua, the team interpreter (whose English name is Bob), from 3 to 15 times a day. Need to order a steak-and-cheese sandwich for delivery from Subway? Call Bob. Need to talk to the team's general manager? Call Bob. One evening in December, Chandler invited two teammates, Wang Fei and Wang Zirui, to dinner at a Western-style restaurant where the Chinese waiters were dressed in red Santa caps. Bob was absent, so the three players smiled, slapped hands and then barely spoke, instead whipping out their iPhones and typing into their translation apps. Chandler held the phone in his huge hands, pecking away for a few minutes, then handed it to Wang Fei, who read it for a moment and started laughing. Then he typed out a response and handed it to Chandler, who stared at the phone and started laughing.
''They are pretty much regular guys,'' Chandler says. ''Fun to be around.'' He has been startled by how often the Chinese players are required to practice, almost year round. ''It seems like it is the army,'' he says. ''You start when you are young, in the schools, and you sleep at the gym. You are just drilled every day.'' On the court, Chandler averaged more than 26 points and about 10 rebounds a game up to the holiday break for the Lunar New Year. In past seasons, some disgruntled foreigners simply did not come back after the holiday, but Chandler stayed in Hangzhou and practiced.
''We're big on commitment,'' Luchey says. ''When you make a commitment, you stand on it.''
It hasn't always been easy, especially when the lockout ended. ''It was tough,'' Chandler says. ''I was like, 'Man, it ended kind of early.' I wanted to go back and play.'' He has kept in contact with friends in the N.B.A. by Skype and says he grew mopey when players began reporting to training camps without him. Luchey predicted that Chandler would be rewarded with a good contract once he returns to the N.B.A., and the Nuggets seem eager to keep him, maintaining regular contact with him. Depending on the playoff fate of the Zhejiang Lions, Chandler could be back in the N.B.A. by March.
Till then, Chandler will continue to live the relatively unpampered life of a C.B.A. basketball player. His team travels on commercial flights, economy class. Chandler tries to sit on an exit row, for leg room, but twice flight attendants have ordered him to move, on the grounds that he cannot speak Mandarin in case of an emergency. ''It's not bad if you are next to one of the guards,'' he says. ''But it is when you are by one of the big guys.'' One thing Chandler has not lacked during his Chinese exile is public support. After a game, when he walks out of the locker room to the team bus, fans swarm around him, pressing together in a scrum, screaming and shouting. Some foreign players find these crowds unnerving, given all the pushing and shoving, but Chandler just moves forward, signing autographs as he goes.
''They are really good people at heart, prideful people,'' he says. ''They want to be their own brand, own country. Just look at how they didn't sell the C.B.A. to the N.B.A. They want to build their own brand.''

HEADLINE: A Chance To See Disabilities As Assets

BYLINE: By PEGGY KLAUS. 
Peggy Klaus consults with executives and organizations on leadership and communication.

 BODY:
MANY people know of Berkeley, Calif., as the birthplace, in the 1960's, of the Free Speech Movement. Fewer people know that Berkeley also played a major role in the disability rights movement. It was here, also in the '60s, that Ed Roberts -- a student with quadriplegia -- became an outspoken advocate of the cause.
I became aware of this after being invited to give a lecture for the Disabled Students' Program at the University of California. I was delighted and, of course, flattered, but I was also nervous. 
Sure, I'd given workshops and lectures hundreds of times, but this would be my first time speaking to an audience made up entirely of people with disabilities. To be perfectly honest, I'd always felt uncomfortable around disabled people. Suppose I said the wrong thing? Came off as insensitive?
I needed guidance, so I turned to Paul Hippolitus, the director of the program. Reluctantly, I acknowledged my discomfort. Paul had spent 30 years at the Office of Disability Employment Policy of the federal Labor Department before coming to the university, and he had heard it all before.
''Perfectly normal,'' he told me. ''In this culture, nearly everyone is uncomfortable with disability.''
Apparently that goes for those with disabilities, too. Enduring the stares and the obvious uneasiness of others, people with disabilities often feel painfully self-conscious. Not surprisingly, they can lack self-confidence.
His students are not exempt. It's the reason, he says, that many opt to go on to graduate school, thereby delaying the task of entering the work force. Besides the distinct disincentive to work because of a possible loss of federal disability benefits, the students are not nurtured, and are often discouraged, when it comes to career goals.
Today, more than 20 years after the Americans With Disabilities Act became law, the percentage of the disabled population that is employed is only 17.9 percent. That compares with 63.7 percent for people without a disability.
Why the lack of progress? Perhaps some employers fear that ''reasonable accommodation'' of the disabled, as the law terms it, will require extra time, resources and money. That fear, according to the federal Job Accommodation Network, is unfounded; many accommodations cost nothing or run into the hundreds of dollars at most.
BUT Mr. Hippolitus is not waiting for employers. He refuses to watch these talented students give up on careers. He is betting that with the proper tools, they can bring about the change themselves. He has just started teaching a course, called Professional Development and Disability, that focuses not only on the principles and practices of disability employment but also on strategies for navigating the world of work.
Clearly, and especially in this economy, there's a challenge ahead for these students. For them, as with everyone else, nailing the interview is often crucial to getting the job.
Employers are prohibited by law from asking about an applicant's disability. But if the disability is visible, that won't stop them from having concerns. The applicants themselves are under no such restriction, and may find it best to address employers' potential reservations head-on -- a topic that is addressed in the course. This not only serves to pop that awkward thought balloon, but it also opens an opportunity to talk about the skills required to manage a disability, like strategic planning and time management.
To start with a line like, ''You may be wondering how I could manage to travel as part of the job,'' means that job applicants can elaborate on how they manage the rigors of travel, given their limitations. In addition to talking about their work and academic experience, they can offer up ''brag nuggets'' and stories -- talking about the preparations they needed for a trip to Europe, for example, or to make an 8 a.m. class.
As for my lecture, I needn't have worried. The students put me at ease immediately with their warmth and hunger to learn. The subject matter made them feel part of the mainstream of the employment culture, and they saw how their disability could be presented as a real asset in the workplace, in terms of their ability to cope and be full-time adapters.
If more of us can see disability as both a challenge and an asset, the nation will be well on the way to fully using the job skills of all of its citizens.

BYLINE: By MELISSA FAY GREENE

 BODY:
In May 1999, Donnie Kanter Winokur, 43, a writer and multimedia producer, and her husband, Rabbi Harvey Winokur, 49, beheld the son of their dreams, the child infertility denied them. Andrey, a pale dark-eyed 1-year-old in a cotton onesie, held in a standing position by a caregiver, appeared in a short videotape recorded in a Russian orphanage. If the couple liked the little boy, they could begin the legal process of adopting him. They liked the little boy very much.
Four months later, the Winokurs flew to Russia from their home in Atlanta to adopt Andrey, whom they renamed Iyal, and to adopt an unrelated little girl two days younger, whom they named Morasha. All four appear in another orphanage video: the beaming new parents on the happiest day of their lives, the toddlers passive in the arms of the strangers cradling and kissing them. In August 1999, the family arrived home to congratulations, gifts and helium balloons. 
''Sometime after their 3rd birthdays, our wonderful fairy tale of adopting two Russian babies began to show cracks,'' said Donnie Winokur, who is now 55. She is pert and trim, with cropped brown hair and a pursed-lips, lemony expression softened by wearying experience. Unlike bright and cheery Morasha, Iyal grew oppositional and explosive. He was a sturdy, big-hearted boy with a wide and open face, shiny black hair in a bowl cut and a winning giggle. But, triggered by the sight of a cartoon image on a plastic cup, or an encounter with Morasha's Barbie dolls, he threw tantrums that shook the house. He stuffed himself at mealtimes with an inexplicable urgency. In a fast-moving car, he unfastened his seat belt and tried to jump out. He awoke every night in a rage. ''I had panic attacks in the night when I heard him coming,'' she said. ''I assumed everything was my fault, that I was not a good-enough mother.'' In preschool, Iyal plowed his tricycle into other children without remorse, or maybe without awareness. He tried to kiss strangers, or feel their toes. Friends and congregants (Harvey Winokur is the founding rabbi of Temple Kehillat Chaim in Roswell, Ga.) who had assured the Winokurs, ''He's all boy!'' or ''Mine was the same way!'' began to fall silent, out of shared concern.
The rabbi wears a carefully trimmed brown beard, wire-rim glasses and a commiserative expression. ''Iyal's disabilities began to define our family's existence,'' he told me.
We sat in their high-ceilinged kitchen in a suburb of Atlanta on a summer Sunday morning; sliding glass doors opened onto a redwood deck filled with flowers and bird feeders. Morasha, 13, cute and sporty, packed her pool bag for an outing with friends; Iyal, 13, played a video game alone in the den but checked in frequently, anxiously, to know when his mother's crumb cake would come out of the oven. Earlier that day, Morasha played the video game with her brother. In a realm in which they searched side by side for hidden treasure, there was peace between them. ''Iyal, push the green button!'' she ordered. ''The green button! Iyal, steer the canoe!'' He obeyed. But outside this virtual kingdom, he doesn't listen to her, especially when she begs him to leave her alone or to get out of her room. It's stressful for a young teenage girl to navigate middle school with a large inept brother lumbering through the same hallways, the target of gibes and ridicule.
For more than a year after Iyal's 3rd birthday, child psychiatrists, pediatricians and specialists examined him without reaching consensus. Finally he was seen by Alan G. Weintraub, a developmental pediatrician, who noted his small head, the small and widely spaced eye openings, the extra skin folds close to the nose and the way the middle area of his face appeared flattened. When the little boy became anxious during the exam, he began making animal noises/ and tried to escape. He detected scary themes in benign pictures. The doctor's conclusion was a blow the Winokurs had not seen coming: Iyal's brain and central nervous system had been severely, irreversibly damaged in utero by the teratogen of alcohol, resulting in an incurable birth defect. Though alcohol consumption by Iyal's birth mother could not be documented, the available evidence pointed to fetal alcohol syndrome, F.A.S., the most extensive form of the range of effects known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, or F.A.S.D.
It is well known that maternal drinking can lead to neurobehavioral and growth impairments in a fetus, as well as malformations in the face, palate, joints, kidneys, genitals, heart, brain and nervous system. There is no known safe window during pregnancy for alcohol consumption of any kind or quantity, according to Dr. Jacquelyn Bertrand of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. surgeon general calls for total abstinence. C.D.C. estimates of the prevalence of F.A.S. in America range from 0.2 to 1.5 children per 1,000 live births, but this data may represent chiefly those children whose facial dysmorphia render them recognizable; the rest may appear physically typical while contending with hidden neurological damage.
It's possible that as many as one in 100 children are born with some exposure to fetal alcohol. A.D.H.D., learning disability or mental illness are just a few of the accompanying disorders that may be diagnosed instead. Adults who presented symptoms before the syndrome's description in the U.S. medical literature in the 1970s may never have been given an accurate diagnosis.
Iyal Winokur was intellectually impaired and at high risk for a range of secondary disabilities, including poor judgment, impulsive behavior, social isolation, limited academic achievement, unemployment, drug and alcohol abuse, imprisonment, mental-health problems including suicidal ideation, inability to live independently and inappropriate sexual behavior. Few medications or therapies could be recommended as truly effective.
At 7, 8 and 9 years of age, Iyal often babbled a nonstop stream of senseless chatter and baby talk. He required a full-time aide at school and his mother's undivided attention in the house. Donnie put aside her production career. Harvey juggled the needs of hundreds of congregants while facing escalating mayhem at home. But if their friends wondered what their lives would have been like if they hadn't adopted Iyal, the Winokurs would have reacted with horror. ''It's unbearable to imagine our child growing up without us,'' Donnie says. ''We never considered dissolving the adoption! We fell in love with our son.'' Still, she admits: ''Staying in love with him has been trickier. People with brain injuries aren't able to reciprocate love in the ways you expect. You're struggling with this cluster of emotions toward your child -- love, but also anger, bewilderment, resentment, frustration and yearning.''
As Donnie found her footing in the parallel universe of special-needs families, she discovered that a nonprofit service-dog agency in rural Ohio placed autism assistance dogs with children. Could a service dog help Iyal? ''Are you kidding me?'' cried her husband. ''We don't need a dog!'' He felt that one more howl raised under their roof, one more living creature whining for attention, one more source of strife between the children would push him beyond endurance. ''No, Donnie. It's too much. I couldn't take it.''
''This could be the help we need,'' she persisted.
''A dog?'' Harvey said. ''Forget about it, please. It's me or a dog.''
Karen Shirk operates a dog-training school in Xenia, Ohio, a charming antebellum village flattened twice by tornadoes. Dressed in baggy jeans and a man's white T-shirt, swaying deeply as she walked, breathing through the metal button of a tracheotomy tube, she led me into her office at the far end of a brick building that once served as the local V.F.W. Hall. We waded into a crowd of bouncing ecstatic Papillons -- toy dogs whose wide, silky ears inspired the breed's name, the French word for ''butterfly.'' Though she stepped away only a moment earlier, the dozen little dogs rejoiced as if they'd feared never seeing her again: some spun in excitement, others leapt onto her desk and one tap-danced along the computer keyboard. They raised their pointed little faces and emitted high-pitched yips of hallelujah. When Shirk, who is 49, reached her desk chair, they settled on the floor at her feet, folded up their ears like kites and watched her. When she laughed, they took out their ears and waved them around.
As a young woman, Shirk pursued a master's degree in social work and held a full-time job with cognitively impaired adults. She felt, she says, ''carefree,'' until the day she collapsed in respiratory distress and was rushed to an emergency room. Hospitalized for months, she received the grim diagnosis, at age 24, of myasthenia gravis, a rare neuromuscular disease. She left the hospital only to become a respirator-dependent patient in need of constant care.
''Why don't you get a service dog?'' a new nurse asked Shirk, six years into her illness. Supine in front of the TV, Shirk seemed unaware of the hour, day or month. A dog could offer mobility assistance, the nurse said, like opening a drawer and bringing clean socks. She seemed also to suspect that a dog might jump-start the life of this sad and lonely patient.
''How could I take care of a dog?'' Shirk rasped. ''I can't even take care of myself.''
''You could take care of a dog,'' the nurse said.
Beginning in 1992, Shirk applied by mail to service-dog agencies around the country. Every program rejected her. ''They're not going to give a dog to a respirator-dependent individual who will never lead a productive life,'' she told the nurse. Finally she won a spot at the bottom of a waiting list. In 1994, a trainer visited to prepare for the placement of a golden retriever. Shirk began to feel strangely hopeful. But then the agency sent a letter instead of a dog: ''Our guidelines prohibit the placement of service animals with people on ventilators.''
''I didn't care if I lived or died after that,'' she told me, placing a fingertip over the metal knob in her throat to enable speech, in a voice that is winningly husky. ''All I could see ahead of me was a long, slow death. I started stockpiling morphine.''
''Karen,'' the nurse said, ''get out of this bed, and let's go get you a puppy.''
Feebly, she dressed herself in bed and crumpled forward into a wheelchair. The nurse drove her to see a litter of black German shepherd pups, the breed of Shirk's childhood dog, and there she found Ben. ''I didn't leap back into life with Ben so much as inch back into it,'' she said. The puppy had to be taken outside, and to obedience classes. Wherever he frolicked, strangers greeted the tubed-up woman in the motorized wheelchair, as they did not when she was alone. It was a lesson Shirk wouldn't forget.
When year-old Ben graduated from puppy classes, he was a gorgeous animal with a shiny coal-black pelt, orange-flecked brown eyes and a feathery tail. He wasn't a complex thinker or problem-solver. But he was smart, and she loved him.
She acquired a wheelchair-adapted van and commuted to a dog-training school in Columbus, where Jeremy Dulebohn, a crew-cut man from rural Ohio, taught Ben the basics of mobility work: to open and close doors and drawers; to hand Shirk's wallet to retailers and return it with change to her lap; to brace her for balance as she moved from bed to wheelchair and back; and to remove her shoes, socks and jeans at bedtime. ''When I asked for water, Ben opened the refrigerator and brought me a bottle,'' she told me. ''When I asked for laundry, he pulled my clean clothes out of the dryer, put them in a basket and dragged them over.''
Dogs evolved over at least 15,000 years to know and like humankind as well as, or better than, we know and like ourselves. Like many German shepherds, Ben was a one-person dog. He seemed to watch Shirk closely when she returned to her apartment following open-heart surgery. ''I had a daytime nurse but was alone at night,'' she says. ''I was on a morphine pump and -- though I didn't realize it -- a deadly combination of drugs. I slipped into unconsciousness.'' When the phone rang, Ben waited -- as he'd been trained to do -- for Shirk's command to answer it rather than to let it ring into the answering machine. But that night, with his owner failing, Ben picked up the receiver without her command, dropped it on the bed and barked and barked. It was Shirk's father. Realizing something was wrong, her father hung up and called 911. The rescue team told Shirk she wouldn't have lived through the night.
With Ben at her side, Shirk became manager of a day care facility for cognitively impaired adults. Gaining in strength and confidence, with new medications allowing her to come off the ventilator during the day, she wondered how many other people were being told they were ''too disabled'' to get a dog. ''I could start my own agency,'' she thought. ''I could place four or five dogs a year with people rejected by the big agencies.'' She mentioned the idea to co-workers and almost instantly heard from a couple seeking a mobility dog for their 12-year-old daughter, who'd been paralyzed by a spinal stroke. Their impression was that no service-dog agency worked with children.
Shirk studied the Americans With Disabilities Act governing service animals and found no legal impediment to placing a dog with a child if a parent served as co-handler. In October 1998, she assembled a board and founded 4 Paws for Ability, a nonprofit corporation. She rescued Butler, a German shepherd mix, from a shelter; hired a trainer to prepare him for mobility work with the 12-year-old; and became a pioneer among service-dog agencies. ''People started calling from all over to ask, Am I too young? Am I too old? Am I too disabled? Am I disabled enough?'' she says. ''I said, 'If your life can be improved by a dog, and if you and your family can take good care of a dog, we're going to give you a dog.' ''
A couple with a 10-year-old son on the autism spectrum called 4 Paws. This was new ground. Placing dogs with adults with ''invisible disabilities'' like post-traumatic stress disorder or seizure disorder was the cutting edge of service-dog work; it hadn't been widely tried with children. Patches, a rescue-hound mix, became one of the world's first dogs trained for autism assistance for a child.
In 2001, Dulebohn joined 4 Paws full time as training director. Today he oversees an expanding staff of trainers, vets, groomers and dog-walkers. The dogs are a mix of shelter dogs, donated dogs and puppies bred in-house, and every one gets 500 hours of training, well beyond the 120-hour industry standard. ''Any breed can become a service dog,'' says Dulebohn, who is 37, ''but, over time, we found that roughly 70 percent of Labradors, golden retrievers and German shepherds graduated from our program, while only about 2 percent of other breeds made the cut.'' It costs $22,000 to train a 4 Paws dog; clients are asked to contribute $13,000 to the organization, with the difference made up through charitable donations and grants. To date, 4 Paws has placed more than 600 dogs.
For socialization, Dulebohn places foster puppies with local families, and for basic obedience training he places them with specially chosen inmates in regional prisons. ''Convicted murderers cry when it's time to give back their dogs,'' Shirk says. ''But we give them another one.'' Since most 4 Paws dogs go to children -- and children want playmates more than they want therapists and trackers -- Dulebohn asks the prisoners to teach their pups tricks, including ''Roll over,'' ''Speak,'' ''Gimme five'' and ''Play dead.''
''I learned with Ben that a dog helps you make friends,'' Shirk says. ''We place dogs with kids in wheelchairs, kids on ventilators, kids with autism, kids with dwarfism, kids with seizure disorder and cognitive impairments; but if your dog does tricks, other kids want to meet you. Kids will ignore your disability if you've got a cool dog.''
One prisoner with a sense of humor returned a dog who -- upon hearing the command ''Play dead'' -- lurched, as if shot, staggered across the floor, knelt, got up, buckled, whined piteously and then dramatically collapsed.
Cool dog. Lucky kid.
In 2007, a phone call came into 4 Paws from an Atlanta mother of a boy with special needs. Iyal Winokur's doctors had tried 20 different medications without lasting success. Iyal was 9; his I.Q. was 80 and falling; his language was primitive. He got hooked on bizarre thoughts and repeated them endlessly. He still suffered from night terrors and bed-wetting. Sometimes Iyal touched his mother's shirt, sniffed his fingers and tried to wipe off the smell. Aware that a majority of individuals living with fetal alcohol syndrome also fight mental illness, his parents feared impending schizophrenia or psychosis.
''Do you place dogs with children who have fetal alcohol syndrome?'' the mother asked Shirk.
''Never heard of it.''
Donnie Winokur, who had by then founded the Georgia affiliate of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, explained with rapid and precise diction.
''Is your son likely to verbally abuse a dog?'' Shirk asked.
''Well, yes,'' Donnie had to admit, at a reduced speed.
''Is he likely to try to physically abuse a dog?''
''It's not impossible,'' she said, now certain of rejection.
''O.K.,'' Shirk said. ''We'll need a doctor's prescription and we'll need video. We want to see your son every day, everywhere -- getting up in the morning, eating breakfast, getting in a car, at school at bedtime. We need to hear his noises and see his tantrums.''
''You'll give us a dog?'' Donnie gasped.
That night at home, Harvey gasped, too. ''Thousands of dollars for a dog?'' he cried. ''Instead of for a nanny, or respite care, or a private school? Does that make sense? A dog's not going to mean anything to Iyal.''
''It might.''
''You're talking about a dog with a vest like a seeing-eye dog? It will be embarrassing to go into public like that!''
''It's already embarrassing to go into public with Iyal, especially for Morasha.''
''But a dog in a vest will make him seem so disabled.''
''A dog in a vest will tell people that he acts like this because he's living with a disability.''
She wore him down. He loved her, trusted her judgment and knew she wasn't going to give up.
In January 2008, Donnie, her father, her first cousin and her children drove to Xenia for a 10-day class with other special-needs families and their new dogs. In the parking lot at 4 Paws, parents carried, coaxed, dragged, pushed, chased and wheeled their children toward the front door. A circle of threadbare sofas, sunken love seats and canvas sports chairs surrounded a training area in the former V.F.W. social hall. In an inner room, pet crates and pens held dogs of all ages and sizes -- 200 dogs are in training at all times -- while dog-walkers, vets and groomers came and went through the side door. The building smelled fragrantly of dog, with undertones of ammonia.
For children with autism or behavior disorders, dogs were trained in ''behavior disruption.'' For children with seizure disorder or diabetes or respiratory issues, dogs were trained to alert the parents at the onset of an episode, and there have been a few able to predict the medical incidents 6 to 24 hours in advance. (How they do this is something of a mystery.)
''The dogs are nonjudgmental,'' Dulebohn tells each class. ''You've got a kid who's picking his nose? The dog isn't thinking, That is gross. He's thinking, Save one for me! Or your child has disappeared and you say: 'Find Jeffrey.' The dog isn't thinking, Jeffrey's in danger! The dog thinks: Game on!''
About 10 percent of 4 Paws placements fail. ''Some fail because parents weren't prepared for how much extra work a dog would be,'' Shirk says. ''They can barely get themselves and their special-needs child out the door; adding a dog feels overwhelming.'' Others fail because it's not a good match. A family's video may not have reflected the severity of behavior. ''A child looks gentle on his video, so we place a soft dog,'' Shirk says. ''Then the child's violent meltdowns scare the dog, and he starts avoiding the child.'' Dulebohn and Shirk try to discourage clients from engaging in ''the Lassie syndrome'': the belief that a devoted, sensitive and brilliant dog will gallop into their lives and make everyone feel better.
And yet, sometimes, that's what families get.
Dulebohn matched Iyal with Chancer, a big, good-humored golden retriever with ''high self-esteem'' who wouldn't be hurt or insulted by the boy. Chancer was originally purchased as a puppy from Mervar Kennel in Youngstown by a family that lost interest in him; he was returned, after a year, overweight, matted, undisciplined and lonely. Knowing that 4 Paws successfully placed Mervar dogs in the past, Judy Mervar donated Chancer. Like all 4 Paws dogs, he was shown kindness and affection in the course of his training, but he was not offered a long-term close human friendship. ''Once dogs have been matched with families, we pet them and love them, but we don't give them that intense, 'I love you so much, you're my baby' kind of one-on-one attention,'' Shirk says. ''We don't take them home with us at night. Every one of our dogs wants that closeness, is primed for that closeness; but we want them to find it with their families, not with our staff.'' Chancer didn't know what he was missing. But his trainers knew. ''Chancer,'' Dulebohn says, ''really needed a boy.''
The dog's deeply encoded desire to attach to humans came alive when he was introduced to the Winokurs. A shaggy, tawny giant, he panted and wagged with pleasure. Something similar, on the human side, was sparked, too. Morasha dropped to her knees and embraced Chancer's big neck. Donnie felt like doing the same. ''Hi, hi, hi good boy,'' she cooed, stroking his broad handsome head. Iyal was briefly interested but then wandered off.
They were in a hard stretch with Iyal. He was throwing tremendous rages daily, and instantly did it here. ''I'm so sorry,'' Donnie said, mortified, unable to budge the explosive boy from the dog-training circle on the very first morning. But she was among friends; special-needs parents all, they patiently waited for Iyal's tantrum to die down. Unfortunately, on a lunch break in town, Iyal lost control again and threw a fit in the drive-through lane at Wendy's. He crossed his arms, sat down hard and bawled. The backed-up drivers looked at Donnie with less empathy than had the 4 Paws parents. Shirk says, ''Iyal really needed a dog.''
At the conclusion of the second day's class, the families were invited to keep their dogs overnight for the first time. At the hotel, Donnie's cousin took Chancer outside for a walk while Donnie supervised Iyal and Morasha in a hot tub in the indoor pool area. ''When they came back from their walk,'' she says, ''Chancer looked around, and then broke away! I thought: Oh, my God, he's escaping. We're going to lose him. He streaked past everybody in the solarium and took a flying leap into the hot tub. He was saving Iyal!''
Chancer had not been trained to do water rescue. Why he leapt unnecessarily into a hot tub is hard to know. Shirk thinks that after 36 hours, Chancer had bonded to Iyal. The reverse, though, may not have been true yet. Part of the havoc wreaked by alcohol on a child's brain is to scramble the emotional pathways. The routes to friendship, fun, intimacy and love are underdeveloped or buried under cognitive roadblocks. But Iyal's burst of laughter when the big yellow dog came sailing through the air and clumsily exploded into the hot tub was the greatest sound his mother had heard out of him in a long time.
The morning after Chancer's first night in the house outside Atlanta, the Winokurs woke up after a full night's sleep for almost the first time since 1999. They looked at each other in semihorror: was Iyal still alive? They found him snoozing beside the big yellow dog, the latter hogging the mattress. Since Chancer's arrival in the house, they've rarely been disturbed in the night. Iyal may still wake up, but he's evidently reassured by the dog's presence and returns to sleep.
''The moment he walked in the house with Chancer, I knew something had changed,'' Harvey says. ''I could feel it instantly, the magnetism between Iyal and the dog. . . . Chancer was an emotional and physical anchor for a kid who was pretty lost in the world.''
When Iyal is distressed, Chancer is distressed. Unlike Iyal, Chancer knows what to do about it. Iyal rages by crossing his arms, sitting down hard on the floor and screaming and kicking. Chancer unknots the crossed arms by inserting his wide muzzle through the locked arms from below, opening them up and nuzzling toward Iyal's face, licking and slobbering, until the boy's screams turn to tears of remorse or to laughter.
Chancer sometimes heads off tantrums before they start. If a tutor or a therapist has worked with Iyal in the dining room a bit too long, Chancer moves between the visitor and the boy, clearly relaying: We're done for today. From two floors away, he will alert, flicking his ears, tuning in. Sensing that Iyal is nearing a breaking point, he gallops up or down the stairs to find him, playfully head-butts and pushes him down to the floor, gets on top of him, stretches out and relaxes with a satisfied groan. Helplessly pinned under Chancer, Iyal resists, squawks and then relaxes, too. The big dog lies on top of the boy he loves, and seals him off from the dizzying and incomprehensible world for a while.
When I ask Dulebohn about Chancer's preternatural sensitivity, he says: ''We trained Chancer to disrupt tantrums. Being able to prevent tantrums is coming from subtle training within the family. He may be reading Donnie's body language or facial expressions, or he may be smelling some chemical changes in Iyal or hearing some noises from him that predict a tantrum. He feels rewarded when Iyal stabilizes.''
Donnie says: ''Lately, and this is the best yet: if Iyal gets distressed, he goes to find Chancer, and he curls up next to him. He picks up Chancer's big paw and gets under it.'' It's the closest the boy has come to mood self-regulation.
Two weeks after Chancer's arrival, Iyal startled his parents by using multisyllabic words. He was suddenly possessed of opinions, judgments and important questions, and he expressed them.
''B.C., Before Chancer,'' Donnie says, ''which is how we refer to our life then, Iyal echoed Morasha word for word. It drove her nuts. Every morning I asked, 'Do you want to take your lunch today or eat lunch at school?' and every morning Iyal parroted whatever Morasha said. If she said, 'School,' he said, 'School.' With his frontal-lobe damage, decision-making like that was difficult for him. One morning, A.C., when I asked about lunch, Morasha said, 'School,' and Iyal said, 'I'd rather have lunch from home than a school lunch.' It was a more sophisticated expression of his thoughts than we'd ever heard.
''B.C., driving in the car with Iyal, if I turned down an unfamiliar route, he might say, 'What happened?' A.C., sensing I'd taken a wrong turn, Iyal asked: 'Were you distracted by Chancer and that's why you made a bad turn?' That showed an understanding of cause and effect, and a high-level word choice.
''B.C., Iyal never mentioned his disability, although we have educated him about it. A.C., he suddenly started asking things like, 'Did Chancer's birth mother drink alcohol?' and 'Does Chancer have a boo-boo on his brain?' and 'Why did my birth mother drink alcohol?' ''
Before Chancer, Iyal didn't seem to possess ''theory of mind,'' the insight, usually achieved by age 4, that other people have points of view different from your own. But Chancer has inspired him to think about what Chancer likes and what Chancer wants and what Chancer thinks. Only since the dog's arrival has Iyal shown sheepishness or regret following a tantrum, signaling a new awareness that his outbursts may affect others. ''Is Chancer mad at me?'' he asks his parents. ''Mommy, tell Chancer I love him, O.K.?''
''The sad flip side of 'theory of mind,' '' Donnie says, ''is that Iyal is deathly afraid that if he misbehaves too much, Chancer will want to be someone else's dog. We'll be in a park, and he'll tell me that Chancer is smiling at another kid and wants to be his dog.''
The science behind Iyal's cognitive leaps is still in its infancy. Alan M. Beck, the director of the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University's College of Veterinary Medicine, is among those intrigued by it. ''There is a real bond between children and animals,'' he told me. ''The younger the child, the greater the suspension of disbelief about what an animal understands or doesn't understand.'' According to Beck, more than 70 percent of children confide in their dogs, and 48 percent of adults do. ''The absolutely nonjudgmental responses from animals are especially important to children,'' he says. ''If your child with F.A.S.D. starts to misbehave, your face may show disapproval, but the dog doesn't show disapproval. The performance anxiety this child may feel all the time is absent when he's with his dog. Suddenly he's relaxed, he's with a peer who doesn't criticize him.''
The hypothesis is that the sudden drop in Iyal's anxiety level -- the sudden decrease in his hypervigilance, the lowering of his cortisol level and the disarming of the fight-flight physiology -- frees up cognitive energy that he can use for thought and speech. ''A child with a disability feels freer not to suppress his ideas and behaviors when he's with his dog,'' Beck says. ''There's a level of trust and confidentiality he has with no one else. And it's a good choice: the dog is his true confidant and friend.''
Chancer has not cured Iyal.
''From the moment Iyal wakes up in the morning, there's tension in the house,'' Donnie says. ''He has neurological and psychological damage Chancer's paws can't reach. But Chancer mitigates the disability. It's like we have a nanny.''
Last fall the Winokur family wrestled with the likelihood that Iyal was being bullied at middle school. ''Some boys told me to hump a chair,'' he reported to his mother and psychiatrist a few days into eighth grade.
''Hump a chair?'' Donnie said. ''I'm not sure what that means,''
Iyal stood to re-enact it.
''Look at Chancer,'' murmured the psychiatrist to Donnie. As Iyal engaged provocatively with a chair, Chancer rose, distressed. Whining, he tried to block Iyal's lunges.
On another day, a distraught Iyal told his parents that the boys said: ''Go kiss that boy or we'll hang your dog.''
''This is the classic setup for people with impaired judgment,'' Donnie says. ''They're at risk of being exploited criminally and sexually. They can become both victim and perpetrator.'' It may not be classic bullying either. ''Iyal may have pursued those boys,'' Donnie says. ''He desperately wants friends. He doesn't understand personal space or social distance. He might have been annoying them, and they reacted.''
The school principal was instantly responsive; his staff spoke to the other boys. ''But Iyal keeps talking about it,'' Donnie says. ''It's hard for Harvey and me to know if the bullying is still happening or if Iyal has just fixated on the trauma of it. Past, present and future get confused in his mind.''
Chancer doesn't accompany Iyal to school because the boy can't take the reins as Chancer's handler. ''He can't even take Chancer for a walk around the block,'' Donnie says. ''He might drop the leash, and Chancer might interpret that release as permission to track a hamburger. Chancer's an amazing service dog, but he is a dog, and he loves meat.''
If Iyal ordered Chancer to do a wrong or dangerous thing, or to join him in reckless behavior, would Chancer recognize that they were transgressing? Would Chancer disobey Iyal? ''When a dog puts a vest on, it changes his persona,'' Donnie says. ''He knows he's working. In the service-dog world, they call it the halo effect. Guide dogs for the blind are trained in 'intelligent disobedience' for dangerous situations, like traffic. But I don't know if a dog can reason between right and wrong.''
With every passing year, the challenges to Iyal's safety, and to the well-being of those around him, multiply. Iyal's attempts to touch his mother inappropriately are escalating; the Winokurs fear that soon the principal's office will be calling them, rather than vice versa. ''Harvey and I feel like we're sitting on a volcano,'' Donnie says. ''Iyal is a 13-year-old who functions cognitively, emotionally and socially like an 8-year-old. That gap will widen. He will never catch up to his chronological age. And few outsiders perceive the difference between 'neurological noncompetence' and 'behavioral noncompliance,' in other words, that Iyal's doing the best he can.''
Iyal will never drive. He will never hold a regular job. He doesn't understand money or time. Experts say that the transition from adolescence to adulthood is particularly difficult for individuals with F.A.S.D. And Chancer won't be around forever. For as long as they live, the Winokurs hope to make sure there is a 4 Paws dog at Iyal's side; for now, they cannot conceive of a life without Chancer.
Chancer doesn't know that Iyal is cognitively impaired. What he knows is that Iyal is his boy. Chancer loves Iyal in a perfect way, with an unconditional love beyond what even the family can offer him. Chancer never feels disappointed in Iyal or embarrassed by Iyal. Beyond cognitive ability or disability, beyond predictions of a bright future or a dismal one, on a field of grass and hard-packed dirt, between the playground and the baseball diamond, you can see them sometimes, the two of them, running, laughing their heads off, sharing a moment of enormous happiness, just a boy and his dog.

HEADLINE: Time for a Little Luxury On the Land Rover Estate

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
North Windham, Vt.
A FEW years ago, Land Rover found itself in a quandary. Research indicated that a lot of people adored the mystique of the company's Range Rover line of premium S.U.V.'s. But there wasn't any Range Rover they wanted to buy.
The two existing Range Rover models were big, heavy, thirsty and expensive. ''We knew there were people who wanted something smaller, lighter and more efficient, but still wanted it to be a Range Rover,'' said Andrew Polsinelli, the general manager for product planning at Land Rover.
The 2012 Range Rover Evoque is the automaker's solution to that problem. It is also a huge change for the company. With an overall length of less than 172 inches, the Evoque is about two feet shorter than the standard Range Rover. That makes it almost seven inches shorter than a 2012 Honda CR-V, which is not a competitor but a common reference point. With an unloaded weight of 3,900 pounds, the Evoque weighs about 1,600 pounds less than the lightest Range Rover, the Sport. 
The Evoque's turbocharged 240-horsepower engine is also the first 4-cylinder gasoline engine Land Rover has offered in the United States since the 1974 models.
While a top priority of Land Rovers and Range Rovers has always been their potent off-road abilities, the Evoque's bias is shifted more toward on-pavement handling, according to Karl Richards, the principal engineer.
That is a significant change for Land Rover, which -- like Jeep and other companies with a big S.U.V. footprint -- is trying to appeal to a public less interested in off-road adventures and to appease regulators who are demanding much more fuel-efficient vehicles.
The Evoque is also within reach of more consumers, though they still must be rather well-to-do. The least expensive four-door model is $43,995 and the least-expensive coupe is $1,000 more. That is about the same as a heavily optioned Land Rover LR2, previously the company's cheapest model, and roughly $5,700 less than the most basic LR4.
My primary test car was the fancy Evoque Prestige four-door with a base price of $52,395. (I subsequently spent several days in a coupe.) Surprisingly, such common luxury-car touches as heated front seats and a heated steering wheel cost an additional $1,000. The rear-seat DVD player was $2,500, satellite radio was $750 and an ''ebony headliner'' was $275. The total was $56,920.
The Evoque has a distinctive look inspired by, and mostly true to, the LRX concept vehicle of 2008. The defining visual element is a roof that slants down toward the rear.
The interior is suitably upscale and looks best, I think, in lighter colors. With this decor there's no doubt the Evoque is a Range Rover, not a poseur with a badge job. A standard, huge, fixed-in-place sunroof over the front and rear seats provides a luminosity that offsets the rather small windows.
The controls are straightforward, but as with many luxury vehicles there's a puzzling paucity of storage for the inevitable detritus of motoring life. The large roof pillars and shallow rear window require a peek-a-boo approach to lateral and rearward visibility.
The back seat is suitable for a six-foot adult for a short trip. The 36.4 inches of rear legroom in the four-door model exceed the larger Range Rover's by almost an inch. Behind the rear seat is 20.4 cubic feet of storage; the capacity increases to 51 cubic feet when the second row is folded flat.
The coupe arguably offers more style points but less practicality. For an adult, getting into the rear seat means a sequence of indelicate contortions. The coupe also offers a little less second-row legroom and slightly less cargo space. When Land Rover decided to forge ahead with the Evoque, executives figured it could be based on what was then its smallest vehicle, the Land Rover LR2, said Mr. Richards, the chief engineer. But as the engineering team got deeper into the project they discovered that substantial changes had to be made in the LR2's underpinnings.
''In order to get ground clearance and headroom with that low roofline they had to essentially squish all the mechanical bits of the car and create space in the cabin,'' Mr. Polsinelli said.
Mr. Richards added, ''Pretty much everything got changed.''
On mountain roads in Vermont and New Hampshire the Evoque felt more carlike than other Land Rovers, which constantly remind drivers of their towering mass. The steering could use more feedback, but the Evoque feels eager and capable for a sport utility vehicle. The ride remained acceptably comfortable on all but the worst surfaces.
The Evoque performs so well on the pavement that one suspects its off-road capabilities are limited. So I spent several hours traveling some of Vermont's Class 4 roads, which are not maintained by the state. While some can be handled by a careful driver in a Toyota Corolla, others deserve caution -- or retreat.
For such off-pavement duties the Evoque has a minimum of 8.4 inches of ground clearance, and its full-time 4-wheel-drive system is matched with Land Rover's Terrain Response system. By pushing a button the driver can change how the powertrain and drive system respond to challenges including snow, sand, mud and ruts.
The Evoque lacks a low-range transfer case that would slow a vehicle on steep descents. Instead it gets an effective electronic hill-descent system that works with the antilock brakes.
With its ground clearance and network of electronic helpers the Evoque easily handled particularly challenging washouts, mud holes and slick surfaces. Nevertheless it doesn't convey the rugged, confident feeling of classic off-road Land Rovers, which seemed to yearn for rock-crawling adventures.
The engine is a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder borrowed from the EcoBoost family at Ford, which controlled Land Rover until 2008. Rated at 240 horsepower, it works with a 6-speed automatic transmission. In a family of vehicles long dominated by V-8s, the 4-cylinder is an anomaly.
The response at less than 2,000 r.p.m. tends to be leisurely, but is strong and quick above 3,000 r.p.m.
Not all is great, however. On my preproduction test vehicle -- Land Rover could not make a full production version available -- there was a slight drone around 1,500 r.p.m. and a tiny vibration could be felt through the steering wheel. This typically happened when cruising in sixth gear and slowing to continue at a lesser speed. The transmission tended to stay in fifth or sixth gear, saving fuel but generating some dissonance.
While vibrations are not uncommon with 4-cylinder engines, in the Evoque they intrude on the upper-class serenity expected by Range Rover owners.
For an S.U.V., the fuel economy is strong, with an estimate of 18 m.p.g. in the city and 28 on the highway. Premium fuel is recommended.
While a diesel engine is available in Europe, Land Rover says it has no plans yet to offer it, or a front-drive version, in the United States.
One challenge for the Evoque is Land Rover's chronically poor reputation for reliability, as determined in surveys by J. D. Power & Associates. Stuart Schorr, a Land Rover spokesman, acknowledged in an e-mail that the company had ''done poorly on some surveys'' but had made significant improvements. He said the top three categories in which the vehicles had lost points in the latest dependability study were noisy brakes, brake dust and the navigation system, not major mechanical failures.
Despite this troublesome past, the Evoque's immediate future looks good. The company is selling every Evoque it can build at its Halewood assembly plant in Liverpool, England. The plant is working overtime to meet demand.
Mr. Schorr said the Evoque could become the best-selling Range Rover in the United States, passing the Sport. Given the new model's combination of chic style, all-around capability, relative affordability and more acceptable fuel economy, such a degree of popularity would not come as a surprise.

HEADLINE: Honda Civic Owner Wins M.P.G. Suit

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
''Maybe I am Don Quixote tilting at windmills,'' Heather Peters said Thursday in a telephone interview, a day after winning a $9,867 judgment in small-claims court against American Honda for claimed fuel-economy deficiencies of her 2006 Civic Hybrid. ''But I'm hoping that what I'm doing helps the little guy have a better chance at getting justice.'' 
She may, however, have little time to savor her victory. Chris Martin, a spokesman at the automaker's headquarters in Torrance, Calif., said Wednesday that the company would appeal.
Ms. Peters filed the small- claims action last year, saying her car never achieved the fuel economy of 51 miles per gallon on the highway and 46 m.p.g. in city driving that Honda promoted.
''Honda promised me this car would get over 50 m.p.g. ,'' she said in the interview. ''Instead, I'm lucky to get 28 now.''
She added: ''The advertising brochure said, 'Drive it like you would a normal Civic.' Now they say it takes special driving skills to achieve that mileage. I would have never bought it in the first place if they would have told me that.''
The mileage ratings of as much as 51 m.p.g. were determined under a fuel-economy testing procedure that the Environmental Protection Agency no longer uses. Having revised its testing methods, the agency rated the current Civic Hybrid at 44 m.p.g. for both city and highway.
Although several class-action lawsuits have been filed on behalf of disgruntled owners of the 2003-9 Civic Hybrid, Ms. Peters said she had refused proposed settlements, saying they were insufficient.
In California's small- claims courts, parties argue cases without formal legal representation. A plaintiff may sue for as much as $10,000. Under some of the terms of an earlier settlement offer, Civic Hybrid owners who were willing to trade in their car could receive a $1,000 transferable discount coupon or a $1,500 nontransferable coupon toward a new, nonhybrid Honda or Acura. Class members who wanted to keep their hybrids were eligible for $500 coupons, but they could not be used toward the purchase of another Civic Hybrid.
A revised settlement, to be considered by a San Diego court next month, would add $100 to $200 cash payments, depending on the model year.
Ms. Peters formerly practiced corporate law, but had allowed her license to lapse. She said she renewed her license last Monday, in part so she could offer legal services to other owners who might want to follow her lead.

BELOW STAIRS
The Classic Kitchen Maid's Memoir That Inspired ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' and ''Downton Abbey.''
By Margaret Powell
212 pp. St. Martin's Press. $22.99. 
The British costume drama ''Downton Abbey,'' shown here on PBS, is now unfurling in all its magnificence, and I, like its millions of American fans, will again be reminded of what it would take for my life to be truly suitable:
-- Everything brought to me on a silver salver.
-- Breakfast in bed daily, because I am a married woman and that is my prerogative.
-- A steward's room boy whose entire job it is to watch a panel of bells, each connected to a different room in the house from which I might ring for service. Since I live in a 1,500-square-foot co-op, this isn't such a bad job.
-- The soles of my shoes polished.
-- My newspaper ironed.
-- My sheets ironed.
-- My shoelaces ironed.
Until ''Downton Abbey,'' I never realized how many of my deepest desires involved ironing. True, it would also be nice to have a great deal of furtive sex with my social inferiors, preferably in crinolines. But at this point, I'd settle for a crisp newspaper.
I know I should feel guilty about my cravings for these things. But that's the beauty of shows like ''Downton Abbey'' and its venerable ancestor ''Upstairs, Downstairs'': the lives of the gentry are filled with so much intrigue, excruciating protocol and silent suffering that it would be churlish to resent their unimaginably comfortable existence.
And there's another draw for Americans, particularly in an election year. We continue to labor under the delusion that we live in a class-free society -- that social mobility is a birthright, not a remote possibility. If we're not continually upgrading our circumstances, as Newt Gingrich reminds us, it's our own damn fault. We are expected to be ''Oprah''-ishly self-actuating and self-improving, and only sloth prevents us from achieving spiritual clarity and financial success. How perversely comforting, then, to turn our attention to a world where you will die where you are born and where the heroes are the rare overachievers who work their way up to butler from footman.
The merchant class, which is to say the publishing industry, is mining the popularity of ''Downton Abbey'' with the release and re-release of two books that inspired the show, and the inevitable companion volume to the TV series (inevitably titled ''The World of Downton Abbey''). One memoir is written from the point of view of upstairs, one from downstairs. See if your keen discerning eye can spot the difference:
''Highclere was a symbiotic system, and mutual respect was the key to its success. The fifth Earl prided himself on an Old World courtesy, and that set the tone for the entire household. He took an interest in the well-being of the staff and the cottagers on the estate; often a donation would be made towards a fund for a tenant whose livestock had died, and money was also made available for the staff to have medical treatment.''
''On Christmas Day after breakfast all the servants had to line up in the hall. . . . Mr. and Mrs. Cutler, and the daughter and the grandchildren, were assembled complete with Christmas smiles and social welfare expressions. The children looked at us as though we were beings from another world. . . . When we got to the Christmas tree we deferentially accepted the parcels that were handed to us by the children, and muttered, 'Thank you, Master Charles, thank you, Miss Susan.' ''
The first selection, from ''Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey,'' is written by the former fashion designer Fiona Aitken, now the eighth Countess of Carnarvon. She and her husband, the earl, are the current residents of Highclere, the 1,000-acre Hampshire estate that, not surprisingly, resembles Parliament, considering they share an architect, Charles Barry. Highclere is also the filming location of ''Downton Abbey.''
The countess's book tells the story of the beautiful and diminutive ''Pocket Venus,'' Almina Victoria Marie Alexandra Wombwell, who lived at Highclere from 1895 to 1923 with her husband, George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, fifth Earl of Carnarvon. He is best known as the co-discoverer of King Tutankamen's tomb -- after a series of expeditions financed by Almina. Because, like many aristocratic families of the time, the Carnarvons were long on lineage and short on cash. So he did what every self-respecting gadabout did: look for an heiress who could rescue him, and his family pile, from ruin.
Enter Almina, for Burke's Peerage the child of Capt. Frederick Charles Wombwell and Marie Boyer but rumored to be the illegitimate daughter of Sir Alfred de Rothschild. A director of the Bank of England for 20 years and the first Jew ever to hold that position, Rothschild doted on his ''godchild'' and made it known that he was prepared to give her a ''fortune'' on her marriage. He also wanted to solidify both her standing in society and his own. He paid up Lord Carnarvon's debts and settled on her a sum of $:12,000 (roughly $1.5 million in today's currency) a year. Almina proceeded to turn Highclere into a social epicenter of Edwardian England.
When World War I broke out, the perfect society lady became the perfect nurse, opening her home to the wounded and transforming it into a hospital. Loyal servants who wanted to go off and fight were promised that their jobs would be available upon their return. Does oblige ever get more noblesser? When Lord Carnarvon died, allegedly of a mosquito bite and blood poisoning, a pall fell over the dozens of grieving servants. At least this is the eighth countess's story. Almina was a woman of great charm and courage, and the family universally beloved.
This account differs somewhat from that in a biography of Lady Almina that came out last year. William P. Cross's ''Life and Secrets of Almina Carnarvon'' tells of a woman who traded her money for a prestigious but arid marriage, took lovers young and old (including her husband's best man) and burned through Rothschild's dowry, leaving her feckless son enraged and penniless when he finally inherited the estate. Lady Almina did, in fact, open her home to the wounded, and went on to open a series of tony nursing homes (and discreet abortion clinics) for the rich and famous. But the homes never paid for themselves, and she and her second husband, a military officer named Ian Dennistoun, whom she married a few months after Lord Carnarvon's death, ended up in bankruptcy court. Almina died in greatly reduced circumstances in Bristol in 1969, at the age of 93.
I suspect the real story of the relationship of servants to their masters is more accurately told by Margaret Powell, in her simple and quite brilliant ''Below Stairs.'' Here she throws the last shovel of dirt on the myth of the devoted help and their unfailing love and respect for the stately home. Powell notes that G. K. Chesterton ''wrote about the malignity of inanimate objects,'' and then adds that she thinks ''they are malign because they take up so much of my time dusting, polishing and cleaning them.''
First published in England in 1968, Powell's memoir was an inspiration for the classic television series ''Upstairs, Downstairs.'' She recalls her years ''in service'' from the time she was a desperately poor girl from a family of seven, growing up in a few rented rooms in Hove, to her years working long days as a kitchen maid and eventually cook in the houses of the good and the great. Apparently she was sufficiently immune to the charms of her employers to seek escape through marriage, children and higher education. ''Below Stairs'' was a hit, and Powell went on to write other books about her experiences. But perhaps none were quite so powerful as this one, which describes in simple and often excruciating detail the divide between Us and Them. ''We always called them 'Them,' '' Powell writes. '' 'Them' was the enemy, 'Them' overworked us, and 'Them' underpaid us, and to 'Them,' servants were a race apart, a necessary evil.'' In those carefree days before nondisclosure agreements, it was assumed by everyone that ''what they upstairs did, although it was a subject of scandal and gossip and laughter, was their privilege. Not because they were better than us, but because they had money and it was no good having money if you couldn't deviate from the norm.''
What makes Powell such a credible narrator is the fact that she's never reflexively bitter or nasty. When she worked for a family that treated her with kindness and without condescension, she was deeply grateful and desperate to please. These families were rare. More common were those that showed their utter disregard for the servants by practicing necessary ''economies'' on the staff, monitoring their food and furnishing their rooms with broken castoffs. As the arbiters of morality for the help, a girl's employers could dismiss her for paying too much attention to her appearance, since there was a slippery slope from wearing makeup to having an out-of-wedlock child (cause for immediate dismissal, of course, without pay and indeed, usually, without anyplace to go). In one home, Powell was excoriated for passing the day's mail to the lady of the house by hand: ''Tears started to trickle down my cheeks; that someone could think that you were so low that you couldn't even hand them anything out of your hands without it first being placed on a silver salver.''
Well. It made me kind of rethink my whole silver salver fantasy. Though I still want my sheets ironed.
All these years later, ''Below Stairs'' retains its peculiar fascination. Powell does nothing to romanticize poverty or domestic service, and considers the few servants who Stockholmishly identified with their masters as jack/asses. But she also makes us understand that service could be tolerable and, in some cases, almost pleasant. There's a certain freedom from stricture, at least in your life outside work, and a certain pleasure in knowing you're a capable person, while the people you serve are not.
Later in her career, Powell had occasion to work for older ladies in reduced circumstances -- perhaps ladies like Lady Almina. ''I can't help thinking that people who were once wealthy and now have to live on a fixed income are worse off than ordinary working-class people,'' she observes, while ''people who are living on fixed incomes like these old ladies have got to keep on trying to keep up some sort of show.'' And that, perhaps more than anything, is what united servant and master. Not love, not admiration, not even fear -- but a certain measure of pity. That man standing at attention in the white gloves may be feeling just a little bit sorry for you.

HEADLINE: The Hidden Homeless

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
ON the sixth day she was homeless, Tonya Lewis overslept. She woke in the dark, in Room 6E at the 93rd Avenue Family Residence, a privately run shelter in Jamaica, Queens. It was 4:45 a.m. She was already running late.
Rousting her children -- Unique, 15, and Jacaery, 2 -- from their beds, Ms. Lewis got them dressed and started shoving DVDs and diapers into two bulging tote bags. When the boys were ready -- sleepy, sullen, hoodied, backpacked, in hats and winter jackets -- she pushed them out the door (''Come on, we gotta go!'') to begin their daily routine.
It went like this: 
They took the Q54 bus five stops to the J train. They took the J train 14 stops to Broadway Junction station. Unique hopped off and transferred to the C train, then the S train, then walked a distance to his classes at the High School for Global Citizenship in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. Ms. Lewis, with Jacaery (pronounced Juh-CARE-ee) still in tow, transferred from the J to the L train. She took the L to the B6 bus in Brooklyn, which she rode to East New York, where she worked for an hour, and then reversed course -- the B6 to the L to the J -- to get Jacaery to his day care center in Bedford-Stuyvesant by 9.
All told, the odyssey required four hours, six trips on the subway and three trips on the bus, and suggests the changing nature of homelessness in New York. Unlike in the 1980s, when the crisis was defined by AIDS patients or men who slept on church steps, these days it has become more likely that a seemingly ordinary family, rushing about on public transportation with Elmo bags and video games, could be without a home.
Of New York's more than 40,000 homeless people in shelters -- enough to fill the stands at Citi Field -- about three-quarters now belong to families like the Lewises and are cloaked in a deceptive, superficial normalcy. They do not sleep outside or on cots on armory floors. By and large, their shoes are good; some have smartphones. Many get up each morning and leave the shelter to go to work or to school. Their hardships -- poverty, unemployment, a marathon commute -- exist out of sight.
Underlying this transition is a cascade of events, both economic and political. For the past three years, city officials say, 30 percent of New Yorkers seeking shelter have done so because of evictions, many connected to the financial crisis. (Domestic violence and overcrowding were other chief reasons.) At the same time, a disagreement over money between city and state officials last spring led to the cessation of a rent-subsidy program designed to shift the homeless from shelters into apartments. For the first time in 30 years, there is no city policy in place to help move the homeless into permanent homes.
MS. LEWIS, a health care aide, was evicted last month from her home in Far Rockaway, Queens. She was working full time for Able Health Care Services of New York, making about $500 a week tending to an autistic man. In August, because of cuts in Medicaid, her hours were reduced by half. Six weeks ago, she separated from her husband, Gregory Pitters, a maintenance man, who, before he lost his own job, earned $600 a week. On top of this, the $1,000 rent subsidy Ms. Lewis was receiving from the city, through the now-defunct program Advantage, ran out. Her apartment, a small two-bedroom, rented for $1,200 a month. She now makes $210 a week. She owes her landlord $4,280. The problem was mathematical, she said: ''I can't afford the rent.''
She was in Brooklyn, on Halsey Street and Broadway, where Jacaery was in tears, when she said this. He often throws a tantrum when his mother leaves him at day care. At the center, a cheerful place with cubby holes and construction-paper cutouts, an attendant flung Jacaery over her shoulder. He wept and wailed and kicked his legs as his mother walked away.
At 38, Ms. Lewis has three sons with three men. She rarely sees the father of her oldest child, Tarrick, who is 19 and lives in Brooklyn with her mother, Delores Lewis, and one of her younger brothers. Unique's father died years ago and, as a rule, is not discussed. Ms. Lewis said she hoped to work things out with Mr. Pitters, Jacaery's father, who is living with his mother in the Bronx. ''We're in this situation partly because of him,'' she said. ''He apologized. But like I said, 'Apologies are not acceptable right now.' ''
She was back on Broadway, headed for her agency's office, when her cellphone rang. It was a former boyfriend, Gary Wade, who was recently released from the Dutchess County jail. Mr. Wade wanted to meet Ms. Lewis at the Halsey Street J stop; at the station, he demanded her assistance in tracking down a lawyer who had represented him before he went to jail. The lawyer had his watch, he said, and his ''very expensive Cartier glasses.''
Ms. Lewis bought Mr. Wade a MetroCard, hoping he might go away. Instead, he tagged along as she ran errands: dropping off her timecard in Downtown Brooklyn and riding the A train to the end of Queens, where she visited a welfare office to pick up documents she needed for a new apartment.
On the train, she briefly fell ill, sweating, breathless. Mr. Wade ignored her.
He refused to leave until someone bought him lunch. It was 12:30 p.m. Ms. Lewis could not get rid of him.
THERE was a time when the shelter system in New York was unquestionably Dickensian. Families slept overnight on benches at the Emergency Assistance Unit, a notorious intake office in the Bronx. Many were placed in rat-infested welfare hotels. A vicious legal battle between the city and advocates left even picayune details of shelter operation -- the availability of milk-bottle warmers, for example -- up to the courts.
These days, families seeking shelter appear at the Prevention Assistance and Temporary Housing Office, a gleaming modern building, also in the Bronx, with artwork on the walls and an airport-like ''departure lounge.'' Advocates say that policies put in place by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg have made it harder to gain entrance to the system, but for those who do get in, the intake process generally lasts 6 to 10 hours, and most families find a place the day they apply. One-third end up in city-run shelters, including some hotels, another third are placed in privately run facilities, like the one the Lewises entered in Queens, which has 54 units, each about 700 square feet, each with its own kitchen and bathroom.
A family stays in a shelter an average of nine months, but there is no restriction on the length of stay. Rules encourage people to move on: families are not allowed to bring in their own furniture or decorate the walls. The city tries to place families near parents' jobs and children's schools, but it does not always succeed. On the ground floor of the shelter that housed the Lewises is an office where caseworkers help residents manage welfare benefits and improve their resumes in hopes of finding better work.
The problem is: How do families get out of a shelter once they get there?
In 2004, Mr. Bloomberg announced an ambitious plan to reduce homelessness by two-thirds over five years by building housing units, by putting more restrictions on those trying to enter the system and, most controversially, by no longer giving homeless families priority in receiving public housing or what is known as Section 8 assistance, which gives people federal vouchers under which they pay no more than 30 percent of their income for privately rented apartments.
At the time, officials said that other New Yorkers at risk of being homeless -- the disabled, for example, or former foster children -- should have first claim on available public housing. (Each year, 5,000 to 6,000 public-housing units turn over and are sought by more than 100,000 people on a seven-year waiting list.) They also said that because Section 8 vouchers were in short supply, families were entering shelters as a shortcut to obtaining them. Once the practice ended, the argument went, the number of homeless people entering the system would decrease.
That didn't happen. At 40,000 people, New York's shelter population is higher than it has ever been. (In 2001, when it hit 25,000, the city's commissioner of homeless services was quoted in The New York Times as calling it ''a temporary crisis.'') On any given night, 6,000 homeless men and 2,000 homeless women bed down in facilities for single people, and an additional 15,000 parents and 17,000 children sleep in family shelters. Then there are the individuals living on the streets whom the city counted last week in its annual Homeless Outreach Population Estimate. (The numbers will be available in March.)
In place of Section 8 priority, Mr. Bloomberg established the Housing Stability Plus program, which provided five years of rent subsidies that declined in value 20 percent each year. In 2007, he introduced Advantage, which Ms. Lewis was using. The $140 million-a-year program offered two-year subsidies of about $1,000 a month, but only if recipients received job training or worked. The state and federal governments supplied two-thirds of the financing for Advantage, while the city administered it.
''I don't believe for a second that every family in shelter needs a permanent housing subsidy,'' said Robert V. Hess, who served as the commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services from 2006 to 2010. ''What many people need is an opportunity to get back on their feet and develop their own income. Over time, they can build savings and move into their own homes.''
In June, however, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, citing budget problems, cut the state's financing for Advantage, and because the city would not pick up its portion, the program was discontinued. Among those arguing for the end of Advantage was the Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy group that has long supported homeless people. While it might seem counterintuitive, the coalition lobbied against Advantage in hopes of pushing the city into again offering the homeless priority for public housing and Section 8 vouchers, of which about 4,000 become available each year.
The situation has led to litigation. The Legal Aid Society sued the city in 2011 to prevent it from ending benefits for the last 8,000 families still enrolled in Advantage. On Friday, a judge lifted an injunction that had forced the city to keep paying benefits. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for this week.
Recriminations have come from both sides. The coalition has attacked Mr. Bloomberg for his ''punitive mind-set.'' The city has, in turn, accused the coalition of being blinded by a kind of advocate's myopia -- for missing the forest of New York's budget woes and its numerous needy groups for the trees of homelessness.
The way forward will inevitably pass through a narrow gap of politics. Seth Diamond, the city's current homeless services commissioner, said the answer lay in raising wages and perhaps in loosening building codes in order to house more people in apartment buildings. He described his philosophy as one of ''professional compassion'' married to ''a reciprocal obligation to participate in your own success.''
''When you come into shelter,'' he said, ''there should be a period of time to get stabilized, but pretty quickly after that, you should be working aggressively on getting back to the community.''
Ms. Lewis said something similar on her third day in the shelter: ''It's a nice little place, you know. Some people could get comfortable here. Not me. I'm not staying long. That's not my plan.''
IT was 4 p.m. Mr. Wade was finally gone. Ms. Lewis took the A train to the J train and fetched Jacaery from day care. She went to her mother's house to find Unique. He wasn't there, but Mr. Pitters was.
Unique had gone to his godmother's house after school and had told Ms. Lewis he would meet her at her mother's. Ms. Lewis waited. One hour. Two. Nothing. She left. ''He'll find his way back eventually,'' she said.
Earlier, she had talked about the boys and the effect on them of a condition she does not describe with its common-noun name. (She employs vague phrases: ''the situation'' or ''what's going on right now.'') Jacaery, she said, was not aware of what was happening: ''He just gets along. He's mellow.'' As for Unique, he brushed it off with manufactured toughness.
He is a 15-year-old man: brooding looks, tired smiles, terse responses.
How was school? ''Fine.''
How is taking care of your little brother? ''Fine.''
How are you handling ''the situation''? A frown, a shrug. ''What am I supposed to do?''
7:15 p.m.: the J train to the Q54 bus. Ms. Lewis and Jacaery walked down 170th Street in Queens in the dark. Mr. Pitters accompanied them from Delores Lewis's house. He did not say much. (Later, he would say: ''We're trying to work it out.'') At 8 p.m., the family, as it were, split up on the shelter's steps. Mr. Pitters was not allowed inside.
The lighted lobby, the sign-in book, an elevator to the sixth floor. In Room 6E, the impression of transition: bare walls, three beds, empty space. A loaf of bread, a box of crackers, a jar of peanut butter in the kitchen. A suitcase in the closet. The tote bags were unloaded. Out came Apple Jacks and Frosted Flakes, bought for the morning. Out came Jacaery's security blanket -- his mother's old silk dress. He watched a DVD, ''Daddy Day Care.''
Ms. Lewis read a letter from the city telling her she might be moved to a Brooklyn shelter. It was closer to everything, her job, the day care center, Unique's school. She didn't want to go. She liked it here. It was clean, familiar.
''It's not as bad as it seems,'' she said. ''It's O.K.''

HEADLINE: Sorry to Break It To You . . .

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
I remember the first time I interviewed a relatively unknown economist named Nouriel Roubini. It was 2005, and as we sat in his New York University office, he laid out his scary vision of the future. Roubini is a specialist in the flow of money around the world and the crises that (sometimes) result. But on that day he wanted to talk about the U.S. housing market.
Homeowners, he said, had become too used to financing their lifestyles with money siphoned from overvalued homes. This housing bubble would pop, he warned, and send the world into a vicious recession, possibly even a depression. I remember leaving his office both stunned and confused. Only after calling a few leading economists was I reassured that this Roubini guy was expressing a fringe view that merited little attention. Like a lot of reporters that year, I turned around a tongue-in-cheek story about Dr. Doom and his scary (but probably best ignored) world view. Oops! 
A few years later, I interviewed Richard Wolff, who is probably America's most prominent Marxist economist (though it's not a hugely competitive field). Wolff also walked me through his view of the next few years. He explained that the puncturing of the housing bubble, then apparent, would lead to a crisis much deeper than anyone understood: it would fracture American confidence in capitalism; the economy would stay stalled for a long time; and there would be global chaos. This time, I didn't even bother calling other economists to check out Wolff's story. The guy was a Marxist! Days later, Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Once the crisis hit, it became popular to scour the past for apocalyptic predictions that had come true. While many gloomy forecasts came from the left -- notably Paul Krugman and Dean Baker -- there was one particularly prescient voice from the right. As early as 2004, Peter Schiff, a libertarian investor, was arguing that the housing-fueled economic boom was a bubble waiting to burst.
But these successful prognosticators, among others, didn't just take a bow in 2008. Many predicted that the U.S. economy would worsen or, at best, stall. Perhaps grasping for hope, many smart people, including, apparently, President Obama, spent 2009 thinking those doomsday callers had just been lucky. Maybe they were right about the crisis, but they were surely far too pessimistic about the recovery. Oops again!
For nearly a decade, it turns out, the most accurate forecasts have come from the fringe. So it's upsetting to learn that many of those same Cassandras now believe, for different reasons, that we are on the brink of another catastrophe that may be far worse. Wolff, the Marxist, fears that China may be entering a significant slowdown, which, combined with Europe's all-but-inevitable recession, could send the world into an economic tailspin.
Roubini, now one of the world's most visible economic thinkers, has a similar view, though he sees the timing differently, with the worst coming in 2013 or 2014, when China will face a situation like the one the United States experienced in 2008. Its banks, he says, will reveal huge investments in nonsensical bubble projects. The world will question China's solvency, and the subsequent chaos will destroy whatever fragile recovery is under way. Schiff also paints a dire picture, but for essentially the opposite reason, saying America's indebtedness and currency policy will cause another crash.
It's much less lonely being a doomsayer these days. Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins, says there's a 50 percent chance of a recession this year. Lakshman Achuthan, of the eerily accurate Economic Cycle Research Institute, predicts a return of double-digit unemployment. They are downright rosy compared to George Soros, who has warned of violent riots throughout the world and a possible total global financial collapse. I really hope these guys are wrong.
After all, they're not infallible. In 2005, Roubini's dark view was fairly vague -- something bad was going to happen (either quickly and painfully, or slowly and not so bad) between then and 2025. And one specific aspect of his forecast -- that U.S. Treasury-bond interest rates would skyrocket and set off a panic -- never actually happened. Schiff and Wolff can't both be right, because their core views pretty much cancel each other out. And anyway, they've all been predicting turmoil for ages.
The economy is so complex that any forecaster must construct a simplified model that is an inexact fit for reality. Some models explain some periods better than others, but no model explains everything correctly. Choosing just one can be like choosing a religion -- you ignore the faults in your own belief system and don't pay much attention to the good ideas in someone else's.
The problem is that there's no perfect model. It's clear now that even the mainstream view can be shockingly incompetent. The widely held consensus just before the crisis went something like this: the Fed, through the visionary leadership of Alan Greenspan, had figured out how to get permanent, healthy economic growth without fear of inflation. Globalized trade and finance had spread risk widely. Forget forecasts; we couldn't even nail the present.
The mainstream view now reflects more gloom. The Blue Chip forecast -- the average of 50 top economic prognosticators -- predicts that the United States and world economies will inevitably recover. But the growth won't necessarily feel like growth -- it will be slow, and millions will stay unemployed for many years. The big difference is that in 2006, most were blind to the impending disaster. Now it's all we can see. The most fringe forecaster today might be the relatively unknown economist Ed Yardeni, who says that corporation are about to start spending again and that the economy will start growing at a healthy clip. Let's hope that the fringe is right.
Deep Thoughts This Week:
1. Many fringe forecasts have been pretty accurate over the past decade.
2. We should listen to them.
3. Sort of.
4. How can you predict the future when there is so much disagreement about the present?

POSER: My Life in Twenty-Three Yoga Poses, by Claire Dederer (Picador, $15.) Dederer, an essayist and book critic, began doing yoga to alleviate back pain and anxiety, and because ''I wanted other people to admire my goodness.'' She also found an elegant structure for her memoir, in which she uses yoga positions (downward dog, triangle, headstand) to reflect on her strained marriage, the travails of hyperparenting, and her own fraught childhood. 
CANTI,by Giacomo Leopardi. Translated and annotated by Jonathan Galassi. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) In this translation Leopardi, the great 19th-century Italian poet, runs the entire vocal range, from public outrage (''On the Monument to Dante Being Erected in Florence'') to private murmur (''Aspasia''). Galassi, a poet himself, has also translated the major works of the Nobelist Eugenio Montale in COLLECTED POEMS: 1920-1954 (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $30), an allusive paean to the seedy but meaningful edges of modern life.
J. D. SALINGER: A Life, by Kenneth Slawenski (Random House, $17.) Slawenski's reverent biography unearths and aggregates the facts -- Salinger (1919-2010) was almost as famous for his reclusiveness as for his writing -- and reads them into the fiction. Among the book's achievements is its evocation of the horror of Salinger's experiences in World War II.
THE REVENGE OF THE RADIOACTIVE LADY, by Elizabeth Stuckey-French (Anchor, $15.) In this darkly funny novel, 77-year-old Marylou Ahearn's daughter long ago died of cancer as a result of a government-sponsored cold war medical experiment. Out for blood, Marylou tracks down the physician who in 1953 conned her into taking a prenatal radioactive potion.
HIGH ON THE HOG, by Jessica B. Harris (Bloomsbury, $17.) Harris, a food historian and cookbook author, traces how African slaves, thrust into a strange land, carried with them the taste memories, cooking techniques and agricultural practices of their homelands and transformed the way Americans ate.
GHOST LIGHT, by Joseph O'Connor (Picador/Frances Coady, $15.) O'Connor reimagines the love affair between the pugnacious young actress Molly Allgood and the Irish dramatist John Millington Synge (1871-1909). Much of the novel is presented in flashbacks from 1952, when an aging and broken Molly, mired in London, looks back on the early days of the Abbey Theater and her brush with greatness.
MONEY AND POWER: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World, by William D. Cohan (Anchor, $17.95.) In ''House of Cards'' (2009), Cohan told the tale of Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed during the financial crisis of 2008. Goldman Sachs, a ''symbol of immutable global power,'' fared very differently, and Cohan's history of the firm examines the controversies behind its success.
THE DEATH INSTINCT, by Jed Rubenfeld (Riverhead, $16.) On Sept. 16, 1920, a bomb exploded on Wall Street, killing more than 30 people. That unsolved act of terrorism provides the impetus for Rubenfeld's historical thriller, which reunites the heroes of ''The Interpretation of Murder'' (2006): Capt. James Littlemore, a New York police officer, and the Harvard-trained physician Stratham Younger.

HEADLINE: One's A Crowd

BYLINE: By ERIC KLINENBERG. 
A professor of sociology at New York University and the author of ''Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone.''

 BODY:
MORE people live alone than at any other time in history. In prosperous American cities -- Atlanta, Denver, Seattle, San Francisco and Minneapolis -- 40 percent or more of all households contain a single occupant. In Manhattan and in Washington, nearly one in two households are occupied by a single person.
By international standards, these numbers are surprising -- surprisingly low. In Paris, the city of lovers, more than half of all households contain single people, and in socialist Stockholm, the rate tops 60 percent.
The decision to live alone is common in diverse cultures whenever it is economically feasible. Although Americans pride themselves on their self-reliance and culture of individualism, Germany, France and Britain have a greater proportion of one-person households than the United States, as does Japan. Three of the nations with the fastest-growing populations of single people -- China, India and Brazil -- are also among those with the fastest growing economies. 
The mere thought of living alone once sparked anxiety, dread and visions of loneliness. But those images are dated. Now the most privileged people on earth use their resources to separate from one another, to buy privacy and personal space.
Living alone comports with modern values. It promotes freedom, personal control and self-realization -- all prized aspects of contemporary life.
It is less feared, too, for the crucial reason that living alone no longer suggests an isolated or less-social life. After interviewing more than 300 singletons (my term for people who live alone) during nearly a decade of research, I've concluded that living alone seems to encourage more, not less, social interaction.
Paradoxically, our species, so long defined by groups and by the nuclear family, has been able to embark on this experiment in solo living because global societies have become so interdependent. Dynamic markets, flourishing cities and open communications systems make modern autonomy more appealing; they give us the capacity to live alone but to engage with others when and how we want to and on our own terms.
In fact, living alone can make it easier to be social, because single people have more free time, absent family obligations, to engage in social activities.
Compared with their married counterparts, single people are more likely to spend time with friends and neighbors, go to restaurants and attend art classes and lectures. There is much research suggesting that single people get out more -- and not only the younger ones. Erin Cornwell, a sociologist at Cornell, analyzed results from the General Social Survey (which draws on a nationally representative sample of the United States population) from 2000 to 2008 and found that single people 35 and older were more likely than those who lived with a spouse or a romantic partner to spend a social evening with neighbors or friends. In 2008, her husband, Benjamin Cornwell (also a sociologist at Cornell), was lead author of ''The Social Connectedness of Older Adults,'' a paper in the American Sociological Review that showed that single seniors had the same number of friends and core discussion partners as their married peers and were more likely to socialize with friends and neighbors.
SURVEYS, some by market research companies that study behavior for clients developing products and services, also indicate that married people with children are more likely than single people to hunker down at home. Those in large suburban homes often splinter into private rooms to be alone. The image of a modern family in a room together, each plugged into a separate reality, be it a smartphone, computer, video game or TV show has become a cultural cliche.
New communications technologies make living alone a social experience, so being home alone does not feel involuntary or like solitary confinement. The person alone at home can digitally navigate through a world of people, information and ideas. Internet use does not seem to cut people off from real friendships and connections.
The Pew Internet Personal Networks and Community Survey -- a nationally representative survey of 2,512 American adults conducted in 2008 that was the first to examine how the Internet and cellphones affect our core social networks -- shows that Web use can lead to more social life, rather than to less. ''Social Isolation and New Technology,'' written by the Rutgers University communications scholar Keith Hampton, reveals that heavy users are more likely than others to have large and diverse social networks; more likely to visit parks, cafes and restaurants; and more likely to meet diverse people with different perspectives and beliefs.
Today five million people in the United States between ages 18 and 34 live alone, 10 times more than in 1950. But the largest number of single people are middle-aged; 15 million people between ages 35 and 64 live alone. Those who decide to live alone following a breakup or a divorce could choose to move in with roommates or family. But many of those I interviewed said they chose to live alone because they had found there was nothing worse than living with the wrong person.
In my interviews, older single people expressed a clear preference for living alone, which allowed them to retain their feelings of independence and integrity, and a clear aversion to moving in with friends or family or into a nursing home.
According to research by the Rutgers sociologist Deborah Carr, at 18 months after the death of a spouse, only one in four elderly men and one in six elderly women say they are interested in remarrying; one in three men and one in seven women are interested in dating someday; and only one in four men and one in 11 women are interested in dating immediately.
Most older widows, widowers and divorced people remake their lives as single people. A century ago, nearly 70 percent of elderly American widows lived with a child; today -- thanks to Social Security, private pensions and wealth generated in the market -- just 20 percent do. According to the U.C.L.A. economist Kathleen McGarry: ''When they have more income and they have a choice of how to live, they choose to live alone. They buy their independence.''
Some unhealthy old people do become dangerously isolated, as I learned when I researched my book about the hundreds of people who died alone in the 1995 Chicago heat wave, and they deserve more attention and support than we give them today. But the rise of aging alone is also a social achievement. The sustained health, wealth and vitality that so many people over age 65 enjoy allow them to maintain domestic independence far longer than previous generations did. What's new today is that the great majority of older widows, widowers and divorced people prefer living alone to their other options, and they're willing to spend more on housing and domestic help for the privilege. Some pundits predicted that rates of living alone would plummet because of the challenged economy: young people would move into their parents' basements; middle-aged adults would put off divorce or separation for financial reasons; the elderly would move in with their children rather than hold on to places of their own.
Thus far, however, there's little evidence that this has happened. True, more young adults have moved in with their parents because they cannot find good jobs; but the proportion of those between 20 and 29 who live alone went down only slightly, from 11.97 percent in 2007 to 10.94 percent in 2011. In the general population, living alone has become more common -- in absolute and proportional terms. The latest census report estimates that more than 32 million Americans live alone today, up from 27.2 million in 2000 and 31 million in 2010.
All signs suggest that living alone will become even more common in the future, at every stage of adulthood and in every place where people can afford a place of their own.

HEADLINE: The Perpetual War: Pirates and Creators

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
From book publishers like Macmillan to Hollywood studios like Disney, producers of content are deeply frustrated by the defeat of their efforts to curb online piracy in Congress last month. The bill they favored was flawed, and could have inhibited expression on the Web. But their concern is spot on: the rampant piracy enabled by the Internet undermines the very economics of creative industries.
Online piracy is growing by leaps and bounds, as the first chart shows. The use of peer-to-peer and cyberlocker sites, most of it for illegal sharing, amounts to over one-fourth of all Internet traffic, according to Cisco Systems' Visual Networking Index. And while that fraction is expected to shrink as legal services like Internet video expand, file-sharing is still expected to grow about 23 percent annually, on average, until 2015. The Recording Industry Association of America says that four out of five digital music downloads are illegal. 
Piracy's effects on the economy as a whole are hard to measure. Studies used by the supporters of the defeated piracy legislation have tended to exaggerate piracy's economic costs and threat to jobs. For example, they often omit the fact that money not spent on music or movies is likely to be spent on something else. Nonetheless, piracy does hurt the industries that rely on copyright to protect their creations.
Consider the record labels' plunging sales since the music-sharing service Napster made large-scale piracy easy a decade ago. Album sales, including digital singles added up into album equivalents, fell from 755 million in 1999 to 458 million last year, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The top album in 1999, ''Millennium'' by the Backstreet Boys, sold 9.4 million copies. The top 2011 album, Adele's ''21,'' sold 5.8 million.
Hollywood was hit by piracy somewhat later because movie files are bigger and require more Internet bandwidth. But home entertainment sales -- a huge chunk of movie revenues -- fell every year from 2004 to 2010. While box-office revenues have benefited from rising ticket prices, movie attendance has been steadily declining. The Oscar-winning ''Hurt Locker,'' for instance, had a worldwide box office of only $49 million but was downloaded illegally seven million times, according to TorrentFreak, a Web site about file-sharing.
Publishers embraced e-books only a few years ago. In 2010, 1.5 to 3 million people were looking for free pirated copies of books every day, according to an analysis of global Internet searches by Attributor, a Web monitoring company. Of course, not every pirated download displaces the sale of a book, album or movie. But when it comes to music, most economic studies have concluded that piracy accounts for the vast majority or even entirety of the sales decline.
Many Internet enthusiasts say that this change isn't unhealthy, and that the Web makes more ventures possible. They point out that while piracy may be cutting the pay of record label executives, it doesn't seem to have stopped musicians from making new music. According to Nielsen, 75,300 albums were released in 2010, 25 percent more than in 2005. But new releases that sold more than 1,000 copies fell to about 4,700 from 8,000 during that time. The wave of creation that is more hobby than profession has little to do with piracy, and would likely be unaffected by laws to curb illicit downloads.
But if professional musicians, movie directors and writers can't make money from their art, they will probably make less of it. Independent producers say piracy is already making it harder to raise money for small and mid-budget movies.
Stopping piracy is about protecting creativity -- and the many occupations it supports (think pop band or sound mixer). If we value what creative industries produce as much as we say we do, Congress will have to find a way to protect it without limiting speech.

HEADLINE: Politics and the Supreme Court

 BODY:
The Supreme Court underscored its power to shape American life when it took major cases about the health care reform law, Arizona's anti-immigrant law and the Voting Rights Act in an election year. But this is not simply a case of the court thrusting itself into politics.
The way these cases developed and made their way to the highest court also illustrates the reverse -- how politics shape the court. Each case grows out of a struggle between left and right where politics have pushed the law: between a quest for universal coverage and the defense of big health care providers; between an emphasis on openness and hostility toward immigrants; and between a promise of access to the voting booth made nearly 50 years ago and the unyielding opposition to keeping that promise. 
Each party has its program and works to turn it into law. The great example of political change through legal change was the long, methodical effort to whittle away at segregation from within the legal mainstream that culminated in the court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The conservatives' legal-political strategy draws from Brown, but it is also vastly different in nature and design.
The struggle for school desegregation was waged by and on behalf of oppressed minority groups seeking to make good on the Constitution's promise of equal rights. They faced strong opposition from the most powerful people in our society, in courts that were not necessarily sympathetic or overtly hostile to their cause. And they fought a long, incremental campaign.
When Lewis Powell Jr. energized conservatives by writing in 1971 that ''the judiciary may be the most important instrument for social, economic and political change,'' he was himself an incrementalist and expected others to be.
But the conservative legal battles of our modern times are being waged by the most powerful, often against the weak and oppressed. They began with a carefully planned and successful effort to reshape the courts to be sympathetic to conservative causes. They are largely aimed at narrowing rights, not expanding them -- except where property and guns are concerned. And beginning with the Reagan administration, conservatives became impatient with the pace of change brought about from within the mainstream. They sought to remake law into a weapon of aggressive action.
The court's health care reform case arose from a decision by Judge Roger Vinson of Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., striking down the Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. It demonstrates the enduring influence of the Reagan administration, which put a premium on picking judges who would carry out its ideology and on countering liberalism with pointed conservatism any way possible.
Besides nominating Judge Vinson and getting him confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate, the Reagan Justice Department published conservative positions on states' rights and other issues in executive-branch opinions to promote them before courts took them seriously.
Citing conservative scholarship about the narrow meaning of the Constitution's commerce clause, the Vinson opinion presents the Reagan view of economic liberty -- an idea that was judged faulty by established scholars during the Reagan era but now carries great influence.
The Bush administration revived this practice, which led directly to the Arizona case. One of its most notorious opinions asserts the power of states ''as sovereign entities'' to crack down on illegal immigration even if the federal government has not delegated them that power. The author of the Arizona law cited the authority granted in the 2002 memo as a basis for it, and the memo underlies similar efforts in a growing list of other states.
The Reagan administration expressed its antipathy to the Voting Rights Act in politics and law -- in its effort to persuade Congress not to strengthen the act in 1982, for example, though Congress did, and in a 1985 Supreme Court test of the extension of the act that was passed.
The case has defined the sides in many battles since about control of American democracy -- between Democrats' interest in protecting minority voters and their representation and Republicans' insistence that the law is being misused to create racial quotas in government.
In 2009, the Supreme Court ducked ruling on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. that nonetheless laid out arguments for its unconstitutionality. The opinion is widely read as a warning that the law is vulnerable to being struck down by the conservative court.
The political influences on these major cases are important by themselves, but also as a reminder that the makeup of the court for the next generation, and thus the law's direction, are likely to be determined by the 2012 election.

HEADLINE: Taking More Seats on Campus, Foreigners Also Pay the Freight

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- This is the University of Washington's new math: 18 percent of its freshmen come from abroad, most from China. Each pays tuition of $28,059, about three times as much as students from Washington State. And that, according to the dean of admissions, is how low-income Washingtonians -- more than a quarter of the class -- get a free ride.
With state financing slashed by more than half in the last three years, university officials decided to pull back on admissions offers to Washington residents, and increase them to students overseas.
That has rankled some local politicians and parents, a few of whom have even asked Michael K. Young, the university president, whether their children could get in if they paid nonresident tuition. ''It does appeal to me a little,'' he said. 
There is a widespread belief in Washington that internationalization is the key to the future, and Mr. Young said he was not at all bothered that there were now more students from other countries than from other states. (Out-of-state students pay the same tuition as foreign students.)
''Is there any advantage to our taking a kid from California versus a kid from China?'' he said. ''You'd have to convince me, because the world isn't divided the way it used to be.''
If the university's reliance on full-freight Chinese students to balance the budget echoes the nation's dependence on China as the largest holder of American debt, well, said the dean of admissions, Philip A. Ballinger, ''this is a way of getting some of that money back.''
By the reckoning of the Institute of International Education, foreign students in the United States contribute about $21 billion a year to the national economy, including $463 million here in Washington State. But the influx affects more than just the bottom line -- campus culture, too, is changing.
While the University of Washington's demographic shifts have been sharper and faster -- international students were 2 percent of the freshmen in 2006 -- similar changes are under way at flagship public universities across the nation: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and University of California campuses in Berkeley and Los Angeles all had at least 10 percent foreign freshmen this academic year, more than twice that of five years ago. And at top private schools including Columbia University, Boston University and the University of Pennsylvania, at least 15 percent of this year's freshmen are from other countries.
All told, the number of undergraduates from China alone has soared to 57,000 from 10,000 five years ago. At the University of Washington, 11 percent of the nearly 5,800 freshmen are from China.
A few places have begun to charge international students additional fees besides tuition: at Purdue University, it was $1,000 this year and will double next year; engineering undergraduates at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had to pay a $2,500 surcharge this year.
''We're in something akin to the gold rush, a frontier-style environment where colleges and universities, like prospectors in the 1800s, realize that there is gold out there,'' said David Hawkins, the director of public policy at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. ''While it's the admissions offices butting up against the issues most right now, every department after them, every faculty member who comes into contact with international students, is going to have to recalibrate as institutions become more international. I see a cascading list of challenges.''
They have already begun here at Washington's flagship university, where orientation leaders last fall had to explain, repeatedly, the rigorous campus recycling practices, reinforce no-smoking rules and, at the make-your-own-sundae bar, help people get the hang of the whipped-cream cans.
But there are deeper issues, like how much latitude professors should give in written assignments.
''We recognize that people from other countries often speak with an accent,'' said John Webster, director of writing at the university's College of Arts and Science. ''If we're truly going to be a global university, which I think is a terrific thing, we have to recognize that they may write with an accent as well.''
For example, because Mandarin has one word for ''he,'' ''she'' and ''it'' and nothing like ''a'' or ''the,'' many Chinese speakers struggle with pronouns and articles. And English verb forms, like past participles, gerunds and infinitives, can be difficult to master, since Chinese verbs are unchanging.
Given that Chinese students' writing will be ''accented'' for years, Mr. Webster believes that professors should focus less on trying to make their English technically correct and more on making their essays understandable and interesting. But he knows this could be a controversial issue, reminiscent of the Ebonics debate decades ago.
The international influx is likely to keep growing, in part because of the booming recruiting industry that has sprung up overseas. That includes the use of commissioned agents, who help students through the admissions process -- and sometimes write their application essays. Amid controversy over such agents, Mr. Hawkins's group has named a commission, to meet for the first time next month, to formulate a policy regarding recruiters.
Nationwide, higher education financing has undergone a profound shift in recent years, with many public institutions that used to get most of their financing from state governments now relying on tuition for more than half their budgets. But legislators and taxpayers still feel deep ownership of the state institutions created to serve homegrown students -- and worry that something is awry when local high achievers, even valedictorians, are rejected by the campuses they have grown up aspiring to.
''My constituents want a slot for their kid,'' said Reuven Carlyle, a Democrat state representative from Seattle. ''I hear it at the grocery store every day, and I've got four young kids myself, so I get it.
''We are struggling with capacity, access and affordability,'' he said. ''But international engagement is part of our state's DNA. We have a special economic and social relationship with China, and I am happy to have so many Chinese students at the university.''
Still, Jim Allen, a counselor at Inglemoor High School in Kenmore, Wash., an affluent suburb north of Seattle, said: ''Families are frustrated. There aren't as many private colleges here as in the East, and a lot of families expect their children to go to U.W.''
Unlike many other state universities, the University of Washington did no overseas recruiting before this academic year, when it staged recruiting tours in several countries. So the rapid growth in international applications -- to more than 6,000 this year from 1,541 in 2007, with China by far the largest source -- was something of a surprise. Last spring, another surprise was the percentage who accepted offers of admission: 42 percent decided to enroll, up from 35 percent the previous year.
''As best I can make out, it's just word of mouth,'' said Mr. Ballinger, the admissions dean. ''We're well known in China, we're highly rated on the Shanghai rankings, and we have a lot of contacts.''
Applications from abroad present some special challenges. Because the SAT is not given in mainland China, the university does not require international students to take it. Although it does not pay recruiting agents, Mr. Ballinger said he knew many applicants hired them, so the university does not consider Chinese applicants' personal essays or recommendations. (Yes, he also knows that some affluent applicants in the United States get extensive help from paid private counselors.)
Some in-state students said they had trouble knowing what to make of the fact that international students, on the one hand, help underwrite financial aid, and on the other, take up seats that might have gone to their high school classmates.
''Morally, I feel the university should accept in-state students first, then other American students, then international students,'' said Farheen Siddiqui, a freshman from Renton, Wash., just south of Seattle. ''When I saw all the stories about U.W. taking more international students, I thought, 'Damn, I'm a minority now for being in-state.' ''
Actually, nearly two-thirds of Ms. Siddiqui's classmates are from Washington, but her inaccurate sense of the population was echoed by all of the three dozen freshmen interviewed -- including those from other states and from China. Most, like Ms. Siddiqui, estimated that half to two-thirds of the class was international.
Ms. Siddiqui cited a psychology class in which the professor asked the 600-plus students about the nature of the families they grew up in. With clickers recording the responses, Ms. Siddiqui said, about 60 percent said their families were ''collectivist,'' rather than ''individualist,'' something she perceived as more Asian than American.
Alison Luo, who grew up in Chongqing, a major city in southwest China, had mixed feelings about the trend that she is part of.
''Before I came, I saw the online chatting in China, with hundreds of people coming to the University of Washington,'' Ms. Luo said. ''I was kind of worried about that. I paid to study abroad, and it was almost like I was studying in China.''

HEADLINE: Revenge of the Econobox: Early Imports Find Admirers

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

 BODY:
WHEN Japanese cars and trucks began arriving in the United States in earnest during the 1970s, they were widely seen as disposable.
Reliable, maybe. Future classics? Not likely.
But in the past decade, those bargain-price models from the '70s and '80s have been revisited by a generation of enthusiasts who grew up riding in the back seats.
''For many like myself, it's nostalgic,'' said Jun Imai, a 36-year-old designer at the Hot Wheels division of Mattel, where he directed the styling for die-cast models of two 1970s-vintage Nissans released last year.
''It's a very special feeling I have for cars like these -- the designs, the sound of the engines, the way they drive,'' Mr. Imai said. ''They are so distinctive, yet most are approachable in terms of costs and availability.'' 
Mr. Imai, who lives in Southern California, owns a 1971 Datsun 510 wagon and a 1972 Datsun pickup. The vehicles' peculiar silhouettes, diminutive scale and heavy use of chrome trim are typical of Japanese styling of the period.
Yorgo Tloupas, a co-founder and creative director of Intersection magazine, which is based in Paris, is the owner of a 1981 Honda Prelude. ''I love that they don't look like anything else,'' Mr. Tloupas said.
''The first time I saw the Honda 600, I had to have the car,'' he said, referring to the tiny 2-cylinder sedan that was among the company's first models shipped to the United States.
The trend has grown rapidly. In 2005, Terry Yamaguchi, 39, and her husband, Koji, 41, who own a 1972 Toyota Celica coupe and a 1977 Celica liftback, started a casual meet-up in Long Beach, Calif., for like-minded enthusiasts. More than 200 cars showed up; the next year they created an official event, the Japanese Classic Car Show, now in its seventh year and attracting some 350 entries.
''We were not going to continue,'' Ms. Yamaguchi said. ''It cost a lot and we didn't have any sponsors. We only did it for ourselves. But people were excited.''
The Japanese have a term for their suddenly trendy vintage cars. They are called nostalgic cars, said Benjamin Hsu, a co-founder of Japanese Nostalgic Car, a Web site and magazine based in Diamond Bar, Calif. ''You know how the Japanese like to appropriate English terms but use them in a slightly different way,'' Mr. Hsu said.
Yet the name is fitting. The demographic that's seemingly responsible for the popularity of Japanese nostalgic cars is 30-something men who grew up with the cars. Mr. Imai remembers his uncles working on and racing Datsun 510s and 240Zs when he was a boy.
''When you have cars that were everyday cars, there's an emotional connection,'' said Bryan Thompson, a designer for Nissan, both in the Japan and the United States, from 2001 to 2009. ''They're a part of your life in the way a pet is a part of your life, or a family member.''
Mr. Thompson, who is now a contract designer for Volvo, cited his parents' 1983 Toyota Tercel wagon as the inspiration behind his career choice.
For Mr. Hsu, interest in the era's cars was stimulated during a layover at the Narita airport near Tokyo on a trip to Taiwan. ''I stepped out for one second and saw the coolest cars I had ever seen,'' he said. ''They were cars that I never knew existed. That kind of blew my mind.''
Mr. Hsu founded the Japanese Nostalgic Car Web site with his brother, Dan, in 2006. They began publishing the magazine, a quarterly, two years later.
Mr. Hsu said that the nostalgic car trend in the United States was partly an evolution of the Japanese import-tuning craze of the 1990s that spawned the ''Fast and the Furious'' film franchise. A further push came around 2000, as interest rose in performance cars made for Japan's home market (a movement in its own right, known as Japanese Domestic Market, or J.D.M.).
''People really wanted to find out what Japanese people were doing,'' Mr. Hsu said. ''And what Japanese people were doing was drifting.''
Drifting, a professional motor sport in Japan since 2000, came from the same hooligan spirit as drag racing. But instead of speeding in a straight line, drivers slide their cars around curves, smoke pouring off the tires. It required a specific kind of car -- lightweight, and more important, rear-drive.
''Japanese companies weren't building rear-wheel-drive cars, unless you get to high-end luxury,'' Mr. Hsu said, which meant using models like the Toyota Corolla GT-S and the Nissan 240SX from the 1980s.
Mr. Hsu owns a 1986 Toyota Corolla GT-S. ''It had all the performance goodies -- twin-cam, 16 valves, rear-wheel drive with an optional limited-slip differential,'' he said. ''To me that is the ideal performance package. The car is lightweight. It handles brilliantly. The motor revs to 7,500 r.p.m.''
The Corolla GT-S ''was the gateway drug'' to other nostalgic cars, Mr. Hsu said. He also cited other popular examples: the first-generation Toyota Celica; the Honda N600 and Civic CVCC; and several Mazdas -- RX-2, RX-3 and the first-generation RX-7.
Many nostalgia-car enthusiasts modify the engines and suspensions, and install parts made for Japan-market models. But the appeal of vintage Japanese cars isn't based solely on performance.
Mr. Tloupas, whose magazine collaborated with Honda last year in customizing a CR-Z, said he had always been captivated by Japanese design. ''They were kind of quirky, he said.
Mr. Thompson explained that Japanese designers were still trying to find their aesthetic and, much as Chinese automakers are doing today, they imitated existing forms.
''Look at a lot of the early to mid-1970s Japanese economy cars,'' he said. ''They were oftentimes reinterpretations of American cars from the 1960s. Because they didn't have the same proportions, they were very strange.''
Of course, Japanese automakers didn't always get designs wrong. The Datsun 240Z was popular from its release as a 1970 model. The Datsun 510 has served as a platform for road racers for decades. And Japanese pickups are noted for their durability; it's not unusual to find one with 300,000 miles on the odometer.
This year, Hot Wheels released two 1:43 scale diecast models of vintage Japanese cars, the 1971 Nissan Skyline 2000GT-X and 1973 Nissan Skyline 2000GT-R. In Japan, they are equivalent to the 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air or Corvette, but neither car was sold new in the United States.
The Skylines are very rare, even in Japan, and very expensive. Of the 1971 Skyline, Mr. Imai, said, ''From a cultural standpoint, you'll notice more recently this car appearing in movies and video games.''
Another model, the Toyota 2000GT, is widely regarded as the original Japanese supercar. It was sold only in limited numbers in the United States and is valued at more than $400,000 in collector-car guides; a 2000GT racecar is currently being offered for $1.7 million.
But most vintage Japanese cars remain very affordable. On eBay, a 1976 Honda Civic CVCC 5-speed with 59,000 miles recently sold for $3,550. A 1977 Corolla SR5 with 55,000 miles sold for $4,000.
Those prices may sound high for 35-year-old Japanese compacts -- the prices are roughly what the cars sold for when new -- but they are low compared with, say, a vintage Alfa Romeo or Chevrolet Camaro. And now owners, aware of the rising interest, are increasingly choosing to hold onto their cars.
''There are people out there,'' Mr. Hsu said. ''They've got extremely low-mileage cars, completely original, stowed in their garages all over the place.''

HEADLINE: After Recess: Change the World

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
A BATTLE between a class of fourth graders and a major movie studio would seem an unequal fight.
So it proved to be: the studio buckled. And therein lies a story of how new Internet tools are allowing very ordinary people to defeat some of the most powerful corporate and political interests around -- by threatening the titans with the online equivalent of a tarring and feathering.
Take Ted Wells's fourth-grade class in Brookline, Mass. The kids read the Dr. Seuss story ''The Lorax'' and admired its emphasis on protecting nature, so they were delighted to hear that Universal Studios would be releasing a movie version in March. But when the kids went to the movie's Web site, they were crushed that the site seemed to ignore the environmental themes. 
So last month they started a petition on Change.org, the go-to site for Web uprisings. They demanded that Universal Studios ''let the Lorax speak for the trees.'' The petition went viral, quickly gathering more than 57,000 signatures, and the studio updated the movie site with the environmental message that the kids had dictated.
''It was exactly what the kids asked for -- the kids were through the roof,'' Wells told me, recalling the celebratory party that the children held during their snack break. ''These kids are really feeling the glow of making the world a better place. They're feeling that power.''
The opportunities for Web naming-and-shaming through Change.org caught my eye when I reported recently on sex traffickers who peddle teenage girls on Backpage.com. I learned that a petition on Change.org had gathered 86,000 signatures calling for the company to stop accepting adult ads.
My next column was about journalists being brutalized in Ethiopian prisons. A 19-year-old college freshman in Idaho, Kelsey Crow, read the column and started a petition to free those journalists -- and in no time gathered more than 4,000 signatures.
Does that matter? Does Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, care what a band of cyber citizens thinks of him? Skepticism is warranted, but so far Change.org petitions have seen some remarkable successes.
Ecuador, for example, used to run a network of ''clinics'' where lesbians were sometimes abused in the guise of being made heterosexual. A petition denouncing this practice gathered more than 100,000 signatures, leading Ecuador to close the clinics, announce a national advertising campaign against homophobia, and appoint a gay-rights activist as health minister.
The masterminds of the successful campaigns aren't usually powerful or well-connected. Mostly, they just brim with audacity and are on a first-name basis with social media.
Take Molly Katchpole. Last fall, as a 22-year-old nanny living in Washington, D.C., she was peeved by a new $5-a-month fee for debit cards announced by Bank of America, with other banks expected to follow. She took an hour to write a petition, her first.
''After a month it had 306,000 signatures,'' Katchpole told me. ''That's when the banks backed down.'' Bank of America and other financial institutions withdrew plans for the fee.
Soon afterward, she started a second petition, protesting a $2 charge imposed by Verizon for paying certain bills online. In 48 hours it had attracted more than 160,000 signatures -- and Verizon withdrew the fee.
Katchpole parlayed her successes into a job with a new advocacy group, Rebuild the Dream, which seeks to improve the economic well-being of middle-class families.
As for Change.org, it is growing explosively. Founded in 2007, it is a B Corporation -- a hybrid of a for-profit company and a charity, seeking to make profits for social good -- and began to soar a year ago. It is now growing by one million members a month.
''We're growing more each month than the total we had in the first four years,'' said Ben Rattray, 31, the founder. He said that 10,000 petitions are started each month on the site, and that each success leads to countless more copycat campaigns.
Change.org has grown from 20 employees a year ago to 100 now, in offices on four continents. By the end of this year, Rattray plans to have offices in 20 countries and to operate in several more languages, including Arabic and Chinese. He recognizes that the site may be blocked in China, but shrugs.
''If ultimately we're not getting leaders to ban our site, we're not doing our job,'' he said.
Meanwhile, what about those 14 kids in Wells's fourth-grade class? I asked them what their next initiative on Change.org would be. They are still discussing options, but one possibility is to reduce waste by calling on companies to stop bombarding the public with telephone books and instead distribute them only to people who request them.
It's absurd to think that 14 fourth graders could accomplish anything so sensible. But then again, they've already shown that the Web can turn the world upside down.

HEADLINE: A Mother Grateful to Have a Key to Her Own Place

BYLINE: By MATHEW R. WARREN

 BODY:
For months last year, Tiffany Tyler lay awake at night wondering if city marshals would come to her door the next day to evict her and her 10-year-old son.
''I was scared,'' Ms. Tyler, 30, said. ''I couldn't breathe.''
The last time marshals banged on the door, waking her up early one morning, it was in 2001, and her son, Shamair, was a month old. Ms. Tyler was 19 and living with her older sister in Harlem; she said she had no idea they had fallen behind on rent and was shocked to learn they were being evicted.
''It was so embarrassing,'' she said. ''It was something I would never want to experience again.'' 
Ms. Tyler had been living with her sister since their mother died of liver cancer, in 1995. Her father had not been a part of her life, she said. She had graduated from high school and had worked as a telemarketer eight months into her pregnancy, but had no job at the time of the eviction, nor was she receiving financial help from Shamair's father, she said.
The marshals gave her a few minutes to gather a few possessions, so Ms. Tyler grabbed diapers, milk and baby clothes and stuffed them in backpacks that she hung from a stroller. With a single change of clothes for herself and a photograph of her mother, she and her baby, together with her older sister, her sister's three children and her younger brother, went to an intake center at a shelter in the Bronx.
Ms. Tyler and her son shared a small room in a shelter for almost a year, until she was approved for Section 8 housing in the South Bronx.
''I was overjoyed,'' she said, smiling at the memory. ''I had my own apartment. I couldn't believe it.''
For the next seven years, she worked in telemarketing and various clerical positions. For extra money, she styled hair and prepared tax returns, a skill she had learned working as an administrative assistant at a tax office. Shamair, who loves horror movies, football and Michael Jackson, grew up without any memory of their time in a shelter, she said.
Things were going smoothly until Ms. Tyler lost her job in 2009. She went on public assistance and entered a back-to-work program with the city's Human Resources Administration, which placed her in a temporary maintenance position with the parks department. But in October 2010, the program ended, and Ms. Tyler was again out of work.
Her only income was $176 a week in unemployment benefits and $200 in food stamps. She was paying $453 of the $728 rent for her apartment, with Section 8 covering the rest. Realizing she could not afford her rent that October, she went to her landlord to discuss her options.
To her dismay, Ms. Tyler discovered that her Section 8 had been cut off since the previous January and that she owed the difference for every month since. She said she had never received any notice from her landlord, and blamed the oversight on the rapid turnover rate of property managers in her building's management company. The city had revoked her Section 8, Ms. Tyler said, because her landlord had not replaced a stove with two broken burners for over a year despite her numerous requests, causing her apartment to fail inspections and making it ineligible for the subsidy. Now, because of the owed rent, she received an eviction notice and was at risk of becoming homeless once again.
''My son was a baby then,'' Ms. Tyler said of her first period of homelessness. ''Now he's 10 years old; it would have been heartbreaking.''
Ms. Tyler sought assistance from the Human Resources Administration and was approved for a one-shot deal of $3,000 in December 2010, but she did not get the money right away. She used loans from a cousin and money she made doing hair and preparing tax returns to help pay her standard portion of the rent, but without Section 8, her arrears increased.
To hold off eviction, Ms. Tyler persuaded a housing court judge to extend her case. When she received the assistance from the city agency, in November 2011, she turned to the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, for help to cover the rest of her debt. With $728 that the agency drew from the fund, along with help from other charities, Ms. Tyler was able to pay off her arrears in time for Thanksgiving last year.
That day, Ms. Tyler and her son, along with her sister's family, went back to the intake center at the shelter where they had been residents, stood outside and handed out food they had made themselves.
''It made me feel really good just to be able to give,'' Ms. Tyler said. ''You can't take things for granted.''
Her landlord recently replaced her stove, she said, and she hopes her Section 8 will be reinstated soon. She is excited about the arrival of tax season, and since December she has been working part time with a catering company. ''I want to be able to keep a roof over his head,'' Ms. Tyler said, her son, now 11, by her side. ''I want to be able to breathe.''

HEADLINE: The World at Its Feet

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
New York real estate can bring out even the most dormant phobias of potential buyers. With so many options, apartment hunters can easily be paralyzed by decidophobia (yes, it's a real term, and means the fear of making decisions).
That doesn't seem to be a problem for the wealthy investors who are wiring millions of dollars to New York to snatch up a piece of 157 West 57th Street - what will be New York City's tallest residential building, with 90 floors overlooking Central Park. 
A bigger worry for these buyers may be acrophobia (fear of heights) or batophobia (fear of being near an object of great height, like a skyscraper).
The views, captured in a virtual tour shown off by the developer in a media event this week, are indeed stunning. From the double-height windows facing north, Central Park rolls out like a long green carpet.
The building (One57, as it brands itself) is not expected to open until the fall of 2013, but sales are already brisk, thanks in large part to interest from buyers from Russia and China, said Gary Barnett, the president of Extell Development Company, which is building the tower. Mr. Barnett said the willingness of foreign buyers to open their wallets for New York real estate ''gave us the confidence to do layouts the way I would like them to be, with large, gracious spaces and volume, and not so many bedrooms.''
Buyers have appeared from all over the globe, including South America, and there have been multiple sales to people from China, Mr. Barnett said. He declined to comment on rumors reported on some real estate blogs that one Chinese buyer had bought four $20 million apartments. But he did confirm that there have been multiple sales to the same buyers.
Fact sheets for the building have been translated into Russian and Mandarin. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian translations are in the works.
Americans, including New Yorkers, are buying as well, though they are a little late to the party. ''Some want to buy, and we don't have the exact product they want anymore,'' Mr. Barnett said.
The duplex penthouse of 10,923 square feet, currently listed at $115 million, is still available. If the six-bedroom home closes at anywhere near that price, it will be the most expensive apartment ever sold in New York, eclipsing the recent $88 million sale of a penthouse at 15 Central Park West by Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman. Ekaterina Rybolovleva, the 22-year-old daughter of a Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, bought that gem. She apparently will use it as her Manhattan crash pad while attending college. (Her security detail reportedly will live in a smaller, $8 million apartment in the building.)
On Wednesday, the developers of One57 and Christian de Portzamparc, the French ''starchitect'' on the project, as the builders called him, explained their vision for the 1,004-foot-tall building at a mimosa-and-bellini-fueled event. Mr. Portzamparc said he tried to design the building's exterior ''like a staircase of curved roofs.''
The lighted and vented top will make the building a beacon at night. The architect said he designed the east-west facade in a pixelated pattern with three colors of glass.
The interior designers said - perhaps predictably - that they wanted to rethink the meaning of luxury in New York. There are small touches, like dedicated wok burners, silverware drawers lined in faux ostrich skin, built-in wine chillers and sleeves for Nespresso capsules in the drawers.
The kitchen cabinetry custom designed by Smallbone of Devizes is intended to achieve a classic modernism. Many master bathrooms will have tubs of hand-carved stone from Italy and televisions next to the bidet.
Dan Tubb, One57's sales director, used an iPad to show me floor plans on the enormous screen in the One57 sales center. The building's library will have a 24-foot-wide fish tank. A screening room and concert space 300 feet above 57th Street will have a grand piano, seat 25 and overlook Carnegie Hall.
Cue the short sales video: String music soars as the building flows up like water into its final shape. A slender woman in a flowing black dress, so at ease, walks in front of her floor-to-ceiling window in the penthouse's grand salon and stares leisurely at the park. She makes a last-minute adjustment in her master bathroom, glancing out a window at a spectacular view of Midtown Manhattan. Then she is in the elevator. The red digital readout reads 90, then 89. In the lobby, she strides through the front door and a doorman ushers her to a waiting black sedan. And she's gone.
I've seen this kind of movie before. I come from Chicago, a city of extra-tall buildings. I remember covering the announcement in 2005 of the ''Spire'' in Chicago, the stunning birthday candle-shaped residential structure designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The project was supposed to be 2,000 feet tall, with 150 floors. It was abandoned in 2008 due to ongoing financial struggles and the global recession.
The difference is New York, of course, where Wall Street's collapse seemed to barely land a glancing blow to the cheek of high-end residential real estate. ''People still see New York as a fantastic place to put their money,'' Mr. Tubb said.
Mr. Barnett said that after just two months, more than 30 percent of the 95 apartments at One57 were either in contract or out for signature. The residences, in floors 39 through 90, sit atop a Park Hyatt.
Sales managers said they received 1,000 inquiries for the building and responded to all of them. That led Jeannie Woodbrey, a senior sales executive at One57, to a 14-year-old boy from a town outside of Buffalo who called a few weeks ago to inquire about the six-bedroom penthouse.
''Can you buy the apartment now?'' she asked patiently. ''No, but I will be able to in a couple of years,'' he responded, sharing with her his plans to open a chain of hotels and ''a bunch of Internet companies.''
She said nothing would make her happier than to be able to sell him the $115 million home with four fireplaces and almost 58 feet of frontage on the park.
He said he would be in touch.

HEADLINE: Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

BYLINE: By DAVID LAT. 
David Lat, a lawyer and journalist, is the founder and managing editor of Above the Law, a Web site about the legal profession.

 BODY:
Two of the best work experiences I have ever had were unpaid. One was an internship at a literary and cultural journal in the Philippines, and the other was an internship in a federal prosecutor's office. Neither of my internships violated the law -- one was at a nonprofit in a foreign country, and the other was with the federal government -- but had they been with for-profit entities in the United States, they might have. 
Assuming an unpaid internship is mutually beneficial and entered into freely by both parties, should such arrangements be illegal? And should scarce government resources be spent on trying to police the large and growing number of unpaid internships? I have my doubts.
A former intern at the Hearst Corporation, Xuedan Wang, recently sued the company, claiming that her unpaid internship violated federal and state law. In addition to making specific allegations against Hearst, her lawsuit faults unpaid internships in general for a whole host of evils, including declining opportunities for paid employment. But unpaid internships are more a symptom than a cause of economic weakness. They are so popular right now because many employers, large and small, simply don't have the ability to create new, full-time, paid positions.
The lawsuit against Hearst claims that unpaid internships exacerbate class divisions, because some people can afford to work free and others cannot. But the same could be said of almost any opportunity that allows students from wealthier backgrounds to enhance their human capital more effectively than students from less privileged backgrounds. The lawsuit asserts that unpaid internships indirectly contribute to higher unemployment. But minimum wage laws themselves, the laws that unpaid internships sometimes violate, arguably have the same effect.
In the end, the status quo, while imperfect and inconsistent, may not be that bad. Let the government largely look the other way on unpaid internships, but leave existing prohibitions on the books, so the most egregious violators can be sued individually. This would deter some of the worst abuses while preserving the educational, mutually beneficial unpaid internships that I and so many others have experienced.

HEADLINE: Can't Park? Blame a Condo

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
EVER since the car muscled out the horse and garages supplanted stables, New York City has had a conflicted relationship with the automobile. In recent years, the car has been on the losing side. Whether it is the addition of bike lines or pedestrian plazas, a push for congestion pricing or rising tolls, the once-exalted automobile is under siege.
In Manhattan the car faces yet another threat, as parking lots and garages are being snapped up to make way for all sorts of development, especially luxury condominiums. In most cases, the lost public spaces are not replaced, because zoning rules discourage developers from adding parking to new residential buildings.
The spaces that do get built are likely to be in luxury condominiums -- and to go to the highest bidder. 
But many people still keep cars in Manhattan, and they are left to mourn a favorite parking lot suddenly surrounded by a construction fence, to swallow hard when the cost of monthly parking goes up again, or to engage in an exasperating hunt for a spot at the curb.
Matthew Smith, the president of Smith Affiliated, a money management company, long ago abandoned hope of finding affordable parking near his apartment on 74th Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue.
Parking in an iffy spot and hoping the parking enforcement officer calls in sick is not a realistic option. The rise in fines -- $65 a pop in most cases -- has made it not worth the risk.
''You get a few tickets, and you are paying what you would in a lot,'' he said.
For several years, Mr. Smith parked in a lot on 57th Street near the West Side Highway. But then the price began to rise.
With all the new development sprouting up on the West Side, he was able to find a garage at 64th Street and Riverside Boulevard with a reasonable monthly rate of $209.
''Near my apartment there is no way you are ever going to get something south of $500 a month,'' Mr. Smith said. Since he uses his car recreationally, he said, sacrificing a little convenience is worth the savings.
The Department of City Planning recently completed its most ambitious study of parking in Manhattan in three decades. The report found that the way cars are used in the city has changed since the early 1980s, when the Clean Air Act's stricter codes limited the number of new parking lots. Developers were no longer required to provide parking in new developments, and special permission was needed to build large garages.
When the rules went into effect, 85 percent of off-street parking was taken by commuters. Now, depending on the neighborhood, up to 70 percent of those spaces are used by residents.
Over the last three decades, the number of off-street parking spots in Manhattan has fallen by one-fifth -- to 102,000 from 127,000, according to the city study.
In the last six years alone, according to data compiled by Property Shark, 92 parking lots or garages have been sold and redeveloped. From the Avenue of the Americas, where a garage fell for a hotel, the Eventi, with rental apartments on top; to Varick Street, site of a condo-to-be, the humble lot has seen better days.
The city plans to convene a series of public meetings in coming weeks to consider the state of parking in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Officials say they are exploring allowing developers to create larger parking lots in Manhattan neighborhoods that rely on commuters, like the theater district or areas around hospitals.
Meanwhile, developers are using the cash they have built up after several slow years of construction to buy property while they wait for the right time to build.
The remaining stand-alone parking lots and garages are prime targets. In January, for instance, the Extell Development Company spent $39 million for two parking lots, one at 135 East 47th Street and the other at 332 West 44th Street. Extell would not say what its plans were for the lots.
The scarcity of parking has made it a must-have for wealthy apartment buyers, who view a space much as they do a fireplace or a walk-in closet. A spot can cost well over $200,000, or, if rented, more than $1,000 a month.
''It always comes up with luxury buyers,'' said Cindy Bernat, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group.
But even when a buyer has millions of dollars to spend, a spot can be hard to come by. Right now, 109 condos priced over $10 million are on the market, according to Corcoran. Of those, only 66 are in buildings that have garages. And of the 209 condos priced from $5 million to $10 million, only 112 have garages.
''It is one of the compromises that buyers at this price range may have to make,'' Ms. Bernat said.
Louis V. Greco Jr., the manager of the development firm SDS Procida, said that demand was high for parking at its projects, but that adding parking to a new development only marginally increased profits.
His firm recently completed work on the Dillon, at 425 West 53rd Street, replacing a 33,000-square-foot parking lot with a seven-story glass building housing 83 condos and rental apartments, as well as a collection of three-story town houses. Since the opening last year, the starting price for one-bedrooms has been in the mid-$700,000 range and up to $4.1 million for a town house.
Initially, Mr. Greco said, Procida planned to build a garage for 150 cars on the site, but the city rejected that idea. Instead the firm built a 37-car garage for residents, who can buy a space for around $200,000.
In Manhattan, a developer needs no permit to provide parking spots for 20 percent of the number of apartments in the building -- assuming the entrance to the garage will not obstruct traffic. But to build more spaces, a developer needs city approval.
''In the old days you had to provide parking,'' Mr. Greco said. ''Now it is to the contrary, and what we are seeing is a slow evaporation of the parking spaces.''
Laurie Zucker is the vice chairwoman of the Zucker Organization, a development company, which with its management firm, Manhattan Skyline, owns and operates about 3,000 apartments in the New York area.
At the company's new luxury rental building at 55 Thompson, the apartments are spacious, and many are suited for families. One-bedrooms start at $6,100 a month, and the three-bedrooms top out at $25,000 a month. But those prices don't include parking.
Although 55 Thompson replaced the 1922 Tunnel garage, which was one of the first facilities designed specifically for cars, the city rejected a plan to build a large lot underneath the building. Ms. Zucker said the plans were then revised to create one parking spot for each of the 38 apartments. That, too, was rejected. In the end, the developers arranged for tenants to have discounted parking at a nearby garage.
You might think that owning a parking lot in a car-saturated city would be so lucrative that there would be little incentive to sell.
Vincent Petraro, the executive director of the Metropolitan Parking Association, an industry group, cited a variety of factors that might inspire a parking-lot owner to throw in the towel. ''The parking industry is facing tremendous price resistance among consumers these days,'' he said in a statement. ''The industry faces the reality of fewer cars coming into Manhattan, a weaker economy as well as higher rents, higher real estate taxes, and higher insurance costs. Because of this, it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain profitability.''
Not to mention that the law of supply and demand makes even the grubbiest garage valuable real estate.
''It is a ready-to-go situation,'' said Ms. Zucker, the developer of 55 Thompson. ''For one thing, you don't have existing tenants to deal with.
''There are a lot of developers with lots of money looking for sites,'' she said.
Robert Gladstone, the chief executive of Madison Equities, recently built a nine-unit development at 57 Irving Place, the site of a stable-turned-garage. The cheapest apartment costs $6.75 million.
''I have torn down two buildings that were former stables in the last few years,'' he said. And just as horses made room for cars, he said, cars are making room for humans. But parking is still a concern.
''It always comes up in conversation,'' he said. ''If you are designing for the super-rich, you have to find a place to put their cars.''
Correction: February 12, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption last Sunday with the continuation of an article about a decrease in the number of parking lots and garages in Manhattan, and the residential buildings that often replace them, described incorrectly 55 Thompson, a building that went up on the site of a garage in SoHo. It is a rental, not a condominium.
