HEADLINE: Bargain-Hunting Aids Stocks; Dow Up 9.18

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher yesterday, buoyed by bargain-hunting after recent steep losses, but buyers were selective ahead of forthcoming third-quarter earnings reports.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.18 points to close at 3,287.87. In the broad market, winning issues led losers, 930 to 752, on volume of 188 million shares, compared with an active 205.4 million Wednesday. 
 But Ron Hill, an investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, cautioned, "Third-quarter earnings season comes out next week, and it's not going to be pretty."
James Andrews, equity-trading manager at Janney Montgomery Scott, said he expected stocks to trade in a tight range until companies begin to report their earnings. "If a company comes out with any kind of negative situation, you can write that off as death," he said.
Analysts said the Presidential election was also moving closer to the forefront of investors' minds.
Gerald Simmons of Interstate/ Johnson Lane said the market "is trying to digest" the fact that Gov. Bill Clinton appears increasingly likely to win the election. While stock prices rose, "it was done with a lack of enthusiasm," the analyst said.
"The economy is still crummy," said Hersh Cohen, president of Shearson Asset Management. "The difference is now people realize it's crummy and will stay crummy."
 
Insurance Stocks Jump
 Gross domestic product -- the nation's output of goods and services -- grew at an anemic 1.5 percent rate in the second quarter, barely half the 2.9 percent rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said.
Insurers leaped on hopes that premium increases are likely near term. General Re jumped 8 1/8, to 102 1/2; American International rose 7 1/8, to 101 5/8; Marsh & McClennan gained 5 1/2, to 89; Chubb advanced 4 1/2, to 79 1/4; the St. Paul Companies rose 3 3/8, to 72, and CNA Financial climbed 3 7/8, to 91. But the Continental Corporation sank 6 1/8, to 24, after it urged a dividend cut and said its pretax loss from Hurricane Iniki would total $55 million.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.03, to 418.47. The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.03, to 380.94.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.56, to 229.98. The average share gained 8 cents. The Nasdaq over-the-counter index rose 2.97, to 585.93.

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Growth Is Lifted, But Jobless Claims Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The economy grew in the second quarter at a slightly less anemic rate than first thought, but new claims for unemployment benefits rose in mid-September for the fourth week in a row, the Government said today.
Consumer caution held the seasonally adjusted rise in the gross domestic product to an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said, revising a previous estimate of 1.4 percent. 
 Separately, the Labor Department said 414,000 Americans filed applications for unemployment during the week ended Sept. 12, an increase of 15,000 partly attributed to claims from victims of Hurricane Andrew.
 
A Lasting Impression?
 Because of the volatility of the weekly reports, many analysts prefer to track a four-week moving average for claims, viewing it as a more reliable indicator of the labor market.
The average was 398,250 in the period ended Sept. 12, up from 390,500 a week earlier when it fell to the lowest since 387,250 during the period ended Oct. 6, 1990. The average was 409,250 during the period ended Aug. 29.
Analysts expect the mostly gloomy economic news to continue between now and the Presidential election Nov. 3.
"I can't see how the impression could possibly change before the election," said Paul W. Boltz, an economist for T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "George Bush is stuck with family values at this point."
Next week, the Labor Department reports on September's jobless rate. Many economists fear that the end of a Federal summer-jobs program for teen-agers and job losses from the hurricane will cause an increase from the 7.6 percent August rate.
On Oct. 27, only a week before Election Day, the Government releases its first estimate of G.D.P. in the July-September period. In advance, economists were expecting at best a modest improvement compared with the second quarter.
"What the numbers show is the economy is not particularly buoyant," Paul Lally of R. H. Wrightson & Associates in New York said. "We're still struggling to get our head above water."
The second-quarter performance followed a moderate increase of 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the first three months. That's considered poor for just after a recession, but it still was the best growth since the early months of the Bush administration.
Behind the slowdown were American consumers, whose spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of all economic activity. Their outlays fell one-tenth of 1 percent in the second quarter after spurting 5.1 percent in the first. The decline included a 2.1 percent drop for durable goods -- big-ticket items such as autos and appliances.
"You can't sustain a recovery without strong consumption," said John M. Albertine, a Washington-based economic consultant.
Business investment in new equipment recorded a large 24.1 percent gain in the second quarter. Business investment in buildings fell at an eight-tenths of 1 percent rate, while spending for housing rose 12.6 percent.
Federal, state and local government spending fell 1.2 percent over all, led by a 5.2 percent drop in military expenditures.
Meanwhile, the Commerce agency said the after-tax profits of United States corporations edged 1.3 percent higher in the second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $232.7 billion, revised downward from last month's estimate of a 2.1 percent gain.
Still, analysts said profits were in good shape compared with a year ago because the latest advance came on top of a 10.8 percent jump in the first quarter, the best in four years.
The various changes translated into a G.D.P. increase at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $18.7 billion with total G.D.P. standing at a $4.89 trillion, after adjusting for inflation.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Saberhagen Is Eight-Ninths as Impressive as Gooden

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The 1993 starting rotation for the Mets remains an abstraction of blind optimism and genuine uncertainty. There will have to be an addition made, likely from outside the organization. And there will have to be a lot of medical hopes realized.
The concept, though, isn't altogether crazy, and the last two nights have infused the abstraction with an encouraging dose of realism. Barely 24 hours after Dwight Gooden turned in his first complete game of 1992, a 3-2 victory over the Cardinals, Bret Saberhagen calmly and economically posted eight shutout innings in what became a 4-3, 14-inning loss at Busch Stadium. 
 The Cardinals, after being held scoreless for 13 innings, scored four runs in the bottom of the 14th to negate Jeff Kent's three-run homer in the top of the inning.
Saberhagen, whose late-season quest has been more for peace of mind than any enhancement of statistics, pitched with blistering effectiveness. He required only 86 pitches to dispense with the Cardinals, allowing five hits and walking none.
So there could be life and power pitching after David Cone, after all.
"Can I be a quality starter game after game for the Mets next season?" Gooden asked tonight. "Yeah. They can rely on that."
"Myself, Saberhagen, Sid, Schourek, it's a solid four," said Gooden. "We'll need a fifth, and none of the big three will be able to have an off year. We'll have to set the tone."
The tenor of Saberhagen's return after his second setback with a problematic right index finger has heightened and sweetened of late. He started last week againt Montreal, working five capable innings and blowing away enough Expos to rekindle the excitement he had brought to the first third of this season. And tonight, he wasn't overpowering, but he was phenomenally adequate. He could undoubtedly have gone deeper into the game.
 
Aha! A Curveball!
 As for Gooden, his resurgence has been distinguished most intriguingly by his precious bit of discovery in a season of personal turmoil and professional mediocrity. Gooden has found his curveball.
"I can't even tell you the exact moment I felt I had it back," said Gooden. "But it's there, and it's right."
As a result, Gooden feels at least close to whole on the mound. And as a consequence of that, Gooden discovered himself on the field at Busch Stadium Wednesday night, the game over, nine innings on the scoreboard, the baseball still in his hand. It was his first complete game since June 1991.
"He's at the highest point of his season," said Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach for the Mets. "The consistency on his fastball is better. His release point is better. Best, the quality of pitches he's making when ahead in the count is much greater. He makes mistakes still, but not nearly as many."
It has been a season of scandal and embarrassment and fear and failure for Gooden.
"It's been worse than 1987," said Gooden, who missed a chunk of that season in rehabilitation for substance abuse. "There was the spring, Darryl's book, the shoulder. Bam, bam, bam."
The personal thumping has been replaced by the crackling of his curveball.
"I'll throw it in any spot now, three, four times in a row," said Gooden. "Early in the season, guys would see it and know I couldn't get it over. It was big and lazy and wild. They started to cheat on my fastball. And that, because of the shoulder, wasn't what it should have been, either."
Fresher, better equipped, Gooden began to last longer, to work easy innings, to humble lineups again. Since Aug. 2, Gooden has gone at least seven innings in seven of his eight starts.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 JOHN FRANCO will fly to Birmingham, Ala., Friday to be examined by Dr. JAMES ANDREWS. The closer for the Mets, who was set to have surgery to repair a damaged tendon in his pitching elbow after a recent diagnosis by the club's doctor, has wanted a second opinion. . . . DWIGHT GOODEN, saying his emotional allegiance was with nephew GARY SHEFFIELD of San Diego, said his baseball mind told him Pittsburgh's BARRY BONDS deserved the National League's most valuable player award. "He's earned every statistic he's got," Gooden said of Bonds. "No one pitches to him."

HEADLINE: Is Enlightened Ice Age Ushering In the 90's?

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
So Wayne Gretzky glides off the ice at about the same time that Manon Rheaume glides on. Is this the coincidence of a superstar's bad back and an expansion team's good publicity, or is it the face-off metaphor of the season? Could it mean that such faded stars as Gretzky, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Mike Tyson and Joe Montana will be replaced by someone newer and more interesting? Or could it actually mean that the Gross 80's are over in sports, that an era of explosive growth, traditional heroes and a school for scandal is finally giving way to the Net 90's reckoning over money, sex and morals?
Manon Rheaume became the first woman to play in one of the four major pro sports leagues last Wednesday night, spending a period in goal for the Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition game. That ice hockey made the breakthrough is significant; the weakest economically of the four major team sports, it also has the greatest potential to reach out and lure new fans, women as well as men. Meanwhile, there is a curious sense of stagnation among the others. Are they mature industries that have gone as far as they can, or is this just a period of retrenchment before the next leap forward? 
 One needs to be a football fan these days to follow that bouncing ball. The N.F.L. seems to have purged itself of the alkies, glass-eaters and 'roid rangers that once made it clownishly engaging (remember the Boz?), but without Hero Quarterbacks to replace them, it's all 'toons. While Montana, the Last Throwback, is still throwing in practice, it seems increasingly unlikely that his 14th season will happen. Montana, handsome, marketable, a scandal-free team player who performed hurt, was a direct descendant of Joe Namath who proves that everything old becomes new again. NFL Properties has just hired Old Joe as its signal-caller.
After pro basketball declared victory in Operation Olympic Storm (with no collateral damage, Nikes and Reeboks were fired into every country in the world), Bird retired and Magic floated a trial balloon about playing in New York. His confusion (or changing tactics) cooled the passion for Magic. What is he up to? When will he stand up and talk about why his plan to "be a spokesman for the virus" went awry? What happened to the President's Commission? Is Magic quiet because he's got a book coming out (smart publishing money says the Christmas bio sweeps will go to Schwarzkopf) or because of his return to active duty?
(Here's one marker of basketball fandom: At the wonderful SportsBooks store in L.A. several months ago, no one was buying Magic's book on AIDS and there was a run on signed copies of Jim Valvano's autobiography after reports he was undergoing cancer treatment, a logical extension of that Gross 80's symptom, the card show.)
Michael Jordan is still out there, of course, but his one-dimensionality gets old. On court he's a windup toy, off court he's a cardboard cutout to pose with. Time to get interested in Michael again when he joins the pro golf tour, even more when he joins the senior pro golf tour.
Baseball's most interesting 80's characters are not in the game, although former President Nixon is campaigning for Pete Rose's reinstatement on the "forgiveness" platform. That makes sense, but why doesn't he stump for Steinbrenner, too? And George will remember Dick when he triumphantly wades ashore next season. Meanwhile, the demonization of George has its flip side, the deification of Fay Vincent, who seems to have gotten more popular in the media since his dumping; he's shopping his autobiography now.
Baseball's playing heroes, Brett, Ripken, Puckett, are merely splendid players, while the more interesting likes of Jose Canseco, Rob Dibble and David Cone should be tested for testosterone poisoning. Darryl Strawberry will never make it mega; once the greatest prospect in the game, he was brought up too soon, for commercial reasons, and seasoned too fast and hot. Nelson Doubleday should donate his piece of the Mets to a mental health center for baseball players.
Which brings us back to the Only True Sport, ice hockey, secure enough in its manhood to let a woman play. Can you imagine what Adam Graves would do to any opposing player who hit a female teammate of his? The new rule in which wearing helmets is optional may be in preparation for female players.
This is all in refreshing contrast to tonight's show in Las Vegas in which Jimmy Connors, that mouthy momma's boy, plays Martina Navratilova in a retrograde, very 80's attempt to evoke the Bobby Riggs-Billie Jean King match of Sept. 20, 1973, which opened the 70's in sport, the Title IX decade of joyous progress for women stymied in the 80's, which some believe began when Larry Holmes beat Muhammad Ali on Oct. 2, 1980, and ended on June 11, 1992, when Evander Holyfield beat Arnold Schwarzenegger in bowling. Bowling!

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Bush Constitution

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
President Bush's veto of the family leave bill, announced at night to avoid public notice, actually deserves close attention. For it gives us an insight into Mr. Bush's view of what government should do in our society -- his view of politics and the Constitution.
The legislation would require employers of 50 or more people to grant them 12 weeks of unpaid leave for births or family emergencies. He was vetoing it, Mr. Bush's message said, because "we must have flexibility in our workplace to meet the challenge" of foreign economic competition. 
 Most major industrial countries have far more rigorous laws, requiring paid family leave. So Mr. Bush must have meant that, to compete, this country must allow worse working conditions.
But the President went on to make what was really a constitutional point. Policies on family leave, he said, must be "crafted at the workplace and not in Washington D.C."
That opposition to Federal action echoed what Vice President Quayle said on the MacNeil/Lehrer News hour last month. "If you start . . . having the government more involved" in such things as leave policy, he said, "I don't know where it stops. After we get through sick leave, what are you going to do, go to pensions, are you going to go to pay?"
The Federal Government has of course been involved for many years in pay and pensions. Since the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, it has set minimum wages and maximum hours. More recently there has been Federal pension reform legislation.
Could Dan Quayle have been ignorant of all that? Yes, he could. But he and President Bush could also be signaling a new conservative effort to undo Federal rules that protect the workplace.
The idea that the Federal Government should have no role in regulating working conditions would take us back 60 years. It is especially curious when you compare it with another Bush-Quayle proposal: Federal legislation to make radical changes in the country's civil injury law.
Our law on civil injuries (torts) has traditionally been made by state courts and legislatures, not by the Federal Government. The Bush-Quayle proposal would sweep away that tradition. For example, it would impose on all states the British doctrine that the losing party in a lawsuit pays the winner's legal fees.
Mr. Quayle's advisers, wanting something positive for him to do, came up with the idea of "tort reform." He touted the plan as a way to discourage expensive litigation, which he said cost us $300 billion a year. (The Quayle people, when asked, could provide no basis for that figure, which The Economist of London called "simply false." They evidently invented it.)
The real effect of the "reform" is likely to be to hurt ordinary middle-class people who are injured. For the British rule makes it much harder for them to sue when they are the victims of medical malpractice or defective industrial processes.
Consider a man disabled by what he says were toxic chemicals in a plant where he worked. If he sues, the company's lawyers will naturally go all out in its defense, running up big fees. If the disabled employee loses before a jury, he will be ordered to pay those fees. So suing over dangerous working conditions or products would be to gamble on bankruptcy.
It is striking, too, that Mr. Bush takes such a narrow view of what the Federal Government should do at the workplace while favoring a highly intrusive Federal role on sex and reproduction. He wants, and has achieved, Federal rules that deny many women access even to advice on abortion.
What it comes down to is this. In Mr. Bush's view of politics and the Constitution, employees have to win family leave and other rights in free-market bargaining with their employers. The Federal Government has no proper role there, but it should take over tort law and regulate sexual matters in this country.
Perhaps it takes George Bush and Dan Quayle too seriously to see some principle in their position on these issues. In all likelihood they are merely offering excuses to support the interests that support them: corporate employers, tort defendants, the Christian right. But it is important to see their lofty arguments for what they are, and for where they would take us.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Hello Again, Suckers

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
H. Ross Perot, having betrayed and suckered millions of Americans, is giving them one more chance to be betrayed and suckered again.
Before he cut and ran, the most attractive part of the first Ross Perot campaign was the people who believed in him, the volunteers. 
 They did not know much about Mr. Perot. Carefully and skillfully, he avoided telling them much. But they created his image out of their own desires and dreams.
If they had been hateful, if their desires had meant hurting or demeaning others, that could have been frightening. But I never saw a hate-placard. Neither, in conversation and correspondence, did I see or hear the belittling words and code language of the political nasties.
These people had a yearning, shared by so many other Americans, to take our politicians by the shoulder and shake them until they listened.
They did not want to tear America apart. They wanted change forward to new political ideas, but also change back to what they considered America had been and should be -- true, compassionate, clean. That kind of thing.
Sometimes outsiders who were uncertain about their eventual Presidential choice, but were unhappy with both parties, deluded themselves about the Perot movement. They thought that whatever his obvious shortcomings, at least Mr. Perot must share the passion of his followers for political decency and faithfulness.
So Americans gave more grace to him than to other candidates, particularly the grace of time. We kept waiting for Mr. Perot to put proposals and ideas where his ever-busy mouth was. Of course he never did, possessing neither the intellect nor the courage.
He just quit before putting anything on the table. He could not handle what every politician, every adult must handle -- the knowledge that he could not control the world. Sometimes it insists on testing you, questioning, challenging, defying, demanding accounting.
And he knew his advisers and employees were preparing proposals that would do what he had said he wanted -- ask sacrifice from almost all of American society. His bluff was being called.
So he concocted a few phony excuses, quit and ran out.
But he does not even have the class to stay out. After awhile he looked back, figured that he could now run on the political cheap. He would be risking nothing, daring nothing, and he would be getting all that TV time and press attention again. A fellow comes to miss that stuff.
So here he is again -- boasting about that tough economic plan, now a paperback best seller. And here he is again, prattling cynically about how his "volunteer movement" will make the decision about his running.
Both are true only to Mr. Perot's desire to get something for nothing. His economic platform is neither his nor a platform. He never adopted, debated or ran on it when he was a real candidate.
Now he has the exquisite gall to demand that the two legitimate candidates meet or match it. He knows he will never have to face a Congress with those proposals for higher taxes and lower benefits. They will remain safely in paperback.
And he knows that his "volunteer movement" is being manipulated by Dallas professionals and paid signature hunters. Ross Perot will decide finally if Ross Perot runs officially. He will pay no more attention to the desires of the volunteers than the day he deserted them.
The Bush and Clinton people have done nothing braver about Mr. Perot than sidle up to him. What? Upset his followers by telling the truth -- this man is telling you folks to bend over again so he can plant one more boot in your backside?
Obviously Ross Perot will not win. Democrats think the Governor is so far ahead that any defections to Ross Perot won't hurt much. They could be wrong; known to happen.
Mr. Bush could lose enough voters in Texas, Florida or New Jersey to guarantee them to Mr. Clinton. Losing any state to a genuine contender is one thing. Losing states to an in-and-out con man would not only unfairly hurt Mr. Bush but would besmirch American politics.
So listening to Mr. Perot now stirs the same stomach quease as listening to a lecture on moral principles from a defrocked clergyman. It is not only himself he degrades, but the congregation -- and the very words he utters.

HEADLINE: Do Government Rogues Traffic in Drugs?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Why is it that any time there is a voice suggesting there might be a connection between drug trafficking and rogue elements of our Government, there is a powerful one like A. M. Rosenthal's ("Movies, Drugs, Elections," column, Sept. 11) to deny this voice with catch phrases like "left-wing paranoia." 
 Now Mr. Rosenthal may not agree with the character who implies this in my movie "Bob Roberts," but certainly he can't tell me he hasn't heard these words before. If he hasn't, I suggest he read "The Politics of Heroin" by Alfred McCoy and "Acid Dreams: The C.I.A., LSD and the 60's Rebellion" by Martin A. Lee and Bruce Shlain, two exhaustively researched books that show connections between agencies of our Government and the proliferation of drug abuse in our country.
Certainly we need centers on addiction and drug abuse like those proposed by former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph A. Califano, but more important, we need to begin providing a viable economic alternative to the drug business in areas where drug use is so prevalent.
We need tougher investigative journalism to start addressing, in some way, the common knowledge of the streets: that the war on drugs is being waged on the user, not the supplier, and that the war cannot be won because there is no will to find the source.
Mr. Rosenthal may not believe that the source is in any way connected to rogue operatives within Government, but a great many people do, and until he is able to refute these beliefs in more definitive terms than taking cheap shots at movies, people will continue to believe the charge.
Everything in "Bob Roberts" is something I have heard in America, on all sides of the political spectrum. Nothing is proved, there are no definitive answers, only questions raised. These questions might make Mr. Rosenthal uncomfortable, but maybe that is their purpose. It does no good to deny these frustrated, inquisitive voices a forum.

HEADLINE: Clinton Hits Hard in New Jersey (Close), Relaxes in New York (Ahead)

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RAHWAY, N.J., Sept. 24

 BODY:
About 2,000 people came to hear Gov. Bill Clinton talk about health care at the Merck & Company headquarters here today, and with egalitarian self-interest, each came with a personal agenda for the candidate to address.
Gloria McGinty, a logistics controller at the big pharmaceutical concern, cares for her 84-year-old mother-in-law and she wanted to know if Governor Clinton shared her view that Medicaid coverage is unfair to the ailing elderly who receive home care. Wesley L. Shoop, a parasitologist in the Merck laboratories, was interested in whether the candidate's proposals to control medical costs would suppress pharmaceutical research investments. Charles L. Garay, president of a small air purification products plant on Hazelwood Avenue who is paying $500 a month in health-insurance premiums for his 75 employees, said suppressing medical costs was all he wanted to hear about. 
 They were the kinds of people that the Clinton-Gore campaign wanted to attract when, some time last week, they decided to schedule a major address on health-care issues in northern New Jersey.
It was not lost on local and state Democrats that President Bush made three visits to northern New Jersey since the campaign began, most recently to the Lincoln Technical Institute a few miles away in Union Township. This was Mr. Clinton's second visit, and was intended to counter President Bush's courtship of a state that has not voted Democratic in a Presidential race since Lyndon B. Johnson beat Barry M. Goldwater in 1964.
This time, however, the Democrats can smell a victory in the Garden State. "We are going to win it," declared Chester Holmes, a Rahway Councilman, who was here today.
A Star Ledger/Eagleton Poll taken Sept. 9-16 reported Mr. Clinton leading Mr. Bush 52 to 39 percent among those interviewed who said they were registered voters, a reversal of the candidates' standings in May, when Mr. Bush led by a wide margin.
The State Democratic Party picked Merck for the speech because it is a corporate leader in health-care policy issues, and because it offers "the kind of high-tech jobs Clinton is talking about creating," said Raymond J. Lesniak, a State Senator from Elizabeth and chairman of the State Democratic Committee.
"Little Rock called us and said they wanted to visit North Jersey and that they wanted the Governor to address health-care issues," Mr. Lesniak said, "and between Little Rock and here, we decided that Merck would be a good location, because it's a good company for New Jersey."
 
Inflation Rate Limits Prices
 And, he did not have to add, it has a company chairman, Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, who has long been active in Democratic Party politics, as well as a corporate policy of limiting price increases on most drugs to the rate of inflation, an important element in Mr. Clinton's health plan.
The local politicians were gratified that Governor Clinton invited Gov. Jim Florio, who is in trouble in the state because of his tax increases, to share the platform.
"Governor Clinton is standing by Florio, whatever the Republicans say," said Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's spokesman.
Most of the arrangements appear to have been worked out between the Clinton headquarters in Little Rock, Ark., and Governor Florio's office in Trenton. It was Mr. Florio's office that called the State and Community Relations department at Merck on Tuesday and asked for an invitation, said Kevin Colgan, a Merck spokesman. The speech outline was faxed from Little Rock at 9:23 this morning.
"It generally works this way," Mr. Shure said. "The strategy comes from Little Rock, the message comes from Little Rock and the geography comes from Little Rock. Then the people on the ground work out where is the best place to deliver the message."
 
Universal Health Coverage
 Mr. Clinton's speech stressed the day-to-day problems of Americans struggling with a health care system that he said was delivering inflated costs and reduced insurance. He spelled out his plan for universal health coverage with employer- or government-sponsored insurance. Prices would be controlled by state panels of business and medical experts, and insurance companies would have to take all applicants regardless of their age or health.
Except for some students from Montclair State College who were ejected for interrupting Mr. Clinton's speech by shouting slogans, the only mishap occurred after the speech, when a baby held up by its admiring mother threw up on Mr. Clinton's jacket front.
"That's what babies do," Mr. Clinton said cheerfully.
Mrs. McGinty said she was impressed with his speech: "I was leaning toward Mr. Clinton and I guess I'm leaning a little bit more."
Dr. Shoop, the parasitologist, said: "He came much closer to the middle than I expected. I thought we would hear much more of the 'Government can solve everything/New Deal' kind of thing. I was glad to hear him say that private enterprise has to stay in the center of this issue. But he's got a problem with putting limits on pharmaceutical prices. You can't cut income without hurting research."
But price controls were just what Mr. Garay, the businessman, wanted to hear.
"I'm still open-minded on who I'll vote for," he said, "but I sure like Clinton's platform on controlling medical costs, because that's what's eating up my business."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 29, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about an appearance by Gov. Bill Clinton at the headquarters of Merck & Company in Rahway, N.J., referred imprecisely to an invitation from Merck, which was solicited by the office of Gov. Jim Florio. Mr. Florio's office asked that Merck invite Mr. Clinton to appear, not that Mr. Florio be included.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ross Perot;
BUSH AND CLINTON TO SEND EMISSARIES TO PEROT MEETING

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

 BODY:
Responding to broad hints that Ross Perot will soon re-enter the Presidential race, President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton said yesterday that they would send emissaries to Dallas on Monday to talk to the Texas billionaire's followers. Each group of emissaries will try to convince the gathering that its candidate is the better alternative to a Perot candidacy.
Officials from both the Republican and Democratic campaigns said they had accepted an invitation from Mr. Perot to address a gathering on Monday of state leaders of United We Stand, America, the organization Mr. Perot set up and financed after he quit the Presidential contest on July 16. Mr. Perot will also attend the meetings. 
 Campaigning in Chicago today, Mr. Bush told reporters that he would be sending Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee; Senator Phil Gramm of Texas; Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Robert M. Teeter, chairman of the President's re-election committee, and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser. Mr. Bush's representatives will address the group for two hours starting at 10 A.M. on Monday at a Dallas hotel.
 
Next, the Democrats
 Later that afternoon, the group will hear from the Arkansas Governor's emissaries. They will be Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma; Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Vernon Jordan, a Washington lawyer and former head of the National Urban League, and Mickey Kantor, chairman of the Clinton campaign.
The meetings will be closed to reporters and will not be taped. Officials with Mr. Perot's group said the audience would comprise one state coordinator from each of the 50 states. It is unclear whether the group will take any votes on whether to endorse either Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton.
 
Achieving His Goal
 The announcement yesterday by the two major parties that they would take part in the Perot volunteers' meeting further confused a political race that had been blurred all spring by the Texas billionaire's involvement, but had seemed to clarify after he pulled out two months ago. The willingness of the two campaigns to participate seemed to indicate that they had assurances that Mr. Perot's next step was not predetermined.
When he pulled out on the last day of the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Perot said it was less important for him to win the Presidency than it was for him to influence the debate and to make the major parties pay attention to his ideas and his grass-roots organization. The agreement by Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton to send representatives to Dallas makes it clear that Mr. Perot may finally be achieving that goal.
The executive director of the volunteers' group, Orson Swindle, yesterday denied a report in The Los Angeles Times that Mr. Perot would announce he was resuming his bid for the White House on CNN's "Larry King Live" television show Monday night.
"It's not true," Mr. Swindle said. "The unidentified source is truly unidentified and uninformed."
Further complicating a Presidential campaign that has become the most unusual in years and has just over five weeks to go, a top Republican on the Commission on Presidential Debates said yesterday that should Mr. Perot enter the race and the President continue his refusal to participate in debates sponsored by the commission, it is possible a debate might take place without Mr. Bush.
"If Bill Clinton agrees and George Bush doesn't agree, it will be just Clinton and Perot Oct. 4 in San Diego," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., former chairman of the Republican National Committee and co-chairman of the five-member, bipartisan debate commission. Mr. Clinton has already accepted the proposed format of having a single moderator. Mr. Bush, saying he would prefer involving a panel of questioners, has so far declined to participate in any commission-sponsored debates.
Mr. Fahrenkopf said that if Mr. Perot announced his candidacy on Monday the commission would determine if he met the criteria to be included in the debate. "If he meets the criteria, we have to invite him," Mr. Fahrenkopf said. "Next week could be an interesting week."
 
Support Put at 90%
 Speculation has been rampant that the mercurial Texan would once again challenge for the Presidency since he said on Tuesday that his decision to drop out of the race was a "mistake." Mr. Perot also said he wanted the state coordinators of his organization to poll their membership to determine if they wanted him to once again pursue the Presidency.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Swindle said the group had "been canvassing literally thousands and thousands of people, and 90 percent say they want him to."
But so far, Mr. Perot has given no indication that he actually wants to serve as President, or whether his efforts in recent months to get himself on the ballot and in recent days to inject himself into the campaign are all designed to bend the political process to his and his volunteers' will.
In recent weeks he has said that he may re-enter the race, but only as a means to insure that his campaign commercials are broadcast by the television networks. Federal regulations require television stations to permit political candidates to buy "reasonable" amounts of time for advertising. The regulations also require the stations to sell this time to candidates at the lowest rates paid by commercial advertisers. The stations have no obligation to sell advertising time to private individuals.
"I think he is trying to get the attention of the two parties," said James Squires, who was director of communications for the Perot Petition Committee. "He is saying to them: 'I don't want to do it. Don't make me do it.' "
 
Waning Influence
 Yet, Mr. Perot's flexing of political muscle comes when public opinion polls indicate that his stature has drastically diminished. A CBS News Poll released yesterday indicates that more voters have a negative opinion of Mr. Perot than at any time since he began flirting with the idea of running for President in February.
In the telephone survey of 1,758 registered voters, conducted Tuesday through Thursday, 47 percent said they had a negative view of Mr. Perot, 15 percent said they held him in a favorable light, 20 percent were undecided and 17 percent said they did not know enough to have an opinion. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Still, the two parties are apparently concerned about the perception that would be created if they refused to meet with a group of ordinary citizens, brought together under Mr. Perot's auspices.
In recent days, Mr. Perot has met with James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, and Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman. In those meetings Mr. Perot extended the invitation for the candidates to send representatives to Dallas to meet with his group.
 
Chance to 'Explain the Deficit'
 When asked why he was allowing Mr. Perot to drag him into a process that is not officially part of a Presidential campaign, Mr. Bush, campaigning in Chicago yesterday, said, "We were invited down to explain the deficit, and any chance we can talk to 50 people, less or more, about our plan for reducing the deficit, which is far better than Governor Clinton's plan for reducing the deficit, why, that's what we want to do."
Mr. Clinton said it was "fine with me" if Mr. Perot runs, and added, "I think he's got a real contribution to make to the country, and if he wants to get back in the race, that's up to him, but I think there are all kinds of ways that he can contribute."
In addition to the television appearance Monday night with Mr. King, Mr. Perot has agreed to appear on the NBC program "Today" on Monday and Tuesday mornings.
Mr. Perot's economic plan, as outlined in his recently published book, "United We Stand," contains a mix of tax increases and spending cuts that could be difficult to sell politically.
It includes increasing the gasoline taxes, raising the marginal income tax rates on the affluent to 33 percent from 31 percent and increasing fees for timber and mining. It also calls for tax increases on Social Security benefits for retired people with incomes of more than $25,000 a year for individuals and $32,000 a year for those filing jointly.

HEADLINE: Court Grants Boy Wish to Select His Parents

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 25

 BODY:
Gregory Kingsley, the determined 12-year-old boy who went to court to change his parents, realized his goal today when a juvenile court judge here ended the parental rights of his natural mother and allowed the boy's foster parents to adopt him.
The ruling by Thomas S. Kirk, a state circuit court judge, is believed to be the first time in which family rights were ended based on a legal action brought by a child. 
 After completing the unusual two-day trial at 7 P.M., Judge Kirk ruled that it was in the boy's best interests to take him from his mother, a 30-year-old unemployed waitress. He then approved the boy's adoption by George H. and Lizabeth Russ, who have been his foster parents since October.
The judge discounted testimony today that the youth's natural mother, Rachel Kingsley, had given up her children to foster care three times in the last few years for economic reasons, and each time had planned to give them up temporarily while she got back on her feet. In fact, Gregory lived with his mother for only seven months in the last eight years.
The judge said that "by clear and convincing evidence, almost beyond a reasonable doubt, the child has been abandoned and neglected by his mother and that it is in his manifest best interest" that Ms. Kingsley's parental rights be terminated so that Gregory can be adopted by the Russes.
Lawyers for Gregory's natural mother, who was not in the courtroom when the verdict was announced, said later that they planned to appeal the judge's decision to Florida's Fifth District Court of Appeals in Daytona Beach.
As soon as the judge ruled, Gregory turned back and smiled at Mrs. Russ. A moment later they hugged. Afterward, his family gave him a baseball cap and shirt embroidered with the number 9 to indicate that he is is their ninth child. When he took the witness stand today, the boy identified himself as Gregory Kingsley, even though the court papers were filed under the name Gregory K.
The New York Times, which usually avoids identifying children in court cases, has not previously published Gregory Kingsley's full name. But protecting his privacy is no longer an issue since his name is being used in court, with some of the proceedings broadcast live. His lawyer, noting that the name has been broadly disseminated, says he is not asking that it be withheld.
 
Bruising Day in Court
 The judge's ruling came after a bruising day in court for Ms. Kingsley, who had been fighting for several months to keep from losing the oldest of her three sons. Despite the testimony of two experts that she had improved her life and could provide a nurturing home for Gregory, Ms. Kinglsey at several moments in the trial was holding back tears or dabbing her eyes as the youth testified that he "did not love her as a mom."
Ms. Kingsley had left the courtroom and was in her lawyer's office when Judge Kirk ruled. "He's always going to be my son," she said at a news conference. "I don't care what anyone says. I just want Gregory to know that I love him very much, and he's always welcome to come back home."
Gregory's natural father, Ralph Kingsley, did not contest the adoption.
During the trial, Gregory was on the stand for more than an hour today, his shoulders just barely rising above the witness stand. Exhibiting a presence and sophistication unusual for a boy his age, the dark-haired sixth grader explained how he had met his foster father during a visit to the youth center where he had been placed.
Gregory said that for almost two years while he was in foster care his mother never visited, called or wrote to him. "I just thought she forgot about me," he said on the stand in an unemotional voice. Later he explained that after he was taken from foster care the first time, his mother had promised him he would never have to go back again. He was placed in foster homes twice after that, and Gregory testified that that was what had changed his feelings about his mother.
 
'She Didn't Care Any More'
 "I just thought she didn't care any more," he said, staring straight at his lawyer, Jerri A. Blair, and not turning to look at his natural mother 20 feet away. "I figured that if she breaks her promise she just doesn't care very much."
Earlier Mr. Russ had taken the stand and was questioned about wanting to adopt Gregory and encouraging the boy to take the route of suing to end his relationship with his natural mother. Mr. Russ said that when he first saw the boy on a visit to the boys shelter in Lake County as a member of a government commission on the needs of children, he noticed Gregory sitting by himself and could not get him out of his mind.
Mr. Russ said Gregory reminded him of his own younger brother, who had been in the care of their father, an alcoholic, after their mother died when he was 11. Mr. Russ, who was 23 at the time, said he had stolen his brother away and taken him to live with a sister rather than leave him with a father who would not take care of him.
After the trial, Mr. Russ said, "Let the law protect real families, not families in name only."
Mr. Russ's wife, Lizabeth, said on the stand that she feels sorry for Ms. Kingsley because she understood that the woman had been a victim of neglect as a child.
"I can't but feel that if she had a different childhood she'd be a different mother and this wouldn't be happening to her," Mrs. Russ said.
A number of witnesses appeared today to vouch for Ms. Kingsley's recent attempts to turn her life around. Among them was her father, Jimmy Maxwell Sutton, of Laurie, Mo., who said that after his first wife died when Rachel was 9 years old, she had helped him raise his other children.
Mr. Sutton's gravelly voice quivered at one point when he said he thought that his daughter deserved a break.
"She's had enough abuse, you know?" he said from the witness stand. "She's a victim of abuse here too." He said he believed the legal system had failed to protect his daughter's rights.
Even during the most intimate and disturbing testimony, Gregory seemed to remain in good spirits. He could often be seen playing a a hand-held electronic game. He and his foster sisters exchanged hard candy and after a break he returned to the courtroom drinking Mountain Dew.
A stark difference was apparent between Gregory and one of Ms. Kinglsey's other children, 11-year-old Jeremiah, who still lives with her. In contrast to Gregory's cool and easy-going manner, Jeremiah, appeared awkward and uncomfortable. Wearing a white suit whose sleeves were too short, he raised his left hand when Judge Kirk asked him to raise his right hand.
Jeremiah has been undergoing counseling and medical treatment for medical and emotional disorders.
Gregory's case has drawn widespread attention. Mr. Russ said that 15 television and movie producers had called him, and that an independent lawyer would handle those negotiations. Mr. Russ, a lawyer who represented himself in the trial, said he had talked to Gregory about taking the unusual step of seeking the right to sue because he feared that the state might take Gregory out of the Russ home if Mr. Russ had sued in his own name.
At the time, the state planned to reunite Gregory with his mother. Since then, the state has changed position and favored adoption by the Russes.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Fell In August

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
New orders for durable goods fell in August, the third drop in four months, the Commerce Department said today, reflecting a surprising degree of business caution and arousing fresh doubts about economic recovery.
The one-tenth of 1 percent decline was considerably more serious than it appeared, analysts said, not only because they had expected a rebound from July's sizable drop but also because of its widespread nature and the fact that orders sank 3.7 percent when military equipment was excluded. 
 While airplanes and tanks generate real jobs and income, purchases of them result from political and national-security considerations rather than economic ones.
 
A 'Discomfort Quotient' Rises
 "My discomfort quotient has gone up," said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Company. The Commerce Department's report "is just full of negatives."
Traders also perceived the report as negative, with stock prices suffering. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.55 points, to 3,250.32, extending its loss for the week to 76.73 points. But the negative news was positive for the bond market, which rose sharply. [Page 41.]
Figures the National Association of Realtors published today showed that sales of existing homes slipped 3.2 percent, to an annual pace of 3.34 million, last month despite the lowest mortgage rates since the early 1970's.
And another set of Commerce Department figures showed that personal income slumped one-half of 1 percent in August as the effects of Hurricane Andrew more than offset what would otherwise have been a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent. Personal spending eased one-tenth of 1 percent.
 
Speculation of Fed Cut
 Mainly because of the decline in orders for durable goods -- a category of goods intended to last at least three years and including products as varied as videocassette recorders and jet engines -- speculation intensified that the Federal Reserve would decide to cut interest rates yet again.
Some analysts, in fact, did not rule out the possibility of a cut before next Friday's eagerly awaited report on the September job market, the final tally before Election Day. If the Fed does provide another dose of monetary stimulus, many analysts predict it would consist of a one-half-point cut in its discount rate and a quarter-point- cut in Federal funds, the overnight lending rate among commercial banks. Both now stand at 3 percent.
This, in turn, would almost certainly drive down the banks' prime lending rate, stuck at 6 percent since early summer.
Today's figures suggest "a very modest, lackluster recovery," said Roger M. Kubarych of Henry Kaufman & Company. "There's no sector that's leading the way," he added, pointing to one private survey of 30 industries that showed only a handful planning to raise investment by more than 5 percent in the year ahead.
The figures on durable goods showed not only weak orders last month but also a 1 percent drop in shipments and an eight-tenths of 1 percent drop in unfilled orders.
Like new orders, the fall in shipments was the third in the latest four months, while the decline in backlogs, a predictive indicator, was the 12th in a row.
 
A Terse Assessment
 "Bad," said Samuel D. Kahan of Fuju Bank, when asked to characterize the report. He said he did not think the economy was slipping back into recession, whose end most analysts still suggest will be placed in 1991, but he said there was no longer any margin for error.
"We are vulnerable to a shock," Mr. Kahan said, such as a default, a run on the dollar or a political development.
Orders for electronic equipment fell 4 percent in August while declines amounted to 1.4 percent in primary metals and six-tenths of 1 percent for industrial machinery and equipment. Transportation equipment jumped 4.2 percent, but this regained only about one-third of July's decline.
For military orders, a relatively small segment, the advance was 16.7 percent following a 21.5 percent skid in July.
New orders in capital goods industries slumped four-tenths of 1 percent over-all but dropped 2.9 percent for nonmilitary business excluding aircraft and parts.
Total orders for July were revised to show a somewhat lesser decline -- 2.7 percent instead of the 3.4 percent initially reported. The August total was $119.7 billion, down from $119.8 billion, the department found.
The consensus economic forecast had been for a 1.6 percent increase in August, and the small decline was considered a bad sign for employment at factories, business investment and economic growth generally.
Durable goods looked strong at the start of the year, but they faded after April. The lack of growth in orders has kept manufacturers from hiring, and the poor job market, in turn, has made consumers cautious about buying the big-ticket items that make up the durable-goods report.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Vetoes Abortion Bill And Backs Federal Pay Cut

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 25

 BODY:
President Bush announced two legislative actions this evening, vetoing a bill that would have permitted abortion counseling in federally financed clinics and asking Congress to approve a pay cut for the highest paid Federal employees, including the President.
The legislative documents were hurriedly issued by the White House press office as the President was preparing to leave here after a day of campaigning. Both announcements were made after the network news programs had already been prepared. The hour of disclosure assured that they would receive minimum press exposure, but in each case it was for a different reason. 
 In the case of the veto, the President was rejecting a bill that would lift the so-called "gag rule," which prohibits physicians and other workers in clinics that receive Federal money from counseling patients about the availability of abortions.
It was the second time this week that Mr. Bush had issued a veto on a difficult political issue in the evening. Last Tuesday he vetoed a bill after 9 P.M. that would have required employers to provide medical and personal emergency leaves.
 
'Symbol of Our Understanding'
 In the case of the pay cut proposal, the White House seemed eager to attract as little attention as possible to the proposed legislation. Mr. Bush had initially vowed in a campaign speech to carry out the pay cut on his own, as an executive action. But the White House later discovered to its chagrin that he did not have the legal authority to do that.
Although the White House announcement said the pay cut would be "a symbol of our understanding of the concerns of so many Americans," the President sent the proposal to Congress with the knowledge that it would not receive any action before the election, and in any case would only apply to the next Administration, whether Mr. Bush's or that of his challenger, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Earlier today, Mr. Bush said Democrats were captives of the "government elite" and preoccupied with playing by a set of old rules, and he charged that Mr. Clinton's policies would cripple business competition.
Speaking to employees at the suburban headquarters of the Motorola Corporation and to a conference of executives involved in the research and development of high technology, Mr. Bush made an edgy and defensive assault on Mr. Clinton, who he said failed to promote new business approaches as Governor of Arkansas.
Mr. Bush said that Mr. Clinton had failed to improve his state's education system, was indecisive on major issues and that even his best intentions would be stunted by "pork-happy partisans" in Congress.
"He and his advisers talk about industrial policies, economic plans designed by a government elite," he told the Motorola conference in Schaumburg. "And the planners dictate the terms, pick winners. If you're lucky, they let the private sector have a piece of the action. And all of it is paid for with new tax dollars from the middle class."
The President's criticism of Mr. Clinton's record on education -- an issue on which he has praised the Governor in the past -- was a departure for Mr. Bush. "Three-quarters of Arkansas's high school graduates needed remedial education when they get to college," Mr. Bush said. "And so it's off for him to talk about high tech when the residents of his state have to worry about getting out of high school."
The Clinton campaign immediately dismissed Mr. Bush's remarks. George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, cited the endorsements Mr. Clinton has received from 400 corporate executives.
"If Bill Clinton's so bad for the high-tech industry, why are all the leading high-tech companies supporting him?" he said.

HEADLINE: Kohl Says Monetary Line Aids Unity

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today rejected attempts to blame German economic and monetary policy for the recent turmoil on European currency markets and said he would press for rapid political and economic union in the European Community.
"Germany is our fatherland; Europe is our future," Mr. Kohl told the German Parliament. His remarks only obliquely acknowledged the concern about being overwhelmed by Germany that underlay much of the opposition to the treaty on European Community monetary and political union, which was narrowly supported in a referendum in France on Sunday. 
 Instead, he insisted almost defiantly that Germans had been good Europeans even by keeping their currency so strong that Britain and Italy were forced to suspend participation in the European Monetary System.
Mr. Kohl had many warm words for France, especially for the referendum's endorsement of the treaty on European union agreed to in the Dutch city of Maastricht in December, and his speech seemed bound to encourage speculation that a mini-union with France and Germany at its core might emerge if the larger proposal fails.
"The current problems," he said about the monetary turmoil, stemmed from "divergent economic developments among member states that have arisen over the long term."
 
'Stability Policy' Defended
 "One-sided accusations of responsibility are beside the point," he said. "The events of the past weeks were not the result of German stability policy. To the contrary, stability policy is the essential basis for confidence in the currency markets and for orderly currency relationships."
"Stability policy," in Germany, means a policy aimed at keeping inflation down, and it is the reason the independent German central bank has kept interest rates high even though Britain and the United States are pleading for lower ones.
The central bank's primary responsibility, Mr. Kohl said, "is and remains that of assuring the soundness of the currency in Germany," and his Government supported that goal.
But the leader of the Social Democratic opposition, Bjorn Engholm, said Mr. Kohl's Government was really to blame because the high interest rates would not have been necessary if the Government had correctly calculated the cost of German reunification. When these costs soared, the Government was forced into heavy deficit spending, and the inflationary tendencies of the deficit led the central bank to boost interest rates as a countermeasure.
 
Approval Seen This Year
 Mr. Kohl repeated his pledge that the German Parliament will ratify the treaty by the end of the year. "If we all do not now exploit the opportunity offered by the Maastricht treaty, the community will be set back by many years," he said. Under terms of the treaty, all 12 members of the European Community must ratify it either in their parliaments or by national referendum before it can take effect.
Just as Germany seized the moment in 1989 and 1990 and achieved unification, he said, Europe now had to push ahead. "Waiting would be the wrong answer, and standing still would be a step backwards," he said.
The Chancellor acknowledged that all European leaders would have to do more to make clear that in a united Europe, individual nations, regions and even cities would retain their own identities and control their own political future. The European Community's bureaucracy in Brussels would make only those decisions that could not be made more effectively at a lower level, he said.

HEADLINE: California Governor, in Reversal, Signs a Bill on Gay Rights in Jobs

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25

 BODY:
At a time when the debate over gay rights looms large in national politics, Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law today a measure that protects homosexuals against job discrimination.
The action by the Republican Governor, a year after he vetoed a similar bill, comes while other prominent Republicans are casting homosexuals as enemies of traditional family values. In the current climate, gay groups up and down the state were braced for another veto from Mr. Wilson and had mobilized for demonstrations this weekend, which will now be recast as celebrations. 
 The measure bans job-related discrimination based on sexual orientation for virtually all state and private workers, as last year's bill would have. It exempts religious organizations and businesses with fewer than five employees, and there is some confusion over whether teachers are covered or whether the state education code already protects them.
The measure departs from last year's by using a different administrative enforcement procedure, which Mr. Wilson said would be less burdensome to a business community staggered by recession.
 
Pessimism Reached Full Boil
 The pessimism of gay-rights advocates reached full boil during last month's Republican convention in Houston, when the podium rang with denouncements of homosexuals and the gay-rights movement. In addition, Oregon voters are considering a ballot measure that would classify homosexuality as "abnormal" and "perverse," and the House of Representatives on Thursday gutted a District of Columbia law that would have allowed city workers to obtain health benefits for their partners, of whatever sex.
But there have also been steps this week in the opposite direction. On Thursday, Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts granted gay state employees the same spousal bereavement rights as heterosexual couples and gave gay couples visitation rights in prisons and state hospitals. The Kentucky Supreme Court struck down the state's anti-sodomy law, ruling that it violated the constitutional privacy rights of homosexuals.
Many gay-rights advocates said those actions combined with Governor Wilson's surprise signature of the employment-protection bill are signs that the tide may be turning in their favor.
"I'm very optimistic," said Thomas B. Stoddard, a prominent gay-rights lawyer and former executive director of the Lamba Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York City. "This development, in combination with yesterday's developments, in combination with the political signs that the Republicans are throwing aside the family values message, suggests that the gay rights movement has finally tipped the scales."
His sentiments were echoed by David Smith, a spokesman for the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center in Los Angeles, organizer of tonight's celebration there. "The prime-time gay bashing in Houston sent shock waves across our community," Mr. Smith said. "It looked like the religious right was poised to take over the leadership of the country. But this indicates there's hope. It looks like they have not infiltrated the Republican Party to the extent we had thought."
The reaction to Governor Wilson's action today was equally impassioned among conservative lobbyists. The Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition in Anaheim, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Wilson had "opened the door for all kinds of special rights for perverted, sexually-addicted people." The measure, Rev. Shelton added, would "protect sex with animals and the rape of children as forms of political expression."
With Governor Wilson's signature, California becomes the seventh state, and by far the largest, to add sexual orientation to laws barring job discrimination. The other states are Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Connecticut, Vermont and New Jersey.
Many cities and localities have also passed such legislation, including New York City, which until today was the most populous jurisdiction in the nation with such protections.
The bill that Mr. Wilson signed, sponsored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman, a Los Angeles Democrat, is similar to last year's vetoed measure but has modifications aimed at addressing the objections posed by the Governor in that earlier veto message.
Last year's veto set off weeks of angry demonstrations in Los Angeles and Sacramento and near-riots in San Francisco, where protesters set fires and smashed windows at a state office building and caused $250,000 in damage.
The bill differs from last year's measure in its administrative remedy; it chooses a civil rather than a criminal approach. The original bill would have considered complaints under the state's Fair Employment and Housing Act, which metes out criminal penalties. The new bill instead processes complaints under the state labor code, which carries civil penalties.
Using the labor code to protect gay workers became possible after a state appellate court ruling last year. After that ruling, Governor Wilson directed the state labor commissioner to begin hearing complaints about discrimination based on sexual orientation. More than 70 have been adjudicated already, with all manner of outcome. The bill signed today codifies the recent court ruling, makes hundreds of thousands of people aware of their rights and is sure to inspire more widespread complaints.
Mr. Wilson and the California Chamber of Commerce say the civil remedy is prompt, efficient and less likely to lead to costly litigation. The bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Friedman, made the change agreeably and said he thought the new enforcement mechanism would be as effective as the one originally proposed.
Mr. Wilson's chief spokesman, Dan Schnur, insisted today that the Governor used "no political considerations whatsoever" in deciding to sign the measure, the same posture he took last year when Mr. Wilson was accused of vetoing the bill to avoid offending conservative Republicans.
But Mr. Wilson signed the bill against the backdrop of his recent jousting with the right wing of his party. Conservatives defied the Governor last weekend by adopting a strict anti-abortion plank at the state convention. Like President Bush, Mr. Wilson often appears trapped between the moderate and the extreme right in the Republican camp.
"Wilson is in the same position as Bush," said Bruce Cain, associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. "If the conservatives stay home in the next election he is in trouble. He has got to keep them in his camp, but he can't let them define him." Mr. Cain added that "the balancing act between losing the right and keeping the people in the middle" can be a dizzying one, likely to produce clumsy "lurches" from one end of the political spectrum to the other.

The Economy
New orders for durable goods fell in August, the third drop in four months. The unexpected decline of one-tenth of 1 percent raised fresh doubts about economic recovery. Also, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes slipped 3.2 percent, despite the lowest mortgage rates in 20 years. [Page 33.]
Personal income slumped one-half of 1 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted rate of $5.03 trillion, the worst drop in 19 months, as the effects of Hurricane Andrew more than offset what would otherwise have been a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent. [38.]
The Senate voted overwhelmingly against President Bush's proposal to permit taxpayers to earmark up to 10 percent of their income tax payment to reducing the national debt. [33.]
 
 International
The Japanese yen is emerging as perhaps the world's strongest major currency, at roughly 120 to the dollar, which could hurt Japan's already weakened automobile and electronics giants. [33.]
France and Germany appeared to have won their battle against currency speculators, at least for now, maintaining the franc's value and salvaging Europe's monetary system. [33.]
 
Markets
The Dow industrials plunged 37.55 points, or 1.1 percent, to 3,250.32 on renewed concerns that economic weakness would hurt third-quarter earnings. For the week, the Dow was down 76.73. [41.]
Treasury bond prices rose sharply as the durable-goods and personal-income reports led some traders to conclude the Federal Reserve might push interest rates down further. [41.]
Lawmakers are rushing to get a compromise futures markets bill onto the floor before Congress adjourns next week. [42.]
Natural gas futures prices rose modestly after a day of seesaw trading at the end of a wild week. [42.]
 
Companies
The U.A.W. struck G.M. in Lansing, Mich., where the popular Pontiac Grand Am and other models are built, complaining that laborers are overworked. But G.M. takes 39 hours to make a car, compared with 22 for Ford, an analyst said. [33.]
Lechters hopes to become the Gap of housewares by selling at lower prices than specialty chains like Williams-Sonoma. The Harrison, N.J.-based chain has 455 stores in 37 states and is expanding aggressively in the New York City area. [34.]
GlenFed is fighting for its life. The owner of Glendale Federal, the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan association, is trying to wring profits out of its 200-plus branches by cutting costs and making less risky mortgage loans, while bargaining with regulators for enough time to put its house in order. [34.]
Bell Sports has its eye on Europe's bare-headed cyclists. The leading American maker of bicycle helmets estimates that only 5 percent of Europe's 105 million riders wear helmets, compared with 20 percent of America's 93 million riders. [34.]

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Says He's Not Leaning Left but Taking a New 'Third Way'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Seeking to counter this week's Republican offensive portraying him as a leftist, tax-mad, big-government liberal, Bill Clinton today began an effort to once more position himself as a "third way" Democrat, neither of the left nor the right.
At the same time, the Democratic Presidential nominee sought to turn President Bush's attack against him, depicting his opponent as a "do-nothing" President who is "out of touch, out of ideas and out of time," and who clings to the "stale, failed rhetoric of the past." 
 Mr. Clinton introduced his new defense in a noontime address that was almost preachily earnest to a small crowd of invited guests at the University of Connecticut at Hartford, in West Hartford. He echoed it, in a looser fashion, before a passionate, mostly young crowd of more than 10,000 people packed shoulder-to-shoulder near the historic Faneuil Hall here.
 
'A Can-Do Country'
 "You cannot permit this election to be about false choices from America's past, about the same old categories, the same old boxes we try to put people in," Mr. Clinton said in West Hartford. "We are living in a new world, at the end of the cold war, and we have new challenges and new opportunities and we had better seize them, and we had better be willing to park all this aimless hot-air rhetoric at the door and deal with the people's problems and the people's agenda.
"I think this is a can-do country," he continued. "This should not be an election about the stale, failed political rhetoric of the past. If we let this be about tax and spend and trickle-down, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. This is about whether we have the courage to face up to the realities of modern life."
In truth, Mr. Clinton evinces no shame in discussing the Republicans' theory of trickle-down economics, which he mocks in most speeches. But his distaste for the words "tax and spend" is both profound and well-founded; the charge of liberalism, if it sticks, can be fatal to a Democrat seeking the White House.
Ever since the lesson of his first, and last, gubernatorial defeat Mr. Clinton has positioned himself as a centrist, and the idea of third-way politics is at the heart of his vision of himself and of a resurgent Democratic Party. For years, the Arkansas Governor has been an active player in the somewhat vaguely defined school of policy and politics that seeks to escape the left-right boundaries formed 60 years ago.
But, since winning his party's Presidential nomination, Mr. Clinton has often slighted discussion of this aspect of himself in favor of more direct and more traditional appeals to Democratic core groups. The candidate's public persona remains vague, and his true beliefs are not clearly understood by many voters.
Now Mr. Bush is seeking to take advantage of this with a negative campaign designed to portray Mr. Clinton as liberal to the point of vaguely socialistic radicalism and as a fiend for tax increases.
Clinton campaign officials said they decided it was imperative that the candidate directly and forcefully address Mr. Bush's attacks, and he did, in a speech that top operatives worked on over several days, only to have Mr. Clinton rewrite it this morning.
"George Bush says there is a Grand Canyon between us, and in that he is certainly right," the Governor said. "There is a gap between his economic policies and mine, between his philosophy and mine, and in fairness there is also a gap between his rhetoric and reality, most importantly the reality of what I have advocated as opposed to what he says I have advocated."
Mr. Clinton, who often but subtly plays generational politics, repeatedly spoke of Mr. Bush in terms that suggested the President was old and tired and that his view of the world belonged to an era that was over.
On the central issues of taxing and spending, Mr. Clinton -- who has, in fact, proposed government programs that would entail increases in both spending and taxes -- took pains to distance himself from that aspect of his party's reputation. "I know the Democratic Party in Washington has been in the past too identified with tax and spend, big government," he said. "But I have worked hard to be a different kind of Democrat and to give the people a different kind of Democratic Party."

HEADLINE: Senate Rejects Bush's Plan On Debt-Reduction Checkoff

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
After a debate colored by Presidential politics, the Senate voted overwhelmingly today to kill a campaign proposal offered by President Bush to permit taxpayers to earmark up to 10 percent of their income tax payment to reducing the national debt.
The measure, introduced by Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, was one of a medley of amendments offered today to a $31 billion tax bill moving through the Senate. The Smith amendment would have mandated that Federal spending be slashed by the same amount as the total debt payments designated by taxpayers. 
 The amendment was defeated in a procedural vote of 58 to 36, largely along party lines.
In a second defeat for the Administration, the Senate killed a Republican amendment striking a provision from the package that would have permanently extended two tax increases for wealthy taxpayers established in the 1990 budget agreement. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said the President would now be forced to veto the tax package unless his proposal was accepted by a Senate-House conference.
Through the day, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, and other Democratic leaders worked hard to limit additions to the tax package. The Senate bill would expand the deductibility of individual retirement accounts, slash luxury taxes on expensive goods, provide a tax credit to first-time home buyers, offer a write-off for intangible assets acquired in company takeovers, and create enterprise zones, where business people would receive tax incentives to invest in poor neighborhoods.
The tax bill was originally intended to respond to the kind of urban decay that led to rioting in Los Angeles in April, but it has since gotten bogged down by Presidential politics. President Bush has said he would like to sign the bill if it does not raise taxes.
The White House asked Mr. Smith to introduce the tax-form write-off proposal, which Mr. Bush offered at the Republican National Convention in an acceptance speech that was intended to project a vision of the economic policy he would pursue if re-elected. The vote demonstrated that Mr. Bush will need a Republican Congress to pass his economic program in a second term, a prospect that even Republican strategists say is remote, at best.
In a speech laden with criticism of the Democratic ticket headed by Gov. Bill Clinton, Mr. Smith said today, "The American people deserve a chance to show that they are willing to make the sacrifices necessary."
He added: "I would just say to Mr. Clinton, 'Why don't you let the American people decide whether or not the plan will work?' "
Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said the amendment would empower taxpayers who are demanding that Washington cut the deficit. "That's why we have Ross Perot," he added.
In a response punctuated by tragic tales from Greek mythology and dripping with sarcasm, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, said: "This amendment sounds like a silver bullet, but it's really a poison pill. In reality, its a potion that will taste like honey, but it's a trick. There is no magic herb to guard against its bewitching powers."
He said the permanent spending cuts required by the amendment might eliminate the national debt in 17 years, but would create "massive hemorrhaging" in vital services.
"There would be no spending left," he added. "There would be no Army, no Navy, no Air Force. There would be no law enforcement. All Federal prisoners would have to be let out."
The Internal Revenue Service had said the proposal offered no major administrative difficulties, but earlier this year a Treasury official testified before a House committee that proposals for tax-form checkoffs would have little effect on the debt.
The future of the bill is much in doubt, in large part because it has become enmeshed in the campaign debate on taxes. Mr. Bush's admission that he was mistaken in agreeing to raise taxes in the 1990 budget agreement has hardened Republican opposition to the permanent extension of two tax increases for upper-income taxpayers. The increases were established in that compromise.
Mr. Dole proposed an amendment to strike from the tax package provisions limiting itemized deductions and gradually discontinuing personal exemptions for the wealthy, as well as a provision decreasing the number of proposed enterprise zones to 30, from 125. The measure was defeated by a vote of 59 to 34.
Mr. Bentsen, the principal proponent of the tax package, said the tax extensions were required to finance the re-establishment of tax deductibility of I.R.A.'s for higher-income taxpayers, and other expansions of the accounts. Those changes would cost the Treasury $6.2 billion over the next five years. Mr. Bentsen accused Mr. Dole and the Administration of seeking a tax cut for the wealthiest 3 percent of taxpayers.
"This is a way to show your constituents that you're against tax increases," Mr. Dole said. "As is often the case with taxes, once they've got them, the Democrats are loath to let them go."
Senators Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, tried to highlight the needs of cities by presenting an amendment to provide $500 million in additional financing for Head Start and other law enforcement, employment and health programs, 60 percent of which would be aimed at areas designated for special investment-tax breaks.
"We're talking about making these enterprise zones strong enough so they can really turn things around," Mr. Riegle said. The measure was approved by voice vote.
The House has passed a far more modest tax bill, providing fewer enterprise zones and modest capital gains tax breaks that are not included in the Senate version. Congressional aides express growing doubts that the Senate can pass its bill, work out a compromise in a House-Senate Conference Committee, and send a final version acceptable to President Bush by the first week in October, the time the lawmakers hope to adjourn.

HEADLINE: A Strained Relationship: Congress and the Capital

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
On Thursday evening, Congress voted to force the District of Columbia to hold a citywide referendum on the death penalty.
Six hours earlier, the lawmakers defeated a measure to provide financing for a District law that would enable unmarried city workers, including homosexual couples, to obtain health insurance covering their partners. 
 For some members of Congress and District officials, the two actions are a sign of a deterioration in the volatile relationship between Congress and the District. Some members of Congress argue that Congress has a paternalistic attitude tinged with racism toward a city with a black majority, and that it minimizes the competence of the District's government.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's nonvoting delegate in Congress, who strongly opposed both Congressional moves, said there was a strain between Capitol Hill and the District government "caused essentially by one factor: the homicide rate." She noted that other cities have high homicide rates, but "they are not the cities where the members of Congress live."
 
Some Signs of Warmth
 But others, on both sides of the issue, said the election last year of Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly to succeed Marion Barry led to a rapprochement between the district and the Congress, and the first increase in Federal funds in five years. And Southern politicians no longer headed the crucial Congressional committees, which no longer review every jot and tittle of the district's budget. Indeed, the key House chairman, Julian Dixon, a Democrat of Los Angeles, is a former chairman of the Congressional black caucus.
"The District of Columbia had a setback this week, but I think that the Mayor still has good relationships with Congress," said Mr. Dixon, chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee for the district. "I don't look for any lasting damage in the relationship."
But Thursday's vote on the death penalty indicated increased tensions between Congress and the district as members of Congress have become increasingly concerned about the high incidence of crime in the neighborhood around Capitol Hill.
Their aides have been robbed and some murdered going to and from their jobs, and their homes have been burglarized. The death penalty measure was introduced by Senator Richard Shelby, Alabama Democrat, whose aide Tom Barnes was among the murder victims. "Tom's death was the catalyst for my involvement in trying to find solutions to the violent crime that plagues our city," he said.
District officials themselves were in the process of putting it on the ballot in November, and the sponsors of the measure believe that it will be adopted.
The members also were caught up in election year concerns that their opponents could portray them as soft on crime and family values. "We could visualize those 30-second television spots," said Representative Leon E. Panetta, who has strongly supported home rule for the District of Columbia but who voted for the measure.
Representative Dean A. Gallo, New Jersey Republican and sponsor of the death penalty measure, said, "We're dealing with something that touches more than the district," Mr. Gallo said. "There are 435 House members, who are touched by this problem."
To combat crime on Capitol Hill, Ms. Norton sponsored a bill to expand the jurisdiction of the Capitol Police to include more of the neighborhood around the Capitol. That measure also was approved Thursday.
As for the unmarried couples bill, she said: "That was exclusively an election-year problem. That had come up in the House three times, and passed each time."
The vote on the death penalty posed a special problem for Mr. Panetta. "I really think the District of Columbia ought to handle its own affairs," he said in an interview. "But crime continues to be a very serious problem in the district. Part of it is the urban crisis that is part of every city's social and economic problems. But I don't get the sense that the district has a strong commitment to confront this issue.
"There was a period of increasing hope that the district could manage its own affairs. But the travails of Marion Barry and the deterioration of services have added to concerns about the ability of the city to respond."
Mayor Kelly pointed the finger directly at Congress. She noted that Congress, responding to the White House's directive, had reneged on a $26 million payment that had been earmarked to fight crime. "At the same time the Congress postures about crime and attempts to force feed the District a death penalty, it removes the prevention funds and programs from our budget designed to effectively combat the problem," she said.
Representative Ronald V. Dellums, a liberal Democrat from Oakland, Calif., called Congressional intervention in the district's affairs "the ultimate act of cowardice."
Representative Maxine Waters, a liberal Democrat of Los Angeles, discerned racism in Congress's treatment of the district. "Congress really has an attitude about the District of Columbia that lingers despite the fact that they have very competent members of their City Council," she said. "Congress has little respect for people of color."

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall 37.55 on Economic Fears

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled yesterday on renewed concerns that continued economic weakness would hurt third-quarter earnings.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the 30 issues that make up the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell by 37.55 points, or 1.1 percent, to 3,250.32. For the week, the Dow was down 76.73. 
 Broader indexes also posted big declines. The Standard & Poor's 500 fell by 4.12, to 414.35, while the Russell 2,000 index dropped by 2.03, to 190.90. Volume on the Big Board was a moderately heavy 213.7 million shares, up from 188 million on Thursday.
Prices on the American and Nasdaq markets also fell.
Fears about the economy were underscored by weaker-than-expected reports on durable goods orders and consumption, both released before the market opened.
 
Worries on Economy
 The reports "increase the likelihood the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy again," said Robert Wallburg, a stock market analyst at MMS International, "but the market chose to look on them as saying we may not be coming out of recession."
Aside from worries about the economy and earnings, stock traders and analysts said uncertainties surrounding the Presidential election continued to prey on investors.
"A month ago, the market wasn't sure that Clinton would really win," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at the Kemper Securities Group. "Now it looks like we may have a new President with a new agenda. And the fact that Perot may get back in the race adds another element of uncertainty."
Mr. Wallburg added that while "Perot has no chance of winning, until we can tell who his entry favors that is another reason for investors to move to the sidelines."
 
A 33-Point Plunge
 Pharmaceutical and health care stocks were pounded, pushed lower initially after Medical Care America said it did not expect any growth in third-quarter earnings because of restructuring and merger costs, an announcement that ultimately pushed down the price of the company's shares by more than 50 percent. The stock closed at 25, down 33 points on the day.
Medical Care America was created two weeks ago when Medical Care International and Critical Care America merged.
Recent newspaper articles highlighting economic and policy pressures in the drug and health care businesses also helped push prices lower.
Among other drug and health care stocks, United Healthcare fell by 3 7/8, to 47 7/8. Johnson & Johnson slipped by 2 7/8, to 47 5/8. And Merck's stock fell by 1 7/8, to 43 3/4.
Cyclical issues like automotive stocks and conglomerates also took a beating. Ford Motor closed at 38 3/4, down 1 5/8, while General Motors shares fell by 1 1/8, to 32. Allied-Signal closed at 53 1/8, down 1 3/8, while United Technologies dipped by 3/8, to 48 1/8.
Chubb posted the session's biggest gain, as its stock rose by 3 1/4, to 82 1/2. Other big gainers included Loews, up 2 3/4, to 120 1/4, and FMC, whose stock closed at 44 5/8, up 1 5/8.

HEADLINE: Rising Yen: Japan's Mixed Blessing

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Amid the commotion in the European foreign exchange markets, the Japanese yen has staged a rally and is emerging as perhaps the strongest major currency right now, a development that could hurt Japan's already weakened automobile and electronics giants.
The yen closed here on Thursday at 120.25 yen to the dollar, a high for Tokyo after rising as high as 119.83 earlier in the day. Today the yen weakened a bit, closing at 120.85, Just last week the yen was as low as 125 against the dollar and at the beginning of August was down to 128. 
 [In New York trading Friday the dollar was quoted at 120.75 yen, up from 120.55 yen late Thursday. On Wednesday, the dollar plunged as low as 119.55 yen before recovering a bit.]
The yen has been gaining in the last few weeks even against the German mark, whose strength has caused a crisis for the British pound, the French franc and other European currencies. At the beginning of the month, the mark was worth 89 yen; now it is worth 80.
 
'Full-Court Press'
 "It's full-court-press, yen strength against all currencies," said Paul A. Summerville, senior economist for Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
The strength of its currency is likely to prove a mixed blessing for Japan. It could alleviate some of the pressure on Japan's beleaguered banks and make it less expensive for Japan to import the oil and other raw materials it depends on. Politically, a strong yen could help mitigate a soaring trade surplus by making Japanese exports seem more expensive to the world and foreign products cheaper to the Japanese.
But for automobile and electronics companies that depend heavily on exports, the high yen could deal another blow at a time when the companies are already suffering heavily from a slump in Japan's domestic market. The net overall impact of a higher yen could be to prolong the nation's recession, some economists say, even in the face of the Government's $86 billion stimulative spending plan.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other top officials have said in the last two days that the Government would consider intervening in the market if the yen experiences too sharp a rise, but that this did not appear to be the case yet. The prospect of intervention has helped keep the yen from rising further, analysts said.
 
Gradual Change Sought
 But Japanese officials actually appear to be more interested in making sure exchange rate changes are gradual, not in keeping the yen from rising. Indeed officials of the Finance Ministry and Bank of Japan have generally been in favor of a rise in the yen and Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, reiterated Thursday that he still favored a firming of the yen over the long term, according to press reports here.
Still, investors in the Tokyo stock market interpreted the developments favorably. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose 327.23 points on Thursday but then fell back by 215.19 today to close at 18,394.76.
With Japan's own economy in a steep slump and interest rates low, the yen hardly appears to be a candidate for a strong rally. Many executives and economists think the yen looks good only by default, as investors seek to escape the turmoil in Europe and because prospects for the American economy are uncertain.
"The main reason for the sharp rise of the yen doesn't exist in the yen itself," said Akira Satate, deputy general manager of foreign exchange at the Bank of Tokyo.
 
Strength Seen Fleeting
 Some executives said the current strength of the yen would be only transitory. But others say the same factors that have brought the yen to its current position will drive it even higher. In addition, some people are hoping the economy here will recover because of the Government's stimulatory package announced last month.
"The yen is now a safe-haven currency," said Robert Alan Feldman, director of economics and market analysis for Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., who thinks the yen will rise to 115 to the dollar or even higher. Despite its poor economy and its political scandals, Japan has a more certain political and economic outlook than the United States and many European countries, he said. Japan's strong trade and current account surpluses are also helping keep the yen strong, he said.
The prospect of a higher yen is sending chills through the board rooms of Japan's electronics and automobile companies, which are already facing periods of extremely low profits or even losses.
Takashi Matsuda, managing director and chief financial officer of the Honda Motor Company, said in a statement that if the yen stayed at its current level or gained strength it would have unfavorable effects both on Honda's export profits and on the Japanese economy. The company, which gets nearly half its revenues from sales in North America, has been basing its financial projections on the assumption of 130 yen to the dollar.
In part because of the gradual strengthening of the yen since last year, Japanese auto makers have already been raising auto prices in the United States more than their American competitors, and have lost some market share.
"The move in the currency right now is the best thing that's happened to Detroit in a long time," said Stephen Usher, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International in Tokyo.
For Casio, the Japanese manufacturer of calculators, watches and other electronic gadgets, each 1-yen rise in the exchange rate translates into a reduction in pretax profit of 1 billion yen, or more than $8 million, said Toshio Isobe, a spokesman for the company. But raising prices right now would be difficult, he said, given the weak economies throughout the world.
Japanese banks could also get a break in meeting new requirements for the capital they must have relative to their assets. The sharp fall in stock prices in the last two and a half years has already put some banks in danger of not being able to meet those requirements because some gains on stocks are counted in the capital calculations.
Mr. Summerville of Jardine Fleming said that about 25 percent of the asset of the major Japanese banks were in dollars, such as loans for real estate in the United States. With the yen strengthening, less capital, as measured in yen, is needed to cover those assets. "This is good for Japan because it gives the banks more breathing room," he said.
Japan has managed to adjust to a much bigger gain in the yen that was caused by the 1985 Plaza Accord, in which major nations agreed to strengthen the yen in an attempt to slow Japan's export machine. By early 1988 the yen had risen to almost 120 to the dollar -- a record passed only this week -- from about 250 yen to the dollar in 1985.
The sharp change in the currency caused an economic slump here, but one from which Japan recovered with dazzling speed.
To make up for tougher export markets, Japan stimulated its own economy with fiscal measures, leading to a domestic boom. Manufacturing companies invested heavily in automation to improve efficiency and moved some operations offshore so they could remain competitive in world markets. And with its currency strong, Japanese companies became major buyers of downtown skyscrapers, Hollywood studios, oceanside golf courses and other American property.
The Japanese will not be able to rely on the domestic market for help this time. However, with banks nursing bad loans and companies in weak condition, the new strength of the yen is not expected to set off a new shopping spree for foreign properties.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Home State;
Suddenly Arkansas's Being Noticed, But a First Glance Can Be Misleading

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIL, Ark.

 BODY:
Forget George Bush's campaign fly-around this week aimed at depicting Arkansas as a sluggish economic backwater. What really gets Ray Lewis is what he hears from his relatives in Mississippi.
"As backwards as Mississippi is, they go around telling Arkansas jokes," grumbled Mr. Lewis, who farms in this picturesque mountain hamlet. "I don't know who they think they are to be telling jokes about us." 
 Long touchy about its image, accustomed to obscurity and resigned to being the butt of jokes, Bill Clinton's home state is being poked and prodded these days to a degree unmatched since its last extended brush with fame, the Little Rock school desegregation riots of 1957.
For both parties, part of the definition of Bill Clinton will come down to a definition of his home state, right down to the antic banjo music in Mr. Bush's attack ad on Mr. Clinton's tax record. But a few days of meandering through Arkansas' backroads produces a picture far more interesting than either the Republican view of Arkansas as a left-in-the ditch backwater or Mr. Clinton's portrayal of Arkansas as plucky, emergent Sun Belt growth state.
 
Utterly Unpretentious Orbits
 What emerges on the surface is a distinctive, utterly unpretentious place that from Little Rock to Peckerwood Lake and Hot Springs to Marmaduke reflects a culture dominated by small cities and small towns still traveling largely in their own refreshing orbit. But beneath the surface is a place that is more familiar than it might appear, whose appeal and whose challenges say much about a nation drawn south and west and wrestling with problems of race and poverty.
An intriguing mix of geography and culture -- Southern, Western and Midwestern at the same time -- Arkansas can seem like an extension of Texas at Texarkana and of Mississippi at Helena. But it's dominated by two rich slices of Americana, the spectacular mountain scenery of the Ozarks and the astoundingly fertile, kitchen-table-flat farmland of the Mississippi Delta.
That diversity, and particularly the populist mountain influence, has helped produce some of the most progressive and independent politicians in the South, like former Senator J. W. Fulbright, the current Senators Dale Bumpers and David Pryor, and Mr. Clinton.
If Arkansas seems different, it is because it always has been.
Viewed in its early years as the last stretch of desolate frontier before the Indian territory of Oklahoma, Arkansas grew up in the land left over between Missouri and Louisiana in the Louisiana Purchase.
"Arkansas had a reputation in the 19th century as being a place of renegades that was so dangerous and crazy no self-respecting person would move there," said a University of Arkansas history professor, Jeannie Whayne.
Unlike Texas to the West and Mississippi to the east, which came to symbolize mythic elements of their region, Arkansas could not even get its own ragged mythology right.
Its national image was first shaped by the tale of the Arkansas Traveler, depicted in folk tales, fiddle tunes and quilts and prints. The original story had to do with a group of Arkansas gentlemen, including a gubernatorial candidate, on horseback, engaged in a comic battle of wits and eventually playing a fiddle tune with an Ozark Mountain squatter.
As it came down through history, it evolved into a tale of a lordly Easterner looking down on a backwoods rube. For better or worse that image has stuck.
The state joined the Confederacy, but few battles of any consequence were fought there; residents in the mountain northwest fought for the Union, and Arkansas has retained little of the Lost Cause fervor common to the Deep South.
"Arkansas had a secessionist convention that met in Little Rock to decide whether to secede, and interestingly most counties sent their delegates down there with orders to stay in the union," said Bill Penix, a lawyer in Jonesboro. "Sure enough, they got all drunked up and seceded."
Even the state's racial history is misunderstood. Arkansas is still tarred with the image of the turmoil that followed Gov. Orval Faubus's refusal to integrate Central High School in Little Rock in 1957.
But Arkansas, where blacks make up about 16 percent of the population, was chosen as a test case for integration because it was believed to be moderate on race. And Governor Faubus's defiance has always been viewed as a political ploy on his part rather than an expression of a deep racial chasm.
"Arkansas was actually jerked out of its natural orbit by Orval Faubus," said Harry Ashmore, the author and former editor of The Arkansas Gazette. "The truth is Arkansas probably has as good race relations as anywhere else in the country and always did have."
More people now live in areas designated as urban than rural. But with 2.4 million people, about the population of Metropolitan Atlanta, spread out over 53,000 square miles, and its largest city, Little Rock, having a population of only 175,000, Arkansas is still a state with a sense of limitless space.
Once the planter wealth of the Delta produced the state's aristocracy and the mountains were the preserve of hopeless poverty. Now the situation is reversed. In the Delta, where increasingly mechanized farm work does not provide nearly the number of jobs it once did, all the problems of the rural South stand out in sharp relief.
In the small town of Hughes, about 15 miles from the Mississippi border, the early evening air is moist and heavy and a thunderstorm of great dark clouds is moving across the cotton and soybean fields of the Delta.
 
A Town 'Beyond Dead'
 But for the crowds of poor blacks congregating on front porches, for people like James Toney, a farm worker sitting on a street corner, or David White, who has a salvage business, this is a town stuck in an era whose time has passed.
"If I had a job offer somewhere else, I'd leave Hughes in a minute and never come back," Mr. White said.
Many whites share the pessimism.
"This town isn't dead," said Vester Steele, who owns the small S & S Grocery Store. "It's beyond dead."
But it is the mountains that have most shaped Arkansas's culture, and they now dominate the economy as well. Northwest Arkansas now is home to Tyson Foods Inc., the world's largest poultry producer, Wal-Mart, and booming new retirement communities around Fayetteville, Bentonville, Rogers and Springdale that have turned Arkansas into one of the nation's most popular retirement states.
Amid endless stretches of mountain highway, it is possible to find some people who fit the old mountain stereotypes.
At the gas station and convenience store that is the only business in Nail, Richard Brown, who sports a grizzled stubble and floppy hat, drives up in a pickup truck loaded with wood.
"Twenty years ago, you could make a living in Arkansas," said Mr. Brown, who has raised 13 children by hauling wood and farming with four mules. "Now, between the taxes and the environmentalists closing down some of these mills, it gets worse and worse."
 
Feel of Endless Yard Sale
 But, in a state that has the feel of an endless yard sale, with roadside stands and flea markets everywhere selling everything from and crystals to peaches to quilts, the hillbilly past has more to do with tourism than reality. In Hardy, the weathered looking craftsmen making leather belts and holsters turns out to be Ken Mullin, a certified nuclear welder, who moved there from Los Angeles a few years back.
And at places like Hillbilly Bill's Gift Shop and Putt-A-Way in Mountain Home or the Booger Hollow Trading Post north of Dover, which push hillbilly calendars, recipe books, joke books and T-shirts, the mountain image lives on only because it's good for business.
"Some of the people at the Chamber of Commerce don't like it, but this is what draws people here," said Bill Arthur, whose business card lists him as the head of Hillbilly Ventures Company rather than Hillbilly Bill.
Indeed for most Americans, Arkansas is not just like home, unless home includes businesses like Count Razorback's Liar's Headquarters, Gas Station and Bait Shoppe in the Ouachita Mountains. It is still a place where a sheriff in Forrest City a few years back proudly displayed in his office the severed testicles of a rape suspect, and where Arkansas caviar means the eggs of the long-snouted paddlefish, a prehistoric fish found only in the Mississippi Valley whose eggs are sold as a caviar substitute.
It is still far poorer, 47th in per capita income in 1990, than the rest of the country and more rural, where a factory job is likely to be in a chicken processing plant.
But from the satellite dishes dotting the mountains, to the retirees from Chicago flocking to the Ozarks, the state is a reminder that nearly all of America exists within the reach of the worlds of Wheel of Fortune, People Magazine and MTV.
 
Contradictory as Any State
 Still remembered by many for Mr. Faubus, Arkansas can be as contradictory on race as the rest of the nation. It is home to both the Ku Klux Klan leader Tom Robb's Klan retreat near Zinc and strong black officials like Joycelyn Elders, Mr. Clinton's outspoken health director.
Like the nation, its challenge on race now has more to do with economics than civil rights, as it tries to bring prosperity to the poor, largely black Delta as it has to the overwhelmingly white northwest. While the income gap between whites and blacks narrowed slightly in the nation during the 1980's, it widened slightly in Arkansas.
And even though Arkansas chic may still seem an oxymoron, the state's changing fortunes, like the prospect of two young Southerners making up the Democratic ticket, reflect the nation's demographic shift.
Twenty-five years ago Eureka Springs was an eccentric resort town of Victorian cottages and limestone buildings little known outside the Ozarks. Now it is like a booming, madcap, Southern theme park, with the original downtown ringed by attractions ranging from the Anita Bryant Show, to the Swanee River Boys Country Revue to the seven-story-tall Christ of the Ozarks Statue, passion play and New Holy Land exhibit.
"I moved from Chicago, to Kansas City, to Eureka Springs, which tells you something, I guess," said Katie Austin, who works as a chef on a tourists' dinner train. "I just couldn't take the dog-eat-dog life up there. Arkansas may be a late bloomer, but it's because people don't know what's down here."

"Some of the people at the Chamber of Commerce don't like it, but this is what draws people here," said Bill Arthur, of Hillbilly Ventures Company. With him was his wife, Alice.

Dual Effort To Survive By GlenFed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
GlenFed Inc., owner of Glendale Federal Bank in Glendale, Calif., the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan association, is fighting for its life.
Confronted by a California economy on the ropes and Federal regulators embarrassed by their failure to prevent widespread collapses in the savings industry, GlenFed is battling on two fronts. 
 On one side, it is wringing profits out of its 200-plus branches by cutting costs and making new mortgage loans that are less likely to go into default than the riskier loans it made in the late 1980's. On the other, it is dickering with regulators for enough time to put its house in order without the specter of failure scaring away its senior officers.
 
A Shrunken Industry
 It is the kind of struggle that has overcome many savings and loans, and reduced the industry to 2,100 companies from 3,200 at the end of 1987.
Investors and traders have decided that GlenFed's future is risky; yesterday's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange, $2.375 a share, was near the 12-month low.
But apart from the standard cures of cutting costs, concentrating on the most profitable kinds of business and working to correct delinquent loans, GlenFed is looking to the Federal courts for relief.
Stephen J. Trafton, GlenFed's 45-year-old chairman, said on Thursday that he planned to offer to settle for $500 million a lawsuit the company is pursuing against the Federal Government. That money would give GlenFed the capital it needs "and would be a lot less than the $3 billion it could cost the Government if they were to close us," Mr. Trafton said.
Mr. Trafton is seeking to settle a lawsuit GlenFed filed in 1990 asking the United States Claims Court to find that enactment of a 1989 law overhauling the savings industry amounted to the Government's breaking a contract. The 1989 law prohibited Federal regulators from counting as capital the good will that GlenFed and other savings and loans entered on their books when they bought insolvent institutions in the early 1980's.
Good will is the amount by which an acquired institition's liabilities exceeded its assets. The ability to count the good will as capital was one factor in making acquisitions of failed institutions attractive to companies like GlenFed.
GlenFed had $700 million of good will resulting from its regulator-approved purchase of a failed savings and loan in Florida. Eliminating that amount from its capital caused GlenFed to fall below the minimum capital levels set in the 1989 law and subjected the company to criticism from regulators. As a result, Mr. Trafton said, the company has had a more difficult time attracting capital.
In July, Judge Loren Smith of the Claims Court agreed with GlenFed that the 1989 law broke a contract entered into by Federal regulators and that it caused financial harm to GlenFed. Federal regulators are appealing that decision.
 
Analyst Advises Patience

 
 Peter Treadway, a savings and loan analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said investors should not look forward to any quick windfall from the court decision. "But a contract is a contract," he said, "and I expect that eventually the company will get something."
Mr. Treadway noted that Mr. Trafton had been highly successful in improving the company's business, but had been stuck with bad loans. "As a manager who inherited a lot of problems, I think he walks on water," Mr. Treadway said. But he noted that Mr. Trafton, who is an Arctic explorer, might yet find that "the ice melts faster in Southern California."
"I think GlenFed will survive in an undercapitalized, wounded state," Mr. Treadway said. "But it is a very risky situation."

HEADLINE: Weak Economic Data Lift Bonds Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose sharply yesterday as new reports on durable goods and personal income reflected extended weakness in the economy. Short-term government securities posted sharp gains.
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 21/32 point, or $6.56 per $1,000 in face amount, causing its yield to tumble to 7.35 percent, from 7.41 percent late Thursday. 
 The economic reports turned traders' sights away from Europe's currency crisis, which has preoccupied the market for weeks, and back to the United States economy. A weak economy increases the chances the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, which would increase bond prices.
 
Three Critical Declines
 The Commerce Department said new orders to factories for durable goods in August fell for the third time in four months. The decline of one-tenth of 1 percent was slight, but it was unexpected, coming on top of a 2.7 percent drop in July.
The Commerce agency said personal income fell five-tenths of 1 percent last month, but the overall decline was more than accounted for by a drop at an annual rate of $60 billion caused by Hurricane Andrew.
Also, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes fell 3.2 percent in August. Despite the lowest mortgage rates in 19 years, sales slumped in every region except the West.
Also helping the market was a belief that next week's report on September employment would be weak. The employment report is one of the most significant economic indicators, and economists say a weak report could force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates again.
"That's the key number," said Ray Stone of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton N.J., adding that if the employment data are indeed poor, the Fed could ease rates when its Open Market Committee meets Oct. 6.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term maturities rose 3/16 point to 17/32 point and intermediate maturities gained 7/16 point to 15/32 point, the Telerate financial information service reported.
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all Treasury issues outstanding with maturities of a year or longer, rose 4.86, to 1,278.84.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills sank to 2.85 percent as the discount lost 9 basis points, to 2.80 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 2.9 percent as the discount fell 10 basis points, to 2.83 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 3.04 percent as the discount lost 10 basis points, to 2.94 percent.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Archdiocese of New York Imposes a Salary Freeze

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The Archdiocese of New York, struggling to control rising costs, has frozen the salaries of 1,600 lay employees and the monthly stipends of 1,500 priests.
The salary freeze is the archdiocese's latest step to curb spending, said Joseph G. Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese. Over the last two years, the archdiocese has closed 10 schools; merged 6 schools into 3; reduced the work force of Catholic Charities from 410 to 263, and put together a task force of corporations to study its finances. 
 The archdiocese has also proposed a one-year wage freeze for 4,325 teachers in Catholic schools, who are now working without a contract. The union is resisting such a move.
 
Paying the Bills
 Mr. Zwilling said that parishioners have continued to give more money, but that the expenses of the archdiocese have risen even more rapidly, particularly for health care and insurance.
"We have to pay the same sort of bills everybody else does," Mr. Zwilling said. "We're not immune to the economy we're living in."
He said he did not have figures for the overall costs, expenses or budget of the archdiocese. "I really can't put that figure together because there are so many different elements," he said.
The hospitals, schools, parishes and affiliated agencies all have their own budgets, he said.
Last year, officials said the archdiocese had an operating budget of $370 million.
 
Salary Freeze
 The salary freeze took effect on Sept. 1. Lay employees, including secretaries, administrators and cafeteria workers, will have to forgo cost-of-living increases and merit raises of 3.5 percent.
And priests who work in archdiocesan parishes will receive no increase for the third year in a row. They are paid a monthly stipend of $500 to $600, depending on how long they have been ordained, though many earn extra income teaching or lecturing. Housing costs are covered for those who live in rectories.
"Archdiocese employees have accepted it very well," said Mr. Zwilling. "They understand the financial situation. It's been a big topic."
The Archdiocese of New York covers Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester and six counties north of the city, and serves two million Catholics in 412 parishes.
The neighboring Diocese of Brooklyn is also facing "difficult economic times" and is cutting costs wherever possible, said a spokesman, Frank DeRosa, but he said the diocese had not instituted any kind of salary freeze for workers.
The archdiocese's salary freeze was first reported in the Sept. 24 issue of Catholic New York, the weekly newspaper of the archdiocese. The New York Post reported it yesterday.
The archdiocese started two fund-raising campaigns in 1991 that have had mixed success. The drive to raise $100 million for the parishes surpassed its goal by $15 million. "This is the most raised by any diocese in the country ever," Mr. Zwilling said.
But a campaign to raise an equal amount for 140 inner-city schools, primarily from corporate givers, has fallen far short. Only about $27 million in donations and pledges has been collected so far. "We seem to have reached a plateau," Mr. Zwilling said.
The archdiocese is facing long-term difficulties in continuing to support the schools, which have provided a good education for thousands of children living in inner-city neighborhoods and which in recent years have increasingly served poor black and Hispanic children. From fiscal year 1991 to 1992, the archdiocese cut its subsidy to the schools from $29 million to $23 million.
 
10 Schools Closed
 It closed 10 schools over the last two years, six of them in poor neighborhoods. Other inner-city parochial schools face possible closing because of shrinking enrollments, rising costs and the cuts in the archdiocesan subsidies.
The 298 parochial schools in the archdiocese, attended by about 106,000 students, rely primarily on tuition and the local parish churches for financial support.
The archdiocese's contract with the two unions representing the teachers in its schools expired Aug. 31. The archdiocese has asked the unions to go into mediation, but so far they have rejected that proposal, Mr. Zwilling said.
Officials with the Federation of Catholic Teachers, which represents 4,000 teachers, did not return calls yesterday. Officials with the Lay Faculty Association, which represents 325 teachers, could not be reached for comment.

In Their Own Words

 BODY:

PRESIDENT BUSH -- In an interview yesterday on WBBM-AM radio in Chicago
"It's not a question of family values. I have long favored family leave, but I don't believe in burdening the economy further and burdening the employers. I mean, we want more jobs for women, and I have very good proposals. We've got a great record on appointment of women, and so I think people ought to not just look at the title and listen to the Democratic rhetoric. 
 And incidentally, let me make this point. They've had that bill sitting around for eight or nine months, and they send it down just two weeks before -- one week before they adjourn and just before an election, trying to make political hay out of it. It's so obvious what's happening. But let me say to the women voters and the women workers out there in the state of Illinois: I am for family leave, and my proposal would not make small businesses have to lay off women in order to make ends meet."
 
GOV. BILL CLINTON -- In a speech yesterday at the University of Connecticut in West Hartford.
"If and when Mr. Bush does actually debate me, he'll find that he's facing a different challenger, a different kind of Democrat who understands that the great issue of this election and our time is how we can help America in a global economy to build a society where the power of government is used to help people and to help the private sector create jobs and increase incomes, to solve problems like the health care crisis instead of just talk about them, and to do it in ways that promote more innovation and less bureaucracy, and finally to educate and empower people to take responsibility for their own lives and their family's futures.
Mr. Bush says this election is a choice between private enterprise and big government, but there is a grand canyon between his rhetoric and the reality of his own record on that subject and my record, between his proposals and my proposals."

HEADLINE: New Terminal Announced for Newark Airport

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plans to build a new passenger terminal at Newark International Airport and renovate other buildings there to handle soaring numbers of international travelers.
The $110 million project will almost triple the number of international passengers the airport can handle per hour, to 3,000 from 1,100, said the Port Authority chairman, Richard C. Leone. 
 "I think no one anticipated that there would be this kind of demand," he said. "This is our first attempt to fully expand to meet the unprecedented growth."
Overseas travel through the Newark airport has increased by 133 percent over the last four years, from 1.2 million passengers in 1988 to 2.8 million in 1991, making it the fastest growing airport in the region. The Port Authority estimates that the current figure will increase by at least 40 percent by the turn of the century.
Port Authority officials say the new terminal, which is expected to open in 1995, solidifies the stature of the Newark airport, now among the top 10 international airports in the country.
But the growth in Newark has not come at the expense of Kennedy and La Guardia airports in New York, said Stanley Brezenoff, the authority's executive director.
"That's a sort of persistent concern that is expressed," Mr. Brezenoff said. "The fact is that the Port Authority is investing billions of dollars in all three airports."
The growth at Newark has come from a growing number of new airlines looking to compete in an international market under deregulation, Mr. Leone said. In the last three years, 20 airlines have introduced international service at the airport. Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport did not have space to accommodate new flights, Mr. Leone added, while the movement of affluent homeowners and corporations to Northern New Jersey in the last decade has made the airport an attractive alternative to New York.
 
Immigration and Customs Space
 Total passengers at Newark from January to May 1992 increased by 8.8 percent from the same period in 1991. At Kennedy , volume increased by 4.8 percent during the same period, while La Guardia's volume fell by 1.7 percent.
Newark's expansion project was approved Thursday at a meeting of the authority's board. In addition to a new building, to be built between two concourses of Terminal B, it includes more space for United States Customs and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a new baggage claim and inspection area and a more efficient use of gates and ramps.
The airport is already building a $378 million monorail that will link the airport's long-term parking lots, its car-rental area and its three terminals. The monorail is expected to open in late 1994 or early 1995.
Major projects are going on at the two New York airports, too. At La Guardia, Mr. Brezenoff said, in addition to a USAir terminal that opened last week, the authority is renovating the main terminal and planning road work, all totaling $300 million in Port Authority funds and $250 million in airline funds.
 
Tighter Focus at Kennedy
 And at Kennedy, where an ambitious plan to rebuild the airport as the nation's premier gateway was scrapped after the agency had already spent $100 million, a refocused project is already under way, he said. Instead of a new central terminal, the plans focus on renovating and rebuilding the nine existing terminals, adding a cargo terminal, rebuilding roadways and adding monorail links.
The plans also include a new passenger terminal, financed by five international airlines, that will be the first new terminal in the airport since the 1960's, he said. The project will cost $1.8 billion in Port Authority funds and another $2 billion in airline and other private funds.
Mr. Brezenoff added that steps had been taken to insure that money would not be wasted at Kennedy. "We've submitted a risk analysis that lays down all of our assumptions, what milestones there are, projections, what things might go wrong," he said. "We will periodically revisit those as the projects continue."
And Donald Plavin, the agency's director of aviation, added that the ill-fated project had more to do with the recession and the weakness of the two airlines most involved in the plans. "Half of the whole airport was carried by T.W.A. and Pan Am," he said. "Those carriers would not have been able to finance the project. We had to step back and regroup."
At Newark, where about half the international service is provided by Continental Airlines, the agency expects the volume of passengers to continue to grow, Mr. Plavin said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Where Impulse Buying Hasn't Died

 BODY:
Lechters Inc. hopes to become the Gap of the housewares market by selling everything from measuring spoons to color-coordinated bathroom sets at affordable prices, cheaper than those of chains like Williams-Sonoma and Crate and Barrel.
The chain, based in Harrison, N.J., now has 455 stores in malls, strip centers and cities in 37 states, up from 234 in 1988; it hopes to be at 535 by the end of the year. 
 The New York City area is the latest target for expansion by Lechters, in part because the company says more business is generated there than in other parts of the country, with space-hungry city dwellers spending more on storage and closet items. Fifteen of the 18 stores in New York have been opened since 1990, with the most recent at 85th Street and Third Avenue. Another Manhattan store is scheduled to open early next month at 111th Street and Broadway.
 
A Profitable Stock

 
 Lechters seems to have plenty of fans on Wall Street. Its stock closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $18.125, a gain of 12.5 cents for the day. The stock was priced at $10.25, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split, when Lechters began offering shares in July 1989.
"I like the Lechters story, they are doing everything right and everything they need to do to succeed," said Dana Telsey, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence in New York.
The housewares chain does seem to have retailing, demographic and economic trends on its side. The rapid expansion of Lechters comes at a time when department stores have scaled down their "home shops." The company is virtually alone in stocking almost endless assortments of kitchen utensils, tabletop items and basic housewares -- most costing less than $10.
And the biggest population segment -- the baby boomers -- are in a nesting mood. "The baby boomers' years of consumption are gone," said Michael Anthony, vice president and general merchandising manager of the chain. "Now they have families and children in college and need to save money. The 90's, not like the 80's, will focus on the home."
Even the recession has played somewhat into Lechters' hands. People seem to be eating more meals at home, and while they may not be buying dishwashers, they seem willing to buy dish towels.
"The recession works for Lechters because people are trying to stay at home to conserve money," said George Rosenbaum, chief executive of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a Chicago-based marketing research firm. "When you go into a Lechters you are not going to get into trouble because the items on the shelves are not very expensive."
A study conducted by the Shapiro firm for Lechters found that of every 100 customers who enter a Lechters, 80 end up buying something. Mr. Rosenbaum said that for a chain that survives on discretionary items, this rate is high. About the only retailers with higher purchase rates are grocery stores and fast-food chains. "Basically Lechters will do very well if it is in a high traffic area," Mr. Rosenbaum said.
Indeed, in a period when other retailers watched sales decline, sales at Lechters stores open at least a year grew 2 percent last year and overall sales increased 25 percent, to $234.3 million. For the first half of 1992 sales were up 28 percent, to $112.6 million, and net income rose 18 percent to $1.1 million.
Donald Jonas, the chairman and chief executive of Lechters, is no newcomer to retailing. His father owned a discount department store in the 1940's called Jonas at 14th Street and the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan. At the age of 23, after attending the University of Richmond, Mr. Jonas opened his first store, a leased women's apparel department in discount shops.
The venture was subsequently expanded into a chain, called Barbara Lynn, after Mr. Jonas's wife. But he gradually left the women's wear field because it was too competitive.
Housewares was less so. "We made a lot of mistakes in the beginning but there was no one else in the business," he said. The first Lechters store opened in 1975 in a shopping mall in Rockaway, N.J.
 
Raising Cash
 The rapid expansion of Lechters started in July 1989 when the company went public, raising $20 million, most of which was used to repay bank loans. Last year the company raised $15 million from senior notes and $28 million from the secondary offering of common stock. In August of last year the company raised $51 million in a bond issue. All these deals have left the company with $84 million in long-term debt to be paid in the next 10 years.
The chain prides itself on being "category killers" in certain products by offering numerous variations. Take the garlic press. Lechters sells eight models varying in sizes, handles, color and quality, with prices from $4.99 to $13.99.
Gadgets like a pickle grabber and an ergonomically correct vegetable peeler are also something of a Lechters trademark.
"We would like people to think of us as the store that has everything, the problem-solving store and a fun place to shop," Mr. Jonas said.

HEADLINE: Jersey City Is the Victor In Relocation

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
In a battle illustrating how desperate real-estate companies are for tenants and governments are for jobs, New York City and New York State have accepted the loss of 1,000 jobs in Manhattan after calculating that it would cost them more than $50,000 a job to retain them.
The winner in the contest was Jersey City, which succeeded in persuading a subsidiary of the First Chicago Corporation, a bank holding company, to relocate its administrative and back-office operations to Newport Center, a sprawling office, retail and residential complex along the Hudson River. 
 Newport Center was conceived in the heady growth days of the 1980's. Its developers, the Lefrak Organization of New York and Melvin Simon & Associates of Indianapolis, gambled that financial-services companies and other corporations fed up with soaring Manhattan rents would flock to the complex.
 
Tenants Staying Put
 But in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash and the onset of the recession in 1989, which ravaged the financial-services sector, rents in Manhattan have plunged and the complex has found it difficult to woo new tenants. About 37 percent of Newport Center's nearly 1.5 million square feet of office space and 90 percent of its 1.2 million square feet of retail space are leased; 93 percent of its 2,000 apartments are occupied.
Underlining the importance that New Jersey placed on snaring First Chicago, the company's decision to move was announced yesterday at a news conference presided over by Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey. "This is the first major corporate location to the Hudson 'Gold Coast' in four years," he said. New Jersey is offering inducements worth at least $5 million.
Paul Weisbrod, president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation, said the city and New York State would have had to pay more than $50,000 in tax benefits and energy discounts for each of the 1,000 jobs to keep them. That is more than twice what the city has previously been willing to spend.
"Certainly $50,000 is far, far in excess of what we have ever provided or offered," he said, "and we decided we shouldn't do it." By comparison, the city and state agreed in August to grant benefits worth about $106.2 million, or more than $20,000 a job, to persuade Prudential Securities Inc. to keep 5,000 jobs in the city for 20 years.
Asked whether the package offered by New Jersey represented a sharp escalation in the battle between the states for jobs, Mr. Weisbrod was reluctant to attack New Jersey. "It has always been fairly intense," he said of the competition. "I think over the past three years or so New Jersey has not been very successful in luring companies from New York."
He added: "Our neighbors and we should be working together to improve the competiveness of the region rather than spending public money to shift jobs from one part of the region to another. We have tried very hard here to have our neighbors realize this as we do."
 
Nonaggression Pact
 Last year, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut signed a nonaggression pact, promising not to use negative advertising against one another in the battle to keep or attract jobs. They also committed themselves to cooperate on economic issues.
Describing the agreement as limited in scope, Mr. Weisbrod said he did not feel that New Jersey broke it in the First Chicago contest. "It has been part of an ongoing competition, and it's a competition where -- at least certainly for the last several years -- we have been exceptionally successful."
Mr. Weisbrod tried to play down the importance of keeping First Chicago, saying that such back-office jobs were not a growth area because technology was reducing the need for them.
"It's not a positive, but it's not hugely negative," Enda Bracken, an assistant vice president at Laudauer Associates Inc., a real- estate consulting company, said of the First Chicago move. "There's no cause for alarm at this stage. The flow of companies to New Jersey has slowed down substantially over the last few years. The reason is New York rents have become substantially more competitive."
 
Moving by Mid-1993
 The subsidiary that is to move, First Chicago Trust Company, has signed a lease for 240,000 square feet in Newport Tower and plans to move by mid-1993. A 36-story office building with one million square feet that overlooks the Hudson River, the tower was completed in April and was bought from its developers by the Limited Inc., the apparel chain based in Columbus, Ohio.
The First Chicago unit, which performs shareholder services for corporate customers -- mailing dividends, annual reports and proxy material and answering shareholder questions -- will keep 100 jobs in lower Manhattan.
In addition to the 1,000 jobs going to Jersey City, First Chicago is moving 100 jobs from Manhattan on Nov. 1 to a new mailing and computer-printing center in Edison, N.J.
First Chicago Corporation now employs 2,300 people in the metropolitan area, including 1,500 in Manhattan at the trust subsidiary, in corporate banking and in mailing and printing operations; 700 at a credit-card-processing operation in Uniondale, L.I., and 100 at a receivables-mailing operation in Secaucus, N.J.
First Chicago Trust's president, Lorne H. Price, said Newport Tower's technological abilities, including fiber optics and satellite communications systems and backup electrical systems, combined with the price of the space, heavily influenced the company's decision. He also noted that the complex is a short ride on PATH from Manhattan.
 
New Jersey's Inducements
 In an interview, Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said the state had provided benefits worth $5 million to $6 million to First Chicago. These included a capital investment in the building and an equity stake that the state was taking in the building.
A New Jersey official who insisted on anonymity said the stake would be less than 5 percent. He said First Chicago's base rent was about $10 a square foot, which he said was about half what First Chicago would have had to pay for comparable space in Manhattan.
In addition, Mr. Coscia said, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company had offered First Chicago "a very competitive rate." Because Jersey City is in an urban enterprise zone, First Chicago will have to pay only a 3 percent state sales tax, half the normal rate.
He denied that the state had been excessive in wooing First Chicago. He said the state, for example, had spent much more to keep a General Electric Company aerospace operation and its 2,000 jobs in New Jersey. "We're building them a building," he said.
The move must be an especially bitter pill for Barry F. Sullivan, New York's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. He is the former chairman of the First Chicago Corporation. Jennifer Kimball, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sullivan, said he had not been personally involved in the negotiations. Mr. Sullivan is still a consultant to First Chicago and has made a policy of not involving himself in any city business with the bank.
The subsidiary is now situated at 30 West Broadway in lower Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Storm Slashed Incomes in U.S.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Hurricane Andrew hurt Americans' total personal income in August, wiping out what would have been a healthy increase, the Commerce Department said today.
Personal income plunged five-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted rate of $5.03 trillion, the worst drop in 19 months. If not for the storm, income would have increased seven-tenths of 1 percent, the best in six months. 
 The agency said August's overall income decline was more than accounted for by a storm-caused drop at an annual rate of $60 billion.
Andrew's demolition of property in southern Florida and south-central Louisiana reduced rental and business owners' income. Work interruptions cut salaries, and crop destruction hurt farm income.
The storm also depressed personal consumption spending. It fell one-tenth of 1 percent, to $3.32 trillion, the worst showing in 10 months. In later months, the storm will probably lift both income and spending as people get cleanup jobs and start buying lumber and other building supplies, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Accord on Aid to Ex-Soviets

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators have agreed on a bill authorizing $460 million next year for wide-ranging aid programs to help the former Soviet Union make the transition to democracy and free markets.
The bill, a compromise of measures the two chambers passed earlier, authorizes a $12.3 billion increase in the American contribution to the International Monetary Fund, which is helping Russia overhaul its economy. It also supports a contribution of as much as $3 billion for currency stabilization funds for the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
 The bill, which the negotiators cleared on Thursday, is expected to get final House and Senate approval before Congress adjourns for the year at the end of next week. A separate foreign-aid-appropriations bill that includes aid for Russia and other former Soviet states is making its way through Congress.
President Bush said on April 1 that the United States would participate in a $24 billion international aid initiative for the former Soviet states and had hoped the legislation would pass before President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russian visited Washington in June. Mr. Yeltsin made a strong pitch for the aid in an address to Congress.
The bill softens the conditions on Russian aid that the Senate version had linked to a pullout of troops from the Baltic states. The new language would require progress on withdrawal and allow the President to waive the aid restrictions.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Bonds Is, Of Course, A Key to Victory

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Sept. 25

 BODY:
It is 5:40 P.M. at Three Rivers Stadium. Barry Bonds stands at the plate, crashing baseball after baseball into the multiple decks in right field. It's a sight the National League has seen too much of and too little of in 1992.
Clubs have crafted entire game plans to prevent Bonds from beating them. He has had the bat taken out of his hands again and again. His 31 intentional walks this season are the most in the majors. His 123 walks are 31 more than anyone else in the National League. 
 "I don't know how he's got the numbers he does," said Don Slaught, the veteran catcher for the Pirates. "It ain't like they are giving him r.b.i. In fact, their doing their damnedest not to. The guy gets to swing the bat about once a game."
It has often been enough. Tonight, Bonds swung his bat and collected another hit. He walked again, too, and not surprisingly, the Pirates won, 3-2, from the Mets. The triumph reduced Pittsburgh's clinching number for third straight title to 2.
 
Numbers of a Star
 Bonds has 31 home runs and has driven in 97 runs. His 71 extra-base hits are tops in the league. His .621 slugging percentage is 36 percentage points higher than the next man, Gary Sheffield of the Padres. No one else has scored more than Bonds's 104 runs.
"He's the m.v.p.," said Pirates Manager Jim Leyland. "There's no doubt in my mind. He's the best left fielder in the game, and he's playing on a first-place club. What do you have to do? If he doesn't win, I don't understand how it all works."
It doesn't work on the field any more explosively or extravagantly than it has for Bonds in September. With the Pirates getting constant pressure from Montreal, Bonds has ruled. He is forever on base, forever a threat, forever crippling one more pitch.
He has hit .452 over the last 14 games as the Pirates have applied what appears to be the knockout punch to the Expos. He has reached base safely 64 times in his last 110 plate appearances. He has walked 26 times in that span, and scored 25 runs in the 24 games.
"A lot of things I've done this season, I've had to say, whoa," said Bonds. "I've had to almost say that's not right, that's impossible."
 
Empty Bandwagon in April
 Before the season, more than a couple of observers termed Pittsburgh's shot at a third consecutive division title impossible. Bobby Bonilla was with the Mets as a free agent, John Smiley had been traded to Minnesota in a deal driven by economics, and Bonds was destined for free agency and perhaps a season of distracting speculation.
But Andy Van Slyke has hit .324. Jay Bell has been an anchor at shortstop and even mounted the N.L.'s longest hitting streak -- 22 consecutive games. Tim Wakefield has come out of obscurity and flung knuckleball after knuckleball and turned in inning after inning for a beleaguered starting rotation. Jose Lind has vacuumed everything hit near him at second. And Doug Drabek has put together yet one more clutch second half of stranglehold pitching.
"It's not a great team by any means," said Leyland. "But it's a damn good ball club day in and day out."
It's a club consequently headed for another run at the World Series, and after that likely another round of rupturing rearrangement. Bonds, the league's most valuable player in 1990, is the most attractive free agent to come on the market in a decade.
 
'To Find His Pot of Gold'
 "I want Barry to chase the rainbow, to find his pot of gold and to understand that his pot of gold isn't only made up of money," said Leyland. "But I'm not going to try and sell him on staying with this club or to try and sell him on me or this city. I don't have that right. I don't want that right. That's the system, and more power to the players."
With all that power, Bonds understands he has no control over whether he wins another m.v.p. award, terming it a result wrought by "statistics and sportswriters." So he has tried to keep a handle on his emotions.
"I don't want to set myself up for disappointment," he said. "To win the N.L. East again this season has probably been the best one of the three. There were a lot of reasons for us to fall or fail."
Barry Bonds, with a bat in his hands or taken out of his hands, is the central reason why the Pirates have not.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 SID FERNANDEZ, who gave up a leadoff homer to GARY REDUS, took the loss for the Mets, and his record fell to 13-11. RANDY TOMLIN got the victory for the Pirates to improve his career mark against the Mets to 8-0. . . . The Mets are 2-11 against the Pirates.

HEADLINE: Is the Novel Dying? Hope and Despair From Eight Who Should Know

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
The novel is alive and well, but subject to occasional spells of depression about its future. That, more or less, was the majority opinion among eight practitioners of the art, who discussed "The Death of the Novel, the Life of the Novel" on Thursday evening at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
The event, organized by the Lannan Foundation, a private arts organization based in Los Angeles, brought together Harold Brodkey, Michael Cunningham, Oscar Hijuelos, Norman Mailer, Paule Marshall, Norman Rush, Mona Simpson and Barbara Probst Solomon. They submitted to almost painfully sensitive and complex questioning by Michael Silver blatt, the host of "Bookworm," a weekly interview program on radio in southern California. 
 Mr. Silverblatt announced early that he had read 220 novels in the last year and might have read many more if Mr. Brodkey and Mr. Mailer had not published two epic-length books, "The Runaway Soul' and "Harlot's Ghost," respectively. The evening might have finished much earlier if he had read, say, 25 or 30.
As the speakers took their places onstage one by one, Mr. Silverblatt hit each of them with a personally tailored question requiring about a week's worth of thought to answer. Mr. Brodkey, first out, had barely found his chair before he was wrestling with, "Why do we need a theory of the novel?"
Most of the panelists sweated through these exam questions. Mr. Mailer jumped at his: "What is the novel?"
"That's easy," he said. "An attack upon reality." He then proposed a supplementary definition, calling it "all those perceptions for which there is no room in other forms," and warned that it is in danger of dying not for lack of vitality, but for lack of an audience.
 
Liberators Versus Gatekeepers
 Like most of the other panelists, Mr. Rush, the author of "Mating," which won the National Book Award for Fiction last year, criticized the cultural forces, notably television, that worked to the detriment of literature, and the dead hand of academia, but he expressed a basic faith in the novel's power to endure. The source of this power, he said, is "ethical anxiety," which he located in "a recognition that we are all limited in our ability to comprehend the world." The novel, he said, "offers us the chance to be something other than we are, and it is therefore a mighty engine of liberation."
Unfortunately, Mr. Rush said, in America a novel lives by being placed on the syllabus of college English courses. Mr. Brodkey took sharp exception, arguing throughout the evening that writers do not live or die based on the decisions of what Mr. Rush called "the gatekeepers" of academia. "Librarians probably have more effect," Mr. Brodkey said, "and we never talk about the politics of librarians."
Mr. Brodkey also found himself at odds with Ms. Marshall, the author of "Brown Girl, Brownstones" and "Daughters," when he argued that novelists and serious readers of fiction constituted a kind of subversive elite in American culture, which he described as essentially political and economic rather than literary.
Ms. Marshall, whose novels describe the life of West Indians in Brooklyn, bristled at the word elite. She cited the small reading groups of black women whom she encountered in cities across the country on a recent book tour as evidence of a more popular audience for serious fiction than one might suppose.
 
How Close to Reality?
 One of the evening's more bizarre episodes came when a member of the audience asked the panelists what short books they might recommend to the homeless residents of a shelter that he managed. Mr. Brodkey, thinking aloud, said that perhaps something close to the residents' actual experience might be the ticket, and he was halfway into recommending "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" before he thought better of it and suggested George Orwell's "Down and Out in Paris and London," a book that he said had helped him when he was young and penniless. Mr. Rush recommended Kafka and the short stories of Chekhov and Isaac Babel, "works that deal with the extremities of the human condition." Ms. Simpson suggested the works of Primo Levi.
The menace of television and film, lurking at every turn, inspired several impassioned defenses of the novel. Ms. Simpson, author of "The Lost Father," argued that not even the best film could ever create truly memorable characters in the way "Middlemarch" or "War and Peace" do, characters that enter one's life in the way members of one's family do, and become part of one's moral reasoning. "A great novel is worth 1,000 films," said Mr. Hijuelos, the author of "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love." His remark drew hisses from several audience members. Perhaps they had seen the movie based on his book.
The question of audience and the novelist's role was an undercurrent throughout the evening. Mr. Mailer and Mr. Brodkey described writing as an intensely personal quest, and the novelist as being, in crucial respects, a voluntary exile from American culture. Mr. Cunningham, the author of "A Home at the End of the World," and Ms. Marshall argued for a more socially engaged fiction, pointing to the work of younger black, Asian and gay writers as the best hope for the vitality of the form.
"One of the great strengths of the novel is that it is probably doing more to give a voice to the disenfranchised than any other form," said Mr. Cunningham, whose work addresses gay issues. "Hollywood is not doing it, television is hardly doing it, and I'm thrilled with it."
Mr. Mailer, who is often thought of as one of the heftiest egos ever to hit the printed page, described the work of the novelist as a radical surrender of self. "Serious novelists conduct reconnaissance into moral reaches that are not under their command," he said, and his remark seemed to amplify a point he had made earlier about the essential humility of the writer's craft. "The art of the novel," he said, "is to arrive at that artless point when your characters become more real than yourself."
By the end of the evening, the American novel seemed to be holding its own, bloodied but unbowed, certainly far from dead. True, Mr. Silverblatt bemoaned what he called "a time of national disgrace for the novel" and delivered a tongue-lashing to the critics who failed to rally around "Harlot's Ghost" and "The Runaway Soul."
Ms. Simpson showed more heart. Rejecting the talk of gloom and doom, she said, "The best thing I can think of is to quote my old writing teacher, Richard Price, who told us, 'I think the novel will be at your funeral.' "

HEADLINE: Review/Film Festival;
Of an Earl, an Old Love and Roger

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
Three superb short films by Mike Leigh of England, Denys Arcand of Canada and Michael Moore of the United States make up the program titled "Taking the Pulse," which will be shown at the New York Film Festival today at 4 P.M. and midnight. Because they probably won't be presented anywhere else in this same combination, you may want to check if there are any seats left for the program. The films don't have much in common, but seeing three such decisively idiosyncratic works together has a way of raising the spirits.
Mr. Moore's 23-minute contribution, "Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint," is a sort of "Roger and Me 2." It's an engagingly tatterdemalion sequel to his 1989 hit documentary in which he examined the sad state of Flint, Mich., after mass layoffs by General Motors, and some of the ways in which private citizens and public boosters were coping. 
 Since Mr. Moore last visited Flint with a camera crew, things have continued to change, meaning that they've gotten worse, even for Roger Smith, the G.M. chairman whom the film maker unsuccessfully tried to interview earlier. Mr. Moore says that Mr. Smith, after resigning from G.M., had his pension package reduced by $100,000.
From time to time throughout "Pets or Meat," the folksy film maker toys with the idea of sending the former executive a check to make up the difference. He could afford it: his profits from "Roger and Me" reportedly allowed him to set up a $250,000 foundation to help independent film makers and social action groups. According to the new film, Mr. Moore also paid two years' rent to each person shown being evicted in "Roger and Me." Now and then social satire pays off.
"Pets or Meat" takes its title from the sign outside the house of Rhonda Britton, the woman who was selling rabbits in "Roger and Me." She is now bankrupt but unbowed. She works at K-Mart and has expanded her in-home business by adding a line of rats and mice, sold as food for pet snakes. One not-great shot: a python engorging a rabbit the size of a small dog.
Other characters make return visits, including Fred Ross, the deputy seen evicting destitute tenants in the earlier film. Now Mr. Ross also works as a repo man, that is, as a repossessor of automobiles. Not all business in Flint is down. Employment is up at the unemployment office. Sales of home security systems and guns have risen because of the increase in crime.
Wearing his G.M. cap squarely on his head, looking quizzical and never surprised, Mr. Moore wanders through this landscape like Tocqueville disguised as a late 20th-century Middle American hayseed. For those who can't get to Lincoln Center today, PBS television stations are scheduled to show both "Pets or Meat" and "Roger and Me" on Monday night.
Mr. Arcand's 25-minute "Seen From Elsewhere" is a segment from a new Canadian anthology feature titled "Montreal Vu Par. . ." Whatever the rest of the film is like, Mr. Arcand's contribution is delicious, an older woman's ecstatic, alarmingly frank recollection of a love affair she had many years ago in Montreal.
Attending a boring diplomatic reception in a Latin American capital, where each succeeding guest has a worse horror story to tell about the provincial manners and morals of French Canadians, the woman is prompted to recall Montreal as the scene of the great love affair of her life. Her surprised husband stands by as she delights the women around her with the explicit details of an escapade conducted during a World Health Organization conference, amid a very snowy weekend and exploding mailboxes, among other things.
The film, beautifully written by Paule Baillargeon, who also appears in a small role, recalls the wit and elan of Mr. Arcand's "Decline of American Civilization" (1986).
The high point of the program is Mike Leigh's "Sense of History," a one-character film that is not, strictly speaking, a Mike Leigh film at all. Mr. Leigh did not write the script, as he usually does. Instead, he sort of presides over it, seeing that all goes well. The true auteur of "A Sense of History" is Jim Broadbent, the 40-ish English actor and wizard, who conceived and wrote the screenplay and plays the portly, 70-ish 23d Earl of Leete.
In the course of a 25-minute monologue, the Earl takes his unseen interviewer on a tour of the 900-year-old Leete estate, chatting all the while about his family, his politics, his marriages and the skeletons in his closet. It's a merciless and sometimes hilarious portrait of the aristocracy, though the Earl is far from being a twit. He's a bigoted, arrogant, lethal weapon of privilege. Yet for all of his faults he is almost likable. He's certainly credible.
The performance of Mr. Broadbent is as remarkably rich as his screenplay, a capsule history of Britain from the landing of William the Conqueror through World War II and beyond. The Earl tells the interviewer that he could not, in all good conscience, take up arms against Hitler, though that doesn't mean he approved of everything Hitler stood for. The Earl believes in land, class, civil order and, as he says with a sweeping gesture, "keeping the bastards out."
Mr. Broadbent will be remembered for his performance as the husband in Mr. Leigh's "Life Is Sweet." To appreciate his extraordinary physical transformation for "A Sense of History," you might want to see him in Neil Jordan's "Crying Game," also being shown at the festival today. In that film he plays a character about 30 years younger and 40 pounds lighter than the garrulous old Earl.
"A Sense of History" is an exemplary work.

HEADLINE: EUROPE: FALL AND WINTER;
In the West End, the Stage Is a Whirl

BYLINE: By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE; BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE is the chief theater critic for The Times of London.

 BODY:
ENGLAND may be in recession. London and the southeast may be particularly hard hit. Tourists from America, put off by the weakness of the dollar against the pound, may be fewer than hoped. Nevertheless, two of London's more important theaters are reopening this fall, each with its innards expensively retooled.
For the last four years, the most central of all West End theaters, the Criterion, has been just a hole beneath Piccadilly Circus. Theatergoers have been deprived of not only the stage that gave the English-speaking world "Waiting for Godot" and many other major plays, but also a Louis XVI-style auditorium that had, sadly, become tacky and decayed. But by Oct. 21, after the expenditure of a million dollars, the theater is to be restored sufficiently to present a new play by James Saunders, "Making It Better," which was well received during a tryout at the Hempstead Theater in February. 
 Jane Asher is to stay on in the role of a BBC producer who finds 1989 an emotionally as well as a politically taxing year. She takes two Czechoslovak lovers after her husband has made his own particular defection, by coming out of the sexual closet.
Betrayal of all kinds is in the air, and it is handled with the same wry, dry wit that Mr. Saunders, one of Britain's most underrated dramatists, brought to "Bodies" and "Next Time I'll Sing to You." "His best play to date," wrote Irving Wardle in The Independent on Sunday.
The other expensively refurbished theater is the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden. Regular playgoers may have suffered the cramped, bumpy seats, but most of them still had special places in their hearts for the theater. The Royal Shakespeare Company used the Donmar Warehouse for years, mounting many of its finest productions on the theater's broken boards. Pam Gem's "Piaf" (in which Jane Lapotaire won a Tony for the title role on Broadway) opened in the Donmar Warehouse, as did works by Edward Bond, Stephen Poliakoff and Howard Brenton, as well as Willy Russell's "Educating Rita."
The evening should be easier on the derriere if not the mind when Stephen Sondheim's "Assassins" reopens the theater on Oct. 29. The show, which celebrates an all-American bestiary of Presidential assassins, had a bumpy ride when it appeared at Playwrights Horizons in Manhattan early last year. It won some admiration and respect, but failed to make the leap from Off Broadway to Broadway. Will new orchestration and the guiding hand of Britain's hottest young director, Sam Mendes, change the fortunes of one of Mr. Sondheim's most daringly original librettos?
Christmas is the time classical audiences want some R & R, and this year the holiday brings another major musical revival to the National Theater in London. Will Nicholas Hytner, the director of "Miss Saigon," succeed in doing for "Carousel" what Richard Eyre did for "Guys and Dolls" 10 years ago? That question will be answered on Dec. 10, the opening night for the tune-packed Rodgers and Hammerstein show.
But nearly two months before that, on Oct. 20, the West End sees a more talked-about musical arrival. Indeed, no coming show is drawing as much hype as Hal Prince's production of the John Kander and Fred Ebb version of "Kiss of the Spider Woman." The show, which reportedly faltered in workshops in New York, opened in Toronto this summer and received some rapturous reviews. Robert Cushman, a former theater critic of The London Observer who lives in Canada, wrote that it should join "Porgy and Bess," "Sweeney Todd" and "Camelot" as one of the four American musicals of truly tragic dimensions.
But how can Manuel Puig's novel-turned-play-turned-film make that leap? How can even Prince inflate a jail-house tale involving just two characters into a major musical? The answer appears to lie largely with Chita Rivera, who is coming to London to play some of the prisoners' dream women, primarily the menacing arachnoid of the title. Expect her and the show to make a prompt move to Broadway if and when it lives up to its advance billing at the Shaftesbury Theater.
Everybody complains about the dearth of new plays at mainstream London theaters, although such sightings are more frequent there than on Broadway, where they alight about as often as swallows in Antarctica. Two of Britain's less prolific dramatists have important openings, at the National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company's smaller London house, the Pit. And coincidentally -- or is it something in the air? -- each play has a similar theme.
Peter Shaffer, the author of "Amadeus" and "Equus," has produced nothing since "Lettice and Lovage" opened in London in 1987 and moved to New York soon after. His as yet untitled new play opens on Dec. 16 at the Pit, is directed by Peter Hall, and brings Judi Dench and Michael Pennington to the stage in a portrait of a troubled marriage. Specifically, a wife looks back on her life with a turbulent playwright, examining their love and estrangement, and what Mr. Shaffer tantalizingly calls "the dilemmas of revenge and retribution."
"Stages," by David Storey, who at the age of 59 is 7 years younger than Mr. Shaffer, also has a somewhat ruminative, introspective sound. Alan Bates plays a writer-painter performing an emotional post-mortem on himself, his loves and the work that, it seems, drove him to madness.
With Lindsay Anderson directing, as he did Mr. Storey's wonderful "Home" and "The Contractor" in the 1970's, this could be the play that regalvanizes a playwriting career that has been somewhat becalmed of late. Opening night at the National Theater: Nov. 18.
Harold Pinter, surely the greatest living British playwright, does not pen much for the theater these days. He started his professional career as an actor, has very occasionally appeared on the stage since he became a dramatist, and returns to it on Nov. 2 in his own "No Man's Land." The theater where the play is being revived is the Almeida in London's Islington section, and the event is sure to draw cognoscenti and Pinter scholars into its tiny, shabby auditorium.
What makes this doubly exciting is that "No Man's Land" is the least known of Pinter's full-length plays. It had a modest success at the National Theater in 1975, with Ralph Richardson as an alcoholic recluse and John Gielgud as the down-at-the-heels poet who assaults his name and his memories; but it has not had a major showing since then.
Will Mr. Pinter and Paul Eddington, respectively following in those actors' large footsteps, succeed in rehabilitating the play? There is no more fascinating question being posed by the London theater this fall.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORMS: THREE REPORTS;
Miami

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; STEVE LOHR, a financial reporter for The Times, has covered Hurricane Andrew's effects on Florida's economy.

 BODY:
FOUR days after Hurricane Andrew cut its swath of destruction through south Florida on Aug. 24, Miami's top tourism officials met here with a group of their counterparts from Charleston, S.C., where Hurricane Hugo came ashore in 1989. One message from the South Carolina hurricane veterans: don't be misled by the surge of hotel bookings in the storm's aftermath as relief workers, insurance adjusters, construction crews and soldiers descend on the area.
Indeed, hotels rooms are scarce now in the Miami area, with occupancy rates averaging 80 percent, well above the 65 percent or so that is typical for the sluggish months before the peak winter season. "But the problem is that the influx of people because of the cleanup and rebuilding displaces the normal fall tourism business," said Helen Stansell, executive director of the Charleston Convention and Visitors Bureau. "And we found that you've got to work real hard to get people back." 
 Miami's tourism revival campaign began almost as soon as the storm passed. State and local tourist agencies have run newspaper and television ads, set up an 800 phone number for updated information and dispatched representatives abroad to allay the concerns of travel agents in key foreign markets. Their message is that the hurricane's undeniable devastation, and its eerie scenes of crumpled buildings and toppled trees, was largely confined to the southern part of Dade County.
The most populated areas and best-known tourist sites escaped severe damage. The Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau reports that 110 of its 115 member hotels are were open by last week. The Art Deco district along Ocean Drive, downtown Miami, Miami Beach and Bal Harbour suffered minor wind damage, and little more. The port facilities in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, jumping-off stations for Caribbean cruises, were spared.
Key Biscayne was hit harder. The Sonesta Beach Hotel and the Sheraton Royal Biscayne Beach Resort remain closed, though both are trying to reopen as soon as possible, perhaps before Christmas. The Silver Sands Motel, an endearing landmark and watering hole, was almost totally destroyed and its future remains in doubt.
Farther south, in the Kendall area, the 290-acre Metrozoo, which was home to 1,200 animals and an attraction for more than 700,000 visitors annually, was devastated. "It looked like a war zone when I walked in the first morning," recalled Ron Magill, the zoo's assistant curator. The storm had toppled concrete walls and picked up trucks, tossing them hundreds of yards like children's toys. During the rebuilding, expected to take a year and cost more than $20 million, one third of the animals have become refugees, sent to zoos from San Diego to the Bronx, including three koalas Mr. Magill took as passengers in a five-seat airplane to Busch Gardens in Tampa.
Still, Miami's tourist business remains remarkably intact, entirely capable of handling the 8.4 million visitors the area last year. But will they come to Miami's sun-and-fun playground knowing that the hurricane-ravaged areas and tent cities are just 25 miles or so to the south?
The answers from travel agents and cruise-line operators are mixed and inconclusive. Brian Robb, vice president of marketing for the Carlson Travel Group in Minneapolis said a scarcity of hotel rooms in Miami, not canceled tourist trips, seemed to be the big problem caused by the hurricane so far. Tim Gallagher of Carnival Cruise Lines said hurricanes were always followed by a falloff in cruise business, but added that it was too early to gauge Andrew's impact. A "nonevent," said Jane Weiller, president of Hartsdale Travel Agency in Hartsdale, N.Y., who has not seen a single cancellation in Miami travel plans after the hurricane. A "drastic effect," asserted Paul Williams of Linden Travel in Manhattan, noting that the few people the agency booked for Miami in this off-season tended to switch plans and go elsewhere, places like Bermuda.
A closer look at the high Miami-area hotel occupancy rates suggests a falloff in tourist travel. Mayco Villafana of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau gives a rough estimate that perhaps half of the 80 percent occupancy in local hotels is normal travel, while the rest is storm-related traffic. Given the usual early-fall occupancy rate of 65 percent, that indicates a tourist and business travel shortfall of as much as 25 percent. And relief workers, cleanup crews and insurance adjusters don't spend their money on many leisure pursuits.
The leaders of Miami's tourism industry recognize that they face a challenge. "There will be a dip," said Tony Goldman, owner of the Park Central, the Imperial and the Heathcote, three adjacent hotels in the Art Deco district. "But the message we need to get across is that the devastation was 25 miles south of here, things are operating now as they did before the hurricane, and that people have nothing to feel guilty about by coming." "If they don't come," added Mr. Goldman, who is also an executive board member of the Miami visitors bureau, "then that could really shake the economics of area and inhibit the comeback of the region."
The 8.4 million tourists who visited the Miami area last year spent $7.2 billion. And nearly one-third of the region's work force, more than 250,000 people, is dependent on the tourism business. Many of these service workers live in the hurricane-battered areas of south Dade County. "If we don't have a healthy tourism industry, we'd not only have people homeless but also jobless," said Mr. Villafana of the vistors bureau.
The message that tourism is back in business is the central theme of the post-hurricane ad campaigns by the state ("Florida: We're Still Open") and Miami ("Miami's tempo is as upbeat as usual"). Spending for the Miami campaign is set at $200,000 for September through November. Getting that message out and repeating it is crucial in post-disaster situations to counteract the steady stream of television, newspaper and magazine images of destruction that people saw right after the hurricane, according to Charles Goeldner, a professor at the University of Colorado business school and editor of The Journal of Travel Research. "The biggest problem is overcoming the intial perception," Mr. Goeldner said.
TRAVEL business bounces back at different rates after natural disasters depending on how much damage was done and how deftly the local people handle the recovery. Three months after the San Francisco earthquake in 1989, the hotel occupancy rates were still 25 percent below normal and retail traffic in Fisherman's Wharf was off 50 percent, according to Economics Research Associates, a travel consultancy in San Francisco. One problem was that the San Francisco earthquake, unlike the Florida hurricane, knocked out vital traffic arteries. Yet within a year, San Francisco's tourism business had recovered fully.
More damaging to tourism is civil unrest like the riots in Los Angeles. Many Japanese tourists have shunned Los Angeles in recent months, according to Economics Research Associates. And the company's studies of tourism in Hong Kong, a staging post for China travel, after Tiananmen Square and social unrest elsewhere found that international travel to those destinations fell off sharply for two years. "Tourists are far more forgiving of acts of nature than of acts of man," said Steve Spickard, vice president of the consultancy.
For Miami, the international image is particularly important because 55 percent of its visitors come from abroad, mainly from Europe and Latin America. The evidence seems to be that foreign travelers are coming back. Dermot Cairns, a tour operator from Belfast, Northern Ireland, who sends a jetful of 360 tourists to Florida each week, reported that in the first two weeks after Andrew 75 percent of his clients canceled their trips, even though they fly into Orlando and many then go on to Miami.
But as word got out that tourist operations in Florida were working as usual, the qualms of Irish travelers soon vanished. "The business came back remarkably quickly," Mr. Cairns said.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Behind the Masks of a Moralist

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
As the dawn lightens, the first entrance of the Greek chorus shocks an audience into realizing just how astonishing Ariane Mnouchkine's Theatre du Soleil really is. The double door at the distant rear swings open and in they surge -- 15 red-clad women (though some are really men), stamping and swaying with a gleeful joy that is very close to barbaric fury.
There is little scenery in the modern sense, but the look is still riveting: faces covered with chalk-white makeup, like masks; headpieces, and costumes with full skirts, vests and glittering ornaments that are an ingenious hybrid of the ethnic cultures stretching from southern Italy through the Middle East to southern India. 
 Miss Mnouchkine's Theatre du Soleil (Theater of the Sun), an institution in Europe for nearly 30 years, is quintessentially French and inherently cosmopolitan. A nearly lifelong Parisian, Miss Mnouchkine has created a unique style that blends world theatrical cultures in the service of Western classics and contemporary epics.
Outwardly similar to the work of another Paris-based theatrical internationalist, Peter Brook, Theatre du Soleil's stylistic fusion is more diverse and organic, its enunciation of the French language more elegant and its dance and music closer to Pina Bausch and other European choreographers. Although Miss Mnouchkine has her detractors, she has won critical admiration and audience enthusiasm that is close to adulation.
Despite her fame abroad, her company has visited the United States only once, presenting Shakespeare in French at the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival in Los Angeles. Now, finally, the company will make its New York debut, with three cycles of its current four-part project, called "Les Atrides," or "The House of Atreus." The performances will take place over an 11-day period starting Thursday at the specially refitted Park Slope Armory in Brooklyn, under the auspices of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Americans are hardly used to hearing theater in foreign languages; in Brooklyn, incomprehensibility will be alleviated by the familiarity of the plays and by translation through earphones. But more than language separates Theatre du Soleil from conventional Anglo-American theater. In addition to its synthesis of theatrical traditions, the company is a commune, a radical popular theater born of leftist idealism that speaks to theater lovers all across the political spectrum. When three of its four parts were staged in Paris last June, the conservative American monthly New Criterion called "Les Atrides" the "most exciting and innovative theatrical experience on earth."
Miss Mnouchkine is a cheerful woman with a handsome face, a winning grin and Brillo-like gray hair, given to baggy yet comfortably stylish clothes. She combines the images of fierce theatrical moralist, bubbling happy child, nurturing mother and forbidding French intellectual. (It was she who branded Euro Disney a "cultural Chernobyl.")
Although she was born in Paris in 1939, the daughter of Russian immigrants, Miss Mnouchkine's first connection to theater was at Oxford. "I went there to study psychology," she said, during a break from tour performances in Montpellier, not far from Marseilles. "But then I joined the Oxford University Drama Society, and one day I said, 'Of course, this is what I want to do.' "
In the early 60's, she embarked on a year's journey to Asia, then founded Theatre du Soleil in 1964. From the first, it was a visionary enterprise, a band of leftist romantics convinced that they could change the world. And although the personnel has turned over completely, the vision remains consistent.
"Theatre du Soleil is the dream of living, working, being happy and searching for beauty and for goodness," Miss Mnouchkine said. "It's trying to live for higher purposes, not for richness. It's very simple, really."
The theater got its name through a similarly openhearted idealism. "At the time theaters were named for their directors, but I could not imagine calling it Le Theatre Ariane Mnouchkine," she said. "We were looking for life, light, heat, beauty, strength, fertility . . ."
In 1970 the ensemble took possession of what has remained its home ever since -- three airy warehouses in the Cartoucherie (or weapons depot, which is what it was up to the 19th century), in the Bois de Vincennes just east of Paris. Today, the first of the warehouses is a huge lobby space, the second a transitional area, and the third, the 1,200-seat theater: sharply raked bleachers and a huge square performing area bereft of wings or flies or changeable scenery. It is this theater that Miss Mnouchkine insists be replicated whenever her company tours. But touring performances cannot duplicate the all-embracing mood in Paris, the sense of having entered, willingly, into another world.
The company spent the 1970's exploring France -- "telling our history in order to make it advance," as she once put it. In 1979 she shifted gears, with her own adaptation of Klaus Mann's novel "Mephisto." Then, in the early 80's, came Shakespeare: "Richard II" (the company's first comprehensive employment of Asian masks and costumes), "Twelfth Night" and "Henry IV, Part I."
The success of the Shakespeare productions brought yet another change of direction: two nearly daylong epic pageants about contemporary Cambodia and India by the French feminist intellectual Helene Cixous (see-zou). The next project was to have been another Cixous blockbuster, this time on the controversial topic of the Vichy regime.
"Helene Cixous was ready, but I was not," Miss Mnouchkine said. "It so difficult to imagine such a close period in time and space. Before, when we talked about France, it was a long time ago, and when we talked about now, it was far away. The Resistance images are still with us, from photographs and films. I felt my dreams were not free, not theatrical: they were still realistic."
Instead, Miss Mnouchkine plunged back into the classics. It was her idea, for "Les Atrides," to preface Aeschylus' "Oresteia" trilogy with Euripides' "Iphigenia in Aulis," written more than 50 years later and more sympathetic to Clytemnestra; her grief at the sacrifice of her daughter makes her murder of her husband more understandable. It's better theater and better feminism.
Beyond sheer spectacle, "Les Atrides" is striking for the power of its choruses, the omnipresence of the music and the doubling and redoubling of the principal parts. The chorus changes from fiercely joyful women in "Iphigenia" to soldiers overcome by the horror of war in "Agamemnon" to black-clad, vulturelike harridans in "The Libation Bearers." In "The Eumenides" they become terrifying mythic beasts, no longer dancing but growling and snarling, led by three harpies straight from a Brechtian proletarian netherworld and standing as eternal threats to human benevolence.
The ever-present background music is provided by Jean-Jacques Lemetre, who has been with the troupe for 14 years. When actors are speaking, he leaps among his battery of exotic instruments, a megalomaniacally inflated one-man band, although for the chorus dances he falls back on recorded ensemble music. He says his music is so intimately wedded to speech rhythms that having other musicians accompany him would be nearly impossible, and a live dance ensemble would be too expensive.
More unusual still is the casting of a few actors in most of the major roles. The most dramatic case is that of Simon Abkarian, a French-born Armenian raised in Lebanon who spent many years in Southern California -- as a cabaret dancer, he says. Mr. Abkarian plays Agamemnon, Achilles, a chorus leader, a messenger, Orestes and, to cap this tour de force, Orestes' nurse.
The Brazilian Juliana Carneiro da Cunha, a dancer trained in the school of Maurice Bejart, does both Clytemnestra and Athena in "The Eumenides"; the Indian Nirupama Nityanandan is Cassandra, a chorus leader, and Iphigenia, a role in which her 20 years of training as a Bharata Natyam dancer in Madras can be seen to especially beguiling effect. Brontis Jodorowsky, born in Mexico of a Chilean father and a French mother, plays a host of secondary parts.
Artistic decisions are described as simple deductions from unassailable "evidence"; that doubling parts may make dramatic sense is dismissed as coincidence. "What I call theatrical evidence just emerges," Miss Mnouchkine said. "It's not discussed. We discuss when something goes wrong, when for two or three days we are stuck. When the work is going, we don't discuss, we work."
The actors concede, however, that Miss Mnouchkine makes the final decisions. Mr. Jodorowsky sees her as almost like a Zen master: "She directs not by adding things but by taking things away, down to the more and more simple, the more essential."
Dismissive of most acting today, with its uninflected imitation of life, Miss Mnouchkine prefers a broadly emotive style that recalls what we know of early Western theater and that still exists in the non-Western world. Not for her, despite her own academic background, the psychological identification of the typical modern Western actor. "We flee daily life," she said in an interview in The Drama Review. "We do not talk of psychology but rather of the characters' souls. The theater is not supposed to represent psychology but passions."
Miss Mnouchkine believes that masks (or masklike makeup) liberate acting from pale realism. In "Les Atrides," the masks and makeup become simpler as the plays approach modernity. Yet, Miss Mnouchkine says, the mask is always there -- "the mask of character."
She categorically rejects the idea that she has poached on exotic cultures. "What we do derives completely from the action of the characters," she said. "Iphigenia is not using the real steps and mudras of India, which would mean nothing to us. She's just showing her feelings. She's not using the codes; she's using what is inward.
"IMPERIALISM IS NOT MY problem; it is your problem," she said, speaking of Americans. "Cultural imperialism is the opposite of what we do. It is the repressing of other cultures. It's what we suffer from in France, with the film and television products of the United States."
Economically, Theatre du Soleil is still a commune, although its members live in their own apartments with whomever they please. It is legally organized to share income -- at present, 60 people (including Miss Mnouchkine and the 26 actors as well as backstage personnel) receive 9,000 francs ($1,800) each per month. "It's a small salary," Miss Mnouchkine said, "but it's not worse than many other theaters."
The company is given $1.4 million annually by the French Ministry of Culture, the figure having been doubled in 1981 when the Socialists took power. The rest of its income (roughly twice the subsidy in an average year, according to Nathalie Pousset, a company administrator) derives from the box office and fees from tour hosts. Miss Mnouchkine rejects corporate sponsorship, but the New York debut was insured by French corporate support from Air France and Elf Aquitaine.
Right now, the troupe is a young one, with the veteran actors having only six or seven years of tenure. "When we started, we were there for all our lives," Miss Mnouchkine recalled wistfully. "But of course it's a mistake to think that."
Miss Mnouchkine holds annual workshops, usually 10 days long, and although she says they are not auditions, she gets most of her actors from them. By all evidence this is a happy group, full of people who really like one another. Miss Carneiro da Cunha, for one, speaks lyrically of her new friendship with Miss Mnouchkine, how they left a late show in Toulouse and rode through the streets on their bicycles as the sun came up.
Still, there is the potential for estrangement between the director and her actors. "People who come here may be nervous at first," Miss Carneiro da Cunha said. "They know Ariane as somebody very famous. But after a while they just see Ariane. And they're famous, too, collectively. What is difficult is the question of age. I've aged and they have not."
Although the company remains true to its Utopian ideals from the 60's, the Utopia seems now to be expressed in religious terms -- the theater as a sacred space and art as an avenue to the divine.
"That is all very personal, very intimate," Miss Mnouchkine said. "We never go on stage thoughtlessly, without saluting it, some little sign, just putting a hand on the stage. For some it's religious, for others superstitious, for others just a habit. Our actors never step on the stage without realizing that it relates to spirit and the progress of the mind."
 
 
 
ASSEMBLING THE PARTS
 "Les Atrides" will be presented under the auspices of the Brooklyn Academy of Music at the Park Slope Armory, Eighth Avenue and 15th Street. The four plays will be performed in three four-part series: the first is this Thursday and Friday and Oct. 8 and Oct. 9 at 8 P.M.; the second, Saturday at 3:30 and 8 P.M. and Sunday at 1:30 and 6 P.M.; the third, Oct. 10 at 3:30 and 8 P.M. and Oct. 11 at 1:30 and 6 P.M. Each performance runs approximately two and a half hours, without intermission.
Series tickets are sold out, but seats remain for individual performances. Tickets are $40 and can be purchased through Ticketmaster and at the BAM ticket office (but not at the armory). Information: (718) 636-4100.
Seating is reserved by section only; there are no reserved seats and latecomers will not be seated. Doors open one hour prior to curtain time, and the audience is invited to secure seats and then visit the dressing area beneath the armory bleachers to watch the troupe put on costumes and makeup.
For simultaneous translations of performances, which are in French, headsets can be rented for $5.
Picnic meals are available prior to curtain time and between performances on weekends.
To reach the armory by subway, take the F train to the Prospect Park-15th Street stop and walk two blocks north. A free shuttle bus goes to the armory from BAM, 30 Lafayette Avenue, 90 minutes before each performance and returns to BAM up to an hour afterward.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Letting Your Computer Be Your Guide

BYLINE: By L. R. SHANNON; L. R. SHANNON writes the Peripherals column for The Times.

 BODY:
PERSONAL-COMPUTER owners will soon have access to travel information drawn from the Zagat Survey guides to hotels and restaurants, which compile customers' opinions of the establishments.
The software, one of three noteworthy programs for travelers, brings together the Zagat information with mapping data, right down to street addresses, licensed from Etak, of Menlo Park, Calif., in a versatile and easy-to-use program developed by Axxis Electronic Publishing, of Haverford, Pa. The product, Zagat-Axxis Cityguide, should be available in retail outlets starting Thursday. The first three guides will be for New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and will cost about $99 each, or all three for $249. 
 Maps are at the heart of the Cityguides, both overall maps of the selected cities or more detailed representations of neighborhoods of interest. Underlying the maps are the data, which can be searched in many ways. For instance, you could ask for all the French restaurants with a Zagat food rating of at least 18 within a specified distance from your hotel. (Zagat ratings run from 0 to 30.)
The computer then would produce a capsule review of one or more restaurants -- there are 1,063 in the New York version -- with address, phone number, price and other information. Of course, you can find all that in a book. But the computer also displays a map, pinpointing the location of the restaurant, and will show the best route for getting there, as a line on the map or in plain prose, which a user can print out and take along. You can even specify areas you would like the route to avoid or places you want to include on the way. The hotel information, for 79 establishments in New York City, is handled similarly.
Although there is no reason that a Cityguide couldn't be used on a desktop computer, it is really aimed at travelers who carry a portable computer. The search for a place to have dinner can become so absorbing, indeed, that there is a danger you will never leave the room.
For people who tend to such absorption, the program offers plenty of toys, or rather tools, for edification. You can zoom in and out for closer or more general views, measure distances, draw on the map or split the screen to see two neighborhoods at once. The map can even be folded, electronically, much like a printed version.
The computer requirements are well up in the high end, particularly for a portable. The machine must be capable of running Microsoft Windows 3.0 or 3.1, preferably in color, with at least two megabytes of working memory (four megabytes is recommended, though) and, depending on the city, five to nine megabytes of hard-disk space. Additional cities should come on line before the end of the year, more than 30 in the United States, as well as versions for the Apple Macintosh and Powerbook, and for a variety of handheld computers.

Campground Directory
 Finding the right campground or recreational-vehicle park couldn't be easier when a computer does the dirty work. Microcamp Campground Directory, Western U.S.A., a program from Corinthian Concepts of Fair Oaks, Calif., makes that possible.
Let us say we are planning to drive a 35-foot recreational vehicle to South Lake Tahoe, Calif., in September. The first step is to pick the state, California, followed by the geographic region, the northeast. Then we select the nearby town, in this case South Lake Tahoe, from a long list. Next we fill in an on-screen form with the features we want in a campground: the minimum area in acres; the maximum elevation in feet; the month open; the minimum number of tent and R.V. sites; the maximum R.V. length the camp can handle; R.V. hookups and waste-disposal stations; boating; drinking water; flush toilets; trails; swimming; fishing; showers, and whether the camp is public or private.
It is necessary only to specify the requirements we insist on; the rest can be left to fall as they may. For instance, gregarious travelers might prefer a camp with a fairly high minimum number of sites, so there are more people to meet, or dedicated walkers will want trails to explore. In this example, the crucial factors are the month, September; the R.V. length, 35 feet, and, come to think of it, a shower after a couple of days on the road. So we fill in those blanks and press a key. (By the way, almost no typing is involved. Selections are made from a series of lists.)
In an instant, the names of three campgrounds appear: K.O.A. Kampground Tahoe Paradise, Richardson's Resort and Tahoe Valley Campground. We're familiar with K.O.A.'s, so we'll look at that one first. Another key is pressed.
In addition to the information we already knew, because we specified it, there are driving directions from South Lake Tahoe, the phone number and address, reservations policy, the number of tent and R.V. sites, and much else, including whether pets are allowed.
Instead of seeking a camp by state, region and nearby town, you can look for one in a particular recreation area -- the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, say, or Bighorn Canyon in Montana. The program is limited to 12 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.
When you have made your choice, you can print out the information and take it along. In fact, if you travel with a computer, you can take the whole program along.
Hardware requirements are fairly modest: a computer with any kind of monitor, 512 kilobytes of internal memory, DOS 2.0 or later and a hard disk with at least two megabytes of free space. The suggested retail price is $99.95, and if Microcamp is not available at a software shop it can be ordered from Corinthian Concepts by phoning (916) 863-1475.
 
Cities on CD-ROM
 CD-ROM technology -- Compact Disk-Read Only Memory -- might have been invented for travel guidebooks. These little platters, essentially the same as the more familiar music CD's, can hold enormous numbers of words, as well as striking illustrations and even sounds. Great Cities of the World, volumes one and two, bring all of these capabilities to a home or office personal computer, assuming it is a rather powerful one.
Volume one covers Bombay, Cairo, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney and Tokyo; volume two covers Berlin, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Rome, San Francisco, Seoul, Singapore and Toronto.
For each city, there is information in the following categories: fast facts, such things as climate and currency; culture; sights; transportation; shopping; entertainment; recreation; restaurants, and hotels, divided into deluxe, moderate, economy and ones near the airport. There are maps galore. In volume two, parts of the maps can be selected for a more detailed look, although the mapping options are rudimentary compared with those in the Zagat-Axxis packages.
So-called slide shows put color photographs of attractions in the selected cities on the screen, complete with narration and music. There are essays by Jan Morris, Pico Iyer and Simon Winchester.
To run the Great Cities programs, one of the following systems is required: an A.T.-class machine running DOS 3.1 or later, with 640 kilobytes of memory, V.G.A. graphics, hard disk, mouse, CD-ROM drive and headphones or speakers; a Multimedia-equipped A.T. running DOS 3.1 or later, two megabytes of memory, Super V.G.A., audio card, hard disk, mouse, CD-ROM drive and headphones or speakers; a Macintosh LC or II-series computer, System 6.0.7 or later, four megabytes of memory, a 13-inch color monitor, hard disk and CD-ROM player.
Each of the two volumes of Great Cities of the World has a suggested retail price of $79.95. They are available at major software shops, or directly from the publisher, Interoptica Publishing, 300 Montgomery Street, second floor, San Francisco, Calif. 94104; (415) 788-8788.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORMS: THREE REPORTS;
Bahamas

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL covers the travel industry for The Times.

 BODY:
ONLY hours before Hurricane Andrew smashed into the United States mainland late last month the storm barreled into the Bahamas, the string of islands stretching 600 miles southeastward into the Atlantic Ocean from just off the coast of Florida. While the destruction in the Bahamas does not compare with the devastation in south Florida, the hurricane -- the worst to hit the islands in more than 60 years -- killed four people and left some 1,700 of the 250,000 residents of the Bahamas homeless. It also wiped out roads, bridges and resort hotels.
But almost all major damage was confined to the northern part of Eleuthera, Harbour Island, Spanish Wells, Cat Cay, Bimini and part of the Berry Islands -- that is, to several of the sparsely populated Family Islands. Nassau and Freeport were untouched, except for minor damage from high winds and rain, as were the Abacos, Cat Island, Andros Island, the Exumas, San Salvador and various other of the Bahamas's 40 inhabited islands. 
 Prime Minister Hubert A. Ingraham said there was $250 million in damage, with $100 million of it on Cat Cay. In a separate, earlier interview Baltron Bethel, the Bahamas director general of tourism said "the physical devastation affected about 2 percent of our rooms, cottages and apartments."
Instead of a modest increase in tourism this year, officials now expect a 10 to 20 percent drop -- despite their reassurances to travel agents in North America and an extensive advertising campaign designed to assure the public that 98 percent of the Bahamas was untouched by the hurricane. Still, even though damage was so limited the Bahamian economy was affected more than Florida's. The island nation earns almost 60 percent of its gross domestic product from tourism, and the jobs of 7 out of 10 Bahamians are dependent on the industry.
The restoration and repair of property already underway on most of the damaged islands is impressive, but it may take years to recover from the loss of wildlife and the uprooting of tens of thousands of trees, plants and flowers. While most tourists visit the Bahamas to swim, shop and gamble, the loss of some of the islands' natural beauty could hurt the new Bahamian Government's efforts to emphasize tourism for nature lovers and environmentalists.
Looking forlornly across eight acres that until recently had been graced by stately coconut palm trees, Roger Becht, the owner of the 10-room Runaway Hill Club on Harbour Island, one and a half miles long, lamented three weeks after the hurricane, "With its beautiful beaches and reefs, this island can't help but come back. But for most of us, it just won't have the same look." While the rooms themselves suffered only minor
 flooding and boken windows, Runaway Hill's landscape and vegetation are no longer lush.
Several hundred yards down the pink-tinged beach, on 16 landscaped acres that had been a bird sanctuary, the Pink Sands resort is a tangle of uprooted palm trees and rotting vegetation heaped so high that in some places it obscures the windows blown out of the 29 abandoned cottages.
But the Pink Sands is an exception; most of the half-dozen other resorts on Harbour Island, which traditionally close from Labor Day to about mid-November, already look as though they will be ready to greet guests on schedule. For example, the 10-room Ocean View Beach Club, high atop a cliff overlooking the ocean, lost the railing on its deck and sustained other minor damage. "But we were planning to close for renovations in October anyhow," said Ithalia Johnson, the assistant manager, "so when we reopen you won't even know a storm passed through here -- except for the missing vegetation."
OCEAN VIEW plans to reopen Nov. 1, as does the 14-acre beachfront Coral Sands Hotel and the Rock House, a seven-room hotel facing the bay. The 38-room Romora Bay Club, once a private estate, expects to reopen by November.
The residents of Harbour Island still hope to restore some of its natural beauty. "We're trying to import 15- to-20 foot palm trees" to preserve the island's character, said Clayton Johnston, a Canadian-born schoolteacher, who has lived there five years. As he spoke, members of the Bahamian defense force and construction crews from the United States Navy were swarming atop the island's elementary school, putting the finishing repairs on the roof damaged by the hurricane.
Andrew also hit nearby Spanish Wells, which now has only one of its two hotels remaining, and the northern end of Eleuthera, the narrow, 110-mile long island less than 10 minutes by ferry from Harbour Island and Spanish Wells. The hurricane destroyed the 18-room Current Club Beach Resort and Marina in northern Eleuthera and damaged at least four other hotels and resorts in the area. It caused structural damage Club Med Eleuthera's restaurant and water-sports complex, closing the 300-room resort 10 miles from Governor's Harbour Airport. But the club plans to reopen Nov. 14. Veering westward, the storm also battered the Berry Islands, Cat Cay and Bimini.
Though sparsely populated, those islands struck by Andrew are among the brightest jewels in the crown that the new Government -- elected to office only four days before the hurricane hit -- was planning to use as its lure for environmentally oriented travelers.
The hurricane damage would have been far worse had not Andrew mostly just huffed and puffed at Nassau (New Providence) and Freeport (Grand Bahamas), briefly interrupting power and telephones, toppling trees, breaking windows and flooding roads. Not only are those the most populous cities, but their attractions and gambling casinos lure most of the 3.6 million annual visitors, who last year spent $1.2 billion.
"We canceled some shows, and we taped our windows and put sandbags against the exits," said Peter F. Major II, executive assistant manager of the 867-room Carnival's Crystal Palace on Nassau's Cable Beach. "Then we held a hurricane party for guests in a ballroom, but luckily the worst we got were high winds and rain."
Despite Government fears, many visitors appear unfazed. Hunter Turnage, a Cablevision salesman from Raleigh, N.C., arrived in Nassau earlier this month on a four-day package tour. "I checked with my travel agent to be sure the hurricane didn't affect Nassau," he said, "and when they said there was no problem I didn't give it a second thought."
Also there were many Japanese tourists, part of the growing number of visitors from that country to the Bahamas. "We have a group arrive every day, 99 percent of them honeymooners," said Tomoko Mitamura, resident representative for ANA Hallo Tours, who added that only a few groups delayed their arrival because of the hurricane.
Three young women from Tokyo, who attended high school and college together, stood in Parliament Square recently listening to the Salvation Army band, the sun glistening off the musician's brass instruments and white uniforms. "We came to swim and win lots of money gambling," said one of them, to a chorus of laughter from her friends.
Despite the impressive pace of repairs on the damaged islands, some hotels there may never come back. "If this is rebuilt it won't be by us, because we're selling it," said Crystal Newbold, the wife of one of four owners of the Spanish Wells Beach Resort, a 30-room landmark on Spanish Wells island. Mrs. Newbold spoke amid the rubble left after the hurricane sheared off the resort's entire second floor, shattered windows and uprooted trees. A few blocks away, Lester Roberts, the manager of the Spanish Wells Yacht Haven, with five apartments, was busy arranging repairs for the dock and replacement windows for the office.
The hurricane destroyed the Chub Cay Club, a hotel and 90-slip marina at the south end of Berry Island, according to Mr. Bethel. According to Prime Minister Ingraham, Andrew also destroyed the Cat Cay Club and its 110-slip marina on Cat Cay, a three-mile-long luxury hideaway about 50 miles from Florida.
"Almost everything there is completely shattered," said Paddy O'Leary, a pilot for Chalk's International Airlines, who flew several post-hurricane charter flights to Cat Cay. After taking off from Bimini recently he flew his 17-passenger seaplane low over Cat Cay, enabling passengers to view the widespread wreckage alongside million-dollar estates and to see the hundreds of palm trees uprooted or broken in two by wind gusts that residents estimate exceeded 200 miles an hour.
Winds hurtling up Bimini Harbor blew off part of the roof at 24-room Brown's hotel, then continued up the beach where it destroyed the dock and flooded several of the 49 guest rooms at the Bimini Big Game Fishing Club and Hotel, owned by Bacardi. It also smashed windows and downed trees at the 32-slip Blue Water Resort, which is host of the Hemingway billfish tournament in March. Both operations are back in business, but without many of the trees, hibiscus and bougainvillea that formerly graced their beachfront properties.
THE COMPLEAT ANGLER, the bar, restaurant and 12-room hotel in Bimini, suffered some flooding and the same power and telephone failure that afflicted most of the Family Islands. But the storm left virtually untouched the ground-floor Hemingway Museum, which is filled with photographs, sketches and other memorabilia of the writer, who often held forth in the bar in the 1930's.
Up the hill, between harbor and ocean, the 13-room Anchorage Restaurant and Hotel lost nine coconut trees, a half-dozen windows and much of its vegetation. "I'm 53, and I lived through a lot of storms, but nothing like this," said Ivan Banks Thompson, its longtime bartender. "But everybody pitched in to help, and the storm actually brought all the people back together who had been divided by the election."
Mr. Thompson was referring to the bitterly contested election Aug. 19, in which the Free National Movement toppled the Progressive Liberal Party, which had ruled the Bahamas for 25 consecutive years.
The new administration plans to sell the seven Government-owned hotels -- three on Grand Bahama Island, two on Nassua and two on Andros -- and four casinos (two each on Nassau and Freeport) to private developers. It envisions developing and promoting the Family Islands as separate and distinctive destinations not only for the scuba diving for which they are now renowned but also for nature walks, bird watching and quiet getaways at small, family-owned-and-operated clubs and lodges.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Water and Sewer Charges;
The Orange Light on Meter-Based Billing

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
RICHARD MEYERS is a prudent man. When New York City installed a new water meter at the 37-unit building he manages at 1780 Eastburn Avenue near the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, he called in a consultant. How could the building conserve on water use, he asked.
The consultant told him to put aerators on the bathroom faucets. Change the kitchen faucets. Replace the valves in the toilets. Buy new shower heads. If the correct products are chosen, low-flow devices can save 10 to 30 percent in water use, the consultant said, at a cost of only $40 to $60 an apartment. 
 Mr. Meyers did all that. But he has yet to tell the Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Water and Energy Conservation to start billing him on a consumption basis -- the purpose of the new meters that are gradually being installed citywide. Thanks to a moratorium on mandatory billing by usage in multifamily buildings (unless they have been built or rehabilitated since 1985), he will still be billed by the traditional method, based on building frontage and other property characteristics.
"I might change my mind," he said. "It depends on whether I get better control than I have now."
Regardless of the billing system used, it is becoming clear that rapidly rising water and sewer charges will be a key issue in multifamily housing operations in the 90's. The question is whether the city and state will respond to the issue.
They won't be goaded to action by aroused tenants, most likely. Renters don't feel surges in operating costs as a pocketbook issue. Co-op dwellers, however, may notice their maintenances costs rising. For homeowners, consumption billing has usually moderated the effect of rate increases.
The water agency itself is restudying the billing question. A one-year moratorium on mandatory use-based billing in city-metered apartment buildings was announced in May 1991. It was extended for another year last May. Owners have been told that if they install a meter voluntarily they can have frontage billing for two years thereafter. They can have it for three years if they also install 1.6-gallon-a-flush toilets.
Meanwhile, the city is systematically installing meters at a rate of 7,000 to 10,000 a year toward a 1998 completion date. About 2,500 multifamily properties have metered billing already because they are of post-1985 construction, and 2,000 more have it because of voluntary installation. There are about 80,000 multifamily properties in all.
Most owners are "sitting on their hands," as one spokesman put it, hoping for a change in a pricing system in which, in the name of conservation, they are held accountable for their tenants' usage habits.
The pricing system is in fact under review as sharply rising bills in metered higher-density moderate-income and low-income properties spread alarm in housing circles. While rates rise rapidly, consumption-based billing has put the greatest burden on the housing that is least able to afford it -- low-income, often overoccupied, buildings.
"Much of our problem has been to meet the city's mandated sewer-treatment capacity," said Steven F. Ostrega, deputy environmental commissioner in charge of the water bureau. "If we don't curb demand we'll have to expand sewer treatment plants. We can't have business as usual. We meter to change behavior." He said he expects a 17 percentage drop in usage in one- to three-family houses, and 7 1/2 percent systemwide in multifamily housing.
BUT he also said the agency was considering combining a uniform base charge with a consumption-based charge, which many utilities across the country do. That might help even out the disparity between low-occupancy and high-occupancy buildings without losing the incentive to conserve on water use.
"The city went from one extreme to the other in 1988, but the optimum is somewhere in the middle," said Frank R. Lichtenberg, professor of finance and economics at the Columbia Business School.
On the conservation side, incentives for installing low-flow equipment are conceivable. City housing officials say they want to revise the regulations on J-51 tax abatements to reclassify toilet replacements as a major capital improvement. A $350 abatement would then be available even if the replacement was not part of a larger-scale upgrading. Legislative action is needed in Albany.
Under state Division of Housing and Community Renewal rules, owners of rent-regulated buildings must install three fixtures -- sink, bathtub or shower, and toilet -- to get reimbursement through a major capital improvement allowance. In a 50-unit building, toilet replacement for low-water-use equipment might cost $15,000, said Lewis M. Kwit, a consultant. But to get the allowance an owner must spend $50,000. Owners have asked the division to consider a change.
Even without consumption-based billing, customers have been feeling the rising rates. Property owners now pay $1.01 for 100 cubic feet of water (748 gallons), and their sewer sharge for that much use is $1.61. The $2.62 total is double the charge five years ago.
Ten years ago the city's sewer rate was a third of its water charge. This year the sewer rate is 59 percent above the water charge. Normal water use for three-person apartment households is 200 to 400 gallons a day. At the present $2.62 charge for 100 cubic feet, the cost attributable to an apartment using 40 cubic feet (299.2 gallons) of water a day for a 31-day month is $32.48. The actual range of use in New York City buildings is much wider and depends on population density, mechanical efficiency and whether there are leaks and how long they persist.
At Manhattan Plaza, a 1,680-unit development at 42d Street and Ninth Avenue, average daily use is only 210 gallons per apartment, said Alan Rothschild, president of the Vantage Group, a consulting firm in North Brunswick, N.J. And the building can do 10 or 20 percent better, he said. In buildings with average densities of four or five people per apartment, 400 to 600 gallons a day is the likely average. "But I've seen averages of over 1,000 gallons a day," Mr. Rothschild said. Leaks or waste are the culprits when high density is not.
Many tenants don't know how much water is used in normal living. A five-minute shower with a high-flow shower head uses 25 to 35 gallons (15 to 20 gallons with a low-flow device), Mr. Rothschild said. Older tank toilets with older flushometers use five to seven gallons a flush. Running a faucet without an aerator for five minutes might use 15 to 20 gallons.
The effect of the rate increases and metered billing on lower-income apartments is illustrated by data from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, or LISC. The corporation-backed nonprofit company will have financed 3,000 units of low-income rehabilitations in the city by the end of the year.
It studied 11 projects with 972 apartments, most of them two-bedrooms, that have had water meters for two years. The average water and sewer cost per apartment last year was $249. When the rent levels were set in 1988, the projected cost was only $90.
Now, for new projects, LISC is following the approach of the Community Preservation Corporation, a major source of financing for moderate-income housing. It is planning for costs of $400 per apartment a year -- or 11 percent of total operating costs.
"This flawed approach is having a truly serious impact on the long-term viability of housing," said Marc Jahr, LISC's New York City program director of consumption-based billing. The Community Preservation Corporation also has warned that the new level of cost is a threat to moderate-income housing.
At the water board, Mr. Ostrega said that city capital funds were needed to cover 86 percent of the cost of federally mandated sewer improvements in fiscal 1992, or $534 million. Five years ago the city paid 50 percent, or $204 million.
"There can be a 20 to 40 percent saving in water use without changing tenant habits," Mr. Rothschild said. But owners have to pick the right products from among hundreds on the market. Billing based on use provides the incentive, he said. But he also favors some degree of cost passthrough to tenants.
"There must be enough of a passthrough so people will report leaks," said Dan Margulies, executive director of Community Housing Improvement Program, an owner group concerned with building operations.
Owners are generally skeptical of how much tenants can be expected to cooperate by reporting equipment malfunctions, practicing restraint in use and permitting prompt repairs. Since conservation provides no economic reward to renters, and waste carries no penalty, it may be naive to expect widespread cooperation.
"Education will work in some buildings but not in others," Mr. Margulies said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Shopping Malls;
Luring Crowds -- and Buyers -- With Fun and Games

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
LAST April, Newport Center, the 1.2 million-square-foot, two-story mall developed by Melvin Simon & Associates in Jersey City, leased space to a carousel. Since then, sales at the street-level stores nearest to the ride are up almost 27 percent over the same period last year and sales at second-floor stores are up 10.4 percent.
"I can't prove it, but I'm pretty certain the carousel made the difference," said Kenneth L. Volk, the center's marketing director. 
 The owners of the CambridgeSide Galleria, a mixed-use complex on the Charles River in Cambridge, Mass., insists that the stores in its three-story, million-square-foot mall already are doing well. Still, they expect that a sports museum and a sports-oriented gaming arcade scheduled to open early next year will increase traffic, and thus sales, even more.
"They'll bring people to the mall on weekday mornings, say, or other hours when malls generally don't do a lot of business," said Stephen R. Karp, chairman of New England Development of Newton, Mass., the mall's owner.
Gone are the days when shopping centers relied only on a good mix of stores and a decent location to thrive. The overbuilding of malls in the 70's, the continuing entry of women into the workforce and the stubborn recession have created a situation where a glut of malls is competing for a dearth of shoppers.
As a result, malls increasingly are wooing game rooms, rides, museums, even stores that double as entertainment centers, all in the hope that they will bring more shoppers in to play, perchance to buy.
"Developers have learned that good clean amusements not only turn vacant spaces into income-producing areas, but also serve as gathering places that attract shoppers," said Deborah Kops, a partner with Arthur Andersen Real Estate Services in Dallas.
Data on sales per square foot are difficult to come by. But Keith J. Foxe, a spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan, says he's certain that sales have dropped in the last couple of years.
And developers, while not offering hard numbers, acknowledge the problem.
"Time spent in shopping malls has been declining steadily, because your typical shopper has neither the time nor the money to spend," said M. Leanne Lachman, a managing director of Schroder Center Management of Dallas, which manages 10 malls in the South and West and has put game rooms in most of them.
Big-league developers like Melvin Simon, based in Indianapolis, and the Rouse Company, based in Columbia, Md., and smaller, regional developers like Schroder are inviting amusement tenants to open new facilities or expand old ones in some of their malls. Among those being wooed are Edison Brothers, of St. Louis, which operates virtual-reality parlors, which immerse players in a computer-generated mock environment, or Nickels and Dimes Incorporated in Dallas, which operates gaming arcades,
They are also talking to hybrid amusement/selling operations like Oshman's, based in Houston, which lets customers play a variety of sports as well as buy sporting equipment, and Glamour Shops, based in Oklahoma City, which takes, and sells, photos of customers in amusing poses.
For the amusement tenants themselves, a result has been not only good lease terms, but also access to locations that might have spurned them in the past. Susan E. Mosedale, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions in Alexandria, Va., says that calls from mall developers are so frequent that her association now takes exhibit space at the International Shopping Center Show. And developers and game room operators alike report little, if any, difficulty getting zoning variances needed to be in shopping centers.
"We used to be a pariah," said Ronald M. Kostelny, president of Nickels and Dimes, which operates more than 200 arcade-like operations at malls. "Now we're being invited in, at real low rents."
Indeed, amusement tenants can solve a multitude of problems for malls. They can keep shoppers at the mall longer, provide amusement for children or nonshopping spouses and, in rural malls where space is ample, turn open areas into income-producing property -- say, by putting in miniature golf courses.
In more cramped malls, scaled-down amusements often fit in secondary space that is otherwise hard to rent.
IN a sense, the gap between the amusement industry and the shopping center industry has narrowed. Many of the Rouse-owned centers, like South Street, Boston's Faneuil Hall and the like are as much amusement malls as they are shopping areas. And shopping center-cum-fantasyland malls woo as many tourists hankering for fun as shoppers clamoring for goods.
Among them are Melvin Simon's new 4.2-million-square-foot Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.; the 11-year old West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, and the new Forum Shops, next to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, which sports moving sculptures and other attractions.
For its part, the amusement industry has grown far more sophisticated. Virtual reality, laser tag and other high-tech attractions have never developed the beer-drugs-and-cigarette stigma that pool halls and pinball arcades once had. And, consultants say, parents have less trouble with the idea that their children are hanging out at an arcade next to Macy's than with their being at one next to a bar or adult book store.
"There's more respectability to amusements at a mall than at a downtown area," said Charles A. Shorter, a real estate specialist at Arthur Andersen in New York.
Still, not all malls have the space or the inclination to put in a full-scale amusement parlor. For them, the answer to spicing up the shopping experience is often to woo stores that do double duty as amusement centers, like Oshman's Sporting Goods. These stores, sprinkled across the country, not only sell sporting goods, but also serve as sporting places in their own right: Visitors can play basketball or golf, rollerblade, whack tennis balls -- and, of course, buy all the attendant paraphernalia.
"WE'RE now getting the kind of great deals on leases that only full-service department stores used to get," crows Alvin N. Lubetkin, president of Oshman's, whose stores generally run upward of 55,000 square feet.
Schroder, for one, is wooing Oshman's to many of its malls, on the theory that a miniature golf course, say, can attract visitors but that a small in-store golfing area next to golf-related merchandise is going to attract visitors and buyers.
"They attract men who come in with their kids, and their sales per square foot are terrific," said Ms. Lachman.
Still, the rush to amusement tenants has not yet hit New York City. Melvin Simon, for one, emphatically spurns amusements for A. & S. Plaza, its vertical mall in Manhattan.
"Mall of America draws families, who come to spend the day," said Donald E. Boelke, executive vice president of Melvin Simon. "A. & S. Plaza targets commuters and transients and it commands rents that no arcade could pay."
Similarly, the South Street Seaport, in lower Manhattan, is just getting a toe wet in the amusement pool, and even that it is doing reluctuantly. The huge festival mall has let Edison Brothers put in a tiny, 50-square-foot virtual-reality game room on the second floor of the Fulton Market Building, a vertical food court crammed with fresh food shops and restaurants. If that turns out to be popular and problem-free, the Seaport may put in a full-scale virtual-reality room or some other form of amusement.
But Larry M. Wolf, a senior vice president of the Rouse Company, which owns South Street, is more resigned than ecstatic over the prospect.
"Entertainment tenants are not high rent payers, and they don't generate high sales per square foot," he said, "and you're certainly not going to put them in spaces that you can rent to an Ann Taylor store, or even in space right next to an Ann Taylor store."
But, he added, "They are still a lot better than nonproductive space."

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
A Small Menu Mostly From the Grill

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
RIDING the crest of the trend for grilled dishes is Chop Chop American Grill in Westport. The word grill in a restaurant's name suggests not only fresh foods simply prepared but also telegraphs casual and informal, which suggests economical dining as well -- a suggestion not always borne out in the pricing.
Chop Chop American Grill is in a free-standing building that has housed several other restaurants in recent years (most recently Checkers). A fence-enclosed outside dining area has been added in front, which is very pleasant as long as the weather remains cooperative. Inside the rather dark, medium-small main dining area (there's a second dining room upstairs) the decor is simple, with creamy-tone stucco walls, velveteen cafe curtains, matching wall hangings and area separators, appliqued with patches of patterned fabric suggesting stylized cows. We're not sure whether this free association is valid, though steaks are on the menu. 
 A small menu, such as this one, usually augurs well, suggesting that the chef has set parameters. In addition to two steak choices, the menu also lists several other grilled red meat entrees -- lamb chops and filet mignon -- along with several grilled seafood dishes.
Chop Chop is open for dinner only. We began one evening with Maryland crab cakes with chive beurre blanc sauce. The two medium-size crisp, deeply browned, tightly packed cakes were pepped up by the addition of red pepper flakes.
Another worthwhile starter was grilled scaloppine of swordfish: thin escalopes in a perky mustard tarragon sauce, accented by a julienne of summer squash, zucchini and carrots (the same julienne that accompanied the entrees).
Less appealing was an order of grilled sliced eggplant, portobello mushrooms and roasted red peppers in a bath of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The problem was the star of the show: chunks of eggplant had been skinned before grilling, thus all the rich smokiness that usually accrues to the skin was lost. What remained was chewy, tasteless and boring.
Two salads sounded terrific but came up short. We ordered the mixed green salad because of its promise of endive and Gorgonzola but though the greens were diverse and crisp, the endive consisted of a few pieces chopped fine and the Gorgonzola had gone AWOL. A bibb lettuce, tomato and watercress salad had a sparkling raspberry dressing, but deserved better olives than the tired canned black ones.
Among the entrees, Angus won: the boneless Angus shell steak grilled, served in a shallot-peppercorn sauce, and sliced black Angus steak, served with caramelized onions and red peppers in a resonant roasted garlic sauce. Both steaks were medium rare (as so ordered by our guests), firm and with fine flavor.
The seared swordfish steak was also well prepared, moist and flavorful, even though the menu-specified ginger broth had evaporated.
Less satisfying was a special of grilled tuna. Ordered rare, the tuna steak arrived well-done and case-hardened, unredeemed even by a fresh tomato and caper-rich sauce or the combination accompaniment of wild rice, white rice and toasted pignoli.
Desserts are served in generous portions. A strawberry shortcake was mammoth, with an abundance of fresh whole berries even though the shortcake was a square of yellow cake. Best choice was the chocolate pecan terrine, a thick slice of pecan-rich fudgy chocolate topped with whipped cream, served in a pool of raspberry puree. The berry-filled almond cookie shell, resting in a sweet raspberry puree, held an abundance of delicious fresh blueberries, raspberries and strawberries, but the cookie shell was over-browned, overbaked, overglazed and tough.
A three-course dinner for two came to $47 before tax, tip and beverages. Several of the right ingredients are already in place at Chop Chop American Grill -- a welcoming staff and a quiet, casual atmosphere. With time, fewer short-cuts in ingredients used, and more attention to culinary matters, this new place could find a loyal clientele among Westport's dining establishments.

HEADLINE: A Surge Expected in Homeless Population

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
JIMMY McLAWRIN pushed a shopping cart filled with cardboard across the plaza of the Journal Square PATH station in Jersey City. In the night shadows near the shops that line the plaza, men and women lay sleeping on the concrete.
A chill breeze was blowing as Mr. McLawrin approached one after another of the sleepers, extracting a length of cardboard from his cart, gently covering each person in turn. Then he found a vacant space nearby, unloaded the rest of the cardboard and built a shelter for himself. 
 As winter approaches, officials of social service agencies across the state are predicting a dramatic rise in the number of people who will be forced onto the streets. After Dec. 31, municipal welfare benefits will be abruptly terminated for thousands of men and women in New Jersey; estimates run as high as 14,000. At that point, officials said, many people who have never before been homeless, who have lived close to the edge but have always managed to scrape together money for the rent or the mortgage, will find themselves in a shelter or on the street.
Together with the continuing recession and lingering high unemployment, the welfare action could swell the ranks of the homeless beyond the ability of social agencies and shelters to cope with them, officials said.
"I think there is a disaster coming," said Linda Flores, director of the Elizabeth Coalition to House the Homeless, an advocacy group in Union County. "The whole system is bursting."
In past years, the coalition would typically provide assistance to about 30 new families during the month of August, she said, adding: "This August was as bad as February. We had 96 new families."
Though the families aided by the coalition are nearly always provided with some form of shelter, Ms. Flores said, the rise in their numbers probably reflects the rise in the number of hard-core homeless. "They're the ones who live under the railroad trestles and under the turnpike," she said. "They're the ones nobody talks about."
Up-to-date data on New Jersey's homeless are hard to find. Advocates for the homeless estimate that there are 29,000 people who do not have permanent lodging. Most of the homeless population consists of women and children who are on some form of public assistance and who are living in shelters or temporary housing.
Data from the state Department of Community Affairs indicate that the number of families that received some form of public emergency housing assistance in fiscal year 1991 totaled almost 26,000 people -- a 67 percent increase over 1989.
But the hard-core homeless, the men and women who live on the streets of cities like Jersey City, Newark, Camden and Atlantic City, are generally not in those figures since they have little or no contact with the agencies that do the counting. .
Bobi N. Ruffin, director of Health and Human Services for the City of Newark, calls them the "hidden homeless." How many are there? "I really couldn't venture a guess," she said.
What many advocates for the homeless are sure of is that the numbers of homeless, hidden or otherwise, will substantially increase after Dec. 31. "We are very worried," said Mary Wells, chairwoman of the state Human Services Advisory Commission, which advises the Commissioner of the Department of Human Services on issues and policies.
In response to the state's budget crunch, state officials determined that single employable adults who were on general assistance -- municipal welfare -- as of July 1 would lose their benefits after they had been on assistance for six months.
As a result, those who were on municipal welfare on July 1 will be removed from the rolls after Dec. 31.
"These are people who are already on the brink," Ms. Wells said. "They might be employable from a doctor's perspective, but they are the least employable people around from an employer's perspective." When their welfare benefits end, she said, such people are likely to end up on the streets.
Statistics from the state Division of Human Services indicate that the number of people currently on general assistance is 30,939, and that 19,672 of them are classified as employable. Nearly all are individual adults.
Mariano Vega, chief of social services for Hudson County, estimates that between 10,000 and 14,000 of them, statewide, will have their assistance terminated after Dec. 31.
"They'll be hitting the homeless ranks in much larger numbers," he said. "And what safety net is there? The people on the front lines are expecting this to be their worst year."
Alan Zalkind, director of the Essex County Department of Citizen Services, said that Essex County has about 10,000 general assistance recipients. About 7,500 of them are in Newark.
 
Payment of $140 a Month
 "We're seeing a large number of individuals with no recourse, no safety net and no place to go," Mr. Zalkind said.
The typical payment that an individual on general assistance receives, he said, is about $140 a month. More important than the money itself, he said, is the fact that the welfare recipients are eligible for medical benefits and shelter assistance. In fact, most shelters for the homeless only admit people who are actually on the municipal or county welfare rolls.
Once those people are off the rolls, Mr. Zalkind said, they are no longer eligible for emergency assistance or medical benefits.
"You literally have an adult with no place to go," he said. "And we have seen absolutely no plans to date that attempt to address the potentially disastrous consequences."
There is no central state clearinghouse for dealing with the problems of homelessness. Some aspects are managed by the Department of Community Affairs, which provides about $2 million in state funds and $500,000 it receives from the Federal Government for the Shelter Support Program. That program provides financing to improve existing shelters and create new ones.
 
$4.6 Million for Help
 Another program that the department administers is the Homelessness Prevention Program, which provides $4.6 million in temporary assistance for people with unexpected monetary problems that could cause them to lose their homes. Participants must prove that they will be able to get back on their feet within a relatively short time, usually a couple of months.
In the Division of Human Services, about $7 million is earmarked for food and shelter for families that are not not receiving other homeless assistance.
 
102 Emergency Shelters
 And families on welfare who are in immediate danger of becoming homeless can receive temporary rental assistance -- up to $250 a month for up to a year -- to keep them in their homes.
What happens after the year is over?
"That's the $64,000 question," said Andy Rauer, assistant Administrative Supervisor of Social Services in Camden County. "In two months they end up with another eviction notice."
The day-to-day responsibility for sheltering those immediately in need of a roof over their head falls upon 102 licensed emergency shelters scattered throughout the state. Currently, 74 of those shelters are inspected by the state's Bureau of Rooming and Boarding House Standards to insure that they provide acceptable shelter. The remaining 28 shelters are inspected by the various municipalities in which they are situated.
Many of those who run the shelters say they have already noticed a large increase in the number of people seeking help and they fear that as the cold weather sets in and people are dropped from the welfare rolls, shelters could be overwhelmed.
Ms. Flores, of the Elizabeth Coalition, said there were not nearly enough emergency beds in that area. "There are already hundreds of people on the streets," she said. "What's going to happen when a couple of hundred more are added to that?"
Mr. Vega said he expected this winter to be significantly worse than previous years.
 
A Magnet for the Homeless
 "Jersey City tends to become a magnet for homeless folks who tend to travel," he said, pointing to the easy access provided by PATH trains to New York and Newark.
Mr. Vega said that in a study his office conducted in 1990, one out of five Hudson County families was homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. "At risk meant that they were one paycheck away from not being able to afford their rents," he said.
The number of shelters has not significantly increased since then, he said, but, "We are now at an all-time high of unemployment." And the shelters were already at or near capacity in 1990.
The Rev. Marvin W. Krieger, who runs the Hoboken Shelter for the Homeless, a 20-bed shelter that is also a soup kitchen, said he expected to be turning away a dozen people a night when winter sets in, even if he used his "emergency capacity" limit of 30 beds.
"I figure if being homeless isn't an emergency, then what is?" he said.
Not all of the homeless, however, will even bother to seek help at a shelter, no matter what the weather.
"If I can sleep out here at 13 below, I can sleep out here anytime," said 39-year-old Mr. McLawrin, as he stood in front of his cardboard shelter in Journal Square, remembering a particularly cold night he had spent out on the streets, alone.
 
Homelessness Hits Suburbs
 Officials of social service agencies say that a significant change is taking place in the demographics of homelessness. "It's absolutely hitting the suburbs," said Mary Wells, chairwoman of the state's Human Services Advisory Council. "People are losing houses, they are going up for foreclosure," she said. "And these people are going to be homeless, too."
Ms. Wells, who also runs a private, nonprofit social services agency in Burlington County, said that among the people seeking emergency housing assistance are increasing numbers of "newly non-affluent" former members of the middle class.
Many two-income couples overextended themselves financially when the economy was thriving and now find themselves "in a tremendous financial bind," she said, if one of the partners loses a job.
Such people, she said, are loathe to ask for help. "One agency had a client family living in a Mercedes Benz," Ms. Wells said. The family, she said, had not sought immediate shelter because "they were mortified and overcome by the embarrassment of it."
Linda Flores, director of The Elizabeth Coalition to House the Homeless, said her organization provided housing assistance to more than 3,000 people each year. "About 18 percent of our new clients are coming from the suburbs," she said.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Q & A: Dr. Jay R. Brandinger;
Translating Research into New Products

BYLINE: By HELEN PIKE

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
DR. Jay R. Brandinger has a resume that spans high-technology history, from the transmission of the first, pre-satellite, television signals between England and the United States to the creation of RCA's first video-disk players. Last year, he turned 64 years of age, but he had no intention of either giving up flying -- he owns a Cessna Turbo 210 -- or retiring.
"I was, in fact, looking around," he said. What he landed was the job of executive director of the state's Commission on Science and Technology. His salary is $83,000. 
 The commission is devoted to fostering research through its advanced technology centers at the state's five research universities and transferring the results of that research out of the labs and onto production lines.
The commission has an office in Washington to help entrepreneurs obtain grants that will allow them to develop new business in New Jersey. It also works with state officials in improving the teaching of technology in New Jersey schools and in the training of workers to operate high-technology equipment.
In a recent interview, Dr. Brandinger said the commission had brokered a number of new business ventures, including companies producing ultrasonic medical equipment and advanced laser systems, and had obtained more than $231 million in commercial and government funds, and $13 million worth of Federal small business grants to New Jersey enterprises.
Dr. Brandinger, an avid ham radio operator, holds a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from Cooper Union and a Ph.D. in education from Rutgers University. He and his wife, Alice, an educator, live in Pennington Borough.
Q. Why does New Jersey need a state-supported science agency?
A. The main objective is to create an environment which is conducive to rapid technologically driven economic growth, so it's not just a science agency. Yes, we do science at one end. But we also are concerned with the development of new products at the other end.
For example, we didn't have much focus at our universities in biotechnology back in 1984, when the commission started. We looked around and said: "Biotechnology is going to be the thing of the future. Health care is going to be important. The graying of America in the year 2000 is an important aspect. Health costs are going to rise. How are we going to do this more effectively and efficiently?' "
Since then, we have, on the average, put 40 percent of our budget into biotechnology. We've also put in capital equipment investments through two bond issues. Now New Jersey is No. 2 to California in the number of biotechnology companies.
Q. Why is that so important?
A. The fact is, we've lost more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs, mostly in the blue-collar labor area, and clearly, with a 9 percent unemployment rate, we are very concerned.
These jobs will be replaced in the future with jobs that grow out of new biotechnology pharmaceuticals and biotechnology devices and systems, and then beyond that, in the 21st century, with jobs from electronics, computers, communications and high-definition television.
Right now, the high-tech manufacturing and the research and development which is done within the state represent something between 5 and 10 percent of the state's total gross product. But even if we continue in the high growth rate that we're in, we won't seriously impact unemployment in the short-term. We think it takes time.
Q. How much time?
A. Probably about five to 10 years.
Q. What is the commission's budget for this fiscal year?
A. The total is $20 million.
Q. Is it down again from last year?
A. That is correct. We were cut more than 10 percent. But 25 percent of our budget is not available for grants. It is used to repay loans on equipment. So our total budget available for grants is something just under $15 million.
Q. Does that jeopardize any of the advanced technology centers?
A. The budget passed by the Legislature left unfunded two of our centers, one in plastics recycling and the other in the investigational cancer therapy area.
Q. Are you going to make up that financing through private partnerships?
A. Those centers are strongly encouraged to find alternate sources of funding. Given the current state of things, New Jersey is not in a position to provide funds.
Q. Why hasn't New Jersey done more to turn its patents into manufactured products?
A. During the 1960's and 70's, the U.S. Government issued a series of consent decrees that made the technologies patented by A.T.& T. and RCA available to their competitors. The business focus then shifted to how to make products in a cheaper fashion. Ultimately, this led to moving factories to more competitive labor markets west, south and overseas. Tax breaks for setting up factories in Puerto Rico also led the pharmaceutical industry to move a lot of their manufacturing out-of-state.
But the research and development for both these industries is still primarily here in New Jersey. In fact, 85 percent of all pharmaceutical research done in the United States is done here in the state.
Q. How do you reconcile the state's image as a premier research center with its status as one of the more heavily polluted states in the country?
A. We are the most densely populated state. When I checked to see where the pollution was coming from, about 20 percent was really from the manufacturing side. The majority of the pollution is a result of transportation, both commercial and private. Automobiles that traverse our roads. Trucks and buses traveling in New Jersey and through New Jersey. These are the major sources of air pollution.
Even if you cleaned up all the factories, you still wouldn't be out of problems with respect to air pollution. You need to deal with the issue of the combustion engine, for example, or the diesel engines, which are polluting.
We believe that we are leaders of how to restore sites in where we have damaged the environment. We think the products which will be made here in New Jersey will help do that, and that the technology will be sought out worldwide, and this will be a major and important business.
But restoration is not the long-term answer. We believe if you do it right in the first place, if you manufacture products in a clean environment, and the products are clean and can be disposed of in a clean way, that will be less expensive. And we will all have a better place in which to live.
Q. What is the commission doing about the stringent environmental regulations that seem to hamper business?
A. One way the commission offers help is through one of the advanced technology centers, the Hazardous Substance Management Research Center at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. This center offers technical advice to the State Department of Environmental Protection and Energy that helps interpret the regulations or that helps write, modify or implement them.
For example, there's no recognition of the difference between the land that's used for manufacturing and the land that's used for building single-family homes. The requirements are somewhat different if you look at them in terms of the question of how much of the site has to be restored and to what levels.
A very important thing the Governor has proposed is a change in the way those laws would be dealt with. What he has done is make a very strong suggestion, and hopefully it will be passed by the Legislature, that will change the laws to recognize differences in the uses of the land.
Q .Why did you leave the Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton to come to work in Trenton?
A. I'm working on retirement. I've retired from RCA Laboratories. I've retired from General Electric. I've retired from the Sarnoff Research Center. I'm now in the state, and am looking for my fourth retirement. I'm going to keep looking to retire until I get it right. But that's not really the answer.
I'm here because I want the state to be the kind of a place where I want to live. It really occurred that I was at a point in my career where I might be able to help. I am a citizen of New Jersey. I've been here a long time. I got most of my advanced education here. I think I have a lot of background and knowledge and can do some things that would be appropriate.

HEADLINE: For Women, Fewer M.B.A.'s

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
MARILYN C. COOPER is the kind of woman who could someday put business schools out of business. An idealistic honors student at Wellesley College, she is precisely the sort of young go-getter whom many business schools would love to go get -- but can't.
Trouble is, she has no interest in business school. "There's just so much out there about glass ceilings in business and the limits that are there," said Ms. Cooper, who hopes instead to pursue a career in higher education. 
 She is also put off by the growing expectation of many graduate business programs that students delay their education until their late 20's, so that they can apply their real-life experiences in the classroom. "That would definitely be a big drawback," said Ms. Cooper, who is 22. "I'd like to think that by 27, I'll be starting to have children, not starting an M.B.A."
Typical? You bet. Much to the consternation of the nation's leading business schools, more and more young women who could easily join the next generation of business leaders are turning off to high-powered careers in business, the kind that often call for a name-brand graduate-school education as a prerequisite.
What these women seem to be turning to instead are careers in law, science, government and the nonprofit sector, professions that might be less lucrative but potentially more satisfying. Or they are simply setting their sights on less demanding jobs in the business world that might allow them to better fuse their work and family lives.
Though many business schools are also experiencing a drop in male applicants because of the economy and a growing feeling that the schools have failed to teach the right skills, a greater proportion of women seem to be reaching the conclusion that the M.B.A. is not worth it. The decline is seen both in the number of applications and in the number of entering students.
Indeed, recession has made pricey business schools a dubious luxury, especially for women who have to worry that their earnings after graduation will trail those of their equally-educated male counterparts. At the same time, sexual harassment in the work place and the risk of being shunted onto a slow-moving mommy track during one's childbearing years have painted a grim picture of corporate life.
After years of being able to sit back and admit students as fast as they could open their mail and process the applications, business school administrators admit that the problem is a vexing one. "It does concern us," said
 A BITTERSWEET MOOD
The women who led the way into the highest levels of American business worry that few will follow. Page 27.
Rod R. Garcia, the acting director of admissions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.
His school has seen the number of female applicants decline 11 percent since 1987, versus a 24 percent rise in male applicants for the same period. To turn that around, M.I.T. is joining nine other leading business schools next Thursday in Boston in a panel discussion and reception for 250 bright young women to sell them on business school.
ONE reason why these ordinarily competitive schools seem willing to cooperate is because they see it as so critical to their survival as the talent scouts for the nation's top corporations.
"We talk increasingly about the need for future managers to understand and develop skills to deal with labor and consumer markets that are much more diverse than they used to be," said Charles W. Hickman, director of projects and services for the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, which accredits some 250 American business schools. "If you have a business school that is all-white or all-male, that becomes an increasingly hollow exercise."
Business schools also cannot afford to ignore the trend because of the clear impact it could have on their bottom lines. Twenty years ago, women made up 4 percent of all business school graduates. In 1990, the last year for which government figures are available, women got 34 percent of the 77,203 M.B.A.'s awarded.
At that rate, the math becomes quite compelling. Even more than with other minority groups, a slight percentage drop in women applicants can cause a big dip in the reservoir of talent that schools draw on.
"The Harvards and the Columbias of the world may get 2 or 3 applicants for every opening instead of 5 or 6," said Mr. Hickman. "But if you follow that through to all the other schools, some won't get enough. That has real dollar implications."
Certainly, the explosive growth in the number of foreign students accounts for part of the gender imbalance in the pool of applicants. Bowing to criticism that their graduates were ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of a global marketplace, many business schools have been setting aside one out of every three seats for foreign students to broaden the class perspective. Many of these recruits tend to be sponsored by their employers and nearly all are men.
But even allowing for that wrinkle in the statistics, schools are detecting a decline in interest from women.
What makes the decline more puzzling is that of the people who take a widely used admissions test for business school each year, the percentage of women has remained fairly constant, at about 38 to 40 percent, according to William Broesamle, president of the Graduate Management Admission Council in Los Angeles, the organization that designs the test.
HE suspects that women are therefore either seeking out part-time programs near their homes that might allow them to keep working while in school or simply staying put at their current jobs for economic reasons and skipping graduate school altogether. The attrition theory is consistent with what Stephen Christakos has observed as the admissions director of Northwestern University's Kellogg School. "Harvard and Stanford were my two top competitors last year," he said. "The work force was No. 3." And he believes that women are more vulnerable to economic pressures than men.
"It's harder for us to close the sale" with women applicants, said Mr. Christakos. He suspects that women have a harder time than men justifying the $130,000 that a top-quality business education can cost between tuition, expenses and forgone wages, citing differences in income expectations and in the number of years women can expect to work before family issues interrupt. "As a cost-benefit decision, it may be harder for women to decide to go to school than for men," he said.
JACE SCHINDERMAN, an associate dean at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, suspects, too, that the advancing age of entering classes may also be "colliding with women wanting to have children earlier." For that reason, Columbia says it is considering relaxing its admission rules and admitting promising younger women with less work experience.
That sort of flexibility would appeal to Amy C. Hoffer, a 21-year-old senior in Northwestern's industrial engineering department who is considering business school sometime down the road. "Several of my friends really think a lot about what trade-offs are involved when you doggedly pursue a business career."
Administrators are also studying ways that their programs may be subtly turning off women, ranging from the shortage of women faculty to possible differences in the way professors grade men and women on classroom participation.
In an effort to make their programs more hospitable to women, many schools are featuring more women in their brochures and at their annual dinners, realigning admissions departments and faculty ranks to include more women, and reexamining their curriculums.
As Debra A. Felix, the assistant dean in charge of admissions at Columbia's business school, sees it, business schools have not always been as hospitable to women as they could be.
Back when she was earning her own M.B.A. at Columbia, she remembers being annoyed that her grade in introductory marketing depended heavily on two exams, one on golf balls and the other on men's toiletries. "I got an honors grade, so I guess I figured it out," said Ms. Felix, whose complaints that year at least insured that the following year's class got to write about a more neutral test topic: pens.
 
 
Two Schools Reach Out
 TWO business schools that are among those working the hardest to woo more women are Columbia and Northwestern.
Columbia has mounted an ambitious research project to canvass students, alumni, faculty and recruiters to identify reasons for the decline in applications from women.
In the meantime, the school plans to hold more luncheons for promising young women and conduct a phone campaign to reach out to women who have requested applications. It is also looking to create fellowships or scholarships just for women.
In addition, Debra A. Felix, the school's admissions director, has spoken bluntly with a number of Japanese companies that pay for their employees to attend top-ranked American schools, since they sponsor male candidates almost exclusively. "I'm asked every year by Japanese companies, 'How can we get our people in?' " said Ms. Felix, who said she initially limited her advice to the usual remarks about grades and test scores.
"Finally, I said, 'Send women,' and they freaked. And the next year, they finally did," she said triumphantly.
At Northwestern in Evanston, Ill., the school features more women in its brochure in lieu of the usual "two-guys-with-a-rugby-ball kinds of shots," as Stephen Christakos, the school's admissions director, put it. The brochure also touts the school's grassy, suburban campus -- a big draw for safety-conscious women.
Northwestern is one of the few schools that has its own students read all incoming applications. This year, it is hoping to find enough women among its current students to fill 17 to 18 of the 37 reading slots, up from 13 last year.
"We hope that just by having more women as the first reader, we'll even the playing field," said Mr. Christakos.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS DIARY;
Two Old Foes Battle for Unity And to Support the Franc

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
It was a heroic fight. Against the forces of profiteers in the $1 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, Germany and France battled to preserve the value of the French franc. They did it by digging deep into their currency reserves to buy francs on the open market. But success is not guaranteed since government resources are small compared with those of the world's currency traders. Yet defending the franc was more important than money; it was a show of unity after France's lukewarm endorsement of the Maastricht treaty. Europe "is facing tests of strength that will be decisive for its common future," Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said. President Francois Mitterrand of France echoed the sentiments. The joint actions put "all Franco-German irritations to bed," said Stephan-Gotz Richter, president of Trans Atlantic Futures, a consultant in Washington.
 
Fleshing Out Health Care
Appearing before a group of employees at Merck & Company, the big pharmaceutical manufacturer in Rahway, N.J., Gov. Bill Clinton put a little flesh and blood on his health care plan. He told the group that if elected he would require private employers with more than 50 workers to provide health- care insurance for employees and would have the Federal Government supplement health care coverage for the unemployed. Mr. Clinton also said he would call for price controls on drugs. His plan would "drastically simplify the administrative costs of the American health care system" and save about $700 billion by the end of the decade, Mr. Clinton said. The plan would also provide incentives for small companies to band together to pool coverage and reduce costs, something President Bush has also proposed. The Bush campaign criticized Mr. Clinton's proposals, saying price controls on drugs would reduce private funding for research.
Time was when most of mahogany row went Republican. But last week Governor Clinton garnered endorsements from 400 of America's corporate titans. Among the endorsers were Paul Allaire, chairman of Xerox; Robert Haas, chairman of Levi Strauss; Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate Palmolive; Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, and the taste maker Martha Stewart.
 
Paid to Do the Right Thing
While Mr. Clinton talked health care, President Bush was homing in on the nation's small business owners. He began by vetoing a family-leave bill that would require companies to grant at least 12 weeks of unpaid leave to any employee with a family emergency. The bill was opposed by many small-business owners who said it was too costly. "I have always supported employer policies to give time off for a child's birth, adoption or for family illness," Mr. Bush said in his veto message. Instead of the bill, he proposed tax credits for employers who give workers time off. Later, in Greensboro N.C., Mr. Bush proposed $20 billion in tax cuts for small businesses.
 
Durable Goods Decline
Orders for durable goods, those big-ticket items that are supposed to last three years , fell 0.1 percent in August, the third monthly decline in four months. The report was "Weak, weak, weak," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago.
 
In Need of an Economic Miracle
Dogging the Presidential race is the sluggish economy. It grew by 1.5 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. "The calendar is running out for George Bush,"said Robert G. Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
 
Daring to Offend China
Time was when President Bush couldn't do enough for China. He supported its most-favored-nation trade status against and fought Congressional pressure to put sanctions on it after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. But with the election looming, old loyalties have been called into question. Last month, Mr. Bush authorized the sale of 150 F-16's to Taiwan, China's longtime foe. Last week, he agreed to sell 12 SH-2F "Lamp" helicopters to Taiwan for $161 million. The helicopters, which can detect and attack submerged submarines, are made by the Kaman Corporation in Bloomfield, Conn. Connecticut -- whose eight electoral votes are considered up for grabs -- has been severely hurt by cutbacks in Pentagon spending.
 
Japan's Bank Won't Budge
In Japan, they are calling it a recession even though growth has so far not turned negative. Japan's gross domestic product expanded by a meek 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the Ministry of Finance said last week.
 
Pleading for Fewer Rubles
Russia is learning about democracy the hard way. Yegor T. Gaidar, the acting Prime Minister , is dedicated to establishing a market system, but he must contend with a Parliament still dominated by proponents of central planning. And while Mr. Gaidar has been trying to keep money growth slow, Parliament appointed Viktor Gerashenko as head of Russia's central bank. Mr. Gerashenko likes to keep those printing presses running. As a result, since last month, the value of the ruble has lost 49 percent of its value. Last week Mr. Gaidar pleaded with Parliament, saying that unless the money supply was tightened, the Russian monetary system would collapse.
 
Agency Hopping at Olds?
Leo Burnett U.S.A., the advertising agency, has been selling Oldsmobiles since 1967. A few years ago it came up with the "This is not your father's Oldsmobile" theme. But the campaign alienated the car company's older customers without bringing in new ones. Oldsmobile's sales are sluggish, to say the least. Last week, the General Motors Corporation put the Oldsmobile account up for review. Although it did not announce which agencies would be allowed to compete for the account, which is worth $100 million to $110 million, it said Leo Burnett would be in the running. "We are confident we can retain the Oldsmobile business," said Jim Oates, Burnett's chairman. Perhaps it will. The last time G.M. dismissed an agency was in 1958.
 G.M. has been working hard to keep the labor peace. But last month, after announcing plans to close plants, lay off workers and buy parts from outside suppliers, workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, struck. And last week, 4,200 members of the United Automobile Workers union went on strike at a body stamping plant in Lansing, Mich., for the same reasons.
 
Cracks in the Rock of Gibraltar
The Prudential Insurance Company may like to portray itself as solid as the rock of Gibraltar, but according to an independent nonprofit research agency, its losses from Hurricane Andrew so far total $1.2 billion -- four times what executives predicted. Those losses could use up 10 percent of Prudential's capital. The estimates caused alarm among analysts at Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency, placed it on credit watch with the possibility of downgrading Prudential from AAA, the highest rating. "We have always felt that Prudential was stretched on capital relative to the rating," said Mark Puccia, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's. Earlier this year, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the nation's No. 1 insurer from Aaa, for exceptional , to Aa1, for excellent.
 
The Pseudo-Sodas
With the fizz going out of the Coca-Cola Company's sales, its third-quarter financial forecasts were, well, flat. One of Coke's answers is to go New Age. Following a host of competitors, Coca-Cola will bring out a new drink in the fast-growing "clear" category, to be called Nordic Mist. The new drink, a flavored sparkling water, will follow Pepsi Cola's H2oH! and Pepsi Crystal and the Seagrams entry, Quest. But while Nordic Mist will be clear, it won't be a health food. It will derive its sweet taste (not to mention 112 calories) from high-fructose corn syrup. "It's soft drinks in disguise," said Jack Trout of Trout & Ries, a marketing firm in Greenwich, Conn.
 
Shoring Up Travelers
The Primerica Corporation, the big financial services and insurance company, said last week that it would invest $722.5 million in the struggling Travelers Corporation in return for a 27 percent stake in the company. Primerica's chairman, Sanford I. Weill, said he would work with Travelers to direct its operations. More than a third of its $13 billion in outstanding mortgages are in trouble.
 
Behind the Scenes at 'Tonight'
The way Ken Kragen tells it -- he's a Hollywood artists' manager -- Helen Kushnick plays too rough. Ms. Kushnick was Jay Leno's manager, and when he became host of the "The Tonight Show" earlier this year, became executive producer. Mr. Kragen said Ms. Kushnick kept one of his clients, the country singer Travis Tritt, off "The Tonight Show" after learning that Mr. Tritt was also appearing on the rival "Arsenio" show. What was even worse, Mr. Kragen said, was that for no reason other than vindictiveness, Ms. Kushnick canceled a scheduled appearance on "The Tonight Show" by Trisha Yearwood, another country singer whom Mr. Kragen represents. Ms. Kushnick denied Mr. Kragen's assertions about her motivations. That denial was not enough for NBC. Last week the network dismissed Ms. Kushnick.

HEADLINE: An Energy Prophet Who Guessed Right

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
In a way, S. David Freeman is a prophet coming into his own. As head of the Ford Foundation's energy project in the early 1970's, he correctly predicted that improved energy efficiency would be cheaper than continued expansion of power plants, and he predicted that American energy use, then galloping ahead, would reach a plateau by the late 1980's. At the time, oil companies and utilities said his idea was radical and wrong, but in fact it was not radical enough. When the plateau was reached, it was 15 percent lower than what Mr. Freeman had predicted.
For the last two years Mr. Freeman has been general manager of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), which is scrambling to replace the power from the Rancho Seco nuclear plant, which the voters closed three years ago. But Mr. Freeman is still a radical prophet. And in an interview earlier this month, he backs new technologies for electricity production to replace nuclear power. 
 Question: You have a toe in the water in every form of conservation and alternative generation. Why?

 Answer: We're going to end up by the year 2000 not only with a very much cleaner power system, but one where the price of electricity for the people of Sacramento County is going to be very reasonable and stable.
If over the next 10 years, through our rebates and education and financing, we can displace the energy-consuming devices with much more efficient ones and reduce the per-capita consumption of electricity 10 or 20 percent, even if we raise the rates 5 percent, I've got happy customers.
We're replacing the nuclear plant with cogeneration, using natural gas, plus a large chunk of advanced and renewable technologies that we're working to improve, so that when we have to commit to them, they can be fairly cost effective, especially if you pay any dues at all to the environmental costs.

 Q: Is this as if you set out to sea and lost sight of land and are going to innovate your way to the other shore?

 A: On the contrary. It's the people who feel that we're going to produce our way out of this problem with nuclear power and carbon-rich coal who are at sea. We have learned the one lesson that needs to be learned from the last 20 years, that nuclear power has proven to be an economic failure in the United States of America, that we can't afford it. The planet cannot afford the continued or increased production of coal or oil.
Now we start off with the advantage of having some hydropower in our system, and some geothermal. We're taking care of all of our growth with efficiency improvements. And we're adding the windpower and a big block of renewables, and we have some geothermal. Add the whole thing up, we're going to be predominantly a clean utility.

 Q: SMUD wants to plant 50,000 trees a year. Why?

 A: When I came to Sacramento a little over two years ago, I bought a home in Arden Park, and some wise person, 20 or 25 years ago, had planted some Modesto ash trees that form a canopy. It was in June, and I'd just come from Austin, Tex. What I had was not a tree but an air-conditioner. It had the wonderful impact of getting better every year, not rusting.
I asked the guys to come up with some numbers. The numbers were that in year 10, we had sizable savings. It was worth giving the trees away; they were saving electricity at less than 4 cents a kilowatt-hour, which was our economic screening device. It sounds like we're just a bunch of do-gooders, greenies, but this is a hard-headed, cost-effective part of our efficiency program.

 Q: Is SMUD's experience a guide for anybody else?

 A: I think so. No one that I know of has put down the simple number of what has nuclear power generated in cost per kilowatt-hour. But if you take all of the plants that were abandoned, plus the ones that were built, I would guess that that number is very close to 20 cents per kilowatt hour. Though you have the emotional believers in nuclear power making fun of solar enery and wind energy, their product hasn't cut it in the marketplace even though it's highly subsidized.

 Q: Can renewable energy sources compete economically?

 A: We may very well end up with less renewables and more efficiency. But that's a wonderful contest to have on your hands. I've got my energy-efficiency people now competing with the guys who develop the solar technologies. Whichever one wins, we're going to be a winner.
We take these issues seriously. We think that's the foundation for our credibility in electrifying our transportation system. The electric system will reduce carbon tremendously because the electric motor is 98 percent efficient, and you don't run the car when it's idling. It not only cuts out local air pollution but it reduces the carbon emissions, not to mention ameliorating the problem of going to war [to secure the oil needed] to get to work.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Currency Wars: Central Banks May Yet Prevail

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
CALL it the great bank bailout, 1990's style.
That is one way to look at the currency follies of the past several weeks, in which European central banks lost billions of dollars, or marks, or pounds, in defending absurd exchange rates. 
 Those losses are someone else's gain. And while the profits were spread around, there is no doubt that commercial banks, being among the biggest and best-capitalized currency traders, were also among the biggest beneficiaries.
Of course, profits made from currency trading can be lost in the same way. And so the big question in Europe now is whether France and Germany will be able to keep the franc from plunging. If they do and if calm eventually returns to markets, then the central banks will make back some of their losses.
The currency game has its unfair elements. It is the Bundesbank, the much-reviled German central bank, that is spending the most money buying French francs. And it is the Bundesbank that could decide to change course by significantly lowering German interest rates, thus taking pressure off the franc and locking in big profits for the Bundesbank. In the currency markets, insider trading is perfectly legal.
Most German interest rates remain high, but the Bundesbank did manipulate the rate on money lent overnight, dropping it almost to nothing. Meanwhile, the French overnight rate soared. That makes it expensive to bet that the franc will fall, a fact the central banks hope will discourage speculators.
To win, the central banks must be believed when they vow to maintain existing exchange rates. Of course, that's what they said before the pound plunged. But perhaps this time the central banks really mean it.
There are, in both Germany and France, people who are quite happy with the idea of a "small Europe," composed of a group of northern European countries whose distinguishing feature would be that they kept within the Exchange Rate Mechanism when the going got rough. "We may," said Yves Lyon-Caen, the chairman of Credit National, the big French bank, "have to create a Europe with Britain out of it." Such a Europe, he said, could move rapidly toward monetary union.
Meanwhile, Europe shows signs of stagnation. Mr. Lyon-Caen thinks that France will post real growth of a puny 1.5 percent next year but that Germany's figure will be only 1 percent. His hope is that the weak German economy will persuade the Bundesbank to push down interest rates.
For big banks, the idea of a weak Europe and a stumbling American economy raises the question of more loan losses, and Mr. Lyon-Caen says German banks are muttering privately about deteriorating loan portfolios. The banks may end up needing all of those currency profits.
Whether they will keep them will probably be known soon. But it may take much longer to get good news about economic growth, on either side of the Atlantic.

HEADLINE: At Work;
A Corporate Collaboration for Care

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
FRAN SUSSNER RODGERS has been in the work-family business or more than 20 years, so she knows how to keep faith in a project over a long time. So it is surprising to hear that she fretted a bit over what would eventually become the American Business Collaboration for Quality Dependent Care. That landmark $25.4 million initiative, concluded earlier this month by 137 businesses and organizations, will provide their employees with a broad range of family services. The announcement included a statement signed by the chief executives of 11 spearhead corporations.
Ms. Rodgers, head of Work/Family Directions Inc., the Boston-based consulting firm that provided expertise, can now pass out tangible evidence of the fruits of collaboration: an 11-page list of infant, child, youth and elder-care projects in 25 states being created or enhanced by the corporations. The list, she says, represents the taming of chaos. "In retrospect, it seems systematic," she said. "Personally, at the beginning, I had doubts." 
 The doubts did not derive from any skepticism about the need for more attention to the pulls between family and jobs many American workers feel. President Bush may not be convinced of the need for a Family Leave Act. And there may be entire sectors of the economy that pay little attention to family issues -- typically the sectors that employ women in small numbers. But the ones that do pay attention pay a lot of attention. Long before the collaboration was a twinkle of potential entropy in Fran Rodgers's eye, corporations like I.B.M., Xerox and A.T.& T. were keeping track of demographic trends that forecast the need for the services a family may need as it passes through the life cycle, all of which are included in the state-of-the-art buzz phrase "dependent care."
It was precisely because some companies already had dependent care partnerships in the pipeline that the collaboration survived an 18-month process to become the relatively pristine headless entity its early sponsors envisioned. The International Business Machines Corporation, for example, a catalyst, brought lessons learned in three projects to the initiative's first meeting, in April 1991, at a hotel in Greenwich, Conn.
"It planted the seed that maybe this concept had merit and could be developed on a larger scale," said J. T. Childs Jr., director of work-force diversity programs at I.B.M., who called the first meeting and is widely credited as a conceptual force behind the initiative, though he portrays himself more as a willing instrument of destiny than an innovator. The Greenwich meeting, he said, "started the engine, but it didn't start the race."
THE race was in reality a collective shedding of corporate ego, a process especially difficult for business, which typically blanches in unison at the notion that the highest form of charity is anonymously given. A crucial step in the collaboration was the decision not to disclose the amount of money each company contributed, which would have allowed the rankings-by-donation so dear to the corporate communications office. The final list includes only totals for each of the 44 communities that are home to the projects.
That crucial step made others possible, including a kind of feedback loop between corporate headquarters, employees in need of services, providers in local communities and Work/Family Directions and its resources. "The grass-roots piece of it is important and appealing," said Deborah Stahl, director of the family care development fund at A.T.& T. "Programs are delivered on a community level." She added: "You can't just plop down a model of a child-care center everywhere. You have to figure out ways to address different needs."
According to Mr. Childs, "The idea was to think global but act local. We wanted to facilitate services where the need was. It helps the local economy by creating a collision between employee needs and service providers." Perhaps it was utter incongruity of a Big Blue bigwig speaking in the language of New Age politics that softened Ms. Rodgers's early worries. By the third or fourth month of meetings, she had moved her likelihood-of-success index up to "maybe"; by six months, she was positively serene.
"Crunch time," as she calls it, starts now, as implementation begins. The group's slogan is "Doing together what none of us can afford to do alone," and Ms. Rodgers hopes that in 10 years people can look back for an object lesson: companies, she said, "should not dismiss solutions simply because they aren't within their own resources."

. . .And a Forecast for the Future

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
As fuel economy and recycling become increasingly important, more and more lightweight -- and different -- materials will find their way into the cars of the future, according to a recent survey by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
The study, based on responses from domestic auto manufacturers and suppliers, as well as scholars and consultants, showed that to achieve a corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) of 35 miles per gallon by the year 2000, nearly 200 pounds would need to be shaved from today's cars. 
 To do that, according to David E. Cole, director of the university's office for the study of automotive transportation, car makers will need to use more expensive and exotic materials such as ceramics, magnesium, powdered metals and composites, although steel will remain dominant.
"Although the value of CAFE regulation is intensely debated," Cole said, "its influence will steer product strategies, engineering direction and sourcing decisions."
Further, he said, recycling of old cars has emerged as a significant issue for the international auto industry in recent years and is expected to have a much heavier impact on design over the next decade. Exterior body parts in particular will use more nontraditional materials, with about 35 percent of the doors and fenders of domestic cars made of plastics and polymers.
The report concludes that "although material trends appear to be reasonably stable, they still represent a significant change from the composition of components today. This suggests rather strongly that we are on the threshold of a revolution in automotive materials."

Happy Hoofbeats Out of the Past . . .

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
THERE are people like me in Detroit! Or at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, at least. If I was unsure before, I know it now that I have put in some time at the wheel of a new Mustang convertible, the one with the big 5-liter V8 and the huge tires and ...
Ah. And the eye-popping red body with the pristine white roof and the white leather upholstery and the white wheels with the chrome horses in their hubs. This car is not only properly old-fashioned, it is dressed up like a tart on the town. And I love it. 
 For some time now, I have been complaining that the domestic manufacturers are failing to give us cars that we want, that are exciting. That come with hues that are more than a monotone. That can be opened properly to the wind, either as convertibles or as hardtop coupes.
O.K., Ford said quietly. Take that!
Well, that is this year's incarnation of the street racer that gave pony-cars their name, a Mustang LX with the optional 225-horsepower engine driving the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. It is fast and it looks that way. I worry about getting arrested just sitting at the light.
There is the sound, for one thing, the burbling through the dual exhausts that makes the little Ford sound like a cabin cruiser. Love it. And there is the smooth flood of torque when you put your foot into the gas. When you drive all these fours and sixes, you do forget.
Of course, there are other things that you forget about the older and "more exciting" designs, too. For instance, the lovely pleated buckets -- comfortable as they are -- are fairly flat and offer little support. There is a tooth-loosening ride that only a periodontist could love. And you have to be a pretty good driver to throw the car into a curve at speed.
But, shucks, you don't have to drive fast. You get the good sound at any speed, and the gearing makes the car want to cruise at a nice license-preserving 60 on the highway. That also helps save the fuel, providing average economy of about 19 miles per gallon. And with a tank that holds only 15.4 gallons, fill-ups come with dismaying regularity in any case.
That is a factor of more than just the big engine, though. Part of it happens because of the convertible's weight, which at a ton and a half is 220 pounds more than the already heavy Mustang coupe. The added averdupois attests to the stiffening that is needed to take the place of the car's normal steel roof, but even with that stiffening there is a lot of shake on rough highways and potholed city streets.
An all-new Mustang will be coming in 1994, and lighter materials can be expected in its design. But, for now, Ford is saving weight (and cost) by leaving out such things as counterbalancing hinges for the hood. I mention that, because all you have to do to realize the heft of current components is to lift that giant piece of steel and prop it up on its rod.
The hinges at the other end of the car are worth mentioning, too. As in days of yore, they are exposed and incorporated as small styling touches on the lid of the trunk, which opens to reveal a shallow compartment fit mainly for soft luggage. The car may be heavy, but its occupants will travel light.
Inside, there is an air bag for the driver and a full array of instruments, including a 140 m.p.h. speedometer. The lined, well-fitted top goes up and down with the push of a toggle on the right side of the black instrument pod, and most of the other controls are equally easy to use.
The radio is an exception. It is low in the center of the dash and has buttons rather than knobs for tuning. You have to take your eyes off the road and fumble a lot.
Getting into the back seat also is difficult, since the would-be occupants must do battle with the front seatbelts, anchored in the rear and blocking the entry. Once ensconced, though, there is a surprising amount of legroom back there.
One of the best features of the car, it should be said, is its price. Ford's Mustang has always been one of the better bargains around, and you can actually own one of the plain-vanilla versions for about $11,000. Step your way through all the permutations and you get to the convertible, which lists for $19,644 and goes out the door at about $22,000.
That's still a steal, and if you're like me, you'll be grinning all the way home from the bank.

HEADLINE: The Strangelove Economics of 1992

BYLINE: By Warren B. Rudman; Warren B. Rudman is a Republican Senator from New Hampshire.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Recently, many politicians and economists have launched a new approach to the exploding U.S. deficit: Don't worry, be happy.
Tired of wrestling with how to untie our fiscal Gordian knot, these folks now suggest we simply learn to live with our red ink. They advise us to indulge our urge to spend our children's money, advocating Strangelove Economics ("How I learned to stop worrying and love the deficit"). 
 Candidates this year have treated the deficit like the skunk at the garden party. They advocate "investment" (spending) and "tax cuts." But they seem to be choking on "deficit reduction," offering only minimal measures in that direction.
The problem is that the winner of the race will have no mandate for change with a $4 trillion debt hanging over his head. Unless Federal borrowing is decreased, thus reducing interest payments, there will be no money to pay for campaign promises. Perhaps Ross Perot's expected re-entry into the Presidential race tomorrow will finally incite discussion.
Don't misunderstand me. Deficit reduction is not a panacea for all our economic problems. But it will re-establish fiscal equilibrium and avert economic turmoil in the years ahead. Even those who preach against reductions now must recognize that it is the weight of huge deficits amassed in the last 20 years that has mired us in the current recession. The debt and attendant $200 billion annual interest prevent us from deploying traditional countercyclical measures -- cutting taxes and raising spending -- as we have done in every past recession.
The Federal red ink has crippled growth by reducing national savings and capital formation. In 1979, when the gross national product was $2.5 trillion, savings in the U.S. totaled $109 billion. But a run of huge deficits over the next 13 years devoured savings and dramatically reduced the capital for investment. By 1992, the G.N.P. stood at $5.7 trillion but savings totaled only $22 billion.
Moreover, we continue to accumulate debt. The Government's liabilities should terrify everyone under 21 (or those who have kids that age). Adults today will receive $14 trillion more in benefits than they pay in taxes. This translates into a $150,000 gap for every household.
Between 1993 and 1997 the Government will collect $657 billion in payroll taxes and premiums for Medicare, but it expects to pay out $913 billion in benefits. It's estimated that by 2020, Social Security and Medicare taxes will increase to between 29 percent and 37 percent of payroll deductions. Today, 70 percent of American families pay more in Social Security taxes than they do in income taxes. Almost 50 percent of Federal spending goes for mandatory entitlements, and the amount is rising rapidly.
Cutting the deficit will involve tough decisions and hurt some people in the short run. But it is far preferable to the calamity that will result if we refuse. That's why former Senator Paul Tsongas and I have formed the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan, grass-roots group that hopes to break the gridlock, reduce the debt and build a future for our kids, not hand them the bill.
The time has come to put up or shut up. A freeze on Federal programs is acceptable. Reasonable military cuts are warranted. New revenues must be considered. And ballooning entitlement programs must be reformed.
America has always held the promise of a better tomorrow. Not now. And not if we succumb to the siren call for the feel-good, quick-fix policies advanced by Dr. Strangelove economists and politicians. Unless we change course -- reduce our debt, save more, invest more -- our children and grandchildren will be the first generation of Americans to have fewer opportunities and a lower standard of living than their parents.

R & D Center Sets Up Shop

BYLINE: By Maureen Milford

 BODY:
A $29 MILLION research and development center that sprouted from a former farmstead is an out-of-the-way example of the emerging world market that is breaking down boundary lines.
Himont Inc., the world's leading producer of polypropylene resins, with headquarters in Wilmington, Del., considered 17 sites in Delaware and Pennsylvania for its North American research and development operation, looking for the best deal. 
 It chose 200 acres in this historic Cecil County town -- known for its quick marriages of eloping couples -- because the state offered $2.475 million and the county $650,000 in low-interest loans and funds to train new employees and because fast approvals let Himont complete the building at 15 percent less than it would have laid out elsewhere, company officials said. Moreover, the site is just 20 miles from its headquarters.
Himont, created in 1983 as a joint venture of Montedison S.p.A. of Milan and Hercules Inc. of Wilmington, was taken over by the Italian manufacturer in 1990, but not before the center here was in the pipeline. Himont's only other research and development operation is in Ferrara, Italy.
Ballinger, the Philadelphia architectural firm that designed the project, was asked to style the building here after others the company owns in Europe.
The boxy, two-story, sand-colored-brick building housing 165 researchers and supporting personnel is trimmed in bright red, green, blue and yellow. Much of the steel is exposed on the interior and painted in primary colors. An atrium offers researchers windows and natural light in their offices, across the corridor from the laboratories.
The 145,000-square-foot building is the first of what the company expects to be several on its Oakmont campus here to accommodate perhaps 2,000 employees within the next 15 years. Its diverse mixture of scientists hail from all over the world, from Nigeria to China.
The town of about 9,000 residents, incorporated in 1787, has become a rest stop on the way to the Chesapeake Bay. Discount liquor marts, truck stops for drivers turning off Interstate 95, shopping centers and fast-food restaurants have become important to the local economy.
Preliminary plans by the state's Highway Administration to build a road that would bypass Cecil County's largest town to get on I-95 have not been well received by local businesses and officials.
As neighboring New Castle County in Delaware has become more restrictive on development and land prices have risen, many builders have been moving housing projects here so they can offer a more affordable product.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Cooking Up Some Ideas For Negative Campaigns

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"EVER notice Bill Clinton when he runs?" asked Sean Fitzpatrick, an advertising executive who recently parted with the Bush campaign's ad team. "He looks like a duck."
Mr. Fitzpatrick turned that concept into a proposal for a television commercial: a waddling mechanical duck dissolves into images of the hefty Arkansas Governor jogging. The announcer says Mr. Clinton claims he is "not like those Democrats in Congress who like to tax and spend, tax and spend." Then, after the duck has quacked, he says: "We say, if it talks like a duck, walks like a duck, it must be a Democrat." 
 Though that spot has not been made, the season of the attack ad has arrived. Last week, the Clinton and Bush campaigns officially began using paid-for airtime to fling mud.
The Clinton camp fired first; its commercial interspersed clips of President Bush making predictions of a recovery with black-and-white frames showing rising jobless figures.
The Bush campaign tried humor; it used hick music and fast-forward video in an ad that portrays Mr. Clinton as a Governor of a small, backward state who did little but raise taxes.
It will only get nastier, and the toughest ads can be expected to come from the Republicans as long as Mr. Bush is stuck in second place in the polls.
"The resistance to Bush is akin to the resistance that mosquitoes have developed to DDT -- people are resisting any and all advances from him," said Douglas Watts, the advertising director for the 1984 Reagan campaign who is now in public relations. "The only way to truly overcome that is to start beating up the other guy."
Killer commercials have inherent risks, but they are often the only way candidates can break through to voters whose only exposure to political discourse is on "Murphy Brown," not the evening news.
The most important decision facing the Republicans in coming weeks is not whether to attack but how hard and on what issues: If Mr. Bush jumps from family values to the draft to pollution in Arkansas, he risks confusing voters and undermining his own credibility.
Most analysts agree that reviving tales of womanizing would only cast the Republicans as purveyors of sleaze. And while the Bush campaign has prepared advertising implying that Mr. Clinton evaded the draft, many Republican strategists questioned whether that issue "has legs" because of the public's ambiguity about the Vietnam War.
 
Pick One Bull's Eye
 "They have to throw darts at one bull's eye," said Don Sipple, an advertising consultant in Mr. Bush's campaign earlier this year. "It has to be Clinton's credibility. I would deal with it very explicitly. Just frame it there at the top of the commercial: How much can we really trust Bill Clinton?"
As long as the criticisms are accurate, Mr. Sipple has no qualms about nasty ads. "You're going to take the hit for going negative," he said, "so you might as well land the blow."
But officials in both the Bush and Clinton camps are nervous because it is getting harder to dodge media "truth squads" -- greater efforts by reporters to look into the claims made in the advertisements. They also know some voters have grown sophisticated about commercials and may not want to elect someone they think is too vicious.
Mr. Bush is still accused of race-baiting with the Willie Horton ad in 1988. A reminder of the danger to the messenger is Elizabeth Holtzman's attacks on Geraldine A. Ferraro in New York's Democratic Senate primary. The ads may have cost Ms. Ferraro the race, but Ms. Holtzman came in fourth, and many voters disliked the tone of her campaign.
The Bush campaign's use of humor and the Clinton campaign's attempts to hang the President using only his own words and numbers from his own Bureau of Labor Statistics may have been attempts to avoid sharing Ms. Holtzman's predicament.
Republicans say their television assault will move into higher gear this week, and the Clinton campaign is not known for shrinking from a brawl. Neither camp will disclose what it has in the works, but several political consultants were asked what they would do under the circumstances. Mr. Fitzpatrick's answer was the duck ad.
Tony Schwartz, a Democratic consultant, said he would reprise his 1968 "A Heartbeat Away" commercial that sought to make voters nervous about Spiro Agnew, Richard M. Nixon's running mate. "The ad should say, 'Which of these two men do you want a heartbeat away from the Presidency: Quayle or Gore?' " Mr. Schwartz said. "It is very meaningful when you talk about how many of the last Vice Presidents became President."
Joseph Napolitan, who also helps Democratic candidates, says they should exploit the idea that Mr. Bush is out of touch with ordinary Americans.
A script he dreamed up opens with scenes from the Depression, cuts to a preppie emerging from a limousine with his school books, and then to Mr. Bush emerging from Air Force One and into a limousine. The announcer says "Some people never come into contact with the realities of life," recalls that young George Bush was chauffeured to school in Greenwich, Conn., and says he still doesn't understand poverty, hunger or unemployment.
Mr. Napolitan, who has been in the business for decades, counsels subtlety to his younger peers. "We tried to sneak in with a stiletto," he said. "Today, they're hitting with a sledgehammer."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Perot: What's Changed And What Hasn't

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
HE set out to rescue a weary America last winter: a bantamweight billionaire Texan with a get-it-done zeal, a puggishness for television talk shows, a populist's drawling scorn for Washington politics and, not least, the support of an army of devoted, mostly middle-class volunteers. The early polls looked rosy for Ross Perot.
But by midsummer, the enterprise had soured. The press had raised a host of questions about the Perot background and character. His promises of programs to fix the ailing economy, the deficit, unemployment had largely gone unfulfilled. His campaign was in disarray. He was nosediving in the polls. 
 And on July 16, he abandoned his undeclared Presidential bid. Many followers called it a betrayal and Democratic and Republican leaders breathed easier, no longer facing the tortuous uncertainties of a three-way race. Mr. Perot all but vanished from public view.
But his more dedicated zealots carried on, quietly getting his name on ballots in all 50 states. And Mr. Perot in late July released a far-reaching economic plan that proposed to eliminate the budget deficit in five years by raising some taxes, cutting health costs and military budgets and taking other painful steps. Oddly, Mr. Perot seemed to be doing better after giving up his campaign.
And last week, he said his decision to quit had been a mistake. He scheduled television time, including an appearance tomorrow night on "Larry King Live," and there was much anticipation that he might well resume his quest for the White House, at least nominally.
But political experts said it was no longer the same game as last February. Too many things had gone wrong and would not be forgotten, they said. The February-to-July campaign, among other things, uncovered for many Americans a dark side of the Perot character: an autocratic, secretive, thin-skinned man who could be mean-spirited, domineering yet fragile.
 
Resenting the Press
 Though almost unknown to most voters when his campaign began, he resisted appeals by his advisers to publish advertisements that would help define him, and aides said he resented the news media for exploring his background and character, for exposing his business practices and his penchant for snooping on competitors, political foes, even friends and family members.
The New York Times in early July reported that Mr. Perot, convinced he had been cheated out of a lucrative state contract in the 1980's, had a private detective undertake an unrestrained investigation of a rival company executive in the computing business. The detective, the report said, gathered evidence against the company and the executive and tried to get officials to investigate him and prosecute one of his aides.
Mr. Perot also was reported to have ordered an investigation of a 1982 land deal involving the chairman of Pennzoil, who had been a friend and business partner of George Bush. Other reports said he had investigated Mr. Bush's children and had his own children shadowed. He denied the allegations, which he called dirty tricks by Republicans, or provided justifications but no detailed explanations.
Throughout his campaign, Mr. Perot resisted making appearances at forums other than those packed with his enthusiastic supporters. He made only one true campaign appearance, on July 11 before a convention of the National Association or the Advancement of Colored People in Nashville. Though the bulk of his address was an appeal for racial harmony, it was marred by some ill-chosen words that left the impression that he lacked an appreciation of black sensibilities. His remarks were sprinkled with references to "you people" and "your people," words that have traditionally offended many blacks.He later apologized for any unintended slight, but his appearance left a sense of ill-will.
Earlier in the campaign, Mr. Perot had said he would not appoint homosexuals to cabinet positions because, "I don't want anybody there that will be a point of controversy with the American people." Aides said his comment was taken out of context, but groups representing homosexuals were incensed. He later met with gay rights groups; in July, he reversed course on the issue of appointing gays to cabinet positions and said he favored an end to the Government policy that bans homosexuals from serving in the military, though if elected he said he would not promise to directly order the Secretary of Defense to end the policy.
While known for organizing skills and his ability to get things done, Mr. Perot seemed unable to cope with internal dissension and turmoil in his own campaign. There were two factions. One, headed by professional political consultants like Edward J. Rollins and Hamilton Jordan, co-managers of the campaign, felt he had to follow traditional practice and define himself more clearly for the public because he was slipping in the polls and allowing the press and Republican critics to define him.
Another faction, including James Squires, his press spokesman, recognized that Mr. Perot had to do some conventional things, like taking polls, but they also felt that his strength was in being a nontraditional candidate with a broad grass-roots support, and they were inclined to let the campaign lean more heavily on the volunteers.
Mr. Perot, who wrote his own speeches and preferred one-page memos on issues rather than studies in depth, rejected the advice for an ad campaign to define himself, prompting Mr. Rollins's resignation on July 15, the day before Mr. Perot's own withdrawal.
Mr. Perot spoke of fixing national problems, like a good mechanic under the hood, tinkering with the economy, the deficit, health care and unemployment. He promised a complete platform, and even went into a retreat to get it done. But by midsummer, he had not issued it, and in the end he could not even fix his own discombobulated campaign.
But in a race that for many had been an emotional roller-coaster, Mr. Perot may have lost heaviest -- the loyalty of some of his most devoted followers -- with his decision to abandon the campaign itself. Fury, bitter disappointment, crushed hopes: these are a legacy not easily overcome, even by the Perot magic.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Middle East Lets Itself Consider Peace

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
NEARLY a year after Arabs and Israelis sat down at the peace table in Madrid, Arabs in a number of countries and Israelis seem to agree they have a real opportunity to firmly establish a habit of negotiation that might, step by step, lead to peace.
It is a mood that contrasts vividly with that of the spring and early summer of 1990, just before Iraq invaded Kuwait, when many people in Israel and the Arab world clearly saw the region sliding toward war. It also contrasts with the mood 11 months ago, when both sides seemed content to come to the bargaining table primarily to please the United States, with little real hope of making progress. 
 Now, many people on both sides say that while reliance on military force for nearly half a century has established basic facts of life in the region, it has failed to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict in any durable way. So there is a general belief that the peace process begun by the United States will continue and perhaps achieve small breakthroughs, even though the latest round of talks in Washington proved inconclusive and recent exchanges between Israel and Syria have proceeded only fitfully.
In conversations with Arab and Israeli scholars, newspaper columnists and politicians in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Cairo, Amman, Algiers, Tunis and Kuwait over 10 weeks, there has been a consensus on several points: that Arabs and Israelis have no way to go but toward making peace in whatever form is possible; that both sides seem willing to advance toward a settlement, albeit warily; that Arabs and Israelis have more to fear from Iran in the immediate future than from each other, and that Arab rejectionists hold few cards if any (although that could change if Israel insists on humiliating terms.)
 
Reluctant Pragmatism
 "No one in the Arab world has got any interest in doubting the peaceful intentions of the new Israeli Government," Usama al-Baaz, chief foreign policy adviser to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, told the press in Cairo last week. But Adli Sadek, a commentator, wrote less sanguinely yesterday in Al Quds al-Arabi, a Palestinian daily in London. "It is true that no one has a credible substitute to a settlement," he said, but he also wrote: "It is forbidden to the negotiator, in fact it is impossible, to give up any of our beliefs."
This reluctant pragmatism has been sustained now for 11 months by a palpable relaxation of tensions and a number of confidence-building measures on both sides. American Jewish leaders were invited to visit Saudi Arabia this year. Israelis have quietly relaxed military patrolling in the West bank. Syria and Yemen have moved to allow their tiny Jewish communities to leave.
It is true that much of this progress is the product of a lack of alternatives. Still, it is creating a momentum for peace that may be difficult to reverse.
Above all, every Mideast country has been sobered by how close Iraq came to manufacturing atomic weapons, along with its missiles and chemical weapons. Now Israel and several Arab countries have arrived separately at two additional conclusions: they can be more certain of each other's limits, and all must prepare to face a new and unpredictable danger, Iran.
They know the Government in Teheran is rearming and they have little doubt it is working to export its revolutionary ideas -- to Palestinians as well as other Arabs. Their fears have been underlined by reports that Iran will soon take delivery of three submarines from Russia, and by Iranian moves to take over a tiny Persian Gulf island it shared with the United Arab Emirates.
Much of the change in how Arabs view Israel began with the humiliation of Iraq in the gulf crisis, which itself was played out against the loss of the Soviet Union as an ally against Israel and the West. This allowed for the rise of the liberating notion that being pro-Western need not be a stigma. Pro-Western regimes like those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia took the lead in making decisions in the Arab world, and even Syria became willing to converse with Israel.
Optimism that the postwar peace talks might, indeed, go somewhere was sealed with the election in June of Yitzhak Rabin and his Israeli Labor Party coalition, which accepts the principle of trading land for peace. Many Israelis now express confidence in Labor's fundamental proposition that the last two years have wrought enough changes to afford Israel time to try a new approach toward its neighbors. There also appears to be a widespread appreciation that while Israel has contained the uprising of Palestinians against occupation, it cannot forever suppress all Palestinian aspirations.
From Tel Aviv to Riyadh, there is, as well, a vivid appreciation of the cost of armaments. Egypt is struggling to rebuild its economy after four wars in 40 years, and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which spent well over $120 billion on the gulf war, now run yearly budget deficits.
In Israel, whose economy has long been hostage to its defense budget and the cost of building settlements in occupied territory, there is now also difficulty with absorbing Jews who left the Soviet Union. And its friend the United States is proving to be a giant with economic feet of clay.
"Rabin understands that we have a chance to make peace and consolidate this lack of threats because he understands that on the horizon new and more serious threats are emerging and they are existential threats because of who is on the horizon," Zeev Schiff, a commentator on military and political affairs for the daily Haaretz, said in a conversation in Tel Aviv. He spoke of "an unbelievable change" in the position of Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad, and he also said, pointing to Iran, that the profile of Israel's enemies is changing.
For their part, many Palestinians have begun to say that time is against them in their effort to wrest land from Israel as the basis for a settlement. The other day, Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, said that Saddam Hussein had misled Palestinians "under the illusion that his missiles were to liberate them from Israeli occupation." It was just a passing remark in a radio interview, nearly obscured by other comments in his usual vitriolic style. But it spoke volumes.

HEADLINE: A Time for Statesmen. Or for a Pause.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
THE names of Jean Monnet, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi and Charles de Gaulle were being invoked last week by their successors, to recall the high ideals and aspirations that underlay the foundation of the European Community but that lately seem to have been lost in bickering.
Many Europeans were asking themselves whether their current leaders are up to the task of bringing Europe closer to unity, or even of preventing the loss of what has already been achieved. Much of the monetary and political chaos of the last few weeks has been an object lesson in inept political leadership and in the narrow national vision that the Community's original architects sought to transcend. 
 "There will be no peace in Europe if states just realign themselves on the basis of national sovereignty and the resultant politics of prestige and economic protectionism," Monnet, the great French political thinker who never held elective office, wrote before World War II ended. Chancellor Helmut Kohl recalled his words in a speech to the German Parliament Friday: "Europe must be united, and not only by cooperation, but by a voluntary surrender of sovereignty by the European nations to a kind of central union, a union that has the power to reduce tariffs, to create a broader European market and to prevent the revival of nationalism."
Starting next January, Europeans will have a tariff-free single market, but the trouble is that not all of them are sure they want political union, or even a single currency. Pulled in different directions by the pressures of a global recession, left to their own devices by Americans preoccupied with their very different internal economic and social problems, Europeans seem to be asking themselves whether they should stop where they are for a while.
The Community has come a long way toward achieving the dream articulated by Monnet. But De Gaulle and Adenauer and the other founders in the 1950's and 1960's glossed over a basic contradiction that has always lain at the heart of the community. Should it tend toward a collection of loosely cooperating nation-states, or a true United States of Europe? They never really decided.
Instead of bringing all of Europe closer together, the end of the cold war intensified the contradiction. The countries of eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union fiercely insisted on reviving national and ethnic distinctions that Communism had suppressed. Civil wars to the east have all but killed the dream of bringing the new democracies there quickly into the European Community fold, and have made all Europeans think more than they used to about what makes them different from one another, instead of about what they all have in common.
 
A Call for Vision
 "We need statesmen," complained Jacques Delors, president of the community's Executive Commission, at a conference in Brussels last week. "A statesman is a man who sees far and wide, in spite of internal problems." But by wavering in the face of public doubts about the unification process, rather than arguing persuasively for going forward, he seemed to be saying, many were not up to the task.
Mr. Delors has many critics, who would say he should hardly be the first to throw stones on the question of leadership. But in recent years, critics of Europe's unification process have often cast bigger shadows than its supporters. Margaret Thatcher of Britain, when she was Prime Minister, left no doubt where she stood: Britain would not surrender its sovereignty to the bureaucrats in Brussels; European states should be content with the joys of the completely free-trade zone they will have starting next year.
Mr. Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand of France have both made clear that they believe Europe should advance more quickly toward unity, in a real federation.
But at the moment these are not strong leaders, either at home or abroad. Both have been in office for the past decade. Mr. Kohl's authority as the Chancellor of German unification has slumped badly because of the unexpectedly high costs of unification and the social and economic turmoil they brought.
Mr. Mitterrand's popularity was sagging before he called a referendum for last Sunday on the treaty on European political and economic union that was signed in Maastricht, the Netherlands, last December. Uncertainty about whether the treaty would survive the referendum (and it barely did, with just short of 51 percent of France's voters approving it) brought monetary strains within the Community to a head, and have shaken it to its foundations -- needlessly, in the view of some of the French President's critics. Mr. Mitterrand himself looks exhausted, and he was recently diagnosed with cancer of the prostate.
Italy has been in a state of political uncertainty ever since last spring's elections. And Mrs. Thatcher's successor, Prime Minister John Major, now faces a growing rebellion by members of his own party who wonder whether the Iron Lady may have been right after all about staying aloof from Europe.
European integration has always advanced in fits and starts, great creative initiatives being succeeded by periods of consolidation and doubt. But forward movement has almost always coincided with periods of strong national leadership in the key countries. In addition, it has also usually had enthusiastic support from the United States.
But Americans' attention now seems consumed by their own election, and by their economic problems. And when the European leaders signed the Maastricht treaty last year, outlining the way to a common currency as early as 1997, it appears that they may have overreached themselves.
Now there is no way for the treaty to go into effect as scheduled next January, even with the narrow endorsement given in France. Denmark, which rejected the treaty in a referendum June 2, said it would not try again until next year. As for Britain, Mr. Major made clear that he would not put the treaty before Parliament before Denmark resolves its problems. Given all the difficulties, there was talk last week that France and Germany could try to go ahead with monetary union on their own, probably together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
 
French-German Solidarity
 German solidarity with France in the money markets was much more evident last week than it had been with Britain or Italy the week before. Mr. Kohl said Germany's Government and central bank believed the franc was at the right level against the mark. With their support, the franc steadied at the end of the week. Without it, the pound had been forced the week before to float free.
Mr. Major, who holds the rotating presidency of the 12-member European Community now, called an emergency summit meeting in Birmingham Oct. 16, when the leaders will discuss the way forward.
One thing they all agree on is that if the Maastricht treaty is to be saved, all national leaders will have to do a better job of explaining to their citizens how it would work. Crucially, the current generation of leaders has not been able to reassure nervous people who think of themselves first of all as British, French, German, Danish or Dutch that surrendering more national sovereignty to European institutions does not mean losing national identity to a faceless bureaucracy in Brussels.
In the end, some of Europe's nations may decide, as the Danes seemed to do in June, that they just don't want to risk that at all. In that case, perhaps France and Germany will indeed go ahead and build a "small Europe." It would be a far cry from the "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals" that De Gaulle used to speak of. But smaller visions seem to have succeeded grand ones all over the world.

HEADLINE: U.S. Uncommonly Inactive In World Economic Arena

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
President Bush's new world order, which assigns leadership to the United States as the surviving superpower, clearly did not apply this week to the European currency turmoil. While the United States Government stood by, Germany marched Europe to the German agenda.
Similarly, Mr. Bush's call last spring for rapid approval of foreign loans for Russia was not repeated by the Administration this week at the semiannual gathering of the world's finance ministers and central bank presidents -- a meeting that is frequently a platform from which to push America's foreign economic goals. The White House was silent on Russia. 
 Behind the American reticence is the diminishing power of the United States to shape Europe's economies, a loss of influence made more explicit than ever by the European currency turmoil. That turmoil suggests a world dividing into spheres, with Germany the superpower in Western Europe, the United States in the Western Hemisphere and Japan in Asia and the Pacific. Russia has so far resisted any superpower's strong hand.
 
'They Do Not Listen to Us'
 "The Germans did not inject themselves into the negotiations with Mexico and Canada for a free-trade agreement, and they do not listen to us in Europe," said Jeffrey Garten, a managing director of the Blackstone Group and the author of the recently published "A Cold Peace: America, Japan, Germany and the Struggle for Supremacy."
Confirming that assessment, a senior Treasury Department official who asked for anonymity said the Germans simply rejected or ignored American proposals in recent months that were intended to avoid the currency crisis that finally developed. The turmoil of the past two weeks disrupted the mechanism that had kept European currencies within a fixed range of Germany's mark. The steady mark has slowly replaced the dollar as the measure other Europeans use to value their currencies.
"The Germans believed they could control the currency market, and we believed they could not," the Treasury official said.
 
'A Domestic Agenda'
 But once the currency markets got out of control, American officials abstained from their usual vocal backseat views of how Europe should proceed. And they have not participated in any of the backroom negotiations to resolve the crisis, the Treasury official said. Those talks started in Europe, moved here this week during the meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and then migrated back to Europe.
"It is up to the Europeans how to put their system back together, not us," the official said. "First they have to stabilize the situation, and then we might play a role in the future."
Several other reasons help explain the low-key American presence at the meetings here. The main one was the presidential election. With Mr. Bush concentrating his campaign rhetoric on solutions for the domestic economic crisis, his strategists have apparently decided not to draw public attention to foreign problems -- particularly problems that have not responded to American pressure.
"The Administration is obviously involved in a domestic agenda," a senior Administration official said, suggesting that at least until Nov. 3, Bush officials are likely to say little about foreign economic issues. The election strategy has soft-pedaled references to the new world order that President Bush proclaimed during the Persian Gulf crisis.
In that spirit, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and David C. Mulford, Under Secretary for International Affairs, had publicly badgered the Germans to lower interest rates, with Mr. Mulford even getting into a squabble with German officials last spring.
The Americans argued, in effect, that only after the Germans, with their increasingly dominant economy, lowered rates could other European nations lower theirs. The American goal was to get Europeans to stimulate their economies, making them more prosperous so that Europe would purchase more American goods and help the United States out of its hard times. But the Germans refused, fearing that lower rates and too much borrowing would raise Germany's inflation rate and weaken the mark.
And the Germans also noted that the United States was in no position to criticize the rising German budget deficit when the American deficit is so high, and rising.
 
A Charitable Reaction
 In the end, the mark proved too strong for the currencies of Britain, Italy and Spain, with their sluggish economies, and these currencies were sharply devalued, destroying the European exchange rate mechanism in the process.
The crisis came on the eve of the meeting here, and the Bush Administration, with its election strategy in mind, responded with mild generalities about stronger worldwide economic growth. The one American attempt to upstage the discussions among Europeans over the proper values of their currencies was a proposal from President Bush that would in effect peg currency values to an index of commodity prices, reducing in the process the mark's power in Europe.
"The Administration was trying to show some leadership and imagination and to provide a sophisticated justification for lower German interest rates," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, offering a more charitable reaction than the Europeans, who ignored the proposal.
The Bush Administration similarly refrained from inserting itself into the growing conflict in Russia -- a conflict that America seems powerless to control. The Russians are divided between those who want to qualify for Western loans by cutting Government spending, closing inefficient companies and laying off workers, and those who want a go-slow policy to save jobs -- even if that means little foreign funding.
The Bush Administration, at the April I.M.F. and World Bank meeting, had declared that a historic moment had arrived and the West should quickly channel funds to the former Soviet Union -- and Russia, in particular -- to save it from falling back into Communism. The assumption was that President Boris N. Yeltsin's Russian Government would soon take the steps to qualify for the foreign loans, an assumption that no longer holds.
 
Avoiding the Wrong Words
 The Administration's policy has not changed, but the timetable for implementing it certainly has, Administration officials said. And Congress has not yet voted approval of a $12 billion contribution to the I.M.F. that America is required to make to help finance aid to Russia. Unable to act, American officials remained silent on the subject this week. So did the Germans and the Japanese, two other contenders for influence in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Given the European currency turmoil, no one particularly noticed. The American silence on Russia seemed less striking than the image of America sidelined in the currency crisis. Aside from the priorities of the election campaign, another view offered for the reticence was concern that the wrong words from American officials might worsen the currency turmoil.
This concern recalls that in mid-October 1987, James A. Baker 3d, then the Treasury Secretary, now White House chief of staff, demanded that West Germany lower interest rates and the value of the mark. His angry public criticism of German economic policy made a small contribution to the stock market crash a few days later, on Oct. 19, 1987.
And finally, the weak economic growth in the United States at a moment when the German Government is spending billions to rebuild East Germany has eroded American influence in Western Europe. The reunification program means Europe is buying more products from Europe at the same time that the United States is buying fewer European goods.
"If the United States economy were only stronger," said David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, "we could have some influence in resolving this crisis."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
A Tense Uncertainty Grows in the Campaign

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Five weeks before Election Day, it is a tense time for Gov. Bill Clinton, but an alarming one for President Bush.
Behind the happy, Trumanesque imagery of Mr. Bush's whistle-stop tour through the Midwest this weekend are some hard political facts: a formidable deficit in the national polls, an unfriendly electoral map and now, the possible re-entry of his most tormenting critic, Ross Perot. 
 Mr. Perot's re-emergence at this late stage of the campaign would be, in many ways, a major headache for both parties; before the Texas billionaire bolted from the race last July, he showed strength among voters who form the bases for both major candidates, and the prospect of his re-entry has sent both campaigns back to an anxious reassessment of the states.
Mr. Clinton, as the front-runner in national polls, but a very nervous one, obviously has the greatest interest in maintaining the status quo in the race. As James Carville, his top strategist, put it, "If the election were held today, I would be happy."
Some analysts suggest that Mr. Bush is so stalled now that he could profit from a scrambled race that forced voters to think anew, and perhaps splintered anti-Bush sentiment.
But Democrats argue, with some evidence in state-by-state polling, that Mr. Clinton can afford to take more of a blow from a new rival than Mr. Bush can. And some analysts say that Perot II could turn out to be another dance with television cameras that produces protest voting, but only marginal electoral impact.
 
Powerful Forces at Work
 Some political professionals are beginning to wonder whether the economic and political forces now working against Mr. Bush are largely beyond the influence of strategy, tactics and strange turns in the campaign plot like the re-entry of Mr. Perot.
"This election is being driven by the continuing pessimism about the economy and a rejection of George Bush as leader," said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, the research center in Washington.
Representative Vin Weber, a Minnesota Republican who is a co-chairman of the Bush campaign, said: "It's still clearly uphill. I think the campaign has gotten its act together over the past few weeks in terms of getting out a consistent economic message, but we still have a heavy burden of proof in a change-oriented environment."
Mr. Bush's team has become painfully aware of the clock. James A. Baker 3d, viewed this summer as the savior just off stage, has been in the White House for a month. His team has honed Mr. Bush's economic message, mounted a new attack on his rival and tried, repeatedly, to seize control of this race. But Mr. Bush has made little if any progress in the polls in recent weeks.
A poll made public today by Time magazine and CNN showed Mr. Clinton with 49 percent of the likely voters and Mr. Bush with 37 percent, a Democratic lead that had grown from 6 percentage points a month ago. In a three-way race, Mr. Clinton would draw 43 percent, Mr. Bush 32 percent and Mr. Perot 17 percent.
Those figures would change if Mr. Perot formally entered the contest, as would those of another new one by Newsweek that showed Mr. Clinton leading by 10 points in a two-way race and a nine points in a three-way race.
Still, while Washington is a city quick to draw conclusions and hang crepe on the basis of polling, Peter Hart, the Democratic poll taker, notes that this Presidential election has transformed itself in 40 days before: Patrick J. Buchanan rose and fell, Mr. Clinton went from a bleeding nominee to a formidable front-runner and Mr. Perot soared, crashed and burned in about the same time. "I think the idea that we've seen the last card played is very misleading," Mr. Hart said.
This week, the Bush camp clearly entered what politicians delicately describe as "the hard contrast" phase of its campaign: it intensified its assault on Mr. Clinton's record and character with a new television commercial attacking him as a taxer and spender, and with biting new speeches from the President himself.
Some Republicans grumbled, privately, that the Baker team had waited too long to pull the trigger, but campaign officials said Mr. Bush first needed to make a positive case for his re-election. Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush camp, indicated that the campaign had high hopes for its new round of advertising.
"About everything there is to know about Bush is known, in terms of bad things for people to know about him," Mr. Black said. "But people don't know much about Clinton." Asked if Mr. Clinton's draft history would be featured in the new advertising, Mr. Black replied that he would not be surprised if it did.
 
Bush's Strategy on Debates
 Until Bush strategists see some movement in poll results, they are expected to take a hard line on debates; top strategists are said to believe that agreeing to debates would simply freeze the race, while the debate itself could allow Mr. Clinton to "close the sale" with the voters.
The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, is cheered by national and state polls that show him in powerful position to gain the 270 electoral votes he needs to win.
In California, a primary anchor for a Democratic majority this year, Mr. Clinton retains a double-digit poll lead, and a Los Angeles Times survey indicates the margin would be unaffected if Mr. Perot runs. Mr. Clinton holds solid leads across much of the Northeast, according to polls conducted this month and compiled by The Hotline, a political newsletter.
Those polls also show that Mr. Clinton holds significant edges in such traditional swing states as Missouri and Illinois, and is running competitively with Mr. Bush in much of the South, including Florida and Texas.
Clinton aides argue that while Mr. Perot may cut into their margins in many of these states, he would not do so enough to change the outcome. These analysts say Mr. Perot actually helps them in some Southern states, notably North Carolina and Georgia.
Still, Clinton forces are aware that much of their support is soft and subject to erosion from advertising aimed at Mr. Clinton's trustworthiness. This is widely expected to be the primary use of the draft issue against Mr. Clinton, an issue raised anew today by a Los Angeles Times report that a meeting was arranged for him with the head of Selective Service in Arkansas in an attempt to avoid the draft.
The Clinton campaign plans to keep emphasizing the economy and Mr. Bush's record in dealing with it. If Mr. Perot does re-enter the race, Mr. Clinton is expected again to avoid direct attacks on the Texas billionaire, on the ground that Mr. Clinton is the natural inheritor of Mr. Perot's supporters.
The Bush forces attacked Mr. Perot vigorously last spring, and the strategy was widely seen as backfiring. Mr. Clinton is also expected to talk more, in the coming days, about reducing the Federal budget deficit, which was an important issue to Mr. Perot.
"The important thing is that we maintain our focus, that we understand this is not a race about Ross Perot; it's a race about the economy and about change," Mr. Carville said.
Whether either campaign will be able to maintain its focus with a revived Perot campaign is another question. Strategists in both parties throw up their hands when it comes to calculating the Texan's impact.
Political professionals say they expect a Perot campaign, at least initially, to get intensive news coverage, and suggest he could help drive the campaign dialogue. For example, he could make it harder for the Bush campaign to focus its fire on Mr. Clinton. In the past, Mr. Perot has delighted in chiding his rivals for focusing on attacks rather than issues, and he seems to take special delight in chiding Mr. Bush. Mr. Perot could also make it hard for Mr. Bush to continue to resist the bipartisan commission's plan for debates.
But he could also point out the flaws in Mr. Clinton's economics, and muddy Mr. Clinton's claim to be the voice of change and economic responsibility.
Still, a revived Perot campaign would be essentially a symbolic effort, many analysts. As a result, it is unclear how many actual votes it would produce, particularly since the level of enmity seems so high toward him in the aftermath of his on-again, off-again campaign this year. The Time-CNN Poll, for example, found him viewed unfavorably by 46 percent of respondents and favorably by 25 percent.
Mr. Perot is widely expected to have his greatest electoral impact in Texas, a state that Mr. Bush must win.
For now, the two campaigns are simply, warily, waiting for Mr. Perot's announcement of his plans. Until then, one Administration official argued this week, the polls are meaningless, "because you just don't know what people's reactions are going to be."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Again Faces Draft Issue As He Returns to New Hampshire

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Sept. 26

 BODY:
Seven months after a second-place showing in this state's Democratic primary saved him from political destruction, Gov. Bill Clinton returned today, triumphant but still dogged by the same questions that nearly destroyed him in February.
As Mr. Clinton hopscotched through campaign appearances in three New England states today, reporters peppered the Democratic Presidential nominee with questions about how he managed to avoid being inducted by the military during the Vietnam War. 
 The questions that first arose as a campaign issue days before the February primary here and have periodically resurfaced, came up again today in the aftermath of a published account asserting that in the summer of 1969 Mr. Clinton's Army induction notice was canceled after a lobbying effort directed at the head of the Arkansas Selective Service.
But Mr. Clinton stayed at least as much on the offensive as on the defensive today, hitting his opponent hard in speeches in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine and in remarks to reporters.
 
Sharp Attack on Bush
 Responding to charges by President Bush today that Mr. Clinton's economic plan would entail higher taxes for millions of middle-class people and not simply the rich Americans whom Mr. Clinton has said he intends to tax, the Democrat responded sharply.
"He has no credibility on taxes, and he can't even count," Mr. Clinton said. "Everything he says is wrong. He raised taxes on everybody. It's just bull. My plan is out there. It's clear: we ran it with Congressional Budget Office numbers."
The question of Mr. Clinton's draft status arose anew today in an article in The Los Angeles Times that said he had benefited from efforts by a Republican friend seeking to arrange a meeting between him and Col. Willard A. Hawkins, who had been appointed by a Republican governor and was director of the Arkansas Selective Service in 1969.
In the past Mr. Clinton has acknowledged that he cast a wide net in the summer of 1969 looking for a way to escape induction, but he has always said he did not do anything improper or receive any special treatment, aside from what might be expected to be given a Rhodes scholar from small-town Arkansas.
Today, he acknowledged that he might have met with Mr. Hawkins, as The Los Angeles Times article suggested, but that any such meeting, if it did occur, would have been part of routine procedure, suggested to him by the local draft board in Hot Springs.
"They told me what procedures to follow, and I followed their procedures," Mr. Clinton told reporters after a speech here.
He said he had no recollection of meeting with the director of the Arkansas Selective Service, but he added: "That doesn't mean it didn't occur. I mean it could have happened by letter or meeting. I can't say one way or the other, because I don't know for sure."
Whatever he did, Mr. Clinton said repeatedly today, had been at the suggestion of the Hot Springs draft board and was strictly "normal procedure."
The draft questions did not appear to mar the Governor's mood, which was notably upbeat as he spent the day in that most pleasant of political activities, running ahead in places where he had been expected to be behind.
Neither New Hampshire, where Mr. Clinton spoke first, nor Vermont, where he spoke next, had voted for a Democratic Presidential nominee since Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory in 1964. Maine, the third stop on the New England tour, has not gone Democratic since 1968.
This year, Clinton campaign officials say their polls in all three states show their candidate ahead of Mr. Bush.
Perhaps with these figures in mind, Mr. Clinton struck a note of thanks and expectant victory in speeches today.

HEADLINE: Angola to Vote, Unsure About West's Democracy

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, Sept. 26

 BODY:
After nearly three decades of war, economic hardship and political strife, Angolans will go to the polls next week to elect a government freely for the first time. While the election could be viewed as a triumph of democracy, cynicism is widespread.
Many Angolans are not convinced that Western-style democracy can work here. Their doubts have not been lessened by sporadic incidents of violence, much of it stemming from a mix of ethnic differences and old vendettas. 
 The backdrop to the voting is the legacy of a long and brutal civil war in which rebel groups first fought Portuguese rulers and then each other on a cold-war battleground. More than 500,000 Angolans died during a generation of bloodshed, two-thirds of them children, leaving virtually no family untouched. An additional million people, fleeing the fighting, Government confiscations, rebel incursions and the military draft, have simply left the country, much of which is devastated.
 
Luanda in Decay
 The cost of the war is especially conspicuous here in Luanda, a seaside capital once called the Rio of Africa. Signs of decay are everywhere: ruined roads, the stench of uncollected garbage, formerly stately apartment houses and villas sinking into squalor, wretched shanty towns with a deadly lack of sanitation. On many streets, men, women and children maimed in the war can be seen hopping on homemade crutches.
The decision now facing Angolan voters is who should bear the blame for such misery, a judgment that has overshadowed debate about future policies.
Does the fault lie with the governing party, the once avowedly Marxist-Leninist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, which was sustained for years by Soviet arms and Cuban soldiers? Even party officials admit that its economic stewardship has been disastrous since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
Or should the blame fall on its main rival, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, and its leader, Jonas Savimbi? With military and financial support from the United States and South Africa, the group, known as Unita, fought a war that ravaged this country yet, arguably, never seriously challenged the Government's hold on power. With the end of the cold war, Mr. Savimbi signed a peace accord last year with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, paving the way for next week's elections.
Mr. Savimbi, who favors a free-market economy and ties to the West, and Mr. dos Santos, who advocates a largely state-controlled economy, are the most prominent of 13 presidential candidates. If no one receives a majority in the voting Tuesday and Wednesday, in which more than 223 seats in Parliament will also be filled, a runoff election will be held.
Although 400 United Nations monitors will supervise the vote, concerns aroused during the campaign persist.
 
'An Abstract Concept'
 "The average man on the street doesn't know anything about democracy; it's just an abstract concept," said Holden Roberto, a presidential candidate who led the old National Front for the Liberation of Angola, which fought the Portuguese and then the M.P.L.A. with Unita.
"All he knows is what he sees everyday, and that is that the cease-fire hasn't stopped the violence and things are getting worse as the election approaches," he added.
His comments were echoed by Paulinho Fernandes Madeca, the Roman Catholic bishop of Cabinda, Angola's oil-producing enclave.
"The people are full of fear, and a lot of them are leaving their villages because they don't know what will happen during the elections," he said.
Still, if Western-style democracy endures and flourishes, the reward for Angola's 10 million people could be enormous. With such resources as oil, coffee, iron ore, cotton, sisal and diamonds, Angola has exceptional potential. Western experts say that with political stability, the country could become one of the few on the continent to break away from the economic decline seen elsewhere.
 
Reticence on Outcome
 There is a profound uncertainty about the outcome of the elections. Most voters are reluctant to discuss their views, and even the best-informed specialists and experienced diplomats say they are at a loss to forecast the results.
Reports in the Government-controlled news media have made much of the violence that has disrupted some rallies, with rocks, bottles, and, in some cases, bullets aimed at some candidates and their supporters. But the attention given to such incidents tends to overshadow the peace that has prevailed at most of the scores of rallies held since the campaign began in earnest in late August.
Before the cease-fire accords were signed in May 1991, conventional wisdom in Luanda suggested that Unita would be an easy winner against the increasingly divided and dispirited governing party. Pointing to the disciplined Unita organization, toughened by years of guerrilla warfare, diplomats and other foreign experts had spoken almost as if a Savimbi victory was inevitable.
Although nearly 20 mostly centrist parties have emerged, they have largely failed to capture the public's imagination as alternatives to either Unita or the M.P.L.A.
Many political commentators here predict that the most potent element in the elections will be the enduring power of regional and ethnic loyalties. In theory, Mr. Savimbi has a slight edge in this area because his political base, the mostly rural and agrarian central highlands, dominated by his ethnic group the Ovimbundu, forms nearly 40 percent of the population.
 
Support Far From Solid
 The governing party, by contrast, was said to draw most of its support from the much smaller group of mixed-raced Angolans, called mesticos in Portuguese, and to a lesser extent from the Kimbundu people of Luanda and the nearby Cuanza Valley.
But reporters and diplomats who have devoted extensive time and effort to interviewing voters throughout the country have found Mr. Savimbi's support among the Ovimbundu far from solid. And doubts about his candidacy appear to have grown as the election campaign has progressed.
In most instances, the sentiment appears to be directed not so much in favor of the M.P.L.A. or Mr. dos Santos, its longtime leader, but rather against Mr. Savimbi.
Part of Mr. Savimbi's troubles stem from the fact that the Ovimbundu were often victims of Unita's guerrilla tactics, although in most cases unintentionally. Tens of thousands of Ovimbundus, for example, are believed to have been killed or maimed by land mines laid by Unita soldiers. The rebels, however, contend that Government troops and their Cuban allies used mines to punish villages sympathetic to the guerrillas.
 
Accusations on 2 Deaths
 Furthermore, the image that Mr. Savimbi carefully cultivated in some western countries as Angola's great democratic hope has also been tarnished by recent accusations that two popular men who had once been his proteges were put to death last year at his group's headquarters in southeastern Angola. Mr. Savimbi has denied involvement in their deaths while accepting responsibility for whatever abuses may have occurred in the war.
The governing party has been plagued by accusations of financial misconduct by its leaders, a continuing theme in the campaign. It is widely said that while party leaders mouthed slogans about equality and socialism they abused their positions.
Even relatively junior party officials could get tax-free imports, preferential housing and special rights to travel. And while corruption is not thought to have reached the level of plunder attributed to, say, President Mobutu Sese Seko of neighboring Zaire, it has been a liability for Mr. dos Santos.
The subject is so sensitive that even some opposition politicians tend not to make much of the issue in public out of fear of inviting swift retaliation by the authorities. But analysts here say that graft and corruption in this country is believed to have increased sharply in recent months.
While some aides have always been engaged in petty corruption to make ends meet, high-level officials dealing with foreign executives are said to be routinely demanding bribes, buying foreign property and sending money abroad. A piece of graffiti found on walls throughout the city reads:
"The M.P.L.A. steals, Unita kills."

HEADLINE: Prospects Looking Up For 7 Southern Senators

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 26

 BODY:
In the Republican high tide after the Persian Gulf war, all roads to a Republican takeover of the Senate seemed to run through Dixie, where seven Democrats were up for re-election in what looked like a strong Republican year.
Now, the Democrats have a shot at winning them all. 
 The South remains the Republicans' best hope for picking up seats in the Senate, and Democratic Senators in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina are all viewed as vulnerable in a year when anti-incumbent sentiments may prove as potent as the war once seemed.
But one of the most telling signs of how much has changed in the last year and how much has not changed in 12 years of Republican Presidents is the political landscape of the South, where the conservative gains nationally did not produce the Republican gains in the South that many had anticipated.
Back when President Bush's approval ratings were hovering around 90 percent and the war seemed certain to be a dominant issue, Republicans were anticipating dramatic gains.
 
Five Freshmen Senators
 Up for re-election are four Democratic Senators who voted to continue economic sanctions against Iraq rather than authorize force in the Persian Gulf: Terry Sanford of North Carolina, Wyche Fowler Jr. of Georgia, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and Dale Bumpers of Arkansas. Five of the seven up for re-election -- Mr. Fowler, Mr. Sanford, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Graham of Florida -- are freshman.
At the minimum, Mr. Sanford, Mr. Fowler and Mr. Hollings seemed likely losers. "They all looked like dead meat," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic consultant now working for Mr. Sanford.
At most, all seven, perhaps with the exception of Mr. Breaux, were thought to be possible targets for the right challenger.
Since then, Mr. Bush's popularity has plummeted. The war has receded as an issue and been replaced by the economy. The Democratic ticket of Southerners, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, has left Southern Democrats more energized than in any race since 1980.
And the Republicans repeatedly failed to get their strongest candidates, like Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, Gov. James G. Martin of North Carolina and a former Georgia candidate for governor, Johnny Isakson, to run. Nothing came of the Republican hope of getting the Gulf war hero, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, to run against the popular Mr. Graham in Florida.
The Democrats are now considered safe in Arkansas, Louisiana, Florida and Alabama. But political analysts say the races in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina could all be highly competitive.
In some ways, the dynamic is similar in each race: an incumbent with some clear vulnerabilities fighting an anti-incumbent tide.
"In almost all the state races I can think of this year, if it was close, the incumbents lost," Mr. Campbell said.
Recent independent polls in the three races show the incumbents leading, but within reach. The most endangered may be Mr. Sanford, who is now a 75-year-old freshman Senator.
With the Gulf war vote no longer a prominent issue, Mr. Sanford's experience as a World War II paratrooper may balance out his vote. But his relatively liberal voting record and what is viewed as an uneven first term make him vulnerable.
Mr. Sanford fought off health problems over the summer. And he may be the only one of the three incumbents to be outspent by his rival, Lauch (pronounced lock) Faircloth, a former Democrat who is backed by the potent conservation organization, the National Congressional Club, allied with Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina.
 
Ticket Helps Democrats
 On the other hand, Mr. Faircloth, who ran unsuccessfully for Governor in 1984, does not have nearly the heft as a candidate that Governor Martin would have had. And for the first time since 1976, Democrats could actually be helped by the top of the ticket rather than dragged down by it the way they were in 1980.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas recently campaigned in South Carolina and proclaimed the state the Republicans' best chance to beat an incumbent. And Mr. Hollings, a prickly 26-year incumbent, may be just the kind of candidate whom voters may turn on this year, particularly in perhaps the most Republican state in the South.
But Mr. Hollings has strong ties to the usually Republican textile belt around Greenville, a big fund-raising edge and an opponent, Tommy Hartnett, who is a veteran politician without much outsider appeal. He lost his last race, a bid for lieutenant governor.
The nastiest race may come in Georgia, where Paul Coverdell, a Republican, is already trying to make an issue of whether Mr. Fowler overdrew his account at the now-defunct House bank when he was in Congress. Mr. Fowler's camp is likely to make an issue of Mr. Coverdell's tenure as head of the Peace Corps, where he was accused of using the office to plot his political future in Georgia.
Mr. Fowler's relatively liberal voting record makes him a target. But it is not yet clear if Mr. Coverdell will raise the money needed to stay competitive. And some Republicans fear that Mr. Coverdell simply does not have the personal presence to make the case against Mr. Fowler.
In fact, though Mr. Sanford, Mr. Hollings and Mr. Fowler could end up falling to an anti-incumbent mood, the Democratic incumbents may also symbolize the success of the Democrats in holding off the Republican tide in a decade when the Democrats won only one state, Georgia, in a Presidential election from 1980 to 1988.
Merle Black, a professor of politics and government at Emory University, said that despite the conservative politics of the region, the Democrats have prospered by fielding savvy, pragmatic political moderates while the Republicans have tended toward ideologues like the four Senate Republican victors in 1980: Mack Mattingly in Georgia, Jeremiah Denton in Alabama, John East in North Carolina and Paula Hawkins in Florida.
Many observers think at least one of the incumbents is likely to lose, but absent an effective negative campaign by the Republicans, said Mr. Black, the traditional Democratic strengths could work this year for Mr. Sanford, Mr. Fowler and Mr. Hollings.
"The Democrats have usually positioned themselves as moderates blending liberal and conservative positions in a way that can attract white swing voters and put together a majority, while the Republicans get only the white conservatives, and that's not enough," Mr. Black said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Georgians Illustrate Why What Worked for Bush in '88 Doesn't Work in '92

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTELL, Ga., Sept. 25

 BODY:
Frank Ellis is the kind of voter who could short out a political consultant's computer programs: a conservative, anti-abortion, 53-year-old white Southerner who has voted for the Republican candidates Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan and the Democrats Jimmy Carter and Michael S. Dukakis.
This year, though he likes what the Republicans say about family values and is uneasy with Bill Clinton's draft record, he is firmly in the Clinton camp. 
 "I'm opposed to abortion, and I agree with Quayle on Murphy Brown, but that's not what the election's about," he said over lunch at Dolly's Farmhouse Restaurant here. "I think people are a little bit more sophisticated than they used to be. They care about the economy. They don't go for all that other junk anymore."
 
Contrast With '88 Race
 Voters like Mr. Ellis may go a long way toward explaining why, despite several weeks of the kind of harsh, value-laden attacks on Mr. Clinton that dismantled Mr. Dukakis four years ago, President Bush remains stalled well behind Mr. Clinton in the polls.
There are any number of differences between 1988 and 1992, from the dismal economy to the chasm in political savvy between Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Clinton. And it is unclear how issues like Mr. Clinton's draft history will play out in the campaign's remaining five weeks. But interviews with dozens of voters in suburban south and southwest Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, an area that leans Republican but is also home to many of the Reagan Democrats both sides are courting, bring out two major reasons why what worked in 1988 is not working now.
The first is the degree to which the economy dominates the race. The second is the way an electorate that is in parts more jaded, more sophisticated and more cynical about politics seems far more resistant to the kind of emotion-laden political gambits that have worked for Republicans in the past.
"I think that in February or March of last year, something clicked in with the American public, where they said, we're sick of the scandal of the week, that unless it's something of cataclysmic proportions, we don't give a damn about it," said Matt Towery, a Republican running unopposed for state representative whose district includes part of South Cobb County. "They're just concerned about the economy."
The interviews also elicited the widespread sense of unhappiness with both candidates that has pervaded the political year and that offers the potential for Ross Perot to play a significant role if he gets back in the race. Less clear is which candidate he would hurt.
As a second alternative for change, he could take votes from Mr. Clinton. But, here at least, it may be just as likely that he could take votes from Mr. Bush by providing an option for voters who want action on the economy but do not trust the Democrats to provide it.
It is clear that one reason the Republican strategy has not worked is that in its rawest form, like the speeches of Patrick J. Buchanan and the Rev. Pat Robertson at the Republican Convention, it may not have been as much in touch with the values of the electorate as Republicans thought.
But in this conservative area, where the bumper stickers on mini-vans in mall parking lots tend toward things like "Life is Fragile: Handle with Prayer," it is not hard to find people who like what they hear from the Republicans and do not like what they know about Bill Clinton and the draft.
"It's a moral issue," said Mary Hernandez, a retired civil servant. "I think Bush has higher morals than the other one. The problem is sinners are more popular than Christians."
But almost everyone who mentioned family values and the draft issue as reasons for voting for Mr. Bush planned to vote Republican anyway.
Frances Zieman, 43, a legal secretary who plans to vote for Mr. Clinton, said: "You think of the flag thing four years ago; what kind of issue is that? It's a different world than it was four years ago. I don't think those things work anymore."
Family values has fallen out of the Republican playbook, but the draft issue clearly carries weight with many voters.
"If someone didn't want to fight for his country, how is he going to lead it?" asked Glenn Neumann, 47, a shop foreman from nearby Powder Springs. But he says he will probably vote for Ross Perot if he runs. If Mr. Perot does not, he will vote for Mr. Clinton. "I can't vote for Bush," he said. "He's been in there for 12 years and hasn't done anything."
On the other hand, the draft seems to have limited appeal to women and to many younger voters.
"I couldn't care less about it," said Tom Foster, a 29-year-old sales manager who says he is undecided.
In fact, if there is a value question that really sticks with many of these suburban voters, it is the economic abilities of the Democratic Party.
"I don't see how any intelligent person who cares about his job can vote for a Democrat for President," said Franklin Burton, 36, a contractor.
It is clear that even if the particulars are not critical, the combination of doubts about the Democrats and the questions raised about Mr. Clinton work together to turn off many voters who do not want to vote for Mr. Bush.
Still, some wonder where voters will go if Mr. Perot enters the race. The Texan will surely siphon off some Clinton votes as an alternative for people who want change. But he also appeals to conservative voters focused on the economy, like Maria Perrucci, 39, who owns a yogurt shop here, and Jill Buhler, 34, a homemaker from nearby Marietta, who would otherwise vote for Mr. Bush.
"I want a businessman in there," Mrs. Buhler said. "I don't care for Clinton's ideas, and I don't think Bush has any."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Says Clinton's Plan to Tax the Rich Will Be Costly for the Middle Class

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Ohio, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Striving to win back disgruntled middle-class voters, President Bush said today that Gov. Bill Clinton's economic proposals would hurt the middle-class taxpayers that the Democratic challenger has pledged to help.
White House officials produced new economic estimates that they said demonstrate that Mr. Clinton's plan to raise the taxes of the top 2 percent of the nation's earners would actually cost a couple with a gross income of $85,000 about $2,800 a year in higher taxes. 
 "That is the big secret of this campaign," Mr. Bush said, standing on the bunting-draped rear platform of a train that stopped in four Ohio towns today. "To capture all the revenue that he wants to raise, to pay for all these promises, Bill Clinton will have to go after the middle class. I am not going to let him do that, and neither are you."
President Bush offered his harsh, new critique as he began a two-day train trip through Ohio and Michigan, two states that have been hit hard by the recession and that will be crucial to his re-election hopes in November.
The 19-passenger car train traveled along rivers and past harvested corn fields, followed a path through some of the most solidly Republican counties in the state, where unemployment rates are generally low.
The Bush campaign estimated that Mr. Clinton's tax-increase plan would affect about nine million people, or 8 percent of all taxpayers.
 
Budget Office Calculations
 Mr. Bush argued vigorously that Mr. Clinton was reaching into the pockets of the middle class to earn $150 billion in new revenues. But an official who briefed reporters on the train about the estimates provided by the Office of Management and Budget would not say whether they considered these high earners to be part of the middle class.
Gene Sperling, the Clinton campaign's economics adviser, said the Bush campaign was distorting the Democrat's plan. The 2 percent figure, he said, was shorthand for what Mr. Clinton really intends, which is to raise taxes only on those people who earn $200,000 or more a year.
And the tax burden on the middle class, he said, would still be eased by allowing taxpayers to choose between increasing the deductions they are allowed for children and across-the-board tax relief.
In Washington, an economist with Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation noted that it was difficult to pin down the top 2 percent, but said the figure fell between Mr. Clinton's and Mr. Bush's notions, at about $155,000. This figure was based on report by the Internal Revenue Service this spring.
Mr. Clinton's plan, the President said, also overestimates the money it would save from proposals like taxing foreign companies. One such company, Honda, has an automotive assembly plant that employs 10,000 people in Marysville, Ohio, Mr. Bush's first stop of the day.
"Now, you slap a tax on Honda, and they'll take the jobs and go somewhere else," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Sperling responded that forcing foreign companies to pay corporate income taxes on all their earnings in the United States would only help keep American jobs. "We believe that good foreign companies pay their fair share of taxes," he said.
The Bush campaign also said that Mr. Clinton's proposal was too optimistic in the growth it projects for the American economy and the programs it promises to create.
The Administration official who briefed reporters said that each time Arkansas ran short of money, Governor Clinton had tapped the middle class, "because that's where the money is."
Energized by the new line of attack and warming to his appeal to average Americans, Mr. Bush used a variation on a line from a country music song that Mr. Clinton has often used to accuse the President of being out of touch.
"We've heard that song before," he said. "Jimmy Carter sang it. Walter Mondale sang it. Michael Dukakis sang it, and they're going after the rich, but the middle class always gets up singing the blues. Big government gets the gold and you get the shaft."
 
Recurring Complaint
 Mr. Bush also renewed a recurring complaint about Mr. Clinton's economic plan, asserting that the plan proposed programs without explaining how they would be financed. The budget cuts that Mr. Clinton has suggested to help reduce the deficit, the President said, are not realistic and represent $242 billion in spending cuts that cannot be achieved.
Mr. Bush criticized Mr. Clinton and his proposals at every stop along the train tour today.
"We must not take a risk about this economy," he said, stating that Mr. Clinton raised taxes in Arkansas and comparing him to a former Governor of another Southern state. "Our economy could slide into a disaster if we go back to the misery days of Jimmy Carter, if we make the wrong choice."
The White House said the trip was patterned after a similar journey made by President Reagan from Dayton to Perrysburg, Ohio, in 1984. But Mr. Bush, who was accompanied by his wife, Barbara, also backhandedly acknowledged the success of the Democrats' bus tours.
"For four months another candidate for President has been tearing down the United States of America, running the country down," Mr. Bush said in Columbus. "Maybe he's inhaling too many of those bus fumes. I think he did inhale them.
"Well let's get that bus off the side of the road. Because on this train trip we're going to blow the whistle on Governor Clinton. I am tired of his lousy record in Arkansas."

HEADLINE: Top Police Ranks Reach Labor Accord

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration has reached a new labor agreement with representatives of the 8,500 captains, lieutenants, sergeants and detectives in the New York City Police Department who had been working without a contract for more than two years, the city announced yesterday.
The agreement, which still has to be approved by the membership of the Superior Officers Council, covers the next 15 months and is retroactive to June 3, 1990, when the last contract expired. The agreement provides for an immediate 3.5 percent increase in salary and a 1 percent increase at the end of the first year, as well as a welfare fund increase of $100 and other benefits. 
 The contract mirrors a settlement reached last year with the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. A statement released by Mayor David N. Dinkins's office said the agreement was "consistent with those reached with other uniform and civilian employees."
The contract will be financed through city funds set aside for it, the Mayor's office said.
The Superior Officers Council is a coalition of four bargaining units. Joseph V. Toal, president of the Sergeants' Benevolent Association, said that with the "difficult economy," he was happy with the agreement.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ross Perot;
Perot's Summer Followers Stir Again, Warily

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 26

 BODY:
If Ross Perot does as he has hinted and re-enters the Presidential race, the breadth of his influence will depend on whether he can win back the supporters who lost faith in him when he dropped out in July.
Some are undoubtedly lost forever. Others, like 35-year-old Nancy Wilder of Chicago, say they will listen to him again, but with much more skepticism. 
 Ms. Wilder, a lawyer in the Cook County Prosecutor's Office, said she had previously considered voting for Mr. Perot because she believed that the other candidates were not addressing the problems of the inner cities. And while she now said she would be willing to take another look at him, her view is colored by Mr. Perot's earlier defection.
 
High Negative Rating
 "I was disappointed when he dropped out and curious as to why he did it," Ms. Wilder said. "But I never got an answer that satisfied me. If he couldn't explain dropping out, how does he explain coming back in?"
Recent polls and interviews with former Perot supporters around the country show that the Texan's abrupt withdrawal on July 16 shattered the bond of trust he had built with voters dissatisfied with the candidates of the two major parties. For the billionaire to again be a serious contender for the White House, he must reforge that link.
A poll by CBS News this week illustrates the scope of Mr. Perot's challenge. The national telephone survey of 1,757 registered voters found that 47 percent had an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Perot, a higher number than the unfavorable rating for either President Bush or Gov. Bill Clinton. The poll was conducted Tuesday through Thursday, just after Mr. Perot said in a television interview that his decision to quit the campaign was a "mistake." The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points.
In a campaign year when the question of trust has been an overarching theme, Mr. Perot's abandonment of his crusade this summer could greatly hinder his ability to play a role in the Presidential race, as a candidate, kingmaker or pacesetter on the economic debate. The grass-roots effort that put his name on 25 state ballots before he left the race was built as much around his personality as it was fueled by dissatisfaction with the current crop of politicians. As a flawed prophet, Mr. Perot now seems to have mostly alienation to power his movement.
In recent interviews even those who said they would still vote for Mr. Perot added that their enthusiasm for him had been diminished by his defection. Mr. Perot had been a refreshing breeze, a man of candor who was a sharp contrast to the typical dissembling candidate, they said. Now, he seemed just another politician.
"As a Republican I believed Bush when he said, 'Read my lips, no new taxes,' " said Diane Rees, a 53-year-old Boulder, Colo., lobbyist was spokeswoman for the Perot Petition Committee in her state. "Then subsequently I believed Perot's pledge that if we got him on the ballot in all 50 states he would run a first-class campaign. Then I believed him when he said was getting out. Although I feel I'm politically sophisticated, my ability to be fooled is undiminished."
To be sure, there is a strong desire for Mr. Perot's return among some who still cannot stomach either Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton. That Mr. Perot's resolve seemed to have wilted under partisan criticism and press scrutiny matters less to these backers than their displeasure with the major-party candidates and the Presidential campaign's level of discourse.
"My opinion of him dropped considerably," said William Flower, the 36-year-old owner of a steel-processing business in Athens, Ala. "It's kind of an easy thing for him do. He can drop in and drop out whenever he wants to. But I would still vote for him, even though I still question his electability."
Timothy Murphy, 41, a Fargo, N.D., businessman who was his state's coordinator for the Perot campaign, agreed, saying: "I think he is a half-pint vessel. But I am so tired of Murphy Brown and Bill Clinton's draft record. I cannot believe the level this campaign has fallen to."
 
Feeling Like a Jilted Lover
 But other former Perot backers said they would never reconsider him. Jennifer Laszlo, 28, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the Presidential campaigns of Boris Yeltsin in Russia and Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia, saw Mr. Perot as a bold reformer, challenging a tired and ineffective government, but not any more.
"I think he's lost credibility," said Ms. Laszlo, a Washington resident who for a short time trained volunteers in the Dallas headquarters of Mr. Perot's petition committee. "I think the people who really cared about him and got excited about politics, maybe for the first time, were disappointed. They're like a jilted lover."
Donna Willard, 41, of New Britain, Pa., did not sign a petition for Mr. Perot, but said she would have if someone had asked. Ms. Willard, who works out of her home selling hand-painted light-switch plates and splash boards for sinks, said she would still consider him for President, though with a more critical eye.
"I really try to think of myself as an open-minded person, so I would like to hear what he has to say and have others dispute him and give their reasons why," she said. "But it's not a great thing for a President to say, 'It's not real good. I'm out of here."

HEADLINE: TEACHERS REACH PACT IN DETROIT

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Administrators and teachers reached agreement this afternoon on a two-year contract, signaling the end of a strike that has closed the nation's seventh-largest school system for 26 days. But the contract carries bitter medicine: layoffs and budget cuts are necessary to offset a wage increase, and that is likely to fuel more anger among parents and students.
The contract, which appeared to settle the largest of several teacher strikes across the country this fall, will be voted on next week by the 10,500-member Detroit Federation of Teachers. The teachers are expected to vote Sunday to go back to work, paving the way for them to return Monday and for the city's 168,000 students to start classes on Tuesday. 
 The agreement calls for a raise of 4 percent in the first year and 3 percent in the second year; more textbooks for grades one through five, and a management team to study class reduction over the next year.
As the strike dragged on this month, teachers and school officials came under biting criticism from students and working parents, many of whom scrambled to find alternatives. "I'm mad at the teachers," said Venus McCrary, a single unemployed mother of two daughters in elementary school, whom she took with her on job interviews and to night school classes. "Why couldn't they take care of this in the summer?"
 
Grim Relations All Over
 Experts say the Detroit strike is indicative of the grim relations between teachers and school boards in many places. While the number of teacher strikes this fall is lower than in past years, the number of teachers working without contracts is higher.
School boards have been taking a harder line with teachers, partly because of economic constraints and partly because the public is demanding that school officials hold teachers to higher standards. Both undercurrents have been played out in Detroit.
If approved as written, the contract will require the school district to make cuts in its $1 billion budget to offset the pay increases. It is likely to force the layoffs of up to 250 members of the teachers' union, which also includes nonteaching personnel.
"We always said a contract with a more than 2 percent pay increase would require cuts," said Deborah M. McGriff, the Superintendent of Schools. "People shouldn't be surprised."
The teachers had wanted a 6 percent increase, while the 11-member Board of Education proposed 2 percent. Detroit teachers earn an average of $42,000 a year, as against $36,650 for teachers in other large urban districts. The United States average is $33,015.
The union also demanded that classes be reduced by an average of one student every year for the next decade, from the current averages of 34 in the lower grades and 35 in grades 5 through 12. That would involve hiring 90 to 115 new teachers a year, the union said, but administrators said the proposal would be too expensive. The parties compromised with an agreement to study the issue.
Ms. McGriff said a committee would be appointed to study where to make budget cuts. This is not likely to please parents or students already dismayed by the disruptions caused by the monthlong strike.
"Teachers are messing up our last year," said Yevrah Billingsley, 16 years old, a senior at Finney High School, adding that "I don't know where to go" to take the college entrance exams and find college financial aid information.
 
Lessons by Phone
 During part of the strike, the school system agreed to open six schools throughout the district. The schools, staffed by volunteers and retired teachers, served 600 to 700 students, according to the district. For its part, the teachers' union initiated a "Learning Line," on which students could dial a phone number to hear an abbreviated lesson. A lesson on Friday, for example, was about autumn and why leaves turn colors.
But most students and parents found themselves with few options. "I have been trying to think of things for my kids to do," said Ms. McCrary. She said she was occupying her daughters, 8-year-old Yolanda and 6-year-old Deandrea, with arts and crafts activities, but worried that Yolanda would fall behind in classes.
"The strike," she said with a sigh, "has been too much on parents."
Yolanda added: "I wish I was in school. I'm ready to go."
Some parents even tried to enroll their children illegally in suburban districts by lying about their addresses. Dr. Ken Siver, a spokesman for the nearby Southfield Public Schools, said 10 to 20 students were trying to enroll each week.
"Some had an angle," said Dr. Siver: they would tell school officials they had just moved into the district and didn't yet have documentation of their residence. "But some were honest about what they were doing," he went on, "and we had to turn them away."

HEADLINE: Republicans May Be Losing Hold On Suburbs in New York Region

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DARIEN, Conn., Sept. 24

 BODY:
For more than 20 years and through five Presidential elections, national Republican candidates have cinched up New York City's suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut as securely as any state in the South or the West -- a sort of miniature electoral lock in the heart of the supposedly liberal Northeast.
In places like this community in southern Fairfield County, Connecticut, and in the affluent commuter suburbs in Bergen and parts of other northern New Jersey counties, Republican voters provided the margin of victory, and the financial contributions that helped to cancel out large areas in the two states where Democrats still did well. 
 But in 1992, political experts and members of both parties say, the Republican grip in the region surrounding the nation's largest city has been loosened, mainly by a recession that has battered the white-collar suburbs as never before. As a result, President Bush could find himself in trouble in two states that have been in the Republican column since the election of Richard M. Nixon.
It is not, the experts say, that Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger, could actually expect to win in places like Darien, where even Franklin D. Roosevelt at the height of his popularity lost badly, but rather that Mr. Bush simply might not do quite as well as he did in 1988 in the places where he must do very well.
Although the Electoral College vote in Connecticut and New Jersey -- 23 -- is a small slice of the 270 needed to win, the battle for the suburbs surrounding New York City is likely to be reflected in similar places throughout the country -- from the suburbs of Chicago to the sprawling counties outside Atlanta. In regions like these, voters for the last two decades formed a major part of the coalition that Republicans forged to tap middle-class resentment against the programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society.
Ross Perot in 1992 has been able to tap resentment toward the Bush Administration's handling of the recession and the Federal budget deficit, and when he dropped out, Mr. Clinton appeared to benefit as the remaining challenger. The signs by Mr. Perot that he might re-enter the Presidential race could complicate matters for both parties.
Driven by these new realities, Mr. Bush has been to New Jersey three times just since the Republican Convention, and campaign officials promise at least three or four more campaign trips there before Election Day. Mr. Clinton hit the suburbs twice this week alone. He chose New Jersey for a major speech on health care on Thursday and Hartford for an address on economics on Friday.
"Bush will win here -- the relevant question is how big he'll win," said State Representative Reginald L. Jones, a Republican who represents Darien in the Connecticut General Assembly. "A loss of support for Bush in the more affluent suburbs of Fairfield County could be enough to give Governor Clinton our eight electoral votes."
All across the region, local Republican leaders speak in similar tones.
"To deliver New Jersey, Bush has to deliver Bergen County -- and he will," said John A. Schepisi, the county's Republican Party chairman, who conceded that some voters had been lost. Noting that Mr. Bush had visited the county during the summer, he said, "One more visit by Bush, which I am anticipating, will solidify Bergen County as a Republican bloc vote for the President. I have personally written to the President advising him that it is necessary."
People in both parties say Mr. Clinton has a commanding lead in New York State, while public-opinion polls show closer margins elsewhere in the region. A poll released this week by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University showed Mr. Clinton with a 13 percent lead in New Jersey. The University of Connecticut's latest poll, earlier this month, showed the race as essentially a dead heat in this state.
 
A Different World
 What has happened across this region since 1988 is that the Republican prosperity is simply gone -- erased by a recession that has swept away more than 140,000 white-collar service-producing jobs in New Jersey alone, with three-quarters of those losses concentrated in the northern part of the state, according to state and Federal figures.
Also cutting into Mr. Bush's support is the defection of Republicans who are mostly moderate on social issues. They have deserted the President following recent Supreme Court decisions supporting state laws that restricted access to abortions and in response to what they felt was a strident emphasis on narrowly defined family values at the party's convention.
And party identifications have continued to weaken as well, or have been turned upside down entirely. Here in Darien, for example, the race for the state legislature is between two Republicans: one candidate, Sally Bolster, has repudiated Mr. Bush and is running on the Democratic line and as the endorsed representative of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker's new third party, called A Connecticut Party. The other candidate is Mr. Jones, who supports the President.
But political scientists say that a deeper and sometimes hidden aspect of the suburban collective psyche has not come into play. In 1988, the Republicans portrayed the Democratic candidate, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, as a candidate whose natural constituencies were in the very urban centers that many in the suburbs have moved to get away from, according to Cliff Zukin, a professor of political science at Rutgers University.
That deep -- and in some cases racially influenced -- fear that some suburbanites feel about New York City as a symbol of blight and liberal programs run amok provided a wealth of Republican votes.
This year, in campaigning in New Jersey and around the country, Professor Zukin said, Mr. Clinton has avoided being pinned down as "urban" by using a few set phrases near the top of most of his speeches -- that he is against handouts and wants to foster self-sufficiency.
Yet there clearly have been some fundamental changes in the New York City region since the last Presidential cycle that go beyond perception. Since February 1989, about 10 percent of all the jobs in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in New York simply disappeared, according to figures from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. New Jersey lost 319,000 jobs; Connecticut lost more than 180,000 jobs as banks and insurance companies and real-estate companies contracted or collapsed. While the jobs are gone, many of the people who held them remain, and remain angry at the Administration.
Until last year, for instance, here in Darien, Tami Green and her husband, Bob, always disagreed over politics. She's a Democrat, he's a Republican. Then he lost his job as a vice president at Equitable Life Assurance Society in Manhattan. After a year he has still not found a new job. He's voting for Mr. Clinton.
"It's a whole new world," said Ms. Bolster, the Republican running here as a Democrat. "White-collar unemployment is a phenomenon this country has never experienced before."
But the race is clearly by no means over. To the extent that the Bush campaign can convince Republicans who remain faithful here and in New Jersey that the gap can be closed with Mr. Clinton, local politicians say, Bush supporters will be inspired to turn out in larger numbers.
The administration has also recently announced several long-delayed major military contracts and development plans that would benefit communities or companies in the two states. Earlier this week, Mr. Bush suggested turning Fort Dix in central New Jersey -- which at one point was scheduled for closing -- into a training camp for United Nations peacekeeping forces. In Connecticut, Pratt & Whitney, the jet-engine maker, got a $740 million contract for jet engines, and Sikorsky Aircraft, a helicopter maker near Bridgeport, was told to begin negotiating for a sale of helicopters to Turkey.
And political experts also generally agree that since Mr. Clinton got the largest share of new support when Ross Perot dropped out of the race during the summer, he would conversely be expected to lose more than Mr. Bush would of the people who might go back to Mr. Perot, who will be on the ballot in both states.
"If he enters the race -- Zoom! I'm getting involved again and supporting him," said Jim Maser, a resident of Milford, Conn., who said he likes Mr. Perot "because he's a strong man, and he's got new ideas."
But Mr. Maser's comments, offered at an interview at Olympic Donuts, drew an immediate response from a friend across the table, Burt Monroe. "I just couldn't vote for Perot after he dropped out. So I'll have to go with Clinton," Mr. Monroe said. "The economy is killing the people around here -- we need someone new."

HEADLINE: Small Airports: Convenience and Limits

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW WINDSOR, N.Y.

 BODY:
Joseph and Molly Malak were tired of driving from Cleveland to visit their son in Hyde Park. But they hate to fly into La Guardia or Newark International, which they say are "too hectic and too congested." So on a recent trip they flew here to Stewart International Airport, the New York metropolitan region's newest commercial airport and one of a half-dozen suburban and exurban airports attracting passengers from Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark International Airports.
While the New York region's three major airports have reached the saturation point, with a combined total of nearly 70 million passengers and a million flights a year, midsized "reliever airports," like Stewart, Long Island-MacArthur in Islip, L.I., and Westchester County in White Plains, continue to grow. And smaller airports like Atlantic City's and Bridgeport's are expanding also. 
 With the smaller airports offering daily flights to most East Coast cities and hub airports for virtually all major airlines, suburbanites are discovering that -- instead of two hours in traffic, $15 a day for parking and interminable runway delays -- they can fly without ever going to New York City or Newark.
The smaller airports offer convenient location but limited commercial service compared to the bigger airports. The smaller airports usually are served by a few smaller jets like 737's, and most of the commercial flights are on turboprops seating about 30 to 50 passengers. Most of the flights at these airports still involve corporate and private planes.
 
'Lot More Civilized'
 "In the past, I'd always fly out of Kennedy, but it would take two hours just to get there," said Lisa Savino, of Brewster, N.Y., who flew to California from Stewart on a United Airlines flight. "This is half an hour from where I live and it's a lot more civilized."
Mariette Reed, who has used smaller airports like Mercer County near her home in Princeton, N.J., said: "It's lovely. Everyone is pleasant and it's amazing to be able to walk comfortably from long-term parking to the terminal."
The rate of growth at the smaller airports is evident in such incongruous scenes as 737's sidling up to the Quonset hut-style terminal at Westchester County Airport, whose tiny waiting area is a solid mass of people during the morning and evening rush.
The increase in use has been particularly striking at MacArthur, where 1.2 million passengers departed last year, up from 257,500 in 1982, said Lee Rosche, the airport's assistant manager. Two years ago, two new concourses were added and jet bridges were introduced, allowing passengers to board without walking across the tarmac, signaled the airport's coming of age.
Among the airlines serving MacArthur are American and USAir, as well as regional commuter carriers owned by major airlines like Delta's Business Express, United Express, Northwest Airlink and Continental Express. A new carrier, Carnival Airlines, is to begin flights to Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Fla., in December.
The boom is, in part, a ripple effect of airline deregulation in 1978, which led to a doubling of passenger travel in the early 1980's, clogging most major airports. But it is also a function of population growth and the changing character of suburban and exurban areas like Suffolk County.
"Suffolk's growth has been phenomenal in the last decade, but like much of Long Island, it's no longer a bedroom community for New York," Mr. Rosche said. This is reflected in the airport's many business travelers, who use it to fly to places like Chicago, Washington, Boston and Raleigh-Durham.
Stewart has had even more striking growth since the former Air Force base opened for commercial use in 1990. Starting with 12 daily flights, the airport's service has expanded to 80 daily flights, which may push its total passenger count to nearly 1 million this year, said Judy Eurich, an airport spokeswoman. A sleek new terminal, which has seven airline counters and car-rental desks, is to be supplemented by a $6 million terminal, with construction to begin next spring.
At Atlantic City International Airport, the number of passengers has tripled, to 740,000, in the last six years. And United Express and TWA Express began flights to Washington and New York this summer. With a $2.5 million refurbishing completed in 1989 and plans under way to expand the terminal and to build a parking garage, the airport has begun to attract more than just gamblers.
"As service has increased, we see more local people from South Jersey who might have gone to Newark or Philadelphia before," said Kevin Willis, the airport's manager. The lure, he added, is not only free parking but also flights by USAir -- which began jet service at Atlantic City in 1988 -- and United to their hubs, which have made it easy for passengers to fly to distant destinations.
And Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Bridgeport has had more traffic, as Business Express, USAir and Continental Express offer 27 daily flights to places like Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and Newark.
But, while deregulation, demographics and the appeal of convenience and civility have led to growth, that growth has led to complaints of noise from people who live near those once-sleepy airfields. This has been especially true of Westchester County Airport, where the number of annual passengers increased to 750,000 last year from 400,000 in 1985.
"In the 1980's, the surrounding community's awareness of the noise increased considerably," said Roland Reisley, of Pleasantville, N.Y. "Now, if you open your doors on a slightly overcast Friday evening when they fly low, you hear them thundering past, one after the other."
Richard Aarons, the editor in chief of Business & Commercial Aviation magazine, expressed the fundamental ambivalence of those who are both airport neighbors and potential users: "People don't like airports in their backyard any more than they like landfills. Yet, everyone wants to live within 20 minutes of an airport."
Perhaps the greatest frustration is at Danbury Municipal Airport, where $13 million has been spent over the last decade to upgrade the runways and terminal, and where about 900 private planes take off on Saturdays, but which has no airline service.
"It's a little tiring, hearing the airlines' excuses why they don't come," said Paul Estefan, the airport's administrator. "They say our runways are too short, the weather conditions aren't good or that they've already published their new schedules and can't add us."
But if the recession ever ends, even Danbury may be in luck.
"When the economy picks up, there will be a strong demand for these Northeastern airports because the big airports are landlocked and can't expand," said Paul Bollinger, a senior vice president of the Airports Association Council International, a trade association representing some 700 airports. "If there's demand for increased air traffic, airlines will have to look to other facilities."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Welcome to the Major Leagues, Bud Selig Presiding

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Sept. 25

 BODY:
"Your chancellorship, how are you?" an old friend asked Allan H. (Bud) Selig, the slight, bespectacled and blue-blazered fellow standing in bas-relief in front of a big, bright abstract painting in the Milwaukee art museum.
"Hello, Ed," said Selig, with a faint smile. Selig, the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team, had recently been given a new title in baseball. But "chancellorship" it was not. 
 "Mr. Selig," said another man, another old friend. "I guess I may call you that now."
"You certainly may," said Selig. Then, to a companion at his side: "Oh, the rips a guy's gotta endure."
Selig has been portrayed recently as more ripper than ripped in the wake of the de facto firing of Fay Vincent as commissioner. "Some writers called it a beer-hall putsch," said Selig. "And some said I was the ringleader. It was nothing of the sort. I had talked with Fay for hours and hours about our dissatisfactions. So it was no sudden thing. And I was just one of the group, even though I probably made more phone calls than anyone else."
"Buddy," said a smartly dressed woman named Bonnie, who came by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres in her role as museum volunteer, "are they paying you to be the new commissioner of baseball?"
"I'm not the commissioner," he answered. "I just have an interim position. It's called chairman of the executive council. And no, the question of salary never came up."
"Nice not to need $650,000."
"Is it," someone wondered, "a charitable contribution?"
"Call it whatever you want," said Selig.
These exchanges took place recently in the late afternoon at a viewing of paintings and other art objects that would be auctioned the following day.
In a few hours, he would be in his box for the game against the Angels in County Stadium, rooting knowledgeably and passionately for the team he fought to bring from Seattle to Milwaukee 23 years ago. "Isn't it amazing?" he said. "We're still in the pennant race. No one expected this." He mentioned Phil Garner, his rookie manager. "He's done a great job. A great job. Better than great."
In between such civic and familial duties, Selig must also find time to function as this quasi-chancellor of baseball, this czar of sorts, this chairman, a position his peers elected him to with a unanimous vote after Vincent resigned.
"There is only one powerful owner in baseball, and that's Bud Selig," said Selig's good friend, Jerry Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago White Sox. "He's the only one who can get votes out of the other owners. It's because he's such a nice guy, and he works at staying in touch with the rest of us."
Others, like Don Fehr, the executive director of the Major League Players Association, wonders if in fact Reinsdorf is the great power among the owners. "Possibly the puppeteer," Fehr has said.
But without question, Selig has been one of the most industrious of owners, and one of the few whose major income comes from baseball. And he is always on the phone. "I probably talk with every owner at least once a week, and some many times more than that," said Selig.
 
Redefining the Job
 One of the issues they are talking about now is finding a new commissioner, a position, he says, that needs not only to be filled, but must also be redefined. "We should look at it not in terms of 1920, when the commissioner's role was first defined, with Judge Landis," he said, "but in the realities of 1992."
It would seem, however, that a redefinition of "commissioner" would leave out the broad powers that Kenesaw Mountain Landis had, and that some of his successors, like Vincent, at least thought they had. But, in the end, they didn't have it. After all, Vincent had stated just weeks before he was ousted that he would never resign.
"I don't make any unilateral decisions," said Selig. "I operate by consensus. If there is a problem of any sort, I get in touch with the executive council. Immediately! And we go from there. We'd probably take a vote and consensus rules."
One of the first issues to arise in his interim reign was whether to proceed with the realignment of the National League that Vincent announced, and that the Chicago Cubs sued over. Last week, Selig and the other owners rescinded the realignment. "It leaves the next commissioner with a clear path to proceed in any way he wants," said Selig.
It seems to be clear, however, that the owners will not endure a new commissioner stepping on any of their toes. And so what person of substance would want such a job in which, at this point, he would seem more a figurehead than a decision-maker?
"Plenty would," said Selig. "People asked the same question after Bowie Kuhn was told he would not be re-elected, in 1984. You wouldn't believe the stature of the people who applied for the job. And remember, the man who accepted the job, Peter Ueberroth, was golden boy of the day, the hero of the Olympics and on the cover of Time Magazine as their Man of the Year."
In fact," he said, smiling now, "we've already gotten a lot of applicants. One of the first was from a butcher in San Mateo. He had some pretty good ideas, too. But I think we have to go in another direction from him."
"We need a strong commissioner, and we expect to have our man within two to four months," Selig continued. "There's a lot that an imaginative man can do. Look at the tremendous job David Stern has done with the N.B.A. We've got to improve our game to make it more appealing. Sure, attendance records have been broken regularly in the last decade or so. But network television ratings of games is down, and more than half the teams are losing money. And the major problem is the huge salaries the players are getting."
The economic situation of the teams is now being studied by a committee combining the owners and the players' union, and Selig is co-chairman of it. The union is more than skeptical about the number of teams losing money. Fehr sees Selig as a "traditionalist" who "would like baseball to be like it was in the 1950's."
"His view is the players are doing better than they should be doing," Fehr said.
One of the major considerations must be a restructuring of compensation for teams that lose free agents, Selig said. According to him, teams that are suffering financially, particularly those in the smaller markets, need relief. These teams include the Brewers, whose revenue from local television broadcasts is among the lowest in baseball.
Fehr contends, however, that the owners should help themselves and not ask the players for aid. And television revenue-sharing for local markets, which exists for the teams in the National Football League, for instance, is unknown in major league baseball.
Selig's argument to this is both circular and "traditional." He admits that "the owners have been somewhat responsible for the high salaries paid" -- and after all, who pays those salaries? But he contends that if things continue at this pace, in which the average major league salary has risen to more than $1 million, the small-market teams might be driven out of the game.
"We need a strong commissioner to lead, like Bart," said Selig. While A. Bartlett Giamatti served only nine months as commissioner before he died, he maintained an impressive and extraordinarily eloquent stature. Selig said he considered Giamatti one of his best friends. "Bart said, 'My job is to lead by suasion.' He understood that there were 26 owners with sometimes 26 different agendas. It was up to the commissioner to bring us together."
The feeling left by Selig was that Vincent was unable to do this; that Vincent's heart was in the right place, but his politicking abilities were not; that he appeared to believe he was the Judge Landis of the 1990's. "That just doesn't go anymore," said Selig.
Selig mentions that if negotiations with the union fail then a "work stoppage" or "lockout" is possible.
Selig, who has lived his whole life in Milwaukee, headed a group that purchased the Brewers for $10.8 million in 1970. He is only 58, but among baseball's owners only the Dodgers' O'Malley family, Gene Autry of the Angels and Ewing Kauffman of the Royals have owned teams longer. The Brewers, he concedes, now have an estimated value of $105 million. A new, $140 million stadium that will soon be constructed could add further value to the ball club.
 
Try the Soup
 Meanwhile, the search for a new commissioner continues. Selig is part of the search committee. He discussed this in a wooden booth in Jake's Deli on 17th Street on Milwaukee's North Side, in the heart of the inner city. Selig is part owner of the small restaurant, and proud of it, recommending especially its chicken-noodle soup and lean corned-beef sandwiches.
He himself ordered a hot dog, on which he spread ketchup. "I know you're supposed to put mustard on a hot dog," said Selig, "but ketchup is my weakness. You see, I'm not that much of a traditionalist."
As for a new commissioner, he noted that such names as former Secretary of State James Baker and the Democratic National Committee chairman, Ron Brown, had been mentioned.
What about Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf?
"No," he said, "I haven't heard his name."
Or Arnold Schwarzenegger?
"Not his either," said Selig, laughing. "But I have no doubt that we'll find someone excellent."
Then Bud Selig, His Chancellorship, bit seriously into his ketchup-laden hot dog.

HEADLINE: The Success of Lean Auto Manufacturing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Andrew Pollack's article "A Lower Gear For Japan's Auto Makers" (Aug. 30) contains many insights into the current gloomy state of affairs in the Japanese automobile industry. Yet, although Mr. Pollack does not say so explicitly, the article leaves the impression that a key reason for the recent decline is the failure of the Toyota production system. I believe the opposite is the case.
In fact the Toyota production system has done exactly what it is supposed to do -- namely, give companies competitive advantage in markets where success depends on high quality, low cost and rapid introduction of new products. 
 If anything, the system has worked too well. Domestically, it has forced other Japanese auto manufacturers to adopt similar methods. Internationally, because of the system's demonstrated effectiveness, American and European auto manufacturers have begun to implement it, and the gaps in quality and cost are closing. Some countries have resorted to negotiating away or legislating away the system's advantages, by forcing quotas or local content rules (which require the manufacturer to deal with unfamiliar suppliers) onto Japanese auto makers. One might say that the Toyota production system, rather than being a failure, is actually a victim of its own success.
The Japanese economy is in a downturn that fundamentally has nothing to do with the auto industry. If American auto manufacturers were to abandon lean manufacturing in the belief that the system has outlived its usefulness, they would be committing a serious error that would undermine the considerable gains they have made in quality, cost and manufacturing flexibility.

 BODY:
FREEDOM. Volume One: Freedom in the Making of Western Culture, by Orlando Patterson. (Basic Books, $15.) This analysis of freedom as a peculiarly Western ideal won the 1991 National Book Award for nonfiction. It is an irony of history, Orlando Patterson contends, that the institution of slavery in ancient societies was a prerequisite for the growing valuation of personal liberty. "It is a tribute to Mr. Patterson that as one reads his interesting book one wants to ask and try to answer . . . difficult and even painful questions," Mary Lefkowitz said here last year.
THE RISE OF LIFE ON EARTH, by Joyce Carol Oates. (New Directions, $8.95.) In this brief novel, Joyce Carol Oates explores the mind of Kathleen Hennessy, a severely abused child who becomes, seemingly ineluctably, an adult capable of murder. "Like Bach with his musical sense, Joyce Carol Oates is practiced with her narrative tools; she writes scenes of unrivaled vigor and conviction that precisely express her vision," our reviewer, Jane Smiley, said last year. Also available in paperback is HEAT: And Other Stories (William Abrahams/Plume, $12), which focuses on typical Oates themes of familial and social violence. The most successful stories are those in which the menace is understated, the injury purely emotional, Wendy Lesser said here last year: "We get normality in all its terrifying nakedness." And Ontario Review Press has brought back into print Ms. Oates's 1971 novel, WONDERLAND ($12.95), the story of a man whose entire family was killed during his childhood in a murder-suicide. It includes the revised ending the author wrote for the book's first paperback edition, as well as a new afterword. It is "in effect, if not intention, an old-fashioned horror story," said our reviewer, Geoffrey Wolff. 
 THE GOOD SOCIETY, by Robert N. Bellah, Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, Ann Swidler and Steven M. Tipton. (Vintage, $13.) This sequel to "Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life" stresses that democracy begins at home. By emphasizing responsibility in private life, the authors argue, Americans can improve public institutions. "The moral vision of the authors is commendable, their motives noble, their analysis subtle," Cornel West said here last year.
TALES OF THE MASTER RACE, by Marcie Hershman. (Harper Perennial, $10.) Marcie Hershman's characters, citizens of a fictional German town during World War II, aid the Nazi cause not through direct participation but through naivete and neglect. Last year The New York Times's Michiko Kakutani called this first novel "a searing portrait of the consequences of moral laziness and self-absorption."
J. EDGAR HOOVER: The Man and the Secrets, by Curt Gentry. (Plume, $15.) To Hoover, the director of the F.B.I. for almost 50 years, information was power; as this thick biography demonstrates, he collected it whether or not he knew it to be true. "Mr. Gentry shrewdly compares him to the 'embezzling bank clerk' who could never take a vacation because he feared his crimes would be discovered while he was away," David M. Oshinsky said in The Book Review last year.
IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE, by Ernest J. Gaines. (Vintage Contemporaries, $10.) This 1978 novel by the author of "A Gathering of Old Men" and "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman" concerns a black clergyman in rural Louisiana who is suddenly confronted with the legacy of his profligate past. "It is the force of Mr. Gaines's character and intelligence, operating through [his] deceptively quiet style, that makes his fiction compelling," Larry McMurtry said here.
CHILDHOOD'S FUTURE, by Richard Louv. (Anchor/ Doubleday, $11.) The author, a newspaper columnist, points out that ours is the only industrialized Western nation in which work and family are viewed as completely separate. He encourages parental leave policies and flexible work schedules to help Americans sustain their emotional as well as economic lives. "His book is useful because it reminds us that childhood's present does not have to be childhood's future," our reviewer, Lisbeth B. Schorr, said last year.
THE DEADLIEST OPTION, by Annette Meyers. (Bantam, $4.99.) This murder mystery gives a whole new meaning to making a killing in the stock market. The heroines, Xenia Smith and Leslie Wetzon, are, like the author, Wall Street executive placement consultants. "Ms. Meyers clearly knows whereof she rips to shreds," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.
THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE: A Biography of Henry Miller, by Mary V. Dearborn. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.) One man's genius is another man's pornographer, and few embodied that contradiction more readily than Henry Miller. This biography provides a detailed overview of the influences that made him the man and the writer he was. "Ms. Dearborn's perspective on Miller's childhood is especially rich," Perry Meisel said in The Book Review last year, "since it is a feminist and mildly psychoanalytic one."
THE MIND OF THE TRAVELER: From Gilgamesh to Global Tourism, by Eric J. Leed. (Basic Books, $15.) Eric J. Leed delves into the philosophical and spiritual aspects of travel, beginning with what may have been the first journey -- Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden -- and continuing through conquests and crusades to contemporary tours. Last year our reviewer, Helen Bevington, called his book "a historian's account, wonderfully rich in material."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
The Facts Are Elusive in the Jobs Debate

SERIES: Issues -- First article of a series: Creating Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The goal of his economic policies, George Bush has said for years, is "jobs, jobs, jobs."
Yet fewer new jobs have been created in his Presidency than in any other Presidential term in the last half century. Actually, fewer people are on private payrolls today than when Mr. Bush took office. 
 Those facts give Gov. Bill Clinton a leg up in this year's campaign for the Presidency, where, both candidates say, job creation is the top issue. But neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Bush is sticking to the facts. Both use questionable statistics to bolster their positions.
 
Tossing Out Numbers
 Mr. Bush says Congress is at fault for the poor jobs record in his Administration. Accepting the Republican Presidential nomination in Houston last month, he said that if lawmakers had approved the tax cuts and other economic measures he proposed in January 500,000 more Americans would now be at work.
That number was apparently derived from a misreading of his own budget.
So much for the past. Now, the Bush campaign is arguing that Mr. Clinton's proposed policies would cost the country 2.6 million jobs. Outside experts say that assertion is probably nonsense and certainly unprovable.
Mr. Clinton's declarations on job creation are in the same vein. The President's plans on medical care, Mr. Clinton says, would result in the loss of nearly two million jobs. That number comes from a college professor in North Carolina who concedes it is a "guesstimate" based on the shaky assumption that Mr. Clinton would control the rising cost of health care and Mr. Bush would not.
Mr. Clinton says his own policies would create eight million jobs in the next four years, a sum that sounds ambitious but that actually would barely keep pace with the expected growth in the number of people seeking work. A Clinton staff assistant said the figure was arrived at more or less arbitrarily.
 
Same Words, Different Ways
 Impartial economists suggest that voters simply ignore the candidates' specific claims and charges about job creation and job losses.
Janet L. Norwood, the Federal Commissioner of Labor Statistics from 1979, in the Carter Administration, until last year and as politically neutral an expert as exists on such matters, put it this way: "In a campaign, there are a lot of numbers that come out about jobs, but I don't think there's any way really to determine how many jobs would be created or lost by different policies."
Still, both Presidential candidates say job creation is the foremost issue in the campaign, and they say so in strikingly similar words.
"Creating jobs is the No. 1 issue," Mr. Bush declared when he kicked off his campaign in Gulfport, Miss., the day after the Republican National Convention ended last month.
Not to be outdone, Mr. Clinton said in a television interview over Labor Day weekend that "the No. 1 thing" he would do as President would be to provide "a jobs program."
The candidates differ significantly in their approaches to job creation. Mr. Bush believes the best way is to give tax breaks to businesses and investors. Mr. Clinton would have the Government spend billions of dollars more on public works like highways, bridges, railroads and communications systems.
Both candidates talk at length about training workers. Mr. Bush would give people grants of up to $3,000 each to help them pay for job training. Mr. Clinton would require companies to spend 1.5 percent of their payrolls on worker training or pay a comparable amount into a Government fund that would finance training.
 
Economy's Crucial Role
 Economists say Government spending probably creates marginally more jobs than tax cuts, since some of the money that people and companies get from tax reductions would be saved, not spent. On the other hand, tax cuts probably have a more immediate impact on the economy than spending on public works because those projects require time for design and planning.
In the end, the overriding factor in job creation is how well the economy does. With times as slack as they are now, each percentage point of annual growth in economic output should create about a million new jobs, said Laurence H. Meyer, a economist who runs a St. Louis forecasting concern that bears his name. As the economy improves, Mr. Meyer said, the amount of growth needed to generate a million jobs will increase somewhat.
Both candidates have offered plans for improving the economy, but deciding who has the better plan is a matter of politics and ideology, not fact. Those who believe that the Government should basically keep its hands off the economy and let the free market run its course favor Mr. Bush's plan. Those who think that the Government should play a lead role in driving the economy favor Mr. Clinton's approach.
 
Gaps in Explanation
 But two other factors that bear on job creation have not been fully addressed by either candidate.
The first is the budget deficit, a topic that neither man seems eager to discuss. To the extent that Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts are offset by lower Government spending and to the degree that Mr. Clinton's increased spending on public works is offset by higher taxes or lower spending elsewhere, the effect of the next President's policies on new jobs will be reduced. On the other hand, if he simply allows the deficit to grow, private investment will presumably be lower and interest rates higher, and that, too, would hurt the job market.
The second factor is mushrooming medical costs. Increasingly, companies facing the high cost of medical insurance are paying existing employees overtime rather than hiring new workers. But neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Clinton has presented a fully developed plan to keep medical costs down.
Mr. Bush is at a disadvantage in the debate over jobs because his Administration's record on the matter has been so poor. He promised in the 1988 campaign to create 30 million jobs in eight years, but so far, as Mr. Clinton keeps pointing out, the President is 29 million jobs short. According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 117,737,000 people were at work nationwide last month, as against 116,708,000 when Mr. Bush became President in January 1989.
The increase of less than 1 percent is by far the worst record in any Presidential term since World War II. By contrast, the number of jobs in the country increased by 11.2 percent in Jimmy Carter's Administration, by 6.3 percent in Ronald Reagan's first term and by 9.8 percent in Mr. Reagan's second term.
The number of nongovernment jobs has actually fallen by 28,000 during the Bush Presidency.
 
Impact of Military Budget
 At the Republican convention, Mr. Bush said Congress was partly to blame. "On Jan. 28," he declared, "I put before Congress a plan to create jobs. And if it had been passed back then, 500,000 more Americans would be at work right now."
Asked this week how the President had arrived at that figure, a campaign staff member referred to a passage on page 1-37 in the budget that Mr. Bush submitted last January. The passage states that Mr. Bush's proposals "should create an additional half a million jobs during the next four years," not in seven months.
The Bush campaign's charge that Mr. Clinton's proposals would cost the country 2.6 million jobs is based in large part on the calculation that the military budget cuts proposed by Mr. Clinton would result in a loss of one million jobs. That may be the case, but it is hardly more jobs than Mr. Bush's own plans for the Pentagon would cost.
The Defense Budget Project, a private organization whose analyses of the military budget are regarded as authoritative, has calculated that Mr. Bush's plans for cutting military spending by $1.42 trillion over the next five years would result in a loss of about 900,000 military and civilian jobs over the period and that Mr. Clinton's cuts of about $60 billion more than that would mean a loss of perhaps an additional 100,000 to 150,000 jobs.
Mr. Clinton promises that all the money saved from military cuts would be spent on job-producing public programs, a promise that may not square with his pledge to hold down the budget deficit. Mr. Bush says only that he would promote retraining for displaced workers from military industries.
The Bush campaign also argues that 1.6 million jobs would be lost under Mr. Clinton's proposals because of the burdens imposed on business by medical insurance and training requirements, automobile mileage standards and corporate tax increases. The figures were compiled by the Republican staffs of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.
The Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee published a rejoinder attributing the Republican calculations to fabrications and erroneous statistics that were based on biased computer models and that ignored relevant academic research.
 
The Art of Estimating
 Mr. Clinton maintains that Mr. Bush's plan to limit spending on Medicare and Medicaid would cost 1.8 million jobs, a figure that is just as unprovable as Mr. Bush's claims about the Clinton agenda. The source of the figure, Kenneth E. Thorpe, an associate professor of public health at the University of North Carolina, said in an interview that his estimate was based on his view that Mr. Clinton would save businesses money by keeping the rise in medical costs under control and that Mr. Bush would not.
Mr. Clinton's promise to create eight million jobs during the next four years would mean that the economy was not performing particularly well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people seeking work is expected to rise naturally by about 7.5 million people during that period, meaning that by his own estimate Mr. Clinton would hardly put a dent in the unemployment rate.
Many economists are simply put off by the numbers that the candidates are bandying about. Lawrence Chimerine, a senior economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting concern in Lexington, Mass., said, "This whole process of trying to quantify things is designed to make people think there's more precision and credibility than there is."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 2, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the Presidential candidates' stands on job creation misstated their plans for military spending. President Bush proposes spending a total of $1.42 trillion on the military during the next five years. Gov. Bill Clinton favors spending about $60 billion less than Mr. Bush has proposed over that period.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "CANDIDATES ON THE ISSUES: Two Points of View On Creating New Jobs"
 
The current unemployment rate is the highest in eight years. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose their jobs in the next four years as the military and related industries shrink because of the end of the cold war. Countless other workers in manufacturing will find themselves out of work as factories move overseas or become more mechanized. Many of those who will be looking for work will need training for the modern workplace. President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton agree that creating new jobs is one of the most important issues in the Presidential campaign and that the best way to guarantee new jobs is to strengthen the economy. What they disagree on is how to do it.
 
THE RECORDS
 
During the Bush Presidency, the number of jobs in the United States has grown by less than 1 percent, the lowest rate of growth in any Presidential term since World War II. The number of nongovernment jobs has fallen by 28,000. As of last month, the unemployment rate had risen to 7.6 percent from 5.6 percent the month Mr. Bush took office.
 
Overall employment in Mr. Clinton's home state has increased. From January 1989 to July 1992, the last month for which statistics are available, the number of jobs in Arkansas grew by 11.8 percent. The unemployment rate fell during that period to 7.1 percent from 7.6 percent.
 
THE PHILOSOPHIES
 
Mr. Bush holds that the best way to create new jobs is to give tax breaks across the board to home buyers, businesses and investors.
 
Mr. Clinton argues that the Government should become actively involved in job creation by financing public works projects and giving specific tax breaks for the kind of investments that are most likely to result in new jobs.
 
TRAINING
 
Mr. Bush would allocate an additional $10 billion over five years for skill training, including grants to individuals of up to $3,000 to help defray the cost of training and counseling and job referral assistance. All workers would be eligible, but emphasis would be placed on helping workers who lost jobs because of trade agreements and lower military spending.
 
Mr. Clinton would require employers to spend 1.5 percent of their payrolls on training, or they would have to pay a comparable amount into a Government fund that would finance job training. Apprenticeship programs would be developed in which high school students and recent graduates could learn skills.
 
SCORECARD
 
Mr. Bush is at a serious disadvantage on this issue because his record on job creation has been so poor. He maintains that if Congress had approved all his economic proposals this year, 500,000 more Americans would be at work, and he says the Clinton policies would cost 2.6 million jobs. Those claims are at best unprovable.
 
Mr. Clinton says his proposals will create eight million new jobs over the next four years, but that is basically a back-of-the-envelope calculation that would reflect job growth if the economy improves modestly. He contends that the Bush health-care plan would result in the loss of 1.8 million jobs, but the claim cannot be documented.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A New Landscape for Global Bonds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
THE crisis in European currency markets has taken a harsh toll on mutual fund investors whose funds own foreign bonds and notes. These funds lost more than 2 percent of their value on average in two weeks that ended last Thursday, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.
This devaluation of mutual fund shares caught many investors by surprise, especially those in short-term global income funds. But obstacles in creating monetary union in Europe may actually be good news for holders of long-term global bonds who are able to ride out short-run price moves. 
 Still, investors in the United States should not underestimate the chaos roiling Europe. "We've seen a breakdown of the European monetary system equal to the 1987 stock market crash in the United States," said David R. Kenerson Jr., who manages the Van Eck World Income Fund in Manhattan.
The pandemonium in European financial markets has helped to discredit the idea that short-term global income funds are suitable substitutes for money market funds. The short-term global funds, which were introduced a few years ago and already hold more than $22.5 billion, aim for share price stability using a complicated hedging technique that relies heavily on the premise that European currencies will fluctuate within a narrow range. That premise no longer holds.
But for investors holding shares in short-term global funds, "there's no reason to sell if you understand that some currency risk means moderate risk to principal," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group in Chicago. Investors who found the recent turbulence too much should move their cash back into domestic money funds, he said.
While some of the world's attention in recent weeks has been focused on drastic moves in foreign-exchange rates, it is interest rates that move bond prices first, noted A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. And so, he said, investors should be considering the opportunities rates are offering. Many fund managers say a fall is inevitable for European interest rates, which are unusually high, but they disagree on when this will happen. As interest rates fall, bond prices rise, producing capital gains for bondholders.
Most global bond fund investors were hurt in recent weeks as foreign-currency bonds were sold and the proceeds were moved to the relative safety of dollar-based investments. In the week that ended on Sept. 17, the Benham, Franklin and MFS funds declined more than 4 percent each. But looking forward, managers say that European bonds represent the best value of debt securities anywhere in the world.
Fiona Biggs manages the top-ranked Dreyfus Strategic World Investing Fund, a fund with wide latitude to invest in either stocks or bonds. Right now, her bond exposure is greater, and she owns bond futures to gain leverage because "the European economy will be so much worse than people expect." She added, "The European economic cycle is a few years behind the United States' ."
The best reason to buy shares in European bond funds is for diversification that provides a hedge to investments in dollars for times when United States markets are reeling, said Mr. Kenerson at the Van Eck World Income Fund. And the best time to invest is after a crash, he said. He predicts continuing volatility in the short term, but as the volatility subsides, there should be "improvement in bond prices and currency generally."
Indeed, while investors have been expecting rates to decline in Europe, "the currency breakdown has accelerated the natural process," said Steven Ilott, with Rowe Price Fleming in London, which manages the T. Rowe Price global bond funds.
Unlike the Dreyfus fund and several others, the T. Rowe Price International Bond Fund makes limited use of hedging, which protects against currency swings. Hedging limits losses, but it also reduces gains.
European bonds have not yet rallied, and there is a very good chance that interest rates will decline and create capital gains, said Nimrod Fachler, who manages the Paine Webber Global Income Fund. His strategy at this point is to invest in long-term bonds in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France -- the countries with the strongest currencies.
Over all, the outlook for investors who already hold European bonds is good, said Steve Bartow, chief investment officer for Putnam's global fixed-income group. Britain cut its interest rates last week, and Italy is expected to do so soon. But public opinion polls indicate that most Germans do not favor giving up the mark in favor of a single European currency, he said, and this sentiment "doesn't get us out of the soup in terms of ongoing volatility."
Investors hoping to profit from Europe's crisis must look at how heavily a fund is invested there. For those who expect European bonds to rise, the more a fund has in Europe, the better its prospects. The high-ranked IDS Global Bond Fund, for example, has relatively little invested in Europe. It normally keeps only 20 percent of its portfolio in Europe and owns even less today, said Ray Goodner, its manager.

HEADLINE: Individualist-Idealist Breaks the Rules

BYLINE: By CAROL STRICKLAND

 BODY:
WHEN civic leaders of Rock Hill, S.C., envisioned an entrance for their new industrial park, they had in mind a redwood sign saying, "Tech Park." What Audrey Flack, the sculptor from East Hampton, gave them were four 22-foot-tall gilded goddesses.
Departing from expectations is hardly new to the 61-year-old Ms. Flack. Her 40-year career is the subject of a retrospective opening on Sept. 29 at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington.
The exhibition and a monograph published by Harry N. Abrams Inc. are entitled "Breaking the Rules." From Ms. Flack's celebrated Photorealist paintings of the 1970's to her sculptured deities of the 80's and now a proposed 10-story high monument in Queens, breaking the rules has been Ms. Flack's major rule. 
 Ms. Flack's work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
"In the last 40 years Flack has become one of the best-known contemporary women artists," the administrative director of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Rebecca P. Abbott, said.
"Audrey Flack is an exciting, varied artist and a fine craftsman," said Elaine Benson, who directs her gallery in Bridgehampton.
Although Ms. Flack's work is popular with the public and collectors, critical opinion is divided. Ms. Flack's New York dealer, Louis K. Meisel, still winces at past reviews. He recalled how John Russell used the phrase "irredeemably hideous" in connection with Ms. Flack's Photorealist paintings in The New York Times in 1983. "Audrey has always been 20 years ahead of the pack," Mr. Meisel said. "Her work has nothing to do with the avant-garde. It's better."
What makes Ms. Flack's work controversial is her tendency to infuse tacky pop imagery, executed in gaudy colors, with religious significance. In her well-known Photorealist paintings she portrayed images ranging from Buddha to Marilyn Monroe, from Buchenwald survivors to strawberry tarts.
She fused Old and New Worlds, using the Photorealist airbrush method to paint over a projected photographic slide. Modern technology aside, her compositions are 17th-century "vanitas" still lifes, complete with symbolic trappings like hourglasses, skulls, ripe fruit and dewy flowers suggesting the brevity of life.
Similarly her statues of pagan goddesses have Classical costumes, but assertive poses and the lithe bodies of Olympic athletes.
 
'It's Postpostmodern'
 "I do go back to the ancients and to Neoclassicism, but my work is very contemporary," Ms. Flack said in an interview. "It's postpostmodern."
Ms. Flack's passionate concern with spiritual and emotional subjects runs counter to the cool theoretical bent of art-world trends. "Critics can't deal with her work because it goes too much against what contemporary art is about," the curator of the retrospective, Thalia Gouma-Peterson, said. "Audrey goes out on a limb and does her own thing. The work is right on the edge, but because of its tremendous power never becomes sentimental or kitschy."
Ms. Flack's sculptures for Rock Hill illustrate her belief that art can heal social ills. Rock Hill (population 42,000) had fallen on hard times before it gambled on the goddesses to change its destiny. A 100-year-old decaying mill town near the North Carolina border with 20 percent unemployment, the town was almost bust after 13 of its 14 textile mills had closed. "We had to rediversify the whole economy," Mayor Elizabeth Rhea said.
To attract international business, Ms. Rhea commissioned Ms. Flack to create "heroic sculpture of the Michelangelo type."
Called "Gateway," the collaboration between Ms. Flack and an architect, Michael A. Gallis, was conceived "not just as a gateway to the city, but to the city's future," Mr. Gallis said.
 
'An Immediate Visualization'
 Although critics demanded that the money be spent on roads and schools, Mr. Gallis, an urban planner, maintained that civic sculpture would prove a better investment. "Public art exerts a powerful effect on the psyche of a city," he said. " 'Gateway' became an immediate visualization that change would happen."
Two years after unveiling the statues, the industrial park is fully occupied by companies from England, France, Switzerland and Germany. The influx brought $150 million in investment and created nearly 2,000 jobs. "The sculptures have absolutely been a drawing card for us, a tremendous boost," Ms. Rhea said.
The art also transformed Rock Hill's image from blue collar to black tie. It went from being considered an esthetic void, lacking even a statue of a Confederate general astride a horse, to the apex of culture in the region. Even booming cities like nearby Charlotte have eyed the statues enviously and are planning their own.
"Thank you for putting those sculptures in Rock Hill," a waitress told Ms. Rhea. "I'll never get to Europe, but I ride by those statues every day. I really feel I've been somewhere special."
"Art is for the people," said Ms. Flack, who hopes her next big project will reinvigorate Queens. The Friends of Queen Catherine have chosen her to design in collaboration with Mr. Gallis a monument to Catherine of Braganza (1638-1705), Princess of Portugal and Queen of England, after whom the borough is named.
Situated on the East River in the Queens West development to be built at Hunters Point, opposite the United Nations, the statue, second in size in New York only to the Statue of Liberty, would "bring business to Queens and give the borough a slice of New York's tourism," said Manuel A. Sousa, president of the friends group, which formed three years ago to build the monument.
Catherine is a symbol of internationalism, said Mr. Sousa, an official of the Portuguese Trade Commission. The monument represents "the ethnic variety in the borough, where 150 different languages and dialects are spoken," he added.
For Janet M. Schneider, head of the friends' art committee, which selected Ms. Flack's design, the monument would promote Queens as "a place with a history attached to significant world events." The monument would cost $2 million, to be raised privately. If the Queens West office and residential complex proceeds on schedule, the monument would be completed by 1995.
For Mr. Gallis, the monument "announces Queens as not just this low flat suburban outer zone, but an important component of New York."
For Ms. Flack the 36-foot-tall bronze sculpture on a 54-foot-high base symbolizes "a new millennium."
"She's a healthy image to give us hope," Ms. Flack said. "No fat frumpy queen." Her design is "an image of movement."
"Her robes are flowing in the breeze," Ms. Flack said. "She's bringing in change with the wind. This will give New Yorkers a different feeling about themselves. She is the essence of what we need now."
And how does a bejeweled corseted 17th-century monarch holding a globe in her hand relate to modern needs rather than past glory? Thalia Gouma-Peterson, a professor of art history at the College of Wooster in Ohio, said Ms. Flack's heroic female sculptures were very "now" in spirit. "One would never mistake them for antique figures," Professor Gouma-Peterson said. "There is tremendous power in those figures. They're self-assured, marching out to conquer the world."
Embodying female strength is Ms. Flack's goal. "Audrey is a staunch supporter of women and women's imagery," said Louis K. Meisel, who directs a gallery with his name in SoHo.
"Audrey's art is not feminist propaganda," said Dorchen Leidholdt, a lawyer and founder of the New York Coalition to End Violence against Women. "But her feminism is inextricable from her art."
Ms. Flack proudly practices activist art and recently addressed a rally to defend battered women. To a crowd of 8,000, Ms. Flack recounted the myth of Medusa, the subject of two of her sculptures. In the reinterpretation Medusa was not grotesque and vicious, but an innocent victim of male violence.
"Here's this woman who was raped, then punished and then beheaded," Ms. Flack said. "I felt very strongly I had to give this important woman a voice. Men see violence against women as macho and glamorous. We have to change that sensibility."
"Audrey is messianic in a way," the director of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, Trudy Kramer, said. "She makes an effort to convey her ideas and participate in social issues. She's very interested in her work being democratic."
Ms. Flack has a home in Manhattan but is an integral part of the East End art scene. In the 1950's she caught the Abstract Expressionist fever, living in Springs, near Jackson Pollock, "around the corner from Bill de Kooning," she said.
Ms. Flack and her husband, Robert Marcus, an executive, have owned a house and studio in East Hampton for nearly 20 years. "Long Island is a very special place in the world," Ms. Flack said. "This is sacred territory." Her nearly lifesize bronze sculpture "Islandia: Goddess of the Healing Waters" symbolizes Long Island for Ms. Flack. The winged goddess was displayed last summer outside the Parrish and is now at the New York City Technical College in Brooklyn.
"There's a reason artists come to the Island to work, something about the air, the space and the light," she added. "There's an energy here that's freeing."
"Audrey has taken a lot of risks with her work, which has allowed her to grow in important ways," Ms. Kramer said. "She has a lot of courage as an artist."

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: RICHARD H. STRAUSS;
Improving Business at the State's Airports

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THE future of Connecticut's six airports is the topic of a series of hearings being conducted around the state by Richard H. Strauss, Deputy Commissioner of the State Department of Transportation.
The commissioner is meeting with pilots and passengers to gather comments on the Transportation Department's new five-year capital improvement program for the airports. At Bradley International, for instance, more than $30 million in improvements are planned. Currently, Mr. Strauss is responsible for state ports and airports in Hartford, Windsor Locks, Oxford, Windham, Danielson and Groton, as well as 138 associated aviation businesses, including municipal airports like Tweed-New Haven and Sikorsky Airport in Stratford. 
 In a recent interview at Windham Airport, Mr. Strauss discussed Connecticut's airports, as well as the issue that is on many aviators' minds as he conducts the hearings: how taxes pose a serious threat to efforts to build a strong aviation base in the state. Following are excerpts from that conversation:
Q: What is the tax problem for aircraft in Connecticut?
A: Connecticut towns tax the aircraft as property. In many states there is a registration fee. I expect that's going to be an issue everywhere we go.
Q: Is there any estimate of the number of aircraft that might be moved into the state if planes are subject to a registration fee instead of a tax?
A: I think that's speculative. But if you look at the number of aircraft in, say, Groton, and what has happened there over the last several years. You've seen the aircraft move, to a large degree, because of the tax, across the border into Westerly. There are about a dozen or 15 aircraft based there, and a few years ago the number of aircraft there was in the 50's or 60's. You see that taking place across Connecticut.
Q: How much would the change from a tax to a registration fee save the average aircraft owners?
A: Obviously, it depends on the registration fee that is ultimately imposed. We're talking about in excess of $2 million in property tax revenues with the system now, and I think the registration system would collect approximately $500,000, so the average aircraft owner would save about 75 percent.
Q: Why do you want to make it easier to own a plane in Connecticut?
A: First of all, the businesses at the airports provide service to pilots and aircraft owners, and having additional aircraft will help their businesses. If you have a very small airport like a Danielson Airport, with a limited number of aircraft based there, it becomes very difficult to have an operator there full time to provide the services that are needed. Having more aircraft makes those airport-based businesses more profitable, so that's a direct benefit.
The indirect benefit to those businesses and to the state is that through the additional aircraft based here, you create new jobs to work on those aircraft, and you have the potential to attract new companies that want to locate their businesses near airports, or entice existing businesses to base their aircraft in the state. That can provide spinoff benefits in terms of sales tax revenues, more jobs and taxes on petroleum products. We will sell more fuel if we have more aircraft. We will create more jobs if we have more aircraft.
Q: Aircraft owners say you are the first Deputy Commissioner to give the tax issue a lot of attention. How did that happen?
A: It came up shortly after I started in June 1991, and it was clear that this was a major concern among aircraft owners. We had a team of people working on it last year. We introduced it this year, but there were many issues on the table. I'm hoping we can make a strong case for it next year. It's clear that this is something that could have a significant impact, and we're committed to trying to get it through again, probably with a hold-harmless clause for the communities that are getting aircraft property tax payments now, so they don't lose money.
Q: The state lost a few private airports in the 1970's and 1980's to real estate speculators. Could that happen again if the market heats up?
A: We have an airport system plan that identifies all the airports in the state and the role they play in general aviation. There's no question that the property tax, as it stands today, has a great impact on aviation in the State of Connecticut. If the property tax isn't changed, you will probably see an erosion of air transportation facilities. If it is changed, you will see benefits from higher utilization of existing airports to economic development.
Q: How much is the state proposing to spend on capital improvements?
A: At Bradley International, the five-year plan exceeds $30 million. At the five general aviation state airports, we're looking for $7 million in Federal funds and $2 million in state funds per year. Then we also participate in funding of improvements at municipal airports, in Danbury, New Haven, Bridgeport. We pay 25 percent of the non-Federal share, which means we pay 2.5 percent and the city pays 7.5 percent of the cost.
Q: There are three airports along the shore, in Stratford, New Haven and Groton, that provide commercial service. Why are they not used more heavily?
A: You really only have jet service at one of those airports, Tweed. The frequency of flights are also important to people's decision as to where they are going to fly out of. Groton, Tweed and Sikorsky might meet the need of some passengers, but many people prefer the airport with a higher level of service, terminal facilities, jetways, and those types of amenities. And as the highway systems improve throughout the state, Bradley becomes that much closer to Fairfield County and southeastern Connecticut.
We're looking forward to the day when the transportation network will be very much improved, and put us in a much more competitive situation with Boston and New York airports. That's good because those airports have significant congestion. It's also more of a reliable airport because we don't have coastal fog, which can close down Boston and New York.
Q: How close to capacity is Bradley?
A: We're doing our master plan now which will identify that, but the air side is at about 60 percent of capacity, and the terminal, its expected capacity is about 8 million embarkments a year, and we're at about 4.8 million. This year is up from last year.
Q: You've recorded increases of well over 10 percent many months this year. What's driving that?
A: The fares. There are a lot of people who have decided "Hey, with these fares, I'm going to go on vacation." Pricing moves people, and the rates have been good, so more people are flying.
Q: Much of what the capital plan contains is renovation and maintenance. Are there any plans for expansion of the air transportation network in Connecticut?
A: We have a lot of work to do regarding simply rehabilitation. At this airport in Windham, for instance, we're not necessarily expanding, but we're looking at safety enhancements, with the creation of a new taxiway. To a large degree the limited funding we have available allows us to look at rehabilitation, and not expansion.
Q: Your plan calls for finding a private operator for Danielson Airport, and possibly for Windham and Oxford later. Why is the state considering getting out of the operation of small airports?
A: We're looking all through our operations and continually analyzing our expenditures to find better ways to do what we do. And if we do it differently, what level of service are we going to provide for the customer, which is the aircraft owner or traveler. In order to do that, we have to test the market. So we do requests for proposals and see whether private businesses can work with us to operate and maintain facilities in such a way that will allow us to reallocate our limited resources to their maximum efficiency. You have to ask, is there another way to do it? For some facilities it may work, for others it might not be the way to go.
Q: Do environmental concerns  about things like de-icing chemicals, fuel and habitat destruction prevent you from doing some of the things you want to at airports?
A: Whether you're running a service in the public sector or the private sector you need to be sensitive to environmental issues. Glycol is an environmental issue at major airports that needs to be addressed from two directions.
One is the safety of the flying public, that the plane be properly prepared to take off in a way that is safe.
On the other hand, you have to deal with the issue of glycol's infiltration into the groundwater. That happens to be one that is very much in the public eye right now. There's no question, though, that if you're building a new facility, the environment is another issue you need to deal with. That's the reality. We work closely with the Department of Environmental Protection, and identify those areas we need to work on.
Q: Is noise becoming more of a concern as suburbanization creeps out to some of the state's once-rural airports?
A: We're fortunate that modern aircraft have become much more quiet. There is a significant difference between a Stage 2 aircraft and Stage 3 aircraft, in terms of noise. Those large airports with commercial air service, we've seen continued improvement in the noise levels people are faced with.

HEADLINE: New Campaign Against PCB's in the Hudson

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
DESPITE regular warnings from the state, most Hudson River fishermen continue to eat PCB-contaminated fish, because they are either unaware of the risks or they do not care about them, a Poughkeepsie-based environmental organization reported last week.
"The bottom line, of course, is that we have to clean up the PCB's, but short of that, we somehow have to get the word out about the dangers of ingesting the chemicals," said Bridget Barclay, environmental director of Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a 13,000-member nonprofit group that is compiling results from a yearlong study of fishermen's habits. 
 In interviews that began in the spring of 1991 with 340 anglers from Fort Edward (a Hudson River town about 40 miles north of Albany), south to Brooklyn and Staten Island, the environmental group found that 43 percent of fishermen along the river ate their catch at least twice a week, a rate the state considers unsafe.
The Clearwater organization's findings follow an updated health advisory last spring that was issued jointly by the State Department of Health and the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The advisory warns about the hazards associated with eating fish from the state's fresh waters, the Hudson River estuary and the New York Harbor area.
Although the newest advisory eases some previous Health Department restrictions on consumption, it still recommends limits on how often different kinds of fish can be safely eaten. For example, the advisory suggests that people eat no more than one meal a month of striped bass caught in the river south of the Tappan Zee Bridge. It also warns against eating any striped bass caught north of the bridge, where PCB concentrations are higher.
In the past, the Health Department has warned against eating any fish from the Hudson River.
But many of the anglers interviewed by Hudson River Sloop Clearwater said that even though they have known about the advisories, they have disregarded them.
"People tell us, 'You're going to die anyway,' and 'I've been eating the fish for years and nothing has happened,' " Ms. Barclay said.
In addition to recommending how often it is safe to eat fish spawned in the Hudson River, the state's 1992-93 advisory says that women of childbearing age, infants and children younger than 15 are probably more vulnerable to the effects of PCB's and should not consume any fish from the river.
Nevertheless, many Hudson River anglers are sharing their fish with family and friends, according to the Clearwater's findings. About 76 percent of those who told interviewers they ate the fish also said they shared their catch with at least one child younger than 15 or with a woman of childbearing age.
Laboratory studies have linked some types of polychlorinated biphenyls to cancer in animals. Also, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that exposure to PCB's could cause nervous-system disorders, headaches and fatigue in all humans, along with reproductive problems in women and developmental delays in children.
During a 30-year period ending in 1977, it is estimated that about 1.1 million pounds of PCB's were discharged legally into the Hudson River from two General Electric Company plants that were manufacturing capacitors in Fort Edward and nearby Hudson Falls. The PCB's were a fire-retardant coolant used in the capacitors.
Although levels of the chemical found in the sediment at the bottom of the river and in fish dropped sharply after General Electric quit discharging PCB's into the river and have continued to decline -- albeit at a slower rate since 1980 -- samplings of fish show that those levels remain above the two parts per million allowed by the Federal Food and Drug Administration for commercial fisheries, said Ronald J. Sloan, a research scientist for the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
Another study of 11,000 people fishing in Lake Ontario also showed that anglers have not changed their eating habits despite the state's health advisories. A study conducted last year at the State University of New York at Buffalo reported that people with fewer years of education and lower household income consumed fish from the heavily polluted lake more often than others, said Dr. John E. Vena, an author of the study and an associate professor of social and preventive medicine at the school.
Similarly, preliminary results from the Clearwater study suggest that social and economic factors may be influencing people's fish-consumption habits, although those data have not been fully analyzed, Ms. Barclay said.
"A question we have is how many people are subsistence fishing," she said. "Is this their main source of food?"
"But whatever the reason they are still eating the fish is the word about the dangers is not getting out there, and that is a big concern to us," she said.
 
No Licenses Required
 The Clearwater study -- which cost $22,000 and was financed in part by the Hudson River Foundation for Science and Environmental Research in New York City and the W. Alton Jones Foundation in Charlottesville, Va. -- showed that only 46 percent of the fishermen were aware of the state's health advisories.
Part of the reason that fishermen along 150 miles of the lower Hudson may not be aware of the health risks, Ms. Barclay suggested, is that the advisories are issued along with fishing licenses, but south of Troy on the river no licenses are required. North of the Troy Dam, fishing is prohibited.
Historically, licenses have not been required for the lower Hudson River, part of which is a marine district not subject to regulation, said Langdon Marsh, executive deputy commissioner for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. Although the state has recently considered fishing licenses for that part of the river as a vehicle for disseminating information and as a source of revenue, it has become what Mr. Marsh called a "politically contentious" issue.
Licensing has been opposed by recreational fishermen, who do not want restrictions on their activities and who also do not want to pay fees.
 
A Corps of Rangers Sought
 Instead, the state is seeking Federal financing for "urban fishing rangers who would go around and talk to anglers" who may not be aware of the health hazards, Mr. Marsh said.
Hudson River Sloop Clearwater is particularly concerned about the section of the river along the Westchester and New York City coastline because of the density of the population in that area and the large number of recreational fishermen, Ms. Barclay said. In addition to fishing rangers, signs posted along the riverbanks may also be an effective way to alert anglers.
The advisories are being distributed to bait and tackle dealers, and information is being disseminated by agents of the Cornell Cooperative Extension and by special-interest groups, like the Sierra Club, said Anthony Forti, a research scientist with the State Department of Health.
Christopher Letts, an educator with the Hudson River Foundation, runs shad and crab festivals along the river and shows people ways to cook the fish to reduce the health risks from PCB contamination. A crab festival will be held at Croton Point Park in Croton-on-Hudson next Sunday.
 
'This Is Not the A.&P.'
 "There's a danger of being too conservative when it comes to deciding whether or not to eat the fish," Mr. Letts said. "And you can tell people not to, but they are going to do it anyway. So you might as well show them the safest way to do it."
"There is something magical about people being able to take sustenance from the environment. It gives you a link," he said. "This is not the A.&P."
While the state and environmental organizations try to teach fishermen about the risks of consuming fish from the river, the problem of counteracting the PCB contamination -- which could cost $280 million to $750 million -- awaits completion of a study by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.
 
Federal Study Due in 1994
 At the request of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, the Federal Government is reevaluating the interim no-action policy it adopted in 1984. Options include continuing the no-action policy, keeping PCB's in place with sand or gravel in areas that could be stirred up by storms or ice, using biological methods to reduce contamination or dredging the river bottom, treating the chemicals and then depositing them in landfills.
The results of the Federal study will not be available until 1994, and they will be subject to public review before action is taken, said Douglas J. Tomchuk, an environmental engineer for the Federal agency.
Under the Federal Superfund Act, General Electric could be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up the river.
 
 
 
 
Warnings and Preparation
 IN a 1992-93 health advisory, the State Department of Health and the State Department of Environmental Conservation recommends limits on eating sport fish because many fish contain potentially harmful levels of chemical contaminants.
Specifically, long-term exposure to PCB's has been linked to cancer and nervous-system disorders. In general, the advisory says, it is recommended that a person eat no more than a half-pound of fish a week caught by recreational fishermen from the Hudson River. Infants, children younger than under 15 and women of childbearing age should not eat any fish from the Hudson River.
The following are some recommendations from the health advisory:
People should not eat any American eel, white perch, carp, goldfish or white catfish taken from the Hudson River from Troy Dam south to and including Lower New York Harbor. They should also not eat any hepatopancreas (the mustard, liver or tomalley of crabs) or any of the cooking liquid from crabs taken from the same part of the river.
The advisory also says not to eat any striped bass taken from the Hudson from Troy Dam South to the Tappan Zee Bridge.
Adults are advised to have no more than one meal a month consisting of walleye, rainbow smelt, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, Atlantic needlefish, bluefish, northern pike or tiger muskellunge taken from the Hudson from Troy Dam south to and including Lower New York Harbor and to have no more than six blue crabs a month from the same part of the river.
The rule of only one meal a month also applies to striped bass taken from the Hudson from the Tappan Zee Bridge south to and including Lower New York Harbor.
None of the above recommendations apply to commercially caught fish.
As for preparing and cooking fish, the Health Department issued the following recommendations:
*Choose small fish. Older and larger fish may be more contaminated because they have had more time to accumulate contaminants in their bodies.
*Use a method of filleting fish that will reduce the skin, fatty material and dark meat, because those parts contain many of the contaminants.
*Cooking methods like broiling, poaching, boiling and baking, which allow contaminants from the fatty parts of the fish to drain out, are preferable. Pan frying is not recommended. Cooking liquids from fish should be avoided.
*For shellfish, do not eat the soft green substance found in the body section. These parts, known as the tomalley or liver, contain high levels of PCB's.
Additional information on the health advisory can be obtained by calling the State Health Department at (800) 458-1158.

THE ETHICS OF AUTHENTICITY
By Charles Taylor.
142 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press.
$17.95. 
 CHARLES TAYLOR is a philosopher of broad reach and many talents, but his most striking talent is a gift for interpreting different traditions, cultures and philosophies to one another. He is a Canadian who has taught at both McGill University and the Universite de Montreal; he is an admirer of Pope John Paul II, but he is a liberal and evangelical Roman Catholic whose instincts are more congregationalist than hierarchical.
When he was a professor in Oxford in the 1970's, he walked across the lawns of All Souls College like a man more at ease with a canoe upon his shoulder; yet his alliances to European intellectual life were closer and stronger than those of almost all his colleagues. He has been active in Canadian politics all his adult life, as an ardent defender of a maximum of decentralization and an equally ardent opponent of Quebec separatism.
If you did not know this, you might guess it from "The Ethics of Authenticity." Mr. Taylor writes about the agonies of the existentialist tradition in the down-to-earth idiom of Anglo-Saxon analytical philosophy; he ties what many critics have thought of as the crisis of the modern mind that began in the 16th and 17th centuries to the politics of the present Presidential campaign; and he comes across, if one dare say so, sounding much like that great North American mediator John Dewey.
This is less surprising than it sounds. Three years ago, Mr. Taylor published "Sources of the Self," significantly subtitled "The Making of the Modern Identity." There as here he drew on ideas that he spelled out more than a dozen years ago in his "Hegel," ideas that Dewey applied 50 and 60 years ago to just the same anxieties. One difference between them will be welcomed by his readers. If Mr. Taylor is no more stylish a writer than Dewey was, he is much brisker. He is also tougher-minded, and less willing than Dewey was to believe that the modern world is sure to live up to its better self. Much of "The Ethics of Authenticity" urges us to think more subtle thoughts; but the final chapter urges us into the polling booths, and into our town meetings. If the modern world is to live up to its potential, we the citizenry will have to work at it.
Mr. Taylor starts from a familiar place: we -- modern, affluent, secular North American we -- set an overwhelmingly high value on self-fulfillment, on the idea that each of us should find some way of life that satisfies us and is authentically our own. Yet this quest for self-fulfillment has backfired. Mr. Taylor takes three large complaints against modernity -- ones that, he says, "are discussed, bemoaned, challenged and argued against all the time in all sorts of media." The first complaint is that the rise of individualism has wrenched us loose from all the settings that gave meaning to the lives of our forebears; we have been thrown back on our inner resources, but when we look inside ourselves, we find emptiness because we have been cut adrift from everything that once supplied the resources we are seeking.
This is bound up with the second complaint -- what Mr. Taylor summarizes as "the primacy of instrumental reason." Our only understanding of what it is reasonable to do is based on efficiency and "cost-benefit" calculation. We are quite good at working out the best ways to make things happen, but less good at knowing whether we should be making those things happen in the first place. The way medical technique has made dying even more alarming than it used to be is a case in point; we have become very clever at keeping the dying body alive a little longer, but have forgotten how to care for the patient. We have lost the sense of the meaning of life and death that might -- to use Mr. Taylor's rather unlovely term -- "enframe" technique.
The last charge is political. We suffer under something that Herbert Marcuse was not the first observer to describe as the despotism of the system. A hundred years before, de Tocqueville feared that Americans might become "enclosed in their own hearts," that they would retreat to the security of their homes, abandon politics and therefore lose political control over their destiny. They would not suffer the terror of the police state; they might even live comfortable lives, but it would be the "pitiable comfort" threatened by Nie tzsche that they enjoyed, and existence would lack human dignity. Put the three charges together and we face "a loss of meaning . . . the eclipse of ends . . . [and] a loss of freedom."
Mr. Taylor's formidable skills of allusion and exegesis allow him to pack in an astonishing number of reference points -- to "The Closing of the American Mind," by Allan Bloom, and its obsession with relativism and subjectivism; to "The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism," by Daniel Bell, and its fear that capitalist affluence promotes hedonism, selfishness and amoralism; and beyond these to Heidegger's fears about technology, Max Weber's fears about the "iron cage" of the modern bureaucratic state, and a great deal more. Still, even Mr. Taylor has to concentrate his forces; the reconstruction of the modern moral consciousness is hardly to be achieved in 142 pages.
Wisely, he concentrates on the first charge, the complaint that individualism rots moral commitment, that when we think for ourselves we turn the world into a meaningless desert. This is wise because it is the fundamental issue. If there are forms of moral individualism that give the world meaning, that sustain community rather than eroding it, the other complaints are easier to deal with. If, to take one of Mr. Taylor's own examples, we learn to understand the natural world as having its own voice and its own meaning -- if not in the way our medieval predecessors saw it, as one of the texts by which God communicated with us, perhaps in the way Wordsworth or Emerson saw it -- we are already halfway to knowing where to draw the line over the exploitation of natural resources. If we see ourselves as already deeply implicated in the common life of our society, we ought to find it easier to reanimate our democratic faith.
The problem, Mr. Taylor says, is that individualism's supporters and critics have alike misunderstood it. Mr. Bloom's complaint that individualism produces the shallow relativism expressed by "everyone's entitled to his own views" is only a half-truth; the truer ethics of authenticity demand that each of us believes not whatever we feel like but only what we are genuinely persuaded of. This needs more than individual honesty. We need other people to set intellectual standards for us; we need other people to recognize our successes and failures. We need "horizons of significance." And in fact they exist, though they are underexplored. In other words, Mr. Taylor is culturally anxious, but he deplores cultural pessimism. Nostalgia will not do; everyone knows it is hopeless merely to try to turn the clock back. We have left the medieval world behind for good reasons. We have our own resources, and it is these we must explore.
THIS will not simplify life, but we know that. The incoherence of simple views is familiar. "Right-wing American-style conservatives speak as advocates of traditional communities when they attack abortion on demand and pornography," Mr. Taylor says; "but in their economic policies they advocate an untamed form of capitalist enterprise, which more than anything else has helped to dissolve historical communities, has fostered atomism, which knows no frontiers or loyalties, and is ready to close down a mining town or savage a forest habitat at the drop of a balance sheet."
Incoherence is not the exclusive property of the right: "On the other side, we find supporters of an attentive, reverential stance to nature, who would go to the wall to defend the forest habitat, demonstrating in favor of abortion on demand, on the grounds that a woman's body belongs exclusively to her. Some adversaries of savage capitalism carry possessive individualism farther than its most untroubled defenders."
That is well taken, if not novel. It is harder to come to grips with the underlying philosophical position. If we share Mr. Taylor's view that we can take our ethics seriously only when we tie them to a view of the "meaning" of nature and human existence, how do we know whether existence means what we suppose? The conventionally religious have an obvious advantage in answering such a question because they think they are playing a part in a script written by God; but what about the unconventionally religious and the agnostic others?
Mr. Taylor's short book is so full of good things that one cannot decently complain about what it leaves out. Still, at some point the author has to come clean: is the "meaning" he looks for no more than a projection of our hopes and desires (in which case critics of individualism will complain that it is not "objective" enough), or is it laid down by some nonhuman power (in which case the unbelievers will complain)? These are old questions; they were frequently directed at Dewey, and particularly after he published "A Common Faith." But they are inescapable, and they must make even the most sympathetic reader of "The Ethics of Authenticity" uneasy.

TWICE UPON A TIME
Stories.
By Daniel Stern.
239 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company.
$19.95. 
 SOMEONE I know, a well-known literary critic, was once admiringly called "the boy who loves books." The same glorious title could surely be awarded to Daniel Stern. He has taken his passionate connection to things written and used it as the starting point for the six ingenious stories in this dandy collection, "Twice Upon a Time."
As in his earlier "Twice Told Tales," Mr. Stern's idea is that the list of grains in the soul that itch their way out into fiction -- "a love affair, a trauma, a house, a mother, a landscape, a lover, a job or a sexual passion" -- should include the literature that has stuck to our imaginative ribs. In this book, that includes two poems by Wallace Stevens, three unsettling masterpieces of the short story (by Kafka, Hawthorne and Melville) and -- to show that the possibilities are limitless -- "The Communist Manifesto," by Marx and Engels (remember them?).
Mr. Stern, who has also written nine novels, has avoided competing with the originals and also the easy trick of simply putting new hats or painting mustaches on them -- outfitting Bartleby the scrivener in blue jeans or transferring Kafka's hunger artist to Little Italy. Instead, he snakes the inspiring story in and out of his own fiction, uses it to color the situation, makes the story itself a character as well as a metaphor. Although Mr. Stern does not make it necessary to reread the original, he makes doing so rewarding. And if that sounds as though these stories were fusty, musty and bookish, they are anything but. Mr. Stern writes with an antic exuberance that makes you search for comparisons -- Bernard Malamud with a dash of S. J. Perelman, say, or with a smidgen of the propulsive energy of Dickens. For a lover, Mr. Stern has also kept his wits about him, choosing for inspiration what most people would agree are some of the seminal imaginative works in world literature.
If there ever were stories that could be called lovable, here they are -- funny, generous, subtle and alive with characters who are just self-deprecating enough to be taken directly to heart. The settings are urban (Los Angeles, New York, Boston), and the characters usually word people, people with an edge, writers, public relations types, movie world types, academics for whom "Where is it written . . .?" is not just an expression. They speak with a wired-up intelligence:
"I told her of Jamie, the lovely Pre-Raphaelite actress who wanted to marry me and have children at once . . . and how I teased her with promises of reform, of getting out of bed early in the morning . . . of getting a job, renting an apartment, opening an account with the New York Telephone Company; promises all welshed on as Jamie's delicate features, her soft gray eyes and light-line mouth, grew weary and finally bitter. Then, one day, she vanished with a road company of 'Saint Joan' and left me alone once again."
The two Stevens-based stories are marvelous. "Sunday Morning by Wallace Stevens" (that's the title) is about a professor of literature, Osterweil, who finishes class one day with the absolute certainty that he is going to die, and that the only thing he desires in what remains of his life is to get a copy of Gilels's recording of the Beethoven C minor Piano Sonata, Opus 111, to be played at his funeral. As it turns out, he seems to find that death is the mother of beauty, as Stevens would have it -- in this case, beauty in the form of a love affair with a student. "The Man With the Blue Guitar by Wallace Stevens" is about a couple surprised into sexual rapture by the excitement of reading great poetry aloud, poetry so great that it keeps them from seeing "things as they are."
In "A Hunger Artist by Franz Kafka" a noted writer, Brandauer, on the usual academic teaching circuit starves the curriculum down to teaching only that one 14-page story "about a strange custom of fasting as an art form." As the narrator, a glutton and consumer of life, tells it, Brandauer is a man who could not find the spiritual or emotional food he liked. If he had, he might, as Kafka's hero insists, have stuffed himself like anyone else.
My favorite piece in "Twice Upon a Time" is the nearly novella-length "Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels," about a hopeful, naively idealistic young writer (who, we discover, is a distant relative of Karl Marx). A Candide who tries to find an ideology to live by, he grows older, grows up as one position after another falls apart under the force of real-world complexities. At the end it is the complexities that seize his heart, the "universe of 'missed points': religion, art, war . . . commerce, economics . . . philosophy, love." What a beautiful ending.
In fact, unlike much current fiction that concludes by vaporizing, Mr. Stern's stories have powerful endings. Like the musician he is (he has been a professional cellist), he can draw everything together to swell into a resounding coda. In the silence that follows, you can hear the sound of your own pulse.
 
 
 
MUSIC TO DIE FOR
 When Osterweil finished teaching the [Wallace] Stevens class he knew with an absolute certainty that he was going to die and he set out to find the piece of music that he wanted played at his funeral. Not just the particular piece, but the one recorded performance that would suffice, and no other. . . .
The latest nuance was his browsing among the great works of music for exactly the right selection to be played when he could no longer hear it. It was a strange training for the ear -- to hear the ineffable, or to hear through the ears of others, his mourning family and friends. Which ears: Lorelei, with her austere love for German art songs, or Stepner, who, frankly, preferred pop classics? It must be what composers have to do, he thought. Listen through the imaginary ears of others. Poets, too. He would find a way to use all this in one of his classes. That would take some of the pain out. -- From "Twice Upon a Time."

HEADLINE: For Shopping Centers, Less Is Becoming More

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH; Isadore Barmash, a former New York Times reporter, writes about business topics from New York.

 BODY:
This year, Melvin Simon & Associates, the nation's second-largest developer of shopping centers, plans to open only 10 new ones, compared with 80 just five years ago. Simon is not alone.
"We in the industry have overbuilt everywhere," Matthew Bucksbaum, president of the General Growth Corporation, a Des Moines mall builder, told a trade meeting last month. "New construction as far as large regional malls are concerned will be limited, and the owners of existing ones will have to depend on getting more results from their present centers. It's a whole new ball game." 
 Indeed, the shopping center industry, once the most dynamic sector in the real estate business, is going through hard times. The number of centers under construction nationwide declined sharply last year, to 552, from 1,008 in 1990 and 1,642 in 1988, according to the New York-based International Council of Shopping Centers.
But the overall decline in growth is masking an important shift among shoppers away from the big indoor malls and toward smaller shopping centers, both old and new, including the humble strip mall, industry experts say. The ball game now, they add, often is being determined by basic changes in the nation's buying habits.
Recession-pressed consumers, short on time as well as money, are gravitating in increasing numbers to more modest, compact centers, the industry experts say. Some of the smaller centers win loyalty because they are closer to home and offer easier access than the sprawling malls. Some have clusters of factory outlet stores that promise steep discounts. And still others are built around so-called category killers -- giant specialty stores like Home Depot, Price Club, Toys 'R' Us, Staples and T. J. Maxx -- that offer enormous display space, huge inventories and lower prices.
"Consumers have simply changed the way they shop," said Allan Hutensky, president of the Hutensky Group, a Hartford-based developer of smaller centers. "Because many families have two workers and are facing time pressures, they have become completely destination oriented in their shopping." Translation: they no longer have as much free time to walk the malls.
To be sure, many big malls are doing quite well, including the biggest of them all in this country, the new Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. And some smaller centers have been hurt by the recession and severe competition from other centers, both big and small. Still, as a group, the smaller centers are multiplying at a faster clip than their bigger siblings.
Between 1988 and 1991, the number of smaller centers, those under 400,000 square feet, grew at an overall rate of 16.8 percent, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Within that group, the so-called power centers, those with category-killer stores, jumped 22 percent. By contrast, the bigger complexes, those from 400,000 to more than a million square feet, grew by 12.4 percent.
What's more, the smaller centers appear to be closing the gap in annual sales per square foot. Centers ranging in size from 146,000 to 250,000 square feet, for example, gained $18 a square foot in sales, to $162.43, from 1987 to 1990, the last year for which data are available, according to the Urban Land Institute, a research organization. Regional malls, those with at least one department store, gained just $11 in that period, to $168.41.
THE smaller centers come in a variety of styles and shapes. There is, of course, the ubiquitous neighborhood strip center. But there are also factory outlet centers, like the upscale Woodbury Common Factory Outlets in Central Valley, N.Y., about 50 miles north of Manhattan. These seek to attract price-conscious customers who nonetheless want top brands and labels.
Spreading rapidly around the country, these outlet centers were kept in recent years 30 to 60 miles away from the suppliers' regular store accounts. But now, as suppliers are responding defensively to the protracted retailing slowdown, factory outlet developers are moving them closer to the prime retail markets, said Carleton Meyers, a consultant based in Burke, Va., who has brought producers and developers together in such centers for the last 12 years.
The power centers are the fastest-growing category of all. These belong broadly in the strip center group -- with about 200,000 to 400,000 square feet -- but unlike the general strip centers and regional malls, they do not need a big collection of small shops and service establishments to lure the public. The category killers are the "destination" virtually by themselves.
The Hutensky Group's Jordan Lane Shopping Center in Wethersfield, Conn., has two category killers -- T. J. Maxx, an apparel discounter, and Super Stop & Shop, a large food and general merchandise store -- among its 270,000 square feet.
The surge in retail complexes of moderate dimensions represents something of a U-turn for the shopping center industry. For years, developers promoted the huge malls as the wave of the future. And they were, for more than two and a half decades. But many malls are now shopworn and need renovation in look and in spirit.
The large regional malls, those with several department stores as anchors and the highest retail rents, have had a particularly bad time of it lately, clobbered by the lingering recession and a spate of department store bankruptcies. Developers, facing slumping demand, restraints on financing and a dearth of big building sites, have generally put the hold sign on anything but the most moderate new projects.
The sharp decline in the number of new malls "will allow for the absorption of existing vacant space as well as more deliberate decision-making by industry leaders to build centers where they are in demand," said John Konarski, research and education director of the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Ironically, one of the industry's biggest recent successes appears to be the truly huge Mall of America, which opened Aug. 11 in seeming defiance of the recession and industry trends.
At 4.2 million square feet, Mall of America dwarfs the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, Calif., which had been the biggest in the country with three million square feet. By comparison, the Roosevelt Field mall in Garden City, L.I., has about two million square feet while the Galleria in White Plains and the Short Hills Mall in Short Hills, N.J., have about one million each.
The 78-acre Mall of America offers plenty of shopping in its nearly 400 stores. But it also offers large dollops of entertainment. Among its other attractions are several nightclubs and the world's largest indoor amusement park, the seven-acre Camp Snoopy.
"We're very pleased with the initial results," said Herbert Simon, president of Indianapolis-based Melvin Simon & Associates, co-developer of the mall.
A million visitors a week trooped into the mall in the first month, said Maureen Hooley, the mall's public relations manager. "We're already exceeding our goal of 40 million visitors a year, which we had set for 1996," she said.
IF Mall of America can draw such crowds, can the other big malls follow by rekindling customer interest and curiosity through merchandise creativity or show-business skills? Or is it a matter of waiting until the economy turns around?
At least one developer is convinced that the industry doesn't have to wait.
"We are becoming more target-driven in our marketing," said Paul F. Kastner, senior vice president of the O'Connor Group, a New York-based developer. He said O'Connor was developing a data base of customer profiles "so we can segment it in various ways." He added, "For the back-to-school season, for example, we know which customers have school-age children and we can contact the families via direct mail and mass media for our tenants and malls."
To guarantee a future, some mall operators have bitten the bullet and undergone ambitious renovation programs. Roosevelt Field, for example, signed up Abraham & Straus to replace the department store that the bankrupt Alexander's chain closed. A number of smaller shops also were added.
But whether face lifts and sharper marketing will do the trick long term is unclear, industry experts said. And it is far from a sure bet that a million people a week will flock to Mall of America a year from now, or 10 years from now.
Mr. Bucksbaum, the Des Moines mall builder, posed the big unanswered question in his trade talk last month. "Is the Mall of America the end of an era for big malls," he asked, "or the beginning of a new one?"

THE FREEDMEN'S BUREAU AND BLACK TEXANS
By Barry A. Crouch.
Illustrated. 187 pp. Austin:
University of Texas Press.
$24.95. 
 AMERICANS have always been better at waging war than at winning the peace. From the War of 1812 to Desert Storm, our history shows that we have rarely known what we wanted to do once the fighting was over. The Civil War is a notable example of our failure to formulate clear war aims.
Aside from the preservation of the Union and (after the fighting began) the emancipation of the slaves, there was no agreement on the peace terms to be imposed on the South once the Confederate armies were defeated. Disagreement was sharpest over what was to be done for, or with, the more than three million African-Americans freed by the war. Many Northern whites thought that nothing more than liberty was due to the freedmen; others believed that they would need a generation or more of careful protection until they were used to the ways of freedom.
While this dispute raged, reports poured into Washington of the deprivation, suffering, hunger and disease among the "contrabands" who had flocked to the Union armies. Clearly something had to be done. Out of this need came the Freedmen's Bureau (technically the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands), established by Congress in 1865. The bureau was intended to be a temporary bridge from slavery to freedom. Under Gen. Oliver Otis Howard, the bureau gave out emergency Army rations to both whites and blacks in the South to prevent famine; it legalized marriages among the freedmen (which had been forbidden under slave law); it set up a system of free labor, under which the white landowners contracted with the black workers to grow the South's major staples; it encouraged education among the freedmen and, as far as possible, it tried to preserve public order. After 1868, when the Southern states adopted constitutions that guaranteed black suffrage, the bureau was, in effect, closed down; henceforth, presumably, blacks could protect themselves at the ballot box.
Historians unanimously judge that the Freedmen's Bureau failed to achieve its objectives. Even though W. E. B. Du Bois praised the "great work of social reform" the bureau attempted, and John A. Carpenter, Howard's biographer, claimed that it "performed near miracles," not even defenders of the bureau argue that it brought about a permanent improvement of race relations in the United States. Indeed, it is hard to see how anyone could so argue, for by the end of the Reconstruction period African-Americans continued to be treated as second-class citizens, continued to live in a virulently racist, segregated society and continued to be ruthlessly exploited in a sharecropping system that was little better than slavery.
But scholars have offered very different reasons for the failure of the bureau. George R. Bentley, whose "History of the Freedmen's Bureau" (1955) remains the standard account, charged that the bureau, by becoming a tool of the Radical wing of the Republican Party, sought "too much for the Negro too soon -- and not so much for his own sake as for the benefit of a faction of a party bent on the economic and political exploitation of the states where the Negroes lived." More recently William S. McFeely, in "Yankee Step father: O. O. Howard and the Freedmen" (1968), has argued that Howard and his subordinates failed because they were -- perhaps unconsciously -- racists, who sought to do what they thought was good for the freedmen without asking what the African-American community desired for itself.
"The Freedmen's Bureau and Black Texans," by Barry A. Crouch, a professor of history at Gallaudet University, approaches this subject from a different perspective. Because the papers of the bureau, which fill nearly 1,500 feet of shelf space at the National Archives in Washington, cannot be mastered by any individual scholar, most previous students have selectively sampled this vast collection and have written of the bureau from the viewpoint of its headquarters in Washington. Mr. Crouch has chosen to focus on a single state, Texas, and by concentrating on a few counties in that state he has been able to study all the relevant records, including some that were considered so local in interest that they were omitted from the 651-reel microfilm edition of the Freedmen's Bureau papers.
As a result he is able to show just how the bureau worked on the local level. Here are the day-by-day activities of the several assistant commissioners of the Freedmen's Bureau, who, with a skeleton staff of civilians and a handful of Union soldiers, were supposed to keep order in that huge state. Mr. Crouch concludes that, facing insuperable problems, "they acquitted themselves well." Here, too, are the stories of some of the sub-assistant commissioners, or agents, in charge of two to five counties each, whose reports, in pedestrian, bureaucratic prose, tell of former Confederates who, according to one agent, cherished a hatred of the national Government "as deep and damning as perdition itself," of race relations "bad as can be," and of Texans who flared into violence when blacks violated social protocol by "not walking out in the road when ordered to do so by the whites."
MR. CROUCH'S central chapter deals with one William G. Kirkman, a Freedmen's Bureau agent stationed in the village of Boston, in northeastern Texas. This Illinois-born agent tried to preserve order in a region comprising 1,838 square miles, where he had, at most, nine soldiers to help him. Boston was a violent community, where murder was an almost everyday occurrence. Though Kirkman initially reported to his superiors that most blacks and whites were attempting to "get along as quietly and as peacefully as possible," he soon discovered that the two races had "little sympathy for each other" and that whites' feelings toward their former bondsmen were "undescribable." He wanted to "pursue a mild and just course" of mediating between the races, but when he attempted to settle quarrels fairly between the freedmen and the landlords, he was ostracized by the entire white community.
Kirkman's life was repeatedly threatened, and the white sheriff of the county refused to give him any assistance or protection. A gang of white desperadoes vowed to kill him. Their leader was Cullen Montgomery Baker, a psychopath who enjoyed terrorizing local citizens and murdered blacks "for the mere sport of killing." Called out of his office at 2 A.M. on Oct. 7, 1868, Kirkman was gunned down in a fusillade fired from the shadows of a nearby house. His body, robbed of his revolver, his watch and three gold pieces, lay in the street for many hours, because the townspeople were too terrified to put their heads out of doors. "Capable, honest and persevering" is Mr. Crouch's epitaph for Kirkman, and it seems just.
Kirkman's assassination was a minor tragedy, not an event that changed the course of history. Yet it, and the other similar episodes in Texas Reconstruction history that Mr. Crouch relates, perhaps do more than broad generalizations to explain why the Freedmen's Bureau failed, and how we lost the peace after the Civil War.

HEADLINE: U.S. SET TO OPEN NATIONAL FORESTS FOR STRIP MINING

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is about to complete a policy change that will open millions of acres of national parks and forests to strip mining for coal except in cases where the Government buys the mineral rights from the families and energy companies that own them.
The policy change, in the form of a new Interior Department regulation that is due to become final shortly after Election Day, would give coal companies the authority to mine a mother lode of coal that now lies beneath 40 million acres of parks, preserves and protected lands in 24 states. The area holds roughly 16 percent of the nation's reserves. 
 Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. says that to prevent strip mining in 19 of the national parks, recreation areas and wildlife refuges that contain some of this coal the agency will buy the mineral rights from the owners.
 
Different Estimates of Value
 Mr. Lujan's aides said the coal reserves beneath these lands were worth just $11 million. But the coal industry and the National Wildlife Federation, an environmental group, said the Government would have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent mining in the national parks.
Last year, in one case alone, the United States Claims Court in Washington ordered the Interior Department to pay at least $150 million to a coal company barred from mining a protected area in Wyoming.
"It could be a bonanza for the coal industry," said L. Thomas Galloway, a Washington lawyer who specializes in environmental cases and an expert on strip-mining regulations. "They don't want to mine in the national parks. It would be too much of a public-relations disaster. But if they threaten to, the way this rule is set up, the Government would have no other choice but to pay them."
 
Ending 15 Years of Protection
 The new regulation, which has been in preparation for more than a year, would eliminate protections that Congress approved for these lands when it passed the Federal strip-mining law 15 years ago. The law bars mining in national parks and national forests and on millions of acres of private lands, except to those who hold a "valid existing right" to the coal.
But Congress never defined that term, and the Interior Department's efforts to do so have twice been struck down by a Federal District judge in Washington. As a result the Government adopted an unofficial policy that gave any coal owner who had sought to mine the coal up to the day the law was established, on Aug. 3, 1977, valid existing rights.
But a growing number of other Federal judges around the country have since ruled that this definition, never formally adopted, violates the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the Government from taking property without just compensation.
The new regulation, in effect, adopts these more recent court rulings as Government policy. "We view this new policy as an affirmation of the Fifth Amendment and a correct interpretation of the surface-mining law," Steven Goldstein, the chief spokesman for the Interior Department, said today.
The issuance of the final rule, expected in November, awaits the completion of an environmental-impact statement by the Interior Department.
The department says the public lands with the richest coal reserves are in eight national forests in Ohio, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.
In addition, hundreds of thousands of acres of state parks and wildlife refuges are likely to be opened for strip mining in Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois and Ohio.
The practice of strip mining in these public lands, in which layers of dirt and rock are blasted away to get at coal seams that often are 100 feet or more below the surface, largely ended in the 1980's under the Government's old interpretation of the strip-mining law.
For the past 15 months, President Bush has pressed for changes in environmental regulations, and he succeeded in relaxing restrictions on filling wetlands, cutting timber, exploring for oil, and mining copper, uranium and other minerals on Federal land.
 
Bush Advocates a Balance
 In a recent campaign appearance in Washington State, Mr. Bush said his development policy was vital to the American economy and balanced the interests of working people and conservationists. For their part, the Democrats' team, Gov. Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore, say the Administration is sacrificing the nation's natural heritage for the short-term benefit of industry.
Mr. Goldstein said there was no political motivation behind the rule on strip mining. "Often times good policy is good politics," he said, "but that was not the motivation for this new rule."
Introduced in a little-noticed entry in the Federal Register on July 18, 1991, the rule is a departure for the Bush Administration, which angered the energy industry in 1989 by withdrawing a similar regulation proposed by the Reagan Administration to allow strip mining in national parks and national forests.
In doing so, the Bush Administration stepped into a long-running policy struggle over valid existing rights, the term Congress left undefined when it passed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act in 1977.
 
Who Owns Mineral Rights
 Mineral rights in public parks, forests other lands are usually held not by the Government but by families and energy companies. The reason is that when the Government establishes a park or refuge or forest, it typically saves money by buying only what is on the surface. Anything below ground remains in the hands of the previous landowner, and the rights to it can be sold to others.
After passage of the 1977 law, the Carter Administration tried to define valid existing rights as those that were held by any mineral owner who had a permit to mine the coal.
But in 1980 that definition was struck down by Federal District Judge Thomas A. Flannery in Washington, who said it was too strict. He ruled that the authority to mine should also be given to mineral owners and lease holders who had made a good-faith effort to gain them before the law was passed.
Judge Flannery's opinion in effect became the Government policy for defining valid existing rights in most coal-mining states.
But with increasing frequency, other Federal judges have ruled that the policy still infringed on the right of families and coal companies to develop their holdings. Prompted by these decisions, the Interior Department worked up its new definition of valid existing rights.
 
Other Fights on Strip Mining
 There have been many battles over the years over the right to dig strip mines in national forests and on other public lands. But in recent months the debate has been thrown into sharp relief in southern Ohio, where coal has been mined since the early years of the century from hills that are thick with ash and oak.
In the Wayne National Forest, a plan by the Belville Coal Company to mine 7,200 acres has drawn attention in the Interior Department and the White House. The company's owner, 58-year-old Thomas J. Belville, who rose from a hardscrabble childhood and a high school education to help found Lawrence County's largest coal company, is also an active Republican and a Bush supporter.
Mr. Belville acknowledges that his political connections helped him in December 1988, when the Interior Department determined that he had the valid existing right to strip-mine more than 11 square miles of the national forest that may contain 15 million tons of coal.
But he was flabbergasted a year later when the department reversed the earlier decision, withdrew the right and prohibited the mining. "That was my thank-you for being so loyal to George Bush," he said.
 
Mine Owner Goes to Court
 Mr. Belville responded by filing a lawsuit in the Claims Court in Washington and two more in Federal District Court in Cincinnati asserting that what the Government did was illegal under the Constitution and the strip-mining law. The lawsuits are being closely followed by the coal industry because the legal precedents set here are likely to have implications in other states.
Mr. Belville won the two District Court lawsuits last year, including one in which the Federal judge said the Government had no authority to take away Mr. Belville's right to strip mine coal he owned or controlled. The Government is appealing both decisions. The Government also is seeking to settle the Claims Court suit by giving Mr. Belville the right to begin strip-mining 40 acres of the national forest.
Mr. Belville's opponents, including hunters and lumber companies, argue that strip mining represents the last wasteful stage of an industrial revolution that has run its course in Ohio and other Appalachian coal states, including Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky.
 
Can Land Be Reclaimed
 "After mining, there is real doubt that there is a future sustainable economic practice available for that land," said Judith Dumke, a botanist and resident of Chesapeake, Ohio. "Most reclaimed land from strip mining produces little timber and is worthless as grassland. I have no animosity to Tom Belville. He does his best with reclamations. But we're still dealing with marginal soil types. After it's mined, it's not going to produce jobs."
Mr. Belville asserts that strip mines can be reclaimed and turned into rolling grasslands that can be used as pastures or habitat for wildlife.
Representative Nick J. Rahall, a West Virginia Democrat who heads the House Interior Subcommittee on Mining and Natural Resources, said the Administration's proposal would open too much public land to development and violated the intent of the strip mining law.
Mr. Rahall has proposed an amendment to the Energy Bill, now under discussion by a House-Senate conference committee, that would invalidate the Administration's rule and restore the definition of valid existing rights that has been used by the Government and most coal mining states since 1980.
Mr. Rahall, however, said that the amendment was under attack by the coal industry and Republican members of the conference committee and that it may not survive in Congress or the courts. "I'm quite sure that if the public knew how much of the nation's most beautiful lands were threatened with strip mining, they would not stand for what the Administration is doing," he said. "But the Interior Department has done a good job at keeping this quiet and I'm not sure we're going to be able to stop it."

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar Makes U.S. World's Bargain Bazaar

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The declining dollar has turned the world's wealthiest economy into the Filene's basement of industrial countries. Despite its rebound during the European currency crisis, the dollar, which fell to record lows this summer, remains extraordinarily weak by historical standards.
To the Swiss businessman just off the Concorde, the $120 tab for a room at the Plaza looks like the lunch check back home. To the teen-ager from Paris, the $9 sticker on the tape at Tower Records and the $30 tag on a pair of Levi 501's read like big signs that say buy one, get one free. 
 Life in the United States may not seem like a bargain to the many Americans whose incomes have been pinched by nearly four years of economic stagnation. But in fact, the weakling dollar has made the United States the least expensive rich country for people to visit and shop, and for businesses to manufacture their products.
The image of the United States as the world's bargain bazaar might suggest a kind of place where tourists flock for cut-rate vacations and where labor is cheap, living standards are low and products and services lack sophistication and quality.
But the United States is hardly a third world nation. Its citizens still enjoy the highest standard of living and are the world's most productive workers. Their pay, measured in terms of the goods and services it can buy in the United States as opposed to foreign countries, is higher than in Canada, Germany or Japan.
To some extent, the dollar's low value -- especially compared with the 1950's and 1960's -- does reflect the growing economic clout and economic prowess of other nations and America's shrinking economic lead.
But the dollar's weakness is not expected to be permanent, since it stems mostly from unusually high interest rates in Germany and unusually low rates in the United States -- and the momentarily different policy goals of Bonn and Washington.
"These are extraordinary times in Europe," said Philip Suttle, an economist at J. P. Morgan. "It's the mirror image of the extreme and unsustainable dollar spike in the 1980's."
Most foreign-exchange traders and forecasters expect the dollar to recover a bit more, as the gap in interest rates narrows again, which is likely when the German economy slows further and the American recovery gathers steam.
 
Bargain Bunch of Lilies
 Think of a low dollar as a special promotion of American-made products and services -- not a "going out of business" sale. Still, bargains clearly abound. For example, a $50 bunch of lilies ordered through Calyx and Corolla set a Japanese suitor back nearly 7,000 yen a year ago when it took 137 yen to buy a dollar. The same bunch costs him just 6,000 yen now, one reason the San Francisco flower mail-order house is doing a brisk overseas business.
One measure of how cheap the dollar became even before its latest bout of weakness, according to Michael Roberts at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, is that it took just $100 in May of this year to buy the same basket of consumer goods and services in the United States that cost $170 in Sweden and $128 in Germany.
Despite economic troubles in many other rich countries, many travelers are taking advantage of the bargains here. More than 1.5 million Germans, 8 percent more than last year, are expected by the United States Tourism and Travel Agency this year, along with 3.4 million Japanese.
 
Not Much English Is Spoken
 "Some days very little English is spoken in our shop," said Thomas K. Woodard, a New York quilt dealer. "Most of our customers are in the enviable position of not having to worry about finances, but they are absolutely thrilled when they save money."
For foreigners in strong-currency countries, coming here is almost cheaper than staying at home. The weekend rate at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, for example, is $89 for a double per night, half the rate of comparable hotels in Munich, London or Rome. A Big Mac is one-third to one-half cheaper here. A movie ticket is one-fifth to one-half as much.
Or take that classic, a trip to Disney World. For a Frankfurt family, a week in Orlando could easily cost less than a visit to Euro Disney. As it turns out, one-third more foreign tourists than last year have arrived at Orlando International Airport.
 
More Than Theme Parks
 In addition to shaking hands with Mickey, tourists from abroad are definitely doing more shopping. Japanese tourists are crowding the counters at Tiffany's, where clerks are familiar with Japanese ring sizes. And computer-literate Germans are buying laptops -- available here at 20 to 30 percent below current retail prices in Germany.
Alert American entrepreneurs are looking for ways to capitalize on the trend. For example, Rex Fritchi, a Chicago travel agent, and Swissair are talking about offering a weekend shopping package this winter to enable Europeans to share the pleasures of off-price shopping at Gurnee Mall, a large mall outside the city. "We could fill up plane loads just coming over to buy bed sheets, shirts, socks and underwear," he said.
Some Europeans and Japanese are ordering directly from American catalogue emporiums. One of the most popular catalogues, L. L. Bean, the woodsy Maine clothier, has had to expand the number of customer service representatives who handle foreign orders to 60, from 12. Orders are up 50 to 100 percent this year over last, said Richard Leslie, director of international marketing.
The cheaper dollar also makes conventional American exports like aircraft, chemicals and machinery cheaper, especially in Europe. A Bureau of Labor Statistics index of prices of exports in various countries shows that prices of imports to the United States have risen about 40 percent more in dollars than prices of American exports.
"Every day the dollar gets weaker I'm very happy," said Andreas Barth, senior vice president at Compaq Computer's European division in Munich. "The Europeans are unhappy because it decreases the competitive position of their exports."
 
More Than Cheap Dollar
 Not all of the cost differentials stem from currency play. American factory productivity has been growing robustly for a decade and inflation in the United States compares favorably with Germany and Japan. Both trends hold down costs.
In fact, the United States has been one of world's low-cost producers since the late 1980's. American factory productivity remains, on average, the highest in the world -- 10 percent higher than in Japan and nearly 40 percent higher than in Germany. Pay measured in dollars at today's exchange rates is roughly the same as in Japan, and 25 percent lower than in Germany.
Arthur Neef, chief of the international division at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, says productivity is growing faster here than in Europe while wages are rising more slowly.
Take Hugo Boss Fashions, the Italian-German company that produces in Cleveland 80 percent of the $800 suits it sells in the United States. "We wanted to be close to the customer, American workers are extremely productive and, at the present value of the dollar, American wages are very competitive," said Jean de Jaegher, president and chief executive of IFAC, the holding company that owns Hugo Boss.
 
Slowdowns in Other Countries
 To be sure, the latest decline in the dollar is not likely to bring about an export boom or eliminate the trade deficit quickly, said Robert Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Europe and Japan are suffering economic slowdowns, preventing consumers and businesses from spending freely.
And foreigners are staying away from the stock, bond and real estate markets in droves. "You can go bargain hunting in goods and services and tourism," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services. "But real estate is depressed everywhere. Stocks aren't bargains. And bonds are expensive."
Provided that the dollar's latest bout of weakness does not end in a panicky dumping of American assets, few economists consider a cheap dollar a big problem and most betit will strengthen a bit more as German rates come down and American rates stop falling -- perhaps sometime next year.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN
The Governor: Clinton in Arkansas -- A special report.;
An Early Loss Cast Clinton As a Leader by Consensus

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
In a Victorian meeting room on the second floor of the Arkansas Capitol, the state's former governors, captured in oil paint, maintain an unblinking vigil. Among these white-haired figures, Bill Clinton, looking oddly youthful and overeager, has already taken his place.
Mr. Clinton has been Governor of Arkansas since 1982. But as his portrait indicates, he is also a former governor; his first term ended in defeat in 1980. More than his accomplishments, this defeat defined his identity. 
 Even now, 12 years later, Mr. Clinton still speaks about the mistakes that drove him from office and of the intense self-examination that enabled him to make a comeback two years later as if they were very much fresh in his mind.
"I spent a whole lot of time trying to figure out where I messed up," he said in a recent interview. "How did I turn people off? What did I do wrong? What decisions could I have made differently? How could I have maintained a stronger level of support for change?"
 
Talking to the Disaffected
 Mr. Clinton said what he learned from his two years out of office was to be more sensitive to the concerns of his constituents. Talking to the voters who had turned him out of office, he discovered "they thought I spent more time doing what I wanted to do and no time listening to them, no time taking them along and communicating with them."
But friends and opponents of Mr. Clinton say the lessons he learned were more complicated.
The young Governor had discovered the dangers of pushing through an agenda ahead of public opinion and the risks of fighting the state's business establishment. As a result, he became much more sensitive to the vagaries of public opinion and much more adept in the art of accommodation.
Betsey Wright, the Governor's former chief of staff and now a top campaign aide, describes the transformation this way: "What he learned from the loss was that government officials, no matter how smart and idealistic they are, cannot decide what's best for the people and just do it."
Others put it less delicately. Ernie Dumas, who wrote editorials at the now-defunct Arkansas Gazette, suggested that Mr. Clinton learned the art of compromise rather too well: "His greatest drawback is he does not like to make enemies."
By all accounts, Mr. Clinton's first term was a time of unusual energy and conflict, at least by Arkansas standards. The Governor, only 32 when he was elected, raised car license fees to finance a highway repair campaign, pushed for a new system of rural health clinics and held hearings to consider limits on clear-cutting in the state's forests. He had wide-ranging plans for improving education and developing industry and increasing energy conservation, and when his plans were blocked -- as they often were -- he did not hesitate to make his displeasure known.
David Matthews, a friend of Mr. Clinton and a former state Representative, recalled how in his first term the Governor used to keep a chart of how each state legislator had voted on his initiatives and call the recalcitrant ones down to discuss their positions. The legislators, many of whom were twice Mr. Clinton's age, were not amused. "It developed tremendous strains," Mr. Matthews said.
Mr. Clinton was slow to realize that his youthful activism was alienating Arkansas's essentially conservative electorate as well. Not until a few weeks before the election did he realize how far his support had eroded. Friends say that when he lost to Frank White, a Republican, he was devastated.
Upon leaving office, Mr. Clinton joined a law firm in downtown Little Rock and began the painstaking process of analyzing his loss and planning his comeback. He tried, he said, to sort out his political problems from the problems of the country as a whole. This analysis would consume him for most of the next two years.
"For the first time in my adult life, I could work a 40-hour week again," Mr. Clinton said. "I began to read as much as I could, trying to figure out what was happening to America, how we got into the economic tailspin we were in in 1980, those things that were beyond my immediate control that shaped the attitudes and the feelings and the lives of my folks. That was an extremely valuable time for me. What I tried to do when it was over was make it a learning experience."
 
A Change in Style
 The conclusions that Mr. Clinton reached during this period of reading and thinking were evident in the changes in his style. If his first term was characterized by brashness, contention and a lack of focus, the subsequent terms were marked by caution, compromise and a search for consensus.
"That defeat was really the seminal experience of his career," said Dick Morris, who served for many years as Mr. Clinton's chief political adviser but is currently not working for either Presidential candidate.
While some critics contend that his defeat transformed Mr. Clinton into little more than a political weather vane, a review of the Governor's 12 years in office suggests that this criticism is overstated.
Throughout his political career, Mr. Clinton continued to push for an activist government in Arkansas, one that worked to improve education and basic services.
But after his defeat, the Governor decided to adapt more to the political culture of Arkansas, which was dominated by the state's major industries and supported by an essentially anti-government electorate. He backed off from several proposals that had offended the state's most powerful businesses, and he shied from tackling Arkansas's historically regressive tax structure. And he began to rely much more heavily on polls.
"I think Bill Clinton has a very true compass," Mr. Morris, who now works only for Republicans, said. "I don't think that varies much with public opinion. But within the general proposition he wants to go north, he will take an endless variety of routes. He's constantly maneuvering, constantly picking the routes he wants to get there, maneuvering his opponents into positions where they can't get a clear shot at him. That is what leaves a legacy of 'Slick Willie.' "
 
Lessons
Conciliation Is Put At Top of Agenda
 In the 10 years since he returned to office, Mr. Clinton's devotion to consensus has assumed near-legendary proportions in Little Rock.
Indeed, so eager is the Governor to conciliate his opponents that his supporters complain, only half-jokingly, that it is often more advantageous to be his enemy than his friend. Mr. Clinton's most vocal critics often find themselves appointed to head state boards and commissions. And while other politicians may cultivate fear as a political weapon, at the Capitol in Little Rock, there is little fear of punishment from Governor Clinton.
Brownie Ledbetter, who is widely active in Arkansas political and social affairs, said, "Nobody is afraid of Bill."
Mr. Clinton's fall from grace in Arkansas was a product not just of political but also of cultural differences: many voters saw the Yale-educated Governor as an Easterner, and his habit of appointing out-of-staters to key posts in his first administration did little to persuade them otherwise. In his subsequent administrations, the Governor -- who generally gets decent marks for his appointments -- has filled the majority of high-level posts with Arkansans.
Often accused in his first term of being inaccessible, Mr. Clinton in his later terms became positively unavoidable. During the legislative sessions, he took to walking the white marble halls of the Capitol, coffee cup in hand, keeping tabs on legislation. He put in frequent appearances at committee hearings to lobby on behalf of his own proposals, and often he could be found squatting down next to some lawmaker's chair, trying to persuade him to come around.
During the 1983 session, Mr. Matthews recalled, Mr. Clinton spent so much time in the House members' lounge buttonholing lawmakers that the Legislature passed a rule expressly banning the Governor from their private domain.
Lawmakers describe him as tremendously persuasive; he often comes armed with statistics on how a bill will affect each legislative district. As a result, the Governor managed to amass a respectable record, persuading the Legislature to overhaul the state's job-development program, to increase money for health care, to create a statewide college scholarship program and to settle a longstanding school-desegration case.
To be sure, there have been several notable occasions when consensus failed and Mr. Clinton went head to head with the Arkansas Legislature, a body openly dominated by the state's utilities and its major industries, poultry and timber. But unlike in his first term, when the Governor took on the state's special interests on a number of fronts, he limited his fights in later years to a few well defined topics.
Supporters call this pragmatism. But critics call the Governor's decision to limit his goals a cynical calculation about what it takes to win re-election.
"From my perspective, Clinton has catered to certain parts of the business community," said Bruce McMath, an environmental lawyer in Little Rock who has pressed unsuccessfully for more vigorous regulation of the state's industries. "He's a consummate politician. He's done it all his life."
 
Priorities
Taxes Enacted To Help Schools
 Probably the most ferocious, and the most consequential, battles that Mr. Clinton has fought as Governor come under the banner of improving education. In 1983, responding to a court challenge to Arkansas's school aid formula, Governor Clinton pushed through legislation to increase spending on education, reduce class sizes and introduce teacher-competency testing. The package encountered fierce resistance from the state teachers' union, which resented the testing provision, and from many voters, who were disturbed by the increase in the state sales tax, to 4 percent from 3 percent. (Later the tax would be raised another half-cent.)
Even foes of the Governor give him credit for increasing school financing and slowly beginning to pull Arkansas up from the bottom of national education rankings. But many political observers in Arkansas accuse him of compromising too quickly on other issues, like environmental quality and tax fairness.
John Brummett, political editor of The Arkansas Times, said that both times Mr. Clinton raised the sales tax, he had promised to exempt food and utilities from the increase. But neither time did he fight for such an exemption.
"It was doable," Mr. Brummett said, "if only he had applied himself."
So reluctant is the Governor to offend that he sometimes creates confusion. In meetings with lobbyists and lawmakers, Mr. Clinton has the tendency to express sympathy with whatever group happens to be in the room. Aides to the Governor say that if callers mistake empathy for a firm commitment of support, this is their problem.
Many Arkansas politicians, however, say that the practice of nodding agreement in private, then insisting in public that no commitment has been made amounts to little more than duplicity. At a labor gathering in 1990, J. Bill Becker, president of the Arkansas A.F.L.-C.I.O., issued a famous denunciation of the Governor as a man who would "pat you on the back" and then proceed to urinate on your leg.
On occasion, too, the Governor's reluctance to antagonize has landed him in some curious binds.
In 1985, for instance, the Legislature approved a bill providing a tax credit of up to $200 for contributions to Arkansas colleges and universities. The Governor's staff urged him to veto the bill as far too costly, and he did so.
That evening, though, when he called the lobbyists who had backed the bill to inform them of his decision, they insisted that he had assured them otherwise. Rather than risk the enmity of the group, the Governor dispatched a state trooper to the Capitol and had him fish the bill out from under a door in the House of Representatives. Where he had stamped "Disapproved" on the bill, he crossed out the "dis" and signed his initials. Later, to slow the drain on the State Treasury, he was forced to call a special session to amend the bill.
With time, Mr. Clinton's relentless quest to convince every interest group in Arkansas that they are gathered under one oversized tent has naturally become more difficult, and several times he has faced strong challengers. But while other Southern governors with similar approaches (Buddy Roemer of Louisiana and Ray Mabus of Mississippi) have been defeated, Mr. Clinton has held on to office and, in fact, has remained popular.
Even a frequent critic like Ms. Ledbetter can, when discussing the Governor, sound oddly sentimental: "We know that Bill loves us and we love him. He cares about us, and that's the bottom line."
 
Strategies
Ready to Attack Or Apologize
 To say that Mr. Clinton continues to live by the lessons of his early defeat is, in a way, to understate the case. Even the campaign strategies he learned in his hard-fought comeback are the same ones he has used in this campaign. Among those lessons: make the most of charisma; be prepared to apologize for mistakes, and, when necessary, go negative.
The 1982 campaign started with a personal appeal to the voters who had turned him out. Within six months of his defeat, Mr. Clinton began traveling the state again, meeting with voters in small groups, listening to their concerns and fixing them with his earnest gaze. (When his Presidential campaign ran into trouble in New Hampshire, Mr. Clinton would turn to a similar kind of micro-campaigning to reverse a slide in the polls.)
"In May of '81, I actually started going out again, making high school commencement speeches," he recalled. "I'd make these little speeches, and I'd get whoever ran the county for me before to get up a group of people afterward and we'd just sit around and talk."
A lot of the talk ran toward the confessional. Many voters admitted that they had wanted to teach the overconfident young Governor a lesson, but now regretted his defeat; for his part, Mr. Clinton said he was sorry that he had lost touch and appeared arrogant.
In early 1982, Mr. Clinton took the unusual step of running a commercial, which aides called "Mea Culpa," explicitly apologizing for some of the mistakes of his first term and promising to heed his constituents more closely if he were re-elected.
"That experience of being able to handle criticism by apologizing is one that he has repeated time and again," Mr. Morris said. When in the wake of the Gennifer Flowers controversy, Mr. Clinton appeared on "60 Minutes" and expressed regret for any pain he had caused in his marriage, Mr. Morris said, "that was all out of that 1982 playbook."
Before losing the governorship, Mr. Clinton had eschewed negative advertisements; indeed, in 1980, when his opponent ran commercials calling him responsible for recent riots by Cuban refugees being housed in Fort Chaffee, Ark., the Governor had not even bothered to respond. This was a mistake he would not repeat.
In 1982, facing both a tough primary and a general election, Mr. Clinton ran rough negative advertisements against his Democratic rivals and later against his Republican opponent, Mr. White. He never let an attack go unanswered, a strategy that the Clinton campaign pursues today from its "war room" in Little Rock.
 
Ambitions
Blending Aptitude And Appetite
 That Mr. Clinton would one day run for office, perhaps even for the highest office in the country, has never been much in doubt.
Rick Stearns, now a judge in Massachusetts, met Mr. Clinton when the two were heading off to England with their fellow Rhodes scholars on the liner United States. While most of the young men were eyeing one another warily on the pier, Mr. Clinton was already busy introducing himself, exhibiting the same gregariousness that he would later use to such advantage with voters.
"Even at that age, Bill struck me as one of the most natural politicians I had ever met," Judge Stearns said. "When he talks to people, he has the ability to fix on them and give them the impression they are the most important people in the universe. I knew within 45 minutes of meeting him that he was going to run for President."
Like Judge Stearns, most of Mr. Clinton's friends speak admiringly and unreservedly about the innate political skills he has demonstrated ever since he was a boy.
David Leopoulos, a friend since grade school, recalled that even as a child Mr. Clinton was always ready to make the first overture. "He'd walk up to you and say: 'Hi, I'm Bill. What's your name?' " Mr. Leopoulos said.
To counter the notion of Mr. Clinton as a natural-born politician in this year of anti-political fervor, the Clinton campaign has been pushing an account of the candidate's youth that stresses adversity as the source of his strengths. According to this version of the Governor's biography, the fact that the Governor's stepfather, Roger Clinton, was a sometimes abusive alcoholic is supposed to explain, for example, why he has insistently sought affection and shunned conflict.
Interestingly enough, though, Mr. Clinton's childhood friends say they had no idea until the campaign began that he had had a troubled family. Neither Bill nor his mother gave any signs of being abused, and their house was a gathering place for local teen-agers.
Mr. Leopoulos recalls going over to the Clintons' after school to play touch football on the lawn and riding around town while Bill sang Elvis Presley songs.
 
Shaking Thousands of Hands
 Mr. Clinton made his first run for office in 1974; he was an unknown, 28-year-old law professor teaching at the University of Arkansas challenging a popular four-term Congressman. It was an unlikely race, and he lost. But during the campaign he met, by his own estimates, some 100,000 voters -- 10 percent of the state's electorate -- and on the strength of his energy and persuasiveness, he established a name for himself in Arkansas politics. Four years later he became Governor.
A politician who has always believed in his ability to win people over one by one, Mr. Clinton these days is running a national campaign very much on the same principle that he used to conquer Arkansas. Schedules have little meaning. Even with thousands of people waiting at his next stop and dozens of national journalists trailing him, he will still pause, as he did recently in Corsicana, Tex., and spend five minutes trying to win over a school teacher nervous about his program for education.
Variously celebrated as "responsiveness" and vilified as "slickness," Governor Clinton's ability to engage with voters might just be called good politics. In a year when politicking is much maligned, though, Mr. Clinton is reluctant to call it that. When asked in an interview whether he thought he was a "good politician," Mr. Clinton hesitated and then threw the question back: "How do you define that?"
Invited to interpret the term for himself, Mr. Clinton said: "If being a good politician means that I've been able to be re-elected in tough times as well as good times, and have been able to build a broad base of support for priorities that were both important and that required the people of my state to change, then I plead guilty."

Chart: "Clinton as Governor: 12 Years at Arkansas' Helm
In April, The New York Times examined Bill Clinton's accomplishments in 12 years as Governor of Arkansas, focusing on several major areas he would have to tackle if he were President. Following is a summary of the main findings.
 
CIVIL RIGHTS
More blacks and women have been appointed to boards, commissions and departments under Mr. Clinton than under any Arkansas chief executive. Mr. Clinton has appointed blacks as the state's chief financial officer, health commissioner and head of the Department of Social Services.
Yet Mr. Clinton's achievements are no better than those of many other governors nationwide, and his administration has been criticized for its record in providing legal protection for blacks and in improving their economic conditions.
Arkansas is one of only nine states that have no law banning discrimination in the sale and rental of housing. It is one of only two states (Alabama is the other) with no civil rights law barring racial discrimination in hiring and promotion. Mr. Clinton supported such a bill in the Legislature last year, but it failed.
 
EDUCATION
Arkansas has done much to improve its schools under Mr. Clinton's leadership -- increasing expenditures, requiring competency tests for teachers, broadening curriculums, setting new academic standards, slowing the dropout rate and encouraging greater college attendance.
The gains resulted in part from a court order that instructed the state to improve its education system.
Even with the gains, the Arkansas school system, ranked among the worst in the nation when Mr. Clinton first took office, is still near the bottom in most national ratings.
 
ENVIRONMENT
Clinton supporters point to Arkansas' rich supply of natural resources, clean air and water as evidence of the Governor's successful balancing of economic goals and environmental protection. But critics say his hands-off approach to conservation is sacrificing the state's natural gifts to industrial interests.
The state has some serious environmental problems, including pollution of the Kings River with agricultural wastes. To deal with that, Mr. Clinton appointed a committee of executives and state officials and asked it to recommend ways to persuade farmers to improve waste disposal voluntarily, without tough regulations.
That approach was typical for Mr. Clinton, who has usually dealt with problems not by proposing new rules but through voluntary guidelines and tax incentives intended to encourage businesses to change their ways.
 
INCOME
One of the enticements to business in Arkansas has been that wages are relatively low. Seventy-five percent of the state's households earn less than $35,000 a year, as against 61 percent of households nationwide.
Some state officials say the low income figures are misleading because they are not adjusted for a lower cost of living.
 
JOBS
A generally warm and cooperative attitude toward business, including the tax breaks, has created robust job growth in the last decade. State officials point to a 3 percent rate of job growth last year, ranking Arkansas fifth in the nation. It ranked eighth the year before that.
State officials also like to note that the 200,000-plus jobs added in the last decade included a high concentration of manufacturing positions, particularly in food processing, one of the state's biggest industries.
 
TAXES
Arkansas has been cooperative about providing special tax provisions, like multimillion-dollar credits or exemptions from sales taxes, intended to attract businesses. In at least one case, however, a big tax break induced a company to modernize in ways that resulted in a reduction of jobs.
Mr. Clinton and other state leaders are hamstrung to an extent because the State Constitution prevents increases in the state income tax without three-quarters approval by the Legislature. Consequently, some of the business-tax preferences and other factors have forced the state rely increasingly on the sales tax for revenue.
Other taxes raised in Mr. Clinton's terms have included those on cigarettes, insurance premiums and gasoline.
But also during Mr. Clinton's terms, several thousand of the lowest-income taxpayers were given blanket exemptions from income taxes.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Uses Farm Speech to Begin New Offensive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANOLA, Iowa, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Stripped across the top of The Des Moines Register this morning was a banner headline: "Clinton Explains Plans for Rural U.S."
The accompanying article, based on an interview with Mr. Clinton, was long and thoroughly positive in tone, as it outlined what the newspaper called the Democratic Presidential nominee's "plan to help rural America." 
 Campaign officials billed Mr. Clinton's speech today to a group of several thousand people gathered in a great, green meadow here about 20 miles south of Des Moines as the unveiling of a comprehensive economic plan for rural America.
But the speech did not include any major new initiatives in rural policy; it was instead a compilation of broad, vague promises to help farmers, along with the usual denunciations of his political opponent, President Bush.
The three-page policy memorandum the campaign provided to reporters outlined Mr. Clinton's farm policy ideas with more specificity, but almost all of those ideas have been around the Clinton campaign for some time. The ideas listed included improving rural health care, establishing not-for-profit rural "community banks" to make capital more available to farmers, supporting Federal farm export and subsidy programs at current or expanded levels and subsidizing a support program for the production of the corn-based fuel ethanol.
The paucity of new ideas suggests that the point of the lightning visit to a state where Mr. Clinton enjoys substantial support in the polls had much more to do with a new political offensive than with any new policy initiative.
It is part, Clinton aides said, of a mix of tactics intended to keep Mr. Bush on the ropes, defending his record and defending his electoral base.
In speeches, the offensive will have Mr. Clinton stressing the theme he introduced last week, that he was the sort of "new Democrat" who could lead the country into an era of change, and that Mr. Bush was some sort of Hooveresque retro-President, able to deliver the politics and policies of the past.
George Stephanopoulos, the Clinton campaign's communications director, said the offensive would also feature frequent trips into states previously regarded as safe Republican territory, to force Mr. Bush to spend valuable time trying to secure an electoral base that seems to be slipping away.
That tactic was in evidence Saturday when Mr. Clinton whipped through stops in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, states that have not voted Democratic in any Presidential election since the 1960's, but where polls show Mr. Clinton ahead of Mr. Bush.
It was on display again late tonight, when Mr. Clinton flew from Iowa to South Dakota, long considered a Republican safehold, to speak to several thousand people who waited for hours in a chill, blustery wind in the paddock of an Arabian horse ranch.
Standing on a makeshift stage in the town of Baltic, Mr. Clinton spoke for a half hour, then worked his way through the crowd, which surged around him as he moved. The Democrat took clear pleasure in finding such an audience in such a state, as he urged the crowd to take a chance on a Democratic ticket in November. "You don't have to be as bright as a tree full of owls to know that it's time America got rid of trickle-down economics," he said.
The campaign regards the use of speeches packaged as "policy initiatives" as a valuable part of the offensive. Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, said the campaign would now roll out one or more such speeches a week. "They will not be a lot of new stuff, but be expansions of ideas we have already put forward, with a few new elements," she said. "They give us a hundred new weapons to talk about the economy and to say to voters that we've already put out a program, and Bush hasn't."
Mr. Clinton's oratory today -- a straightforwardly political combination of denouncing the opposition and promising the future -- made clear the real nature of this "policy" speech.
"Bush promised to expand farm exports, but when the opportunities come, he just sort of hems and haws about them," Mr. Clinton said.
He blamed the President for lost sales of pork and wheat to Russia, saying Mr. Bush had delayed the deals in hope of timing them to his political advantage. "He sat on it, and diddled around on it, and finally other country's got the sale and the farmers got the shaft."
Under a Clinton Administration, he said, things would be different. Export enhancement and farm subsidy programs would be supported and made to work better for farmers, health care would be better and illiteracy would vanish in five years.
And in an environment where environmentalists are less than popular, Mr. Clinton, who often criticizes the Bush Administration for an environmental policy that has limited environmental concerns when they ran afoul of commercial ones, struck a similar tone of compromise. "I believe we can find a way to deal with the environmental objection that have been raised as to ethanol usage," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Focuses on Patriotism as He Warns of Clinton

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WIXOM, Mich., Sept. 27

 BODY:
President Bush leaned into the microphones attached to the platform of his campaign train this morning and warned of economic disaster for a small Michigan town that relies on a Lincoln Continental plant for survival.
If Gov. Bill Clinton has his way with automobile pollution standards, Mr. Bush shouted, he will "toss 40,000 auto workers out on the unemployment line right here in Michigan." 
 A few miles along the track, in Milford, Mr. Bush evoked themes of patriotism and national pride. "I am proud that because of our leadership we have far less fear of nuclear weapons today," he said, declaring America "the greatest country on the face of the earth" and accusing Mr. Clinton of trying to "tear down America."
 
Borrowing Reagan Imagery
 All down the line in Ohio and Michigan, Mr. Bush tried to recapture the soft-focus imagery that put Ronald Reagan back in office in 1984, yearning for an America where "every day has that spirit of the Fourth of July."
And he summoned scary images of Mr. Clinton's "socialist" economic ideas and the "liberal guys" who Mr. Bush said evaded the Vietnam draft and now want to invade the "real America" to tear apart the traditions of the largely white, blue-collar precincts through which Mr. Bush's train rolled this weekend.
Touring these safely Republican districts, Mr. Bush tried to plug into every political channel he could find.
The train trip was part of that effort, as was Mr. Bush's removal of a Cabinet member, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Edward J. Derwinski, on Saturday under pressure from veterans' groups.
But aboard the train, behind the noise and movement, the Bush campaign seemed suspended, waiting for something to change and hoping it is not too late. The President's aides now say privately they are even hoping for the re-entry of Ross Perot into the Presidential race. As dangerous as that might prove to be, the aides say it would at least shake things up.
 
Trying to Show Relaxation
 Mr. Bush seemed intent on appearing relaxed and confident this weekend. But the state of his nerves was evident in the way he sent aides into the train to pick out reporters and usher them into his car in pairs, as one aide put it, "to see how much fun the President is having."
In his car, with its plush upholstery and mirrored windows, the President propped up his feet and waved to onlookers outside. "We've got time left," Mr. Bush said. "We're going to win it. You don't believe us."
With a correspondent who had been reporting on the Clinton campaign for some time, Mr. Bush seemed eager to show that his campaign had the same energy and support. "You're going to eat a lot of crow," he said.
He talked about Prime Minister John Major's come-from-behind re-election in Britain this spring. "I'm not wavering one tiny bit," he said, while Barbara Bush tried to change the subject to "all those lovely houses" along the route and, apropos of nothing in particular, to whether the animal "llama" was spelled with one "l" or two.
Onlookers gathered at virtually every crossing to watch the train go by with the Presidential standard snapping from a pole above the locomotive. They stood on rooftops to wave, leaned over their backyard fences to cheer and held up signs, most friendly.
But there were also knots of Clinton supporters and pockets of discontent. At one spot in rural Ohio on Saturday evening, near a hard-scrabble mobile home park, three barefoot children stood by a sign that said, "Buddy, we need jobs."
 
Efficient Presentation
 The weekend's events were efficiently executed. Aides released clouds of red, white and blue balloons precisely on cue, set off fireworks that dropped tiny American flags on tinier parachutes and bused in brass bands to every stop. The crowds were large, friendly and often enthusiastic.
But even among these committed Republicans, there was an air of expectations not quite fulfilled.
"I'm a little nervous about the polls," said Teresa Goins, 30 years old, of Marysville, Ohio, as she and her husband, David, tried to summon an enthusiastic endorsement for their candidate. "No, I AM enthusiastic," she said. "I mean it. He's done a really O.K. job as President."
Mr. Goins said he did not understand why Mr. Bush's campaign still seemed to be misfiring. "Why have they been so slow? Like after the hurricane, somebody should have realized that they had to hit a home run."
 
Searching for the Public Mood
 This is not the first time the Republican campaign has become frozen, waiting for some event -- for Mr. Bush to name his campaign team, to give his State of the Union Message, to hold his nominating convention and finally to bring his old friend James A. Baker 3d back into the White House.
But the problem may run deeper than simply timing. Some of Mr. Bush's friends and associates say the President has trouble reading the mood of the public as the pace of the election accelerates. In this year, that is an especially dangerous thing.
In recent days, Mr. Bush has all but abandoned his positive oratory in favor of an increasingly harsh attack on Mr. Clinton.
The attack grew more jeering at every stop. In Bowling Green on Saturday evening, the President even paused to talk about the Clinton supporter dressed in a chicken suit who has been showing up at every campaign event in recent days -- to suggest that Mr. Bush was afraid of a debate.
"I'm not sure if that chicken is from Oxford, England, or if he's the one that dumps that fecal coliform bacteria into the Arkansas River," Mr. Bush said.
Cecily Kumor, a 38-year-old auto parts manager, clutched two copies of Mr. Bush's economic pamphlet, "Agenda for American Renewal" at the rally here. "He's not coming out enough with what he plans on doing," she said. "This is the first I've seen of his agenda."
 
Random Attack
 At times, especially late in the day as he grew tired and hoarse, Mr. Bush seemed to stitch his attack lines together in random patterns.
Saturday night, in Plymouth, Mich., he combined the political hot button that his campaign believes will prove Mr. Clinton's undoing -- his draft record -- with an economic assault on the Arkansas Governor.
"Governor Clinton is already talking about pulling together the 'best and brightest' -- all the lobbyists, economists, lawyers -- all those guys, liberal guys that were hanging out with him in Oxford when some of you were over there fighting and have them solve America's problems," Mr. Bush said.
But Keith Greer, a 64-year-old employee of the Honda plant in Marysville and an enthusiastic Bush supporter, said he was tired of all the talk about the draft. "We want to talk about the economy," he said. "I've got 15 grandkids, 10 of them Navy kids, and they like Bush and not one of them ever talks about the draft."
Living by the demands of his office within a bubble of security and aides, Mr. Bush had little chance to mix with anyone on this trip and tried to make up for the lack with local references.
"Others can blow the saxophone," he said in Columbus, "but I'll stand with the Purple Pride of Pinkerton."
"You try to say that," he shouted triumphantly, as members of the band in question, from the town of Pinkerington, winced.

HEADLINE: U.S. SAYS HOSPITALS DEMAND PHYSICIANS PAY FOR REFERRALS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Federal investigators say that hospitals, under severe financial stress, are increasingly looking to doctors as a source of additional money and demanding payments for the referral of patients, in apparent violation of Federal Medicare law.
A recent study by the Department of Health and Human Services said there had been "a proliferation of contracts" requiring such payments by doctors in return for the hospitals' efforts to direct patients to them. Doctors who refuse to make the payments say they sometimes lose the right to practice at the hospital, a particular burden to radiologists and other specialists who are based in hospitals. 
 D. McCarty Thornton, chief counsel to the inspector general of the department, said these payments were often disguised as reimbursement for billing, marketing or other services. He said he had examined many contracts in which hospitals required doctors to provide "payments or remuneration far in excess of the fair market value of any services" supplied to the doctors.
 
Forms of Payment Vary
 In one case, he said, radiologists had to pay half of their gross receipts to a hospital's endowment fund. In another, a group of doctors had to pay 25 percent of their profits exceeding $120,000 to a hospital as a condition of running its radiology department. In a third case, a hospital insisted that pathologists buy billing services from a hospital subsidiary.
Hospital executives deny that the payments are illegal and say the Federal Government has no business interfering in contractual relationships between doctors and hospitals.
But Federal law prohibits the solicitation or receipt of any payment or remuneration -- direct or indirect, overt or covert -- in return for the referral of business financed by Medicare or Medicaid, the programs for the elderly and the poor. A hospital or doctor found to have violated the law is subject to civil penalties, including exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid, and criminal penalties, including fines up to $25,000.
The law reflects Congressional concern that kickbacks encourage the ordering of unnecessary medical services and thus contribute to higher costs. Nearly 50 percent of hospital patients are covered by either Medicare or Medicaid. The programs account for nearly 40 percent of total spending on hospital care.
Federal officials are investigating the complex ties between doctors and hospitals at a time when hospitals are facing severe financial pressures and are aggressively trying to increase their revenues. Hospitals find themselves in an intensely competitive medical marketplace. At the same time, hospital costs are soaring but insurers and other payers are restricting payments. Seven out of 10 hospitals will lose money caring for Medicare patients in 1993, the American Hospital Association says.
 
Lawsuit in Virginia
 In Culpeper, Va., a group of radiologists filed a lawsuit in 1990 charging that a local hospital terminated their right to practice there after they refused to buy billing and management services from a company owned by the hospital's parent corporation. The doctors contended that the hospital was demanding a kickback by requiring them to buy these services in exchange for the exclusive right to provide radiology services to patients at the hospital.
"I was a radiologist at Culpeper Memorial Hospital for 27 years, from 1961 until we were ousted in 1988," said Dr. Archibald C. Wagner, who is now 62 years old. "The hospital stripped us of our clinical privileges. We were unwilling to sign a contract proffered by the hospital because we felt it was unethical and our attorneys felt it was illegal. Under the contract, in order to maintain our privileges, we would have been required to pay the hospital for billing and so-called management services -- management services we had no need for."
William A. Gravely Jr., president of the 84-bed Culpeper Memorial Hospital, confirmed it had terminated a contract with Dr. Wagner's group, but said the radiologists' other accusations were "blatantly false."
"Everything we did is legal," Mr. Gravely said. "We violated no laws. I find it amazing that the Federal Government feels it necessary to interfere in this type of relationship between a hospital-based physician and a hospital. Even if we had done what we were accused of doing, I don't see that as a violation of the Medicare fraud and abuse law."
The doctors' lawsuit is scheduled for trial next year.
Health officials and economists say such disputes are not merely an intramural spat.
"Kickbacks have been shown to increase utilization" of medical services, said Mr. Thornton of the Department of Health and Human Services. "This, in turn, increases the costs of our health-care system. It can expose beneficiaries to unnecessary medical procedures. Moreover, kickbacks tend to lock up the market, making it harder for competitors to enter the market with better, less costly alternatives for providing the same services."
The study by the department says that hospitals are in a pivotal position to influence the flow of business under Medicare and Medicaid because they select radiologists, pathologists and anesthesiologists for hospital patients.
For example, the study said, if a hospital gets half of a radiologist's billings over $250,000, the hospital has a strong incentive to increase the use of X-rays and diagnostic imaging services, and the doctor may be tempted to do more procedures to offset the cost of the payments to the hospital.
At the same time, many doctors are complaining that hospitals decide whether to grant medical staff privileges on the basis of a doctor's ability to generate revenue for the hospital, not on the basis of the doctor's competence. Doctors have challenged these practices, known as economic credentialing, in lawsuits around the country.
Doctors generally cannot admit patients to a hospital or perform procedures there unless they have staff privileges. So the denial of privileges can severely limit the doctors' ability to care for patients and earn a living.
In Florida, Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center allowed a doctor to perform thoracic surgery, but refused to let him do heart surgery while he had a contract with a competing hospital to develop its cardiac surgery program. A state judge ruled in June that Florida law allowed hospitals to consider economic factors in deciding whether to grant privileges to a doctor.
Lawyers say the case is the first in which a court has explicitly upheld a hospital's use of "economic considerations" in deciding whether to grant privileges.
In California, a group of doctors asserted last year that Anaheim General Hospital terminated their contract to perform radiology services after they refused to pay $181,000 to the hospital. The hospital described the money as marketing fees. The doctors said it was a kickback.
Historically, hospitals investigated the professional qualifications of doctors before deciding whether to grant staff privileges. Dr. Robert E. McAfee of Portland, Me., a trustee of the American Medical Association, said that economic credentialing shifted the focus.
"The inquiry is no longer whether the physician is qualified, but whether the physician is economically safe for the hospital," Dr. McAfee said.
The same law that prohibits hospitals from demanding kickbacks also forbids the payment of kickbacks. In a recent "fraud alert," the Federal Government warned hospitals that they might not pay doctors "any sort of incentive" or bonus for referring patients to the hospital.

HEADLINE: Russia Loans Being Delayed By Bureaucracy and Anxiety

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Bureaucratic red tape in Moscow and Western capitals, together with quarrels over the repayment of $70 billion in foreign debt incurred by the Soviet Union, has seriously slowed aid to Russia, international financial officials say.
The delays mean that Russia will not receive this year all the $24 billion promised in April by President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, although most of the money should arrive by the end of March. 
 The delays are important because Russian factories and consumers need Western currency to buy the imports needed to revive industrial production. Western officials worry that continued economic decline could lead to unfavorable political changes.
 
Nervous Borrowers
 Some loans have not even been offered to Russia because of squabbles about the terms and overdue past debts, while some loans to pay for imports have been made available but are not being tapped as the plunging value of the ruble makes Russian enterprises leery of buying costly goods even with Government financing.
"The money is not getting in there, that is very, very true, and we need to get those credits in there," said Eugene K. Lawson, the vice chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
Viktor F. Kronyov, an adviser to President Boris N. Yeltsin who handles foreign-assistance issues, complained in Moscow last week, "All credit lines have been cut off because we have not been able to pay for the old ones. There are no credits now."
Mr. Kronyov may have been exaggerating. The United States Agriculture Department, for example, has just announced that it will guarantee loans for Russia's purchase of another $1.15 billion worth of American grain.
 
What Adds Up to $24 Billion
 The $24 billion pledge included $11 billion of bilateral aid. The International Monetary Fund has calculated that bilateral aid to Russia totaled nearly $6 billion in the first half of this year, suggesting that the $11 billion target would be reached.
The rest of the $24 billion is to come from the postponement of interest payments by Russia, new loans from multilateral institutions and a special fund to defend the value of the ruble.
But the specific makeup of the $24 billion has always been murky. "We received one contradictory document after another about what was in and what was not, and then the dates slipped," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard professor and economic adviser to the Russian Government.
 
Long List of Deferrals
 A variety of problems explain Russian officials' complaints that aid is behind schedule and less than they had expected. Central to the problems is Russia's inability to raise foreign currency to pay its 61 percent share of the Soviet debt:
*Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr N. Shokhin of Russia said on Wednesday that Spain had frozen a $1.5 billion line of credit because Russia was $200 million behind on its debts.
*A British official has said the European Community will postpone the release of a $460 million food loan because the community has not received a $13 million interest payment.
*The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was to lend up to $1 billion this year, has only recently agreed to lend $17 million because of difficulty in finding reliable borrowers.
*The I.M.F. granted Russia a $1 billion credit nearly two months ago, but no money has been used because the interest rate, 7.5 percent, is too high, Mr. Shokhin said on Wednesday. The World Bank approved a $600 million loan on Aug. 6, to pay for critical imports to help the energy, transportation and farm industries, but legal and technical disputes have prevented the signing of the loan, he added.
*A $6 billion ruble-stabilization fund included in the $24 billion plan was postponed last summer until 1993 because of slow progress in bringing inflation and Government spending under control. Another $3 billion loan from the I.M.F. included in the $24 billion plan is on hold until the end of the year for the same reason.
*United States Government backing for $2.2 billion worth of oil and gas deals in Russia has been held up by a dispute between the United States and the World Bank over whether the repayment plans would erode the World Bank's claim to receive precedence on any payments by Russia.
 
Crowded Cast of Donors
 With 22 countries and multilateral institutions now operating at least 230 different programs to help Russia, nobody knows the amount of financial assistance actually affected or the average length of the delays. But as financial officials met here last week for the annual meeting of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, a consensus began to form that transfers of money increasingly lag behind promises.
Most of the money was promised before the fall of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when the Soviet Union was still a feared superpower rival; very little has been promised to President Yeltsin. The United States, with its food-loan guarantees and other programs, is the only country still making large commitments, said Mr. Kronyov, the adviser to Mr. Yeltsin.
To be sure, Russia is casting around for ways to raise some money, but some are alarming Western officials. Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev said on Thursday that a plan to sell three submarines to Iran for up to $750 million would not only improve the stability in the Persian Gulf but also help raise money. It is unclear whether the deal will be completed.
Russia's slowness in taking advantage of new loans has prompted a range of explanations. To some extent, Mr. Lawson said, the Russian reluctance may reflect a commendable caution.
But the worst fear of Western officials is that loans may not be tapped because the money may not be needed. Russia's industrial production shrank 27 percent in the year ended Aug. 31, suggesting that factories once in need of spare parts and other imports may no longer be operating.

HEADLINE: Democrat's Senate Bid Stumbles in Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Lynn H. Yeakel, who won a stunning upset in the Democratic primary for the United States Senate, has stumbled in recent months and lost much of the momentum she had coming out of her April victory.
In an effort to regain some of that strength, the Yeakel campaign began blanketing the state this week with three image-building television commercials. A lot is riding on these advertisements and those that come in the next five weeks, because political analysts say Ms. Yeakel, a fund-raiser for women's charities who is making her first bid for elected office, has lost ground to the two-term Republican incumbent, Arlen Specter, who is seeking a third term. 
 New polls, taken by the candidates and an independent polling firm, Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, also suggest that Mr. Specter has moved into the lead. The race had previously been a dead heat, with Ms. Yeakel coasting on the momentum from her primary campaign.
Her primary victory is widely credited to her advertisement that rekindled voters' anger with Mr. Specter for his prosecutorial questioning of Professor Anita F. Hill in the confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
 
Specter Has Money Advantage
 Her first three advertisements in the general election campaign do not mention the hearings. The 30-second commercials show newspaper clips of endorsements by workers, teachers and the elderly as evidence that Ms. Yeakel has the answers for improving the economy. "What I want to do in the United States Senate is put Pennsylvanians back to work and put Washington's priorities back in order," Ms. Yeakel says in one advertisement.
Mr. Specter's response is to attack Ms. Yeakel, and then deal directly with his own problem, the Thomas hearings.
The Specter campaign, which expects to spend $7.5 million on the general election, or about twice as much as the Yeakel campaign, had carefully prepared for Ms. Yeakel's advertising debut. For the last two months, Mr. Specter has run a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign, including 35 television commercials and 60 radio advertisements. These are filled with endorsements and details about Mr. Specter's 12-year record in the Senate on behalf of labor, women's health programs, jobs and the economy.
After putting out all those positive messages, Specter campaign officials say they are in a good position to become critical of Ms. Yeakel. Within hours of Ms. Yeakel's first general-election advertisement, Mr. Specter ran his first attack advertisement on statewide radio and television. It reminds voters that Ms. Yeakel failed to pay Philadelphia income taxes for 10 years, and only paid the $17,000 tax bill the day before announcing her candidacy. "The Philadelphia Inquirer asked, 'Was she being crafty or just sloppy?' " says a narrator. "Doesn't that concern you?"
And on Monday, the Specter campaign plans to start running a television commercial statewide that asks voters to look beyond the Senator's role in the Thomas hearings, in which he took the lead in questioning Professor Hill on her accusations of sexual harassment by Judge Thomas when the two worked together in Federal agencies.
In the advertisement, Teresa Heinz, the widow of Senator John Heinz, who was one of this state's most popular politicians, tells viewers: "I don't think you can agree with any Senator on every issue, and I certainly didn't agree with Arlen Specter during the Clarence Thomas hearings. Nevertheless, I'm supporting him." She adds, "Arlen's long standing commitment to women's rights, human rights, civil rights, to jobs and to health is one we cannot afford to lose."
Shanin Specter, the 62-year-old Senator's son and campaign adviser, explained the advertisement's timing. "It was apparent to us that we are in a position of strength and that it was time to address the core of Yeakel's supporters, the people upset about the hearings."
Yeakel campaign officials concede that Mr. Specter has gained in the polls, but they say there is plenty of time to catch up. "I think people were worried that we weren't on TV this summer, but it's all part of our strategy," said Catherine Ormerod, a spokeswoman for the Yeakel campaign. "It's been clear all along that Specter would outspend us enormously, but ours is a grass-roots campaign."
But the same political analysts who said Ms. Yeakel ran a nearly flawless primary campaign say her campaign has been listless and unfocused for months. "The Yeakel campaign has displayed a lethal mixture of arrogance and incompetence," said David L. Buffington, editor and publisher of The Pennsylvania Report, a political newsletter in Harrisburg.
In particular, Mr. Buffington and other analysts fault Ms. Yeakel for losing the support of traditionally Democratic unions to Mr. Specter. Because labor is split this year, the Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O. Council, which has played an important role in electing Democrats to statewide offices, did not endorse either candidate. During the last few months, the analysts also say that Mr. Specter has kept Ms. Yeakel on the defensive, keeping her busy with questions about her record, including her failure to pay Philadelphia income taxes.
Ms. Yeakel, 50, lives in Rosemont, a Philadelphia suburb, but maintains a legal residence in the city. She has said she did not know she had to pay Philadelphia taxes, and did so voluntarily when her lawyer brought it to her attention as she was preparing to start her campaign.
Political analysts also say that Ms. Yeakel has a good issue -- what she refers to as the "Bush-Quayle-Specter recession" -- but that she has not dealt with it in a way that resonates with voters.
"Every challenger has to provide compelling reasons for voters to reject the incumbent, as well as some compelling reason to vote for the challenger," said Michael L. Young, a professor of politics and public affairs at Pennsylvania State University at Harrisburg.
"Yeakel has successfully painted Specter as a symbol of male-dominated incumbency, but she hasn't yet given voters a positive reason to vote for her," he continued.
Some voters who oppose Mr. Specter are impatient with Ms. Yeakel. "I want to like her, but she's not giving me enough material," said Andrea Giles, 39, a banker who lives in Swarthmore, a western suburb of Philadelphia. Ms. Giles worked as a volunteer and fund-raiser for the Yeakel campaign until her enthusiasm cooled last month. "It was appropriate for Yeakel to be anti-Specter in the earlier stages of the campaign, but I am hoping for something a little more substantive and positive now."

HEADLINE: Ft. Dix Loses Recruits, Customers, Friends

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT DIX, N.J., Sept. 23

 BODY:
This old Army post resembles a ghost town these days. No more raw Army recruits are getting their hair shorn, or doing push-ups for snarling drill sergeants, or struggling to tell their left foot from their right. Streets once filled with marching columns and throaty cadence calls are silent and empty.
Seventy-five years of tradition as the biggest Army boot camp in the Northeast formally ends here Wednesday, and Dix begins a new life as a summer and weekend training camp for reservists and National Guard members. 
 The switch, under way for months, will leave a multimillion-dollar hole in the already bleak economy of central Burlington County, thinner bank accounts for local merchants and fatter bills for some taxpayers, a half-filled new $17 million wing in one local high school, and all sorts of gaps in the social fabric of towns around the base.
"We've always had a fair number of military personnel in the congregation," said the Rev. Joan Watson, pastor of Grace Episcopal Church in Pemberton Township. "They're transient. They come and go. Now, everybody's gone or going and nobody's coming. We aren't used to the impact yet."
 
Losing High-School Classmates
 Military transfers have cost Grace Episcopal 2 of the 10 members of its choir, 2 of its 7 Sunday-school teachers, and 3 of the 20 teen-agers in the parish youth group.
And they may end the friendship between Anne Marie Perry and Alicia Dodson, two freshmen at Pemberton High. "She's my best friend and I don't feel like losing her," Miss Perry said today as she waited to play in the junior varsity soccer game. "Alicia just got here in the beginning of seventh grade. She doesn't really know what's going to happen with her father."
The Pentagon says Fort Dix's reduced military role will save American taxpayers a total of $60.5 million between this year and 1997 and $25.3 million a year after that.
Those figures provide little solace in Wrightstown, Pemberton Township and other nearby communities. A lot of money is vanishing. In 1988, when Washington started talking about reducing Dix's military role, it paid soldiers here nearly $213 million and civilian employees $64.2 million. Much of the money was pumped into the local economy for food, furniture, cars and services. The military payroll shrank to $13.4 million and the civilian payroll to $17.6 million from October 1991 through March.
 
'Cut Right Dead in Half'
 Last year, Dix paid $74.3 million for contracts for everything from repairing barracks to running the mess halls. Those expenses are expected to fall to $58 million this year.
Ernie Bozarth, a barber in Browns Mills for 30 years, says he has lost 50 percent of his business. "Back-to-school time used to be nonstop for me," Mr. Bozarth said in his empty shop today. "This year, there's been plenty of stopping. My business has been cut right dead in half. I haven't seen anyone with Army connections in eight months. Billy Hamilton and his family -- they're in Fort Hill, Virginia, now. They moved last year during wintertime to save his job. And Charlie Knight's brother -- the redhead -- he went to Indiana."
There are plenty of empty houses and apartments now, on post and off. "For sale" signs dot empty yards all around Pemberton, a sprawling 65-square-mile township of forests, farms and about 31,000 people.
 
Santa's Elves Transferred
 "At one time, 35 to 40 percent of my business was military; in the early 80's it may have been more than that," a Pemberton real-estate broker, John Davis, said. "Now it's probably 10 percent."
Since the end of 1988, the number of soldiers here, generals to privates, fell from about 11,000 to 4,283 at the latest head count on June 30, officials said.
The transfers have depleted the ranks of "Dix's elves." They are soldiers, from colonels to privates, who help each year with "Operation Santa Claus," an effort to collect thousands of new and used toys for needy children each Christmas. Three of the "elves" specialized in repairing and repainting old bicycles. They're gone. "Sergeant Rolf, he retired and went to Texas; Sergeant Lofland is over in Korea, and Sergeant Mann is in California someplace," said Imogene Greener, a volunteer with the group. "We lost quite a few."
Transfers have also depleted the ranks of coaches and players in the Pemberton Area Athletic League, which provides baseball, basketball, football, soccer and three other sports for 2,000 children from ages 7 to 13. Three of the 12 players on Anne Marie Major's baseball team left with their fathers in late spring and the team's final game was canceled.
Pemberton's schools are also suffering. Six years ago, 2,000 children who lived at Fort Dix attended town schools. Now about 1,300 do, said Robert Moore, a retired Pemberton superintendent who now is a consultant for the district. The reduced enrollment will cost the district about $3.4 million in education stipends from the Pentagon, Mr. Moore said.
Pemberton taxpayers, he said, will be paying over the next 20 years for a wing that opened at the high school this fall. The wing's auditorium, classrooms, cafeteria and gymnasium are largely surplus now.
"We're hurting," said Robert Holmes, the high school principal. "This is a school for 2,200 kids and we have 1,457."
Mr. Moore said: "When we did the demographics for it, we had no idea Fort Dix would be downsizing."
The Federal Government has moved to use some of Dix's empty space and soften economic losses. The F.B.I. will offer firearms training here and the Coast Guard is bringing in an small environmental team. Some empty Army barracks are to be converted into the nation's biggest Federal prison, a low-security institution for 3,200 convicted drug offenders and white-collar criminals. The proposed prison has a projected operating budget of $25.2 million and payroll of $17.8 million.
 
Bush Raises Hopes at U.N.
 In a speech at the United Nations the other day Sept. 21, President Bush offered Dix as a training site for a multinational peace-keeping force. But no definite plans for that are ready, a Pentagon spokesman said.
Joe Farago, a drill sergeant at Dix in 1967, has little love for the old base. Now he is Mayor of Wrightstown, whose bars once attracted droves of recruits. In recent years Dix has opened its grounds and PX to car washes, truck rentals, fast-food restaurants, dry cleaners and video arcades, catering to the thousands of retired soldiers who live near Dix. Those businesses, he said, might have opened in downtown Wrightstown.
"The good-neighbor policy went out the window quite a while ago," he complained. "If the Army is going to close Fort Dix, they should do it completely and throw they key away so we can get on with our lives and maybe start attracting industry."

HEADLINE: To Hold Jobs, New York City Revises Goals

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
For a decade, New York City's efforts to stem the exodus of business to the suburbs, the Sun Belt states and elsewhere has increasingly resembled a game of five-card-stud, complete with cash on the table and poker-faced bluffs. But rarely has the game been played more intensely than it was last week.
At stake were a financial services subsidiary of the First Chicago Corporation and Bradlees, a department store chain. Compared to many of the titans of Wall Street and midtown Manhattan, both are relatively small players. 
 Yet the deals and the negotiations involving the two businesses have broken new ground.
In the case of Bradlees, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced last week that the Braintree, Mass.,-based company had accepted a promise of city tax incentives to reopen two vacant Alexander's stores in the Bronx -- the first time the city has offered tax incentives to attract or retain a department store chain. Aides to the Mayor now say similar incentives would be considered for other retailers.
 
A Failed Effort
 In the case of First Chicago, the city ultimately lost out to New Jersey, which offered a generous package of cash and other inducements -- but not before the city had, for the first time, publicly announced that it had engaged -- and failed -- in an intense effort to keep a New York City business and that it had been willing to pay dearly for it.
Although the loss of First Chicago was described as a deep disappointment, it was the first time the city had made clear the limits to what it would offer large companies. Analysts say that drawing the line in such cases was long overdue, while city officials said the departing First Chicago subsidiary was not worth chasing because it holds little prospect for growth.
Still, the city's approaches still met with some harsh criticism.
"New York City has decided the most economic thing to do is offer bribes to business," said Peter Salins, an urban planner at Hunter College. "That leads to problems," including the threat that companies may leave, even if they have no intention to do so, to extract public subsidies.
To be sure, the inducements offered Bradlees and First Chicago were far from the first, and will not be the last. Under Mayor Edward I. Koch during the 1980's, and now under Mayor Dinkins, New York City has institutionalized a policy of picking out companies it hopes to attract or retain, and cutting their taxes, offering subsidized state electricity and other public benefits.
 
Dangling Incentives
 New Jersey has responded with giveaways of its own. And, as New York's senior economic development officials are quick to note, cities and states across the nation are poised to offer a treasure trove of incentives to lure companies away.
"The vast majority of companies whose leases expire in Manhattan are the targets of inducements from other cities," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation and Mayor Dinkins's chief negotiator in charge of retaining business.
The landscapes of Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn are checkered with corporations that have received the city's special favors. In one of the most recent deals, Prudential Securities, which had threatened to move from Wall Street to Jersey City, received a pledge in August of $48.4 million in tax incentives from New York City and New York State, as well as $57.8 million in energy subsidies. In return, Prudential promised to stay in lower Manhattan for 20 years, saving the city 5,000 jobs.
In March, Bertelsmann, a diversified German publisher and record company, accepted a 15-year city package of tax exemptions, worth $11 million, to consolidate its United States headquarters, with 1,750 employees, in a new building on Times Square instead of moving part of its work force to Chicago from Manhattan.
And in June, 1991, Bear Stearns and Company, which had threatened to move 1,500 workers to New Jersey, said it would move them instead to Metrotech Center in downtown Brooklyn. Its reward from the city: $17.6 million worth of tax incentives and energy subsidies.
"Any responsible company with a lease running out is going to look at the costs and benefits of being in New York," said Ronald Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, which has rallied top executives of several Wall Street firms and New York City's largest industrial corporations to help convince companies not to leave the city. "Many will also wonder, 'What will the city pay to keep us.' "
No one disputes the economic risks for New York if it were to lose such businesses. And no one can say for certain how many of the companies that have received what the city now calls "retention benefits" had any intention of leaving, even without city help.
"There is a lot of bluffing going on," said Mr. Salins.
 
Importance of Retailers
 Although the First Chicago and Bradlees deals were criticized harshly by some, both deals are receiving high marks by many analysts of New York City affairs; In the case of Bradlees for what the city did to attract the business, and in the case of First Chicago for what it did not do.
"Few things could be more important to the city than a large retailer," said Gary Alterman, executive vice president of New Spectrum Realty, a broker of stores and other retail space that is based in Manhattan. He said the Bradlees deal will "put people on the streets and anchor a neighborhood" in the Bronx.
In all, Bradlees said it had purchased or taken over the leases of six New York-area stores vacated when Alexander's Department Stores, a retail mainstay for more than 50 years, filed for bankruptcy in May. Besides the two stores in the Bronx, Bradlees said it will renovate and reopen two stores in Queens, one in Yonkers and one in Valley Stream, L.I.
But its incentives from the city apply only to the Bronx stores, where Mr. Weisbrod and other officials said the need for large department stores is greatest. So far, neither Bradlees nor the city has divulged what tax incentives are to be provided, saying they are still in negotiation. But people with knowledge of the deal say they are likely to include a cap on real-estate taxes, and the assurance that tax bills will not rise for a decade or more.
 
Special Case in the Bronx
 Critics said one risk for the city is that other department stores, or even small retailers, will expect similar tax breaks in the future. Merchants might argue that singling out Bradlees' Bronx stores gives the company an unfair advantage in a hotly competitive retail industry.
"It could be a Pandora's box," said Marc A. Weiss, director of the Real Estate Development Research Center at Columbia University. "Any time you start offering tax breaks, people will threaten to shut down unless they get one."
Still, Mr. Weiss and other experts said the special treatment of Bradlees is warranted in the Bronx, particularly at the store on Fordham Road.
Other merchants in the area said that while Bradlees' tax incentives and lower costs could give it an competitive edge in discounting merchandise, the benefits of having the store there outweigh the threat. Many compared Bradlees's role on Fordham Road to that of an anchor store in a shopping mall.
"That store is the heart of the neighborhood," said Vijal Dindyal, manager of Modell's Sporting Goods, just east of the vacant Alexander's on Fordham Road. "Bradlees will bring in people, and help us a lot."
 
Help From the State
 The decision by First Chicago to move to Jersey City, taking 1,000 jobs with it from Manhattan, was called a major disappointment in New York. The business that will move is a subsidiary of the Chicago-based bank holding company, which processes dividend checks, mails out annual reports and provides other shareholder services for large corporations.
Officials said First Chicago decided to move next year because the low operating costs in Jersey City could not be matched in Manhattan, even with city incentives. The company was pledged a $6 million grant from the state of New Jersey, and its rent in the Newport City Center in Jersey City will be far below comparable office space in Manhattan.
To match the terms in Jersey City, Mr. Weisbrod said New York City would have had to offer an incentive package worth $50 million, or $50,000 for each First Chicago job. In even the most generous incentive packages offered in the past, he said, the cost to the city was no higher than $20,000 per job.
"We looked at the cost and benefits, and we were simply unwilling to do it this time," he said Friday.
Despite the lost jobs, some experts said First Chicago's departure may eventually benefit New York City. For once, they said, city officials have made it clear that its corporate largess has limits. Therefore, other companies that ask for incentives in the future may be less ambitious in their demands for public support.
"You have to draw the line somewhere," said Mr. Shelp. "The trouble with these negotiations is that whenever you raise the ante for one company, the next one coming in will expect the same or more."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "CITY BUSINESS: Staving Off the Moving Vans"
 
Some of the major deals New York City has made in an effort to keep businesses from moving out:
 
Prudential Securities, in a deal announced Aug. 5, promised to stay in New York for 20 years, saving 5,000 jobs. The city and state provided $57.8 million in tax incentives and $48.4 million in energy savings, allowing the companyto buy low-cost power from the New York State Power Authority. Prudential estimates it will generate $830 million in tax revenues over the 20 years.
 
Bertelsmann, a German-based company that owns RCA Records, Bantam-Doublday-Dell Books and Parents Magazine among others, had planned to move 500of its 1,750 employees in Manhattan to Chicago and Indianapolis. Under an agreement announced March 1, Bertelsmann said it would keep the 500 jobs in the city and set up its North American headquarters in the city. In return city offered an $11 million, 15-year package of tax breaks.
 
Bear Stearns and Company, an investment company, had planned to relocate 1,500 workers in Manhattan to New Jersey. In a deal announced June 6, 1991, it agreed instead to move into the new Metro Tech Center in downtown Brooklyn. Because the company moved to another borough, it qualified for special incentives, including a full exemption on taxes for 11 years, a $500 tax credit for each worker it will relocate to Brooklyn over the next 12 years and low-cost power from the state. The company also received tax and energy savings worth $17.6 million.
 
After having considered a move to Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City, the chairen of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Commodities Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange announced on Nov. 6, 1990, that they would move the exchanges to a city-owned site near the World Trade Center. They were later joined by the New York Futures Exchange. Under the agreement with the city and the state, the exchanges were to receive $145 million in incentives - $100 million to go toward reducing the costs of constructing and operating the new building, and $45 million in reduced taxes. The figures were later reduced after the Merchantile Exchanged dropped out of the agreement. The revised deal will save about 8,000 jobs for the city.
 
Merrill Lynch & Company, the securities company, announced in June 1989 that it would move 2,600 jobs form New York City to Jersey City. Mayor Edward I. Koch had told Merrill Lynch that the city would match any package of incentives it was offered to relocate elsewhere. But he said at the time that the company had refused to give city officials the "bottom line."
 
First Chicago Trust Company, a subsidiary of First Chicago Corporation, announced Friday that it was moving 950 employees to Jersey City, where they will occupy 24,000 square feet and become the anchor tenant in the Newport Office Tower. The city made an effort to keep them, presenting three alternative sites. Because no agreement was reached, city officials would not disclose what incentives were offered.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley May Have Lost Its Way

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
After more than three decades as a fertile breeding ground for hundreds of technologies, Silicon Valley is in the midst of a midlife crisis, wondering if it still has the right stuff.
"We are definitely the equivalent of a 40-year-old male who just discovered he has a little paunch," said T. J. Rogers, chairman of Cypress Semiconductor, a chip maker in Sunnyvalewho has long symbolized the Valley's fiercely independent management style. "We've got troubles here in Silicon Valley." 
 After working 70 hours a week for years on end, founding successful companies and becoming multimillionaires, many top executives here say their entrepreneurial zeal has been overtaken by worries about fierce global competition, increasing Government regulation and the cumbersome size of some companies, as well as the high cost of living, poor transportation and pollution.
 
The Doomsayers vs. the Optimists
 And Tom Hayes, an executive at Applied Materials, a producer of chip-making equipment in Santa Clara and the chairman of an industry group that recently issued a report on Silicon Valley, said: "High-tech jobs have been growing like crazy. They're just not growing here."
But a variety of new entrepreneurs and Valley veterans say that is nonsense, arguing that the doomsayers are overlooking the extent to which the Valley's best and brightest now work on software and related new design technologies rather than hardware.
"There are plenty of ideas around and plenty of personnel around," said Sheldon Breiner, who recently founded Quorum Software Systems in Menlo Park, Calif.
And Cyril Yansouni, the chairman of the Read-Rite Corporation of Milpitas, Calif., asserted: "As far as creative ideas, this remains the nation's hotbed. I can see a lot of reasons to be frustrated, but in the end we get better products."
Some people say the pessimists are nothing more than executives of established companies, whining because they cannot grow as quickly as they once did and because they oppose Government regulations intended to protect the environment and the Valley's workers against such things as the hazards of working in a semiconductor manufacturing plant.
"Everyone is screaming that we're losing our edge," said Anno Saxenian, a professor of regional planning at the University of California at Berkeley. "But there is a lot of dynamism under the surface."
 
Survived an Earlier Crisis
 The soul-searching found voice in the report by Mr. Hayes's panel, a study sponsored by some of the Valley's largest companies and business organizations. The report, titled "An Economy at Risk," cautioned that a range of warning signs on the horizon are pointing toward the decline of Silicon Valley as a center of innovation for business and technology.
"It's getting so darn expensive to live here that we're restricting the flow of bright new people coming into the Valley," said Gordon Moore, vice chairman of Intel and a member of the industry panel.
This is hardly the first time that the region -- 50 miles south of San Francisco and synonymous with the silicon chip, digital watch, hand-held calculator, video game and personal computer -- has found its competitiveness called into question. In the early 1980's, doubts arose about the Valley's ability to survive as a manufacturing center in the face of what appeared to be an overwhelming Japanese assault.
Silicon Valley survived that crisis by shifting its focus from chip making to product design. As manufacturing jobs fled to lower-cost regions, Silicon Valley did not wither. Start-up companies thrived, new industries like pen computing continued to emerge, and bearded programmers and corporate executives replaced the thousands of assembly workers whose jobs were shifted elsewhere.
But now a tangible mood of despair looms in Silicon Valley, leading to a debate about whether the very creativity that has defined the Valley is being exhausted.
"One of the things that is striking is that there has been a slowdown in the number of new businesses that are being formed," said Douglas Henton, assistant director in the center for economic competitiveness at SRI International, a research center in Menlo Park that prepared the original report. "That's a warning sign."
Some industry executives have called for an industry-government effort to shore up the Valley's economy -- a departure for business executives known for going their own ways.
"They're going from being cowboys to becoming collaborators," said Steven Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, an economic research center in Palo Alto.
Optimists say studies that have charted the region's decline have overlooked part of the Valley's continuing success: the impact of high-technology growth in areas surrounding Silicon Valley. Many technology start-up companies have emerged as far away as San Francisco and Berkeley -- but they are directly tied to the Valley's economic infrastructure.
Another source of confusion is that much new growth in the Valley has been in software rather than in computer or semiconductor manufacturing. Because many software jobs are classified as service rather than manufacturing, the manufacturing employment numbers have not reflected this shift.
Economists say the service category hides the real growth in the Valley -- software and hardware design jobs that have made the region the world's microelectronic research laboratory.
Data collected by the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy show that manufacturing jobs in Silicon Valley fell to 258,500 last year from a peak of 291,600 in 1984. During that period, the number of service jobs grew to 219,900 from 179,200.
 
Less Seed Money?
 Another area of concern is the falling amount of venture capital that is available for start-up companies. In past years the availability of such investments allowed virtually any engineer or executive with a bold idea to strike out on his own.
But venture financing dropped to $1.09 billion last year from $1.24 billion in 1987, and the portion invested as seed money in new projects fell even more sharply. But not everyone is complaining.
"There's still plenty of venture capital," said Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, a New York firm that monitors high-technology start-ups. "In fact there is no place else in the world that compares to Northern California in terms of start-up activity. What's broken is the economy of the state of California."
And Wilf Corrigan, who founded the valley's largest chip maker, LSI Logic, and is a longtime engineer and manager there, said: "I'm one of those people who have great confidence in Silicon Valley. There are a lot of people who come to work in the morning believing that they work for Silicon Valley."

HEADLINE: California's Ratings Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A leading credit-rating service lowered its ratings on California's bonds on Friday, saying the tardy state budget approved by Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature included a $1 billion "de facto deficit."
Fitch's Investors Service lowered the rating from AA+ to AA after a meeting at the state Treasurer's office in Sacramento. 
 "The long-term outlook for California has declined as the recession continues to be deeper than expected and employment loss is very significant, even though the full impact of defense reductions is yet to be realized," Fitch said.
The budget was balanced, in part, by shifting school money from one year to the next, a move that drew criticism from Fitch.
"Even if the plan succeeds, there will be a de facto deficit from a loan of nearly $1 billion to school districts which is outside the budgetary accounts," Fitch said.
The Republican Governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature reached agreement on a $57.4 billion budget on Sept. 2.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL: Sports of The Times;
Politics and College Coaches

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. Rhoden

 BODY:
LATE last week, someone jokingly asked Joe Paterno whether it was significant that the President of the United States had asked the Penn State football coach and not the university's president to introduce him during a visit to the campus.
On Thursday, Paterno, the Nittany Lions' 65-year-old coach, introduced President Bush to 10,000 spectators in State College, in what was billed as a "Beat Maryland Rally." 
The President, referring to Penn State's 81-0 shellacking of Cincinnati last season, said he wanted to do to his Presidential opponent what the Nittany Lions had done to the Bearcats.
A day later, Paterno explained that he had been asked to introduce the President because they were friends and fraternity brothers. He also said that Joab Thomas, the Penn State president, was obliged to maintain a nonpartisan public stance.
"It's a political thing," Paterno said. "This is a state university."
How much less political is it, however, when the nation's most highly visible college football coach uses his visibility and a public university as a platform to help advance the cause of one candidate over the other?
This question speaks to the evolving role of "the coach" at a time when the volatile, highly visible intercollegiate athletics industry is attempting to define a more precise function as an appendage of higher education.
Paterno was sensitive to the issue. He recalled the reaction of some colleagues after he seconded Bush's nomination for President during the 1988 Republican convention.
"I caught a lot of flack for that, I mean a lot of flack," Paterno said.
Apparently some members of the Penn State faculty felt, first of all, that sports should remain separate from politics. Second, some felt that such a public endorsement by anyone so closely identified with the school was inappropriate.
The prevailing image of "the coach" is still that of the sage-like figure who has been at one institution for decades, preaching, cajoling and banging on lockers to implore teams to win, primarily for pride and honor.
This traditional image came to mind on Saturday as Johnny Majors, the head coach at Tennessee, made his 1992 debut. Majors, in his 16th season as the Tennessee coach, underwent quintuple-bypass heart surgery on Aug. 25. Last Monday, just four weeks after surgery, he was back on the practice field.
In a steady drizzle, Majors trotted out ahead of his team for the pre-game warmups. Then, he coached from the press box as Tennessee routed Cincinnati, 40-0.
It was the undefeated Volunteers' fourth consecutive victory and some speculated that the unexpected early season success had prompted Majors to accelerate his recovery. And indeed, the coach admitted that he was tired of being a spectator. But Majors said that what pulled him so quickly from surgery to the football field was stronger and deeper than a need to grab glory.
He was raised in Tennessee, where his father was a successful high school football coach before becoming head coach at the University of the South. He and his four brothers all played college football, three of them, including Majors, at Tennessee. Two, Majors and his youngest brother, were Volunteer all-Americans.
His brother Bill coached at Tennessee for three years and was on his way to a successful career when he was killed in an automobile accident in 1965.
"We've been on this field a long time," Majors said.
This sense of a deep and longstanding commitment to a single institution, which has largely disappeared from the college coaching ranks, is perhaps the lone thread that legitimately connects a largely commercial enterprise to the university.
Football coaches are often public -- albeit superficial -- ambassadors for their universities; they strengthen old ties to the institutions and nurture new ones with communities whose primary contact with the schools often comes through the athletic departments.
In some cases, this critical public-relations aspect of the job has been a barrier to hiring minority-group head football coaches at predominantly white Division I-A universities.
Three years ago, Ron Brown, the University of Nebraska receivers coach, was interviewed for the head football job at Brown, his alma mater. Before the interview, Brown said, the athletic director told him that there was unhappiness on the part of a small group of alumni that he was black.
"They said, 'We don't want to play that experiment here,' " Brown recalled.
The university offered Brown the job anyway, but he turned it down, in large part, he said, because he was concerned about the support he would receive.
But the mounting complexities surrounding the role of coaches go beyond race and sex identity. The greater predicament, from Alcorn to Arkansas, revolves around the question of how, indeed where, the modern-day football coach fits into higher education. Many are given tenure, but few are required to teach, and while the uncompromising mission of the institution is to educate, the coaches' primary mandate is to win.
The lines between politics and education, entertainment and economics, in intercollegiate athletics continue to blur. In their zeal to patch a problem, educators have concentrated too much on reform and not nearly enough on the more difficult task of definition.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
What to Buy If Optimistic On Economy

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
SCOTT BLACK isn't happy to see that the Red Sox are in last place. The last time they finished in last place, Herbert Hoover was in office expounding that prosperity was just around the corner. And everybody knows what happened after that.
But Mr. Black, the proprietor of Delphi Management Inc., a money management firm in Boston, says that while the Red Sox are hopeless, the current economy is not. Social programs provide "built-in stimuli" to guard against a 30's-style depression, he says. 
 Besides, he adds, a Democrat will probably be the next person in the Oval Office. And that possibility suits the self-described old-fashioned New England Democrat just fine.
Wall Street tends to be made up of Republicans, give or take a stray liberal. Among the strays, Mr. Black is notably outspoken about his political views. Indeed, he talks more like a social worker than a hard-nosed manager calling the shots on $500 million in client money. A financier who favors drug outreach and child abuse programs, he advocates Government spending that could send a hard-core Republican into a cold sweat.
"I hate saying it, because it's not going to happen," he said. "But for the economy to pick up we need to educate our kids." That means spending big money on American schools, Mr. Black said.
A revved-up educational system or not, Mr. Black is still placing bets on a modest turnaround. He has been putting client money into cyclical stocks like Amax, Texas Industries and New Jersey Steel in recent months, figuring that "if the economy turns, these companies have a lot of leverage to do well." Amax, a producer of aluminum, gold, natural gas and coal, closed Friday at $17.125, down 37.5 cents. Texas Industries, a steel and building materials company, closed at $20, unchanged, and New Jersey Steel, a mini-mill, fell 50 cents, to $16.50.
He is also sanguine on recovery prospects for what he calls "washed-out technology companies" including LSI Logic, a Silicon Valley chip maker, and Bell Industries. LSI closed Friday at $6.375, off 37.5 cents, and Bell closed at $9.75, unchanged.
A value player, Mr. Black buys stocks only when they are selling below book value -- "the way Warren Buffett used to invest," he said with a chuckle.
Since founding his firm in late 1979, Mr. Black's accounts have outpaced the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500, rising sevenfold while the S.&P. rose fivefold. In 1990, a clunker of a year for him, his accounts fell 8.9 percent while the S.& P. fell only 3.2 percent. Client money began disappearing as value stocks languished in 1990: from a December 1989 peak of $900 million under management, Mr. Black's accounts shrunk to their current $500 million.
With value back in style this year, performance has picked up. Through the end of June, Mr. Black's clients have gained 5.8 percent, on average, while the S.& P. has declined about 1 percent. Unlike market commentators who have seized the opportunity to lay out their political investment menus -- one that applies under President Bush, another that applies under President Clinton -- Mr. Black shrugs and says it will not matter to individual stocks who wins the election. But the passionate Democrat takes care to assert that stocks, over all, have done better under Democratic administrations.
With his own money, Mr. Black has recently invested heavily in Ginnie Maes, securities of the Government National Mortgage Association, which buys mortgages, pools them and sells the securities to investors. The most recent came with interest coupons of 7 percent. Investors should keep in mind, however, that any purchases of the securities above par come with a risk: if Ginnie Maes decline in value, and an investor takes a loss, only the losses below par can be deducted from income taxes. Thus, the investor who sells a Ginnie Mae that fell from 101 to 100 -- or par -- has no deduction. The investor who bought at par and sold at 99, however, would be able to take a deduction.
Seven percent of Delphi's funds are invested overseas, with emphasis on Scandinavian countries, where Mr. Black likes the "indigenous work ethic" on which companies can capitalize. Mr. Black, who counsels clients that he does not hedge foreign investments by buying derivatives like futures and options, intends to increase his exposure to foreign stocks in the months ahead.
Currently, he owns shares of Atlas Copco, a Swedish machinery maker traded as an American depository receipt on the New York Stock Exchange. Trellebord, a Swedish metals company, is another Delphi holding. Investors must go directly to the Scandinavian markets to buy Trellebord, Mr. Black said.
Mr. Black's accounts also include shares of Hafslund Nycomed, a Norwegian maker of the contrasting agents used in medical imaging. It is traded as an A.D.R. and closed Friday at $24.25, off 50 cents.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The Industry Is Set to Start A Global Self-Promotion

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE advertising executives who toil so diligently at selling products to skeptical shoppers will now try to sell the selling process itself.
The International Advertising Association is scheduled today to discuss the details of a worldwide pro bono campaign to explain the benefits of advertising to consumers while countering criticism of it as intrusive, coercive and manipulative. 
 The presentation, on the second day of the association's 33d World Advertising Congress in Barcelona, Spain, is the culmination of two years of work on the "Campaign for Advertising," initially proposed by Roger Neill, the organization's world president. It is the first such effort by the association, which has more than 3,200 members in 87 countries accounting for 97 percent of global advertising spending.
"People all seem to know what's bad about advertising," Norman Vale, the association's director general, said in a telephone interview last week from Barcelona. "It's time to tell them what's good about it."
Barry Day, vice chairman at Lintas Worldwide in London who plans to join Mr. Vale for the presentation, said, "As an industry, we've assumed everyone knows what we do, but that's less and less true."
"Advertising is like a brand," he added. "It needs to be presented and re-presented and refreshed."
The campaign's print advertisements and television commercials were developed by executives including Mr. Vale; Mr. Day; Michel Reinarz, visual communications director at Nestle S.A.; Jonathan Davies and Charles Molony, senior vice presidents at Grey Europe in London, and a creative team at Lintas New York.
One commercial asserts that curtailing sports sponsorships would hurt fans by limiting teams' revenue sources. The point is dramatized by making one of two teams playing in a soccer match vanish, as an announcer declares: "It would be, as they say, a whole new ball game."
And an ad created to appear in newspapers says: "Did you know that every ad in your newspaper helps pay for the rest of the essential pages? The fact is, your paper would cost you about $5 a day without advertisements. A price that would make news indeed."
The ads are being produced in two versions. In markets like Britain, France and the United States, where advertising has been an important element of their economies, the campaign will carry the theme "Advertising. The right to choose."
In developing markets like China, Poland and Russia, where advertising is still a fairly unfamiliar concept, the campaign will carry the theme "Advertising. That's the way it works" or "Advertising. That's the way it works for you."
The association hopes the campaign will run for at least the next two years, Mr. Vale said. Among the group's media members that have agreed, beginning this week, to donate advertising space and commercial time for the campaign, he listed the Cable News Network, The Economist, The International Herald Tribune, The New York Times, Newsweek, Reader's Digest, Time and The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Vale said he was particularly pleased by CNN's agreement to run spots "on its entire network feed into 120 countries."
"Even Qaddafi can pick it up," he added.
Perhaps, then, someday ads will urge consumers around the world to buy a new brand of canned fruits and vegetables If it's "Libya, Libya, Libya, on the label, label, label."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
4 Months Into Strike, Pittsburgh Dailies Struggle Against Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
An eerie calm, disturbed by the sporadic crackle of a police band radio, fills the newsrooms of The Pittsburgh Press and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Ears still turn toward the radio, and pencils jot down a note or an address. But there is little reason for reporters to grab a telephone or rush to the scene of a crime. Because for yet another day, there will be no daily newspaper. 
 The four-month-old strike against the two newspapers by the teamsters' union has stopped publication and has raised some tough questions: Will enough readers return after the strike to assure the survival of both newspapers? And are the newspapers being permanently eclipsed by other media?
Newspaper executives fear that many readers may be gone forever.
Before the strike, The Press had an average circulation of about 210,000 daily and 553,000 on Sunday, while The Post-Gazette's weekday circulation totaled about 155,000. Some of that circulation is almost certain to be lost; the question is how much.
USA Today has increased its circulation in the Pittsburgh area to more than 100,000 from 60,000 since the beginning of the strike. Suburban newspapers have also gained circulation.
 
Concerns About Advertising
 Moreover, Angus McEachern, editor of The Press, the afternoon and Sunday paper, worries that some advertisers may permanently defect to radio and television, leaving the papers much slimmer. "Maybe I won't have as much space for news when this is all over," he said.
Indeed, both papers are facing a crucial advertising deadline in the beginning of October. John G. Craig Jr., editor of The Post-Gazette, the morning paper, noted that many big advertisers would be making decisions then on their budgets for the rest of the year -- which includes the extremely ad-rich Christmas season. If advertisers do not know whether the papers will be publishing soon, he said, they are likely to commit much more money to television, radio and direct mail.
The problems extend to the news staffs, where many editors and reporters are idle and wondering about the future of their jobs and their newspapers. "The primary concern for journalists isn't money but uncertainty," Mr. Craig said.
The 150 members of The Post-Gazette's news staff who belong to the Newspaper Guild are idle and are collecting about $400 a week in unemployment benefits and strike pay.
At The Press, the news staff is not unionized; its 220 members have been coming to work and drawing pay since the strike began on May 17.
But without the daily newspapers, reporters have been deprived of the chance to cover Presidential politics, a baseball pennant race and appointments of top city officials.
"When Barbara Bush was in town, I was sent to monitor it, to make sure nobody shot her," said Ed Blazina, a general assignment reporter for The Press. "But if someone did, I couldn't write a story about it anyway."
 
Behind the Dispute
 In the first few weeks of the strike, no one worried much because it was presumed that the dispute would be settled soon. The labor issues included a switch from children to adults as paper carriers, a move that would reduce the number of truck drivers needed to service the carriers.
But by Labor Day, the mood turned sour.
"People are really getting down," Mr. Craig said. "The length of the strike increases the possibility that when the newspapers come back, readers will say, why bother?"
To maintain interest in local news -- and local newspapers -- The Press has been publishing a free alternative newspaper, The Allegheny Bulletin, which has advertisements and a few articles. The Press mails the newspapers twice weekly to about 250,000 households in zip codes where subscription rates are high. But the news is a week old when it arrives.
 
Looking to the Future
 The Post-Gazette has been producing a truncated edition delivered by fax to a few hundred subscribers, and its reporters have been reading news articles on radio stations in western Pennsylvania.
The newspaper has also been sponsoring a town crier dressed in colonial costume, a whimsical attempt to raise spirits and generate publicity.
But the strike has given The Post-Gazette a chance to test how it might be able to react when its joint operating agreement with The Press expires in the year 2000.
The Press, a Scripps Howard newspaper, owns the printing presses, circulation and advertising departments that The Post-Gazette now shares. Presumably, The Press will want to publish in the morning when the agreement expires, because readers increasingly prefer morning newspapers. Thus, The Post-Gazette, which is owned by the Block family of Toledo, Ohio, could wind up as it is now: a newsgathering organization with no way to publish.
The Post-Gazette's publishing alternatives, therefore, are as much a long-term survival strategy as a response to the strike.
Mr. Craig estimated that profits generated by selling advertising on The Post-Gazette's radio news programs could equal his newspaper's profits. Although he did not disclose those profits, he said the two newspapers had not been very profitable.

HEADLINE: Skepticism on Central Europe Trade Zone

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Central Europe has reacted coolly to President Bush's recent proposal to establish a free-trade zone with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.
Since the President raised the idea in a speech in Detroit on Sept. 10, policy makers and newspapers here have politely dismissed it as largely irrelevant and incompatible with efforts to speed the countries' integration into the European Community. 
 "We are very pleased with the offer, but we will have to examine it in the context of our relations with the E.C.," said Miroslav Somol, head of the multilateral trade policy department at Czechoslovakia's Ministry of Foreign Trade.
 
'Pre-Election Statements'
 Mr. Somol said United States officials had not consulted his Government on the idea. Suggesting that the proposal could have been a throwaway campaign phrase, Mr. Somol added, "Everybody knows how it is with these pre-election statements."
The official said, as did editorials in several Prague newspapers, that American exporters of grain and other products would be likely to benefit if trade barriers with the United States were removed. "It's obvious that Czechoslovak products would have much more difficulty exporting to the United States market," he said.
Although they have doubled during the last two years, Czechoslovak exports to the United States -- machinery, transportation equipment, textiles and glass -- still account for only 2.5 percent of the country's total exports.
A Hungarian Under Secretary of State, Istvan Major, wrote in a leading Hungarian newspaper that the idea was "not compatible with a full-fledged entry of Hungary into the European Community." But in an apparent prod at the European Community for faster movement, he added that Mr. Bush's idea could be "an acceptable alternative" if it appeared that Hungary's European integration would take more than 10 years.
Vaclav Klaus, Prime Minister of the Czech region of Czechoslovakia, said he would seek more details on the proposals from United States officials. But the Czechoslovak press agency has quoted him as saying it would be "absurd" to create a free-trade zone with the United States before creating one with Western Europe.
 
A Sharp Shift of Trade
 Since Communism collapsed, Central Europe has sharply shifted its trade away from other former Communist countries and toward the European Community, which now accounts for half of Czechoslovakia's and Hungary's foreign trade.
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland have each signed an interim association agreement with the European Community intended to prepare them for full membership within 10 years. The agreements have increased the access of Central European goods to Western Europe while imposing few reciprocal obligations on their still-weak post-Communist economies.
But Czechoslovakia's plan to split into Czech and Slovak states in January has slowed the country's road to the West. This month the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, started discussing formal ratification of the association agreements with Hungary and Poland but put off discussion of Czechoslovakia.
European Community officials, eager to minimize the economic and political disruptions from the split, have told Czech and Slovak officials that they must conclude a strong, comprehensive customs union between themselves. If not, the two successor states were recently warned, each will have to renegotiate a new association agreement from scratch, possibly with less favorable terms.

HEADLINE: Litter City

 BODY:
Simplified driving instructions for getting to New York City from Long Island: Drive west until you reach the garbage. Then you know you are in New York City.
The dividing line is precisely that clear. On major gateway highways, one abruptly sees old tailpipes, hubcaps and other refuse. Why? One reason, obviously, is money. New York has a financial crisis and many services have been curtailed. It would cost several million more a year to clean and maintain major highways properly. But another reason is determination. 
 When the Democratic National Convention came to town and it seemed important to put on a welcoming face to the world, Mayor David Dinkins found enough extra money -- $400,000 for overtime -- to do a cleanup along major arteries from the airports. Not only was heavy litter removed; the weeds were mowed and flowers were planted.
Now that the guests have departed, though, weeds the size of young trees sprout from the detritus of Detroit, a clear sign that no one cares. That's not simply the fault of government. The flowers that were planted along the Grand Central Parkway were soon stolen. Only days after city-organized volunteers removed graffiti from along the Prospect Expressway, new graffiti appeared.
Because most highways are state-owned, the state contributes to their maintenance, but the city contends that it doesn't get enough state funds and is pressing for more.
Even without more from Albany, the city retains an obligation to keep its highways clean. Yes, other needs rank higher on the list of municipal priorities. But cleaning up the filthy face that New York highways present to the world's visitors has -- literally -- fallen off the priority list altogether.

Reading J.A.B. III's Mind

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I am being blamed for a mistake I never made this summer and a mistake I am not making this fall.
The media, which I have been cultivating for these 13 years, is poised to hold me responsible for the delay in taking over the campaign before the disastrous Houston convention. (Is "poised" a good word, as in "poised for recovery"? Sounds effeminate; better tell Zoellick to drop it.) 
 They miss the whole point. The basic problem with the Bush campaign through June was not so much the nation's recession but the candidate's depression. Before I could come to the rescue of his mismanaged White House, I had to snap him out of his own double-dip. After I did, at least we had a fired-up candidate.
Granted, I had my hands full with the Arab-Israeli negotiations, and nobody sneezes at a chance at a Nobel prize, but even that delay had a campaign purpose: Rabin, who owes me his job, agreed to our sale of F-15's to the Saudis in return for the gift of some helicopters, and now we can bring off some sort of Syrian-Israeli agreement here in Washington the last week in October. That should help in Chicago and Miami.
All right, if I had been on top of things in Houston, we would never have given Buchanan prime time for his religious war unless we had rock-solid promises from the evangelicals to deliver, which they're not doing. And I would have squelched Marilyn Quayle (note to Tutwiler -- make certain it's known, not for attribution, that I came to the '88 convention too late to stop George's choice of Dan Quayle).
But I was the one who cut losses on the family-values fiasco and got Darman and Brady to swallow the no-pain economic stuff from Kemp, so at least we had a plan to wave. My Truman analogy drew a lot of media scorn, but now that Clinton is running like Dewey it may gain some new resonance.
And nobody denies we're organized. Our spokesmen are seized with a simple message, and Teeter and Black clobber Kantor and Carville on TV. (Get some pundit to praise Carville -- I want to see more of that evil grin.)
Now they say my mistake is in botching the debate debate. How little they know.
My strategy is to bust up the inevitability-of-Clinton factor first with a Perot ratings scramble, then with one killer three-way debate.
Our cover story for delay has been that we want a panel of reporters to protect us from a head-to-head contest with a Clinton great on specifics. As a result, the media have been falling all over themselves deriding their own questions that begin "What if your own son were gay and pregnant?" Now they assume a moderator-only debate to be in Clinton's interest.
They forget the way George tore Dan Rather's head off when he dared ask about Iran-contra four years early. They missed the way Bush recently scored on Brokaw's show, in the only joint appearance so far, while Clinton talked too fast.
The media have persuaded themselves, and the public, that George is too much the gentleman to do the dirty work of destroying his opponent's character. But I want the President of the United States positioned right in the middle of a threesome, between the little guy others deride as "the yellow Ross of Texas" and the puffy draft dodger we hit in ads as "Slick Willie."
All the better if the two of them gang up on the President. Then he's the lonely man in the middle, the only one who has proven courage in combat, the only one with a plan to stop terrorist missiles from raining down on America, the only one against tax hikes, the only one you can really trust -- against one guy with no experience in government and another guy with only experience in government. Take a chance -- hit Clinton for pandering to Perot.
How do we get people to stop voting against us and start voting against them? The trick is to shift attention away from the record of the past to the dangers of the future -- to high taxes and crippling inflation. To get back the women and the youth, we have to push Perot to isolation and Clinton to intervention and re-implant the simple fear of war.
It's a daring strategy, and it requires some forward momentum before the debate, but when you're this far behind this late, you have to roll the dice.
If it doesn't work, all my spin doctors know the four magic words: "Not even Jim Baker . . ."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Triumph and Tragedy

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Two years ago, in the Persian Gulf crisis, President Bush summoned up a vision to support his call for international military action against Iraq. Whatever one thought of the war and the way he took us into it, the vision was inspiring.
"A new world order," he called it. The strong would be called to account if they attacked the weak. Human rights would be respected. America, the one superpower, would provide leadership by seeking international consensus through the United Nations. 
 It was an appealing vision and a promising one. It combined the Wilsonian idealism that has been so important in American foreign policy through the years -- the concern for individual and national rights -- with a realistic sense of changing power in the post-cold war world. So it seemed.
The hopes raised by Mr. Bush's rhetoric then have turned to dust. Today the phrase "a new world order" evokes nothing but cynicism.
Instead of seizing the moment for constructive American leadership, Mr. Bush funked one opportunity, one challenge after another. He was slow to understand and accept the breakup of the Soviet Union, slow to recognize its republics, slow to offer help to their struggling democracies. In China he sided with yesterday's men, the aging Communist tyrants. He has had no leadership to offer in the world's financial turmoil.
But the greatest failure, the one that will forever stain George Bush's reputation, has been in the former Yugoslavia. Bold American leadership, exercised in a timely way, could have prevented much of the political and human disaster. Mr. Bush wrung his hands. He is still wringing them.
The world has a short attention span for tragedy. How many times can we bear to hear about Serbian slaughter of innocent Bosnians? But the slaughter goes on, with terrible consequences not just for the Bosnians but for the peace of the world.
Within the last week we have heard reports of Serbs taking busloads of Bosnian men, Muslims, from a prison camp, supposedly to bring them to Bosnian-controlled areas. Instead the Serbs took the men to a ravine, shot them and threw the bodies in. Two prisoners escaped and lived to tell. The episode could have come from Yevgeny Yevtushenko's poem of the Holocaust, "Babi Yar."
It happened on George Bush's watch.
This past weekend the U.S. Government said it had corroborated reports of mass murder in Serbian prison camps. A statement said "as many as 3,000" Muslim men, women and children were killed in the camps in May and June.
It happened on George Bush's watch.
"Ethnic cleansing" by the Serbs -- removal of non-Serbian families from their homes -- has actually increased in recent days. So has the Serbian shelling of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, despite solemn promises. The attacks on civilians have been worse in the last month than at any time in the six-month Serbian siege of Sarajevo.
It is happening on George Bush's watch.
How is it possible to square the feeble, feckless Bush of these events with the gung-ho President who rallied the world against Saddam Hussein? Does the difference come down to oil? Has he been paralyzed by the prospect of the election?
Whatever the reason, the American public understands how weak his performance has been. The usual explanation for Mr. Bush's slide downward in the polls from his lofty ratings after the gulf war is that people care more about the economic distress at home. That matters a lot. But I believe the public is judging him on foreign policy, too.
What has happened is more important than Mr. Bush's political difficulties, and sadder. At a time when countries are breaking up and nationalism burning, a chance has been lost to demonstrate that, whatever the ambiguity of international boundaries, the slaughter of ethnic groups will not be tolerated.
It was a task for the United Nations. And at this unique moment in modern history the United Nations could have undertaken it -- if there had been American leadership.
What it required was vision, clarity and moral force from the American President. What we got from George Bush was fudge.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan Protects Both Owl and Logging

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Don't Blame the Owl" (editorial, Sept. 21) totally ignores the fact that President Bush has devised a sensible, balanced protection plan for the owl and for logging. 
 If Congress would only approve the Administration's owl preservation plan, some 2.8 million acres of old-growth forest, in addition to the 2 million acres already protected in wilderness and national parks, would be designated as conservation areas for the northern spotted owl. This plan is designed to preserve 1,300 nesting pairs of owls and an estimated 17,000 timber industry jobs.
This would provide time for an orderly economic transition in the Pacific Northwest, rather than imposing drastic changes on families and communities dependent on the timber industry. Advocating tourism to replace logging is not a quick cure-all, especially in light of worldwide economic conditions.
President Bush wants balance and he wants our endangered-species program used as a shield to protect nature rather than as a sword to slash the lifeline of jobs, families and communities.

Jobs and Timber

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Economists Strive to Find Environment's Bottom Line" (Science Times, Sept. 8), on the search for the economic benefits of environmental regulation, was a timely report on a topic that has become a Presidential campaign issue. 
 I take exception, however, to the comment of Dr. H. Ronald Pulliam, an ecologist at the University of Georgia, who asserts that all of the jobs in the forest products industry of the Pacific Northwest will be lost in 10 to 20 years if the remaining old growth is harvested.
The current harvesting rate for old growth is based on achieving sustained yield. When the forests in the Northwest are harvested, seedlings are planted to replace them. These seedlings mature and eventually provide new raw material for consumers. For example, trees planted on private land 70 to 80 years ago will be ready for harvest in another 20 years.
Unless more land is set aside, the current level of harvesting need not decline precipitously. A recent University of Washington study found that "timber harvesting in western Washington will decline just 4.6 percent over the next 100 years." When Dr. Pulliam says people will lose jobs if old-growth harvesting continues, he ignores sustained yield and how that strategy assures jobs and timber in perpetuity.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ross Perot;
Perot Plan to Attack Deficit Thrusts Issue at Opponents

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
In the 21 weeks from when his unorthodox campaign for President blasted off until it exploded, Ross Perot basically offered voters only himself and an outlet for their anger.
Now, as he flirts with reviving his candidacy, he is proffering something else: a bold, and some say drastic, plan to eliminate the Federal budget deficit in five years and reinvigorate the nation's economy. 
 Many economists and Congressional leaders have acknowledged that Mr. Perot's plan might actually be a realistic way to eliminate the deficit estimated at $350 billion for the current fiscal year. But even those who support the plan concede that its sharp tax increases and harsh cuts in popular Government spending programs make it too perilous to be embraced by a Presidential candidate who has any chance of winning in November.
Mr. Perot did not make his plan public until he had declared himself out of the running in mid-July. But now that he has re-emerged and leaders of the volunteer movement that put his name on the Presidential ballot in all 50 states are assembling here on Monday, his plan has been thrust into the political limelight, making it an issue that President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton will have to grapple with as long as Mr. Perot remains a factor in the Presidential equation.
Representatives from the two major-party candidates will meet with Mr. Perot's volunteers on Monday, and each delegation presumably will seek to persuade Mr. Perot's followers that its economic ideas are closer to those of the Texas businessman.
On his way into a dinner tonight with state coordinators at the Doubletree Hotel, where the meetings with the major-party delegations are to be held, Mr. Perot said there would be no decision on Monday about whether he would re-enter the race. He said the state coordinators would first have to report back to their chapters. "They have to go back and brief their people," he said, adding that there would no word "for a few days."
Mr. Perot's economic platform, set forth in his book, "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country," envisions a mix of tax increases, spending cuts and Government incentives for business. And while many experts praise it as fiscally realistic, others criticize it as politically naive.
 
Little Support Seen
 "It's easy for an outsider to get kudos for raising issues that nobody else has done," said Stuart Butler, director of domestic policy for the Heritage Foundation, a Washington public policy research organization. "But the reason nobody else has done it is because nobody can get it through Congress."
Mr. Perot's economic agenda was in the final stages of being drafted when he abruptly quit the Presidential race on July 16. Some news reports at the time suggested that when he learned the Draconian measures in the program, , he concluded that it would be too unpopular for him to run on.
Former Perot aides have said that the man who once asserted that he could eliminate the Federal deficit "without breaking a sweat," was taken aback by the economic plan. But John White, an executive with the Xerox Corporation who oversaw the drafting of the document, denied that. "The notion that he looked at the plan and therefore quit is nonsense," Mr. White said.
Among the program's proposals that may be difficult to sell are gasoline taxes that increase 10 cents a gallon every year for five years, increased taxes on Social Security benefits to upper-income beneficiaries, an increase to 33 percent from 31 percent in the marginal income-tax rate for individuals making more than $55,550 and joint filers earning more than $89,250 a year, and taxes on some employer-provided health care plans.
 
15 Percent Cuts
 On the spending side, Mr. Perot proposes cutting by 15 percent Federal spending for programs other than debt costs, the military and mandatory programs, also called entitlements, like Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, food stamps and agricultural price supports that automatically pay benefits to everyone who is eligible. He would achieve that 15 percent cut by eliminating what he terms "unnecessary and outdated" Government programs as well slashing nonmandatory programs by 10 percent. Most mandatory programs would not be cut, but some recipients would be taxed on their benefits.
Mr. Perot would also reduce military spending by an $40 billion more than the cuts proposed by Mr. Bush, in part by eliminating weapons programs, including the B-2 bomber and the Seawolf submarine.
It is a far bolder and more specific attack on the deficit than anything offered so far by either the President or Mr. Clinton.
"This is the only proposal floating around in the public sector today published by anybody who's running for office that will solve the budget-deficit problem," said Carol Cox Wait, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit organization in Washington.
Mr. Bush asserts that the deficit can be brought under control without tax increases, largely through a vaguely defined ceiling on what he calls mandatory spending for programs like Medicare. He has also proposed allowing voters to earmark up to 10 percent of their tax payments for deficit reduction.
 
Clinton Also Has Plan
 Mr. Clinton promises that he would cut the deficit in half in four years. His plan, based on an optimistic pace of economic growth, envisions billions in savings through cutting administrative costs throughout the Government and improving management of the savings and loan bailout. He has also proposed sharp reductions in military spending, tax increases on the wealthy and collecting more taxes from foreign corporations based in the United States.
Economic prescriptions currently top Mr. Perot's agenda, but they are only one theme covered in his book. In assembling the delegations they are sending here, both the Republicans and Democrats seem to have taken into account Mr. Perot's concerns with foreign policy, urban affairs and campaign reform.
 
Calling for Sacrifices
 Indeed, the Bush campaign has taken an apparently unprecedented step by dispatching Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, on a political mission as part of the delegation. While some historians interviewed today said Mr. Scowcroft's journey to Dallas would be little different from appearing on a political talk show or addressing a party convention, others said it debased the post.
"Bush has lowered the prestige of the national security adviser's office by doing this and has injected it into the political dialogue," said Melvin Leffler, professor of diplomatic history at the University of Virginia.
On the surface, Mr. Perot's economic plan appears to call for sacrifices from all segments of the public. Mr. White said his marching orders from Mr. Perot in drafting the plan included an admonition to protect the poor. But calling for a 10 percent across-the-board reduction in all Federal spending except debt costs and military and mandatory programs would mean that programs like the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, a nutrition program for low-income families, would be cut by the same percentage as spending that aids the middle class.
With the exception of a gasoline tax, virtually all of Mr. Perot's tax increases are aimed at upper-income, but by no means rich, Americans.
The Texan would allow tax deductions for interest on only one house for the first $250,000 of mortgage. Deductions for interest are now limited to the first $1 million in mortgages, which can be for more than one house.
He would tax as income employer-paid health insurance plans with premiums of more than $135 a month for individuals and $335 a month for families. And he would have the more affluent pay Medicare taxes on all of their income. Currently, Medicare taxes are not levied on income above $130,000 a year.
Mr. Perot also proposes increasing taxes on the Social Security benefits of retirees who have incomes of more than $25,000 a year individually or $32,000 when filing jointly.
Mr. Perot's plan is intended to stimulate business activity through the elimination of capital gains taxes for small businesses and the reduction of capital gains taxes for long-term investment. He would also provide investment tax credits for businesses and research and development tax credits.
Campaigning in the Midwest today, Mr. Clinton said the team he was sending to Dallas would seek to sell his economic plan as the most likely to reduce the deficit.
"I expect it to be very straightforward," Mr. Clinton said about the pitch the eight-person Clinton delegation would make. "We're sending a delegation of people who can answer any questions they ask about." The Clinton group will also present the campaign's proposals on health care, national security and political reform, he said.
Mr. Bush, campaigning in Grand Blanc, Mich., today, also referred to the meeting with Mr. Perot's supporters.
"Tomorrow in Dallas, some supporters of Ross Perot will gather to hear what both campaigns have to offer," the President said, "and we're going to send a team just to make a case for the agenda that I offer for America. Mine is the only agenda that includes cutting the growth of mandatory Government spending, cutting the size of Government and reducing the Federal deficit, because that is the way to give the kids here today a better America tomorrow.
"Governor Clinton offers more of the old big taxes, big Government -- no serious plan to control the deficit. And when you compare our ideas, it is a very clear choice. He wants to do what is right to win an election, and I want to do what is right to win the global, economic competition."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ross Perot;
Nominees' Camps Make Their Cases to Perot Backers

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Top delegations from both Presidential campaigns conducted a careful courtship of the supporters of Ross Perot today, but the Texas billionaire kept everyone dangling. He suggested he would announce by Thursday whether he would re-enter the race.
It was a day choreographed to highlight Mr. Perot's power in Presidential politics, and the organizations of Gov. Bill Clinton and President Bush dutifully played their designated roles. At the invitation of Mr. Perot, each campaign sent high-level delegations to meet privately with the on-again, off-again candidate and his state coordinators, to brief them on their candidates' positions and to appeal for support. 
 Not suprisingly, the supporters gathered here indicated at day's end that they remained overwhelmingly loyal to Mr. Perot. On CNN's "Larry King Live" tonight, the talk-show host received only silence when he asked the state coordinators which candidate's presentation today they preferred. They erupted in applause when Mr. King asked if they wanted to see Mr. Perot re-enter the race.
 
'No Messianic Drive Here'
 Mr. Perot, clearly reveling in his return to the center stage of American politics, portrayed the day as a much-needed injection of real issues and ordinary people into the Presidential campaign, although the briefings were closed to the public.
He continued to present his decision on whether to re-enter the race as being up to his volunteers and supporters. "This is driven from the bottom up," he said. "There is no Messianic drive here to have a candidate or to have me as a candidate."
Over the next three days, Mr. Perot said, his state coordinators will convey the content of the briefings to the volunteers, and will then report back with their "consensus" on what should be done next. He was sketchy on the details of this process, and nobody knows how many of his volunteers will actually be reached and express their views.
On the Larry King show tonight, Mr. Perot said of his volunteers, "They could decide the responsible thing to do is not get involved. They could decide the responsible thing to do is support one party or the other. They could decide they want me to run."
 
Willing to Debate
 He proceeded to give an '800' number that viewers could call to urge him to enter the race. And he said that if he enters, he would immediately be willing to debate, a process currently stymied by the Bush campaign.
An ABC News-Washinton Post Poll released today showed that with Mr. Perot in the race, Mr. Clinton's lead over Mr. Bush would shrink to almost a statistical dead heat. The survey showed Mr. Clinton with 44 percent, Mr. Bush with 39 percent and 14 percent for Mr. Perot. The poll of 616 likely voters, conducted Sept. 23 to 27, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. It showed Mr. Clinton's lead had dropped dramatically over the last week.
Other polls taken within the last several days, all with smaller margins of sampling error, showed a smaller effect if Perot were to re-enter the race. When averaged, they gave Mr. Clinton 46 percent, Mr. Bush 33 percent and Mr. Perot 13 percent.
The nine-member Democratic delegation, led by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, presented Mr. Clinton today as the true heir to the Perot movement's push for economic revival and sweeping change in the nation's direction. Senator Bentsen acknowledged that Mr. Perot and the Democratic Presidential nominee had their differences, notably on the pace of deficit reduction. But he added, "Every Perot and Clinton supporter knows that we're not going to have fundamental change by returning to office a President who offers nothing more than four years of the same."
 
G.O.P. in Awkward Position
 The Republicans' position here was more awkward by virtue of their fierce attacks on Mr. Perot earlier this year, and Mr. Perot's own frequently ventilated disdain for the President. But their delegation, led by Robert M. Teeter, the Bush campaign chairman, told reporters that Mr. Bush was far closer in philosophy to the Texas billionaire because both believed in private enterprise, steep cuts in the deficit and trimming the Government.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, among the Republican delegation, asserted, "We are serious about balancing the budget, and so is Ross Perot."
Mr. Perot said there was some "commonality" among the platforms of both candidates and his own views, although neither major party is embracing the stern package of taxes and spending cuts that Mr. Perot advocated in an economic plan made public after he left the race in July.
Many analysts say that a revived Perot campaign this late in the election season would be a symbolic effort with only marginal electoral significance. Mr. Perot's popularity has plummeted since July 16, when he abruptly bolted from the race. But recent days have demonstrated his ability to seize the spotlight -- and television time -- and thus influence the debate to a much greater extent than his poll ratings would suggest.
All of this explains why the delegations trooped to Dallas today for a careful show of respect, directed more to the millions of onetime Perot supporters around the country than to the small group in the room.
Mr. Perot said that if he re-entered the race he would wage a 50-state campaign that would go "all out." He also said that his running mate would be James B. Stockdale, a 68-year-old former Navy pilot who spent seven years as a North Vietnamese prisoner of war.
He said he would seek "an overwhelming consensus" from the volunteers on what do do next. "We think we can have it buttoned up Thursday," he said. "We're going to move heaven and earth to do it."
 
Old Innocence and Anger
 For much of the day, in his news conferences and television interivews, Mr. Perot seemed to be reaching back for the old, can-do, up-from-the people innocence of his early days as a potential Presidential candidate. But from time to time he also displayed some of the anger that marked the final days of his campaign, when he lashed out at the press for investigating his past.
After asserting that his effort, his movement and any ensuing campaign would be solely focused on issues, he asked, rhetorically, "What are you going to do when they bring up all this stupid stuff about you?" He answered his own question: "I'm going to ignore it. Now, that puts most of you out of work. But I'm going to ignore it unless it's issues, O.K.? We're going to stick to issues, fellows. And ladies."
The meetings between the campaign delegations and the Perot coordinators were closed to the public, Mr. Perot said, because the campaigns preferred it that way. After each meeting, the campaign officials trooped to a news conference with Mr. Perot, where they exchanged effusive courtesies -- more effusive, it seemed, among the Democrats than among the Republicans.
In a deft piece of politics, Felix G. Rohatyn, a former board member of Mr. Perot's company, was among the delegation chosen to represent the Clinton forces. Mr. Rohatyn, who is chairman of New York State's Municipal Assistance Corporation, told reporters today that he shared Mr. Clinton's inclination to reduce the deficit far more slowly than Mr. Perot advocated, and to put considerable emphasis on job creation through private and public investment. Still, Mr. Perot was noticeably complimentary of Mr. Rohatyn today.
The Democratic delegation, led by Senator Bentsen, included Mickey Kantor, the Clinton campaign chairman; Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Senator David Boren of Oklahoma; Vernon Jordan, the former head of the Urban League; Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, Gene Sperling, a Clinton economic adviser, and Henry Cisneros, former Mayor of San Antonio.
Besides Mr. Teeter and Mr. Gramm, the Republican delegation included Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, and Mary Matalin, the deputy campaign manager.
Several campaign officials were careful to say that Mr. Perot's decision was up to him, that their task today was informational. Still, Jim Pope, a Perot supporter from Washington, said after the Clinton campaign's briefing: "Their whole pitch was the Perot volunteers could do more by giving Clinton a bigger mandate for change. The emphasis was on the need for change, and they saw Clinton as the vehicle for change. And what we did should just be supportive."
As the meetings with Mr. Perot's supporters were taking place in Dallas, President Bush was in the same city campaigning, but he did not meet with Mr. Perot or his backers.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Pulse -- Missouri;
Missouri's Words of Advice to Bush: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 26

 BODY:
In November 1976, Christopher S. Bond, then the Governor of Missouri, gathered family and friends for a party to celebrate what he confidently expected to be his re-election. But he lost, unable to overcome the drag of a losing Republican Presidential candidate, Gerald R. Ford.
Now seeking a second term in the Senate, Mr. Bond is haunted by the prospect of a repeat performance. President Bush is doing badly in Missouri, trailing Bill Clinton by more than 20 percentage points in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch poll and running behind in private surveys for the two parties as well. 
 "I told these guys a year ago that they ought to be talking about jobs, jobs, jobs," said Senator Bond, a moderate Republican. "How about giving some answers to people who ask me, 'Will my kid ever get as good a job as I have?' But instead they talk jobs for a day, then they drift off again."
Like his colleague, Senator John C. Danforth, also a Republican, Mr. Bond thinks his party has suffered grievously in Missouri from the strident oratory at the Republican National Convention, in particular its attacks on homosexuals and, in the view of many, on working women. Mr. Danforth called the convention "a total disaster that in no way stood for what George Bush or this party believes in."
 
'I'm Not Driving That Bus'
 "They've put a real hammerlock on the far right wing, maybe 10 per cent of the vote," said Mr. Bond in a sarcastic tone of voice, continuing his indictment of the Bush campaign. "That's not worth much in a two-way contest -- leaves a lot out there for the other guy. Well, I'm not driving that bus. I'll go my own way on my own little bicycle, and see if I can survive."
Unfortunately for the President, many voters here appear to identify him not with his own Houston speech, which was much less abrasive, but with those of Patrick J. Buchanan and the Rev. Pat Robertson and Marilyn Quayle. Partly as a result, many do not take him seriously when he tries to indict Bill Clinton as untrustworthy, extreme, not ready for Presidential responsibility.
So Mr. Bond, facing a serious challenge from Geri Rothman-Serot, and some other Republican candidates here (and still others in adjacent states where the situation is similar) have decided to go their own way. Former Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri, who was briefly the running mate of George S. McGovern on the Democratic ticket in 1972, has seen the phenomenon before, in his own party.
"The Republicans down the ticket are running away from Bush the way Democrats used to run away from McGovern and later from Mondale," he said. "It's a sure sign the national platform is out of touch with local ideas."
 
Bush Blamed for Economy
 David Leuthold, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Missouri, said: "People are upset about the economy. They blame it on Bush, so he is behind. He tries to shift the subject, first to family values, then to trust, then to Clinton's record as 'the failed Governor of a small state,' but none of it has really taken hold in this state so far.
"I think there are three reasons for that. Houston damaged his credibility, his support was never deep enough to stand up to trouble, and he was very late to prosecute his campaign with sufficient vitality."
Obviously concerned, the President has been pounding away lately with repeated campaign visits to the two parts of the state essential to Republican victory: the southwest, close to the Arkansas line, and St. Louis County, the belt of suburbs to the west of the city that now contains twice as many people as St. Louis itself. Right after the convention, in fact, Mr. Bush was in the Ozark resort town of Branson, displaying the "country music and horseshoes" side of his personality.
Missouri, which has 11 electoral votes, has always been considered one of the most typical states, with elements of the North and the South, of the East and the West. Very roughly speaking, it is slightly more than half urban and suburban -- big concentrations around Kansas City in the west and St. Louis in the east -- and slightly less than half small-town and rural. And in every Presidential election this century except 1956, when it somewhat inexplicably went for Adlai E. Stevenson, Missouri has voted for the national winner.
 
Seeking a Real Smoking Gun
 Can Mr. Bush pull it out here?
"Not," answered a Kansas City businessman with close ties to the White House, "unless we can prove that Clinton shot his mother or something."
But others, including Gov. John Ashcroft, a Republican whom many consider the state's most popular politician, say a victory for the President is still possible. On the basis of telephone calls to a quarter of a million homes by party election workers, he argued that "a lot of people, perhaps as many as 30 percent, haven't really focused on this yet." Having failed to push through a modest state tax increase for education last fall, the Governor says he thinks Missourians will eventually turn against Mr. Clinton because he has urged some higher taxes.
The key, here as elsewhere, appears to be the suburbs, and within the suburbs, the independent voters. As these white- and blue-collar enclaves have grown, in this state and elsewhere, the Republicans have prospered. But now property values are falling, jobs are scarce, and crime, drugs and traffic have migrated from the central cities, as if chasing the fleeing voters.
Mr. Bush appears to be gaining a bit in St. Louis County, which he carried by 10 percentage points four years ago. Early polls showed him trailing; now the race there appears to be even. To carry the state, the President must win big, especially since Mr. Clinton, with his small-town, tousle-haired appeal, is doing unusually well for a present-day Democrat in rural Missouri.
 
Jets, Aerospace Jobs, Votes
 St. Louis County is home to many of the workers at McDonnell Douglas, the state's biggest employer. By announcing there this month the sale of McDonnell Douglas F-15 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia, thereby preserving 7,000 jobs at the company's estimate, Mr. Bush spoke directly to the jobs issue and demonstrated Presidential clout.
But such tactics reach limited numbers of voters, and Mr. Bush is still not doing nearly well enough among Reagan Democrats, who accuse him of failing to extend the prosperity of the 1980's. The Missouri economy is hardly falling apart, with unemployment at about 6.2 percent, well below the national average of 7.6 percent, and the recession here is shallower than those of 1974 and 1982.
In those years, however, there was no Presidential race. Recessions seldom coincide directly with Presidential re-election campaigns, because most Presidents, whatever the longer-term consequences, contrive to massage the economy well enough to have recessions clearly on the wane by Election Day.
Mr. Bush, as Professor Leuthold commented, neither managed that nor seemed to realize until very late that failing to do so would hurt him badly.
 
Stress Money, Not Values
 Furthermore, the suburbs are full of women, many of them Republicans and Independents, who are deeply roiled by Mr. Bush's tough stand on abortion and his party's even tougher position. Harrison Hickman, a poll-taker working for Democratic candidates in Missouri, said that Mr. Bush's figures among white, independent, suburban, blue-collar women were "astonishingly poor."
Mr. Danforth said that if Mr. Bush could "get off the family values, get off all the other clutter, emphasize that we have to cut this deficit, we can't just write checks to everyone, call for sacrifice without putting the country in the dentist's chair and doing a root canal on every tooth," he could pull within hailing distance here.
"Then, obviously, they would have to go very negative on Clinton," the Senator added. "It saddens me to say it, I detest it, but without it, Bush has no hope in Missouri."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail;
At Bush Camp, a Debate On Whether to Debate

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

 BODY:
Now there seems to be a debate about debates within the Bush campaign itself.
When President Bush's aides first announced that he would not debate Gov. Bill Clinton unless the format was changed, the dispute seemed to be mainly with the commission that set up the debates. But to hear Mr. Bush's backers talk lately, there is no agreement within the Bush campaign about what kind of format there should be and, for that matter, no agreement about whether Mr. Bush should debate at all. 
 Some aides close to James A. Baker 3d, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, say Mr. Baker is increasingly leaning to the view that the President stands to lose more than he could gain from debating. Mr. Baker is said to worry that time-consuming debate preparations would make it even more difficult for Mr. Bush to gain campaign momentum. Further, he is said to believe that Mr. Clinton would gain political stature simply by being permitted to argue face-to-face with the President of the United States.
Other aides argue that debates may be Mr. Bush's last, best chance to reverse the flow of the campaign. They say he must take the risk because risk is about all he has left.
Still other aides contend that any and all debates would be to Mr. Bush's detriment, unless Ross Perot jumped into the race. Then, they say, Mr. Bush should agree to debate because, they are confident, he could dominate a three-way contest.
 
Making a Scene At a Bush Event
 It was billed as a by-invitation-only event. But 18-year-old Tony Rothert, president of the Young Democrats of St. Louis University, somehow managed yesterday to infiltrate St. Francis de Sales Church in St. Louis for an appearance by President Bush.
After sitting quietly for a few minutes, he slowly but determinedly lofted a Clinton-Gore sign.
News cameras swung toward him. But before they could focus, half a dozen Bush supporters crowded around Mr. Rothert, blocking the good shots, smugly smiling.
Then the police moved in and what had begun as a bit of political guerrilla theater instantly became a scene. There was no stopping the cameras and reporters after that. They had an action story to compete with the one about another Bush speech.
Now it was Mr. Rothert who wore the smug smile.
Shaking with frustration, Dan Hogan, the Bush supporter who led the effort to screen off and oust Mr. Rothert, lamented that his counter-guerrilla tactic had backfired. "My intention," he tried to explain, "was to ask a guest to leave when he was no longer welcome but . . ."
 
Trail Mix: It's 'Quail.' No Joke.
 About those placards advertising back-to-back "Bush" and "Quail" events the past few days at the Stouffer Concourse Hotel in St. Louis: No joke. The spelling was correct. The "Quail" event was for hunters.
What are the odds? Bookmakers cannot legally take bets on a Presidential race in the United States. But London bookies can. Recently, some have shortened their odds to 1 to 3 on Mr. Clinton and lengthened them 2 to 1 on Mr. Bush, meaning a bettor has to put up $3 in hopes of winning $1 with the Governor, and $1 in hopes of winning $2 with the President. Las Vegas bookies say that if they were betting people when it comes to politics, those odds would have the right look -- unless Ross Perot jumps in, in which case all bets are off.
By the numbers: After issuing their economic manifestoes for America earlier in the campaign, President Bush and Governor Clinton both posted telephone numbers and urged voters to call in for free copies. So what's the score? The Bush campaign (202-336-7080) says it has received "somewhere around" 225,000 requests for the President's "Agenda for American Renewal." The Clinton campaign (1-800-For-Bill) says it has received "at least" 100,000 requests for the Governor's "Putting People First." What all that adds up to is anybody's guess.
The real straw poll: Moviegoers at the 300 or so General Cinema theaters around the country can ask for either a Bush straw or a Clinton straw when they buy their movie drinks. So far, more than 670,000 "votes" have been cast. And the winner is: Bill Clinton, by 55 percent to 45 percent.
Incidentally, that margin is fairly close to national polls.

HEADLINE: An Outsider's Amex Stewardship

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Struggling to survive as the nation's third-largest stock market, the American Stock Exchange in 1989 undertook a bold experiment: In search of a new chairman, the Amex reached outside Wall Street's clubby world to tap James R. Jones, a former Democratic Congressman.
The idea struck some on Wall Street as a worthwhile gambit. The exchange's future seemed to be in the hands of Washington as new rules that could reshape the industry were considered. So, the thinking went, who better to present the Amex's case to Government officials than one of their own? 
 But three years later, the experiment appears wobbly. A small but influential group of floor traders is working to derail a renewal of Mr. Jones's contract even as others -- including some supporters -- criticize what they contend is his failure to grasp the exchange's workings.
"He needs to learn more about our business," said George Reichelm, a prominent trader who says he supports the former Oklahoma Congressman, even while describing many of his accomplishments as "more facade than reality."
 
Morale Problems Arise
 The net effect of the criticism, which Mr. Jones and others contend is the result of traders angered about a market slowdown and his moves to shake up the Amex, is that while the exchange faces increasing competition from other exchanges, it must contend with morale problems; resumes from exchange managers are circulating.
Rumors that Mr. Jones, 53 years old, is a candidate for a job in a Clinton Administration has prompted some Amex veterans to hold their fire, they say, hoping the Presidential election resolves the issue. If not, they say the pressure could mount again after November.
The criticism of Mr. Jones involves management decisions, like his naming of two former Congressional aides with no exchange experience to senior posts and what some see as poorly timed dismissals of two executives. One was let go shortly after she disclosed her pregnancy and another within days of his mother's funeral.
Some at the exchange also look askance at his failure to select a president for the Amex for more than two years, for not consulting with traders or even board members on some decisions, for reorganizing the exchange in a way that raised conflict-of-interest questions as some compliance functions became part of the marketing division, and for spending time on what some contend are publicity gimmicks.
To be sure, criticism is an occupational hazard in the chairman's job, resulting from the anger arising from trying to balance competing interests of members and the public. And, Amex officials say, Mr. Jones is being unfairly blamed for the exchange's failure to increase trading volume.
Business at the exchange has been flat for years, with the average daily volume still below the 13.8 million share volume in 1987. This comes as the Amex -- like its bigger competitors, Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange -- is struggling with some of the leanest times in years, posting a loss last year. The Amex has begun to see stronger revenues in the first six months of 1992 for the first time in years.
"There is always going to be complaining during a volume slowdown," Mr. Jones said in an interview. "The entire time I've been here we had doldrums in the economy."
The Amex chairman also attributes the criticism to his moves into new endeavors that he says disrupt business as usual, including his reorganization of the Amex bureaucracy. "The industry is changing," he said. "Any kind of change brings criticism."
And Mr. Jones has won converts through his work. "Before he was selected, I was not someone who was in favor of Jim Jones because I thought we needed someone with more experience," said Jeffrey Silverman, chairman and chief executive of Ply-Gem Industries and a member of the Amex board. "Since seeing him and working with him, I like his style and I think he is doing a good job."
 
Some High Marks
 Moreover, Mr. Jones has won high marks in some of the areas where he was expected to bring benefits. The exchange has established close alliances in Washington and won speedy approval of numerous new products and proposals from the Securities and Exchange Commission, including for its new Emerging Company Marketplace, where companies that do not qualify under Amex listing standards can be traded through the exchange.
And he has also won praise for championing more electronic systems on the floor of the exchange, pushing projects on hand-held terminals and touch screen technology.
But, according to current and former directors, advisers, traders and others, most of whom spoke on condition they not be identified, the successes have not overcome a frustration in some quarters with the direction of Mr. Jones's administration. The troubles began early in Mr. Jones's tenure, professionals tied to the Amex say, when he created the impression that he trusted advisers who knew him more than those who knew the markets.
Some at the Amex expected Mr. Jones to recruit Wall Street executives for top posts to compensate for the fact that he is the only head of a major American exchange without a business background. But, within months, Mr. Jones hired two former Congressional aides, Christopher Finn and Philip Steele, for those spots.
Mr. Finn, a former press secretary for Mr. Jones, is now head of equities for the Amex although he does not have a business degree. His only business experience came from about a year working with the financing arm of an engineering services company.
Mr. Steele, who has a business degree from Stanford and also worked as a Congressional aide for Mr. Jones, is executive vice president in charge of strategic planning. His business experience comes from working as a consultant with the firm of Seidman & Seidman. Amex veterans criticized a number of Mr. Steele's projects, including a failed effort to open trading in Hawaii.
Mr. Jones defends the two selections, saying that Mr. Finn brought skills of marketing and dealing well with people, while Mr. Steele brought wide-ranging experiences from his consulting work. "I think we have a good team here," he said.
Within months of Mr. Jones's arrival, the management of the Amex changed significantly. Kenneth Leibler, the president, resigned. Mr. Jones said he had not named a successor in part because none of the managers were ready for the job.
Other executive changes have brought litigation. During Mr. Jones's first year, Katherine Walz was dismissed shortly after she informed the management that she was pregnant. The dismissal, court documents say, was at the direction of Mr. Jones. Ms. Walz was the director of strategic planning and had worked under Mr. Leibler, whose departure put her post in question.
When she was dismissed, Ms. Walz was given a severance agreement that would pay her the equivalent of about four months' salary and limited health benefits in exchange for agreeing not to file claims against the exchange regarding her termination and from discussing any Amex issue with the media. Ms. Walz refused to sign and threatened to file a sex discrimination suit.
 
Moved to Smaller Office
 The exchange quickly agreed to rehire Ms. Walz to work for Mr. Steele as if the dismissal had never occurred. Yet upon her return, court documents show, Ms. Walz was not allowed to return to her empty office on the executive floor but was instead moved to a smaller office in a neighboring building. She had little of her former contact with senior executives, and, at the end of the year, her bonus was a fraction of what she had received before.
Ms. Walz left the exchange, filing along with her husband a lawsuit contending she had been "constructively discharged" in retaliation for her discrimination threat. The Amex disputed the charge, saying Ms. Walz had significant assignments and chose to leave. This month, Federal District Judge Lawrence M. McKenna ruled that the case could go to trial, stating the exchange's actions raised "significant questions about the possibility of retaliatory motive."
Mr. Jones said he could not comment on the pending litigation.
The handling of other dismissals also created internal controversy. For example, in Mr. Jones's first year, Porter Morgan, a former executive vice president, was told within days of his mother's funeral that he was being let go.
The action left some executives feeling bitter about what they felt was insensitivity on the chairman's part. But Mr. Jones said that reaction was unwarranted. He said he was simply making changes he felt were needed at the exchange and was unaware of Mr. Morgan's personal situation. "That clearly was not intended, and if that is what occurred, I'm sorry," Mr. Jones said.
Mr. Morgan, who was given months by the exchange to find another job, was hired by Mr. Leibler, now president and chief operating officer of the Liberty Financial Companies. "I have had a number of resumes sent to me by a number of the management of the exchange," Mr. Leibler said.
Even as the changes were taking place in the executive offices, the Jones administration was worrying some traders. Some chafed in early 1991, when Mr. Jones said in a news report that the Amex had been headed for one of its best years in 1990 until investors got nervous after the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein in August. But the trading average on the exchange had reached its high for the year months earlier, on Jan. 5.
Even Mr. Jones's biggest success, the Emerging Company Marketplace, has brought some criticism. The concept for creating a separate Amex marketplace for companies that did not meet Amex listing standards had been around long before Mr. Jones came. But it was often dismissed for fear that it would attract companies whose listings would prove embarrassing.
It did. In what many now contend was a blunder, Mr. Jones expanded on the idea of simply offering an auction market option for over-the- counter companies by seeming to endorse certain issues. At a huge press conference, complete with balloons and flags, Mr. Jones said that an Amex committee, through a careful screening process, had uncovered the future jewels of the market. Those claims came back to haunt the exchange as the troubles with some of the issues started coming out, including PNF Inc., whose largest shareholder was banned years ago from association with the Amex.
Mr. Jones says that despite the troubles the new venture is a success and signals novel approaches for the exchange's future, although he does believe that some of the marketing for it was misplaced. But some Amex officials contend that the way the marketplace was presented and the way Amex reacted to the troubles reflect Mr. Jones's focus on public relations.
"There seems to be this tremendous concern and fear of the press," Mr. Reichelm, the trader, said. "With E.C.M., in response to the press, we should have listed 50 more stocks. Instead, we just froze at the wheel. We chose the Washington attitude of make it look good even if it is not."

HEADLINE: Hard Times for Women in Construction

 BODY:
Lisa Narducci gets up at 5 every morning to commute to the Coney Island Water Pollution Control Project. With the acrid stench of sewage rising around her, she drills and saws through plywood, crawls over hot concrete and lifts wooden planks -- all part of her day's work as a carpenter.
There are no separate changing rooms for her or the other five women on the job. There are no separate bathrooms. The trailers have pin-ups of naked women on the wall. Sometimes, a co-worker or supervisor says he doubts she can do her job. 
 Still, she is glad to be there.
Ms. Narducci and other women in the building trades find themselves fighting battles they thought they won years ago. They fight for the few jobs left in the depressed construction market. They face competitive fears and pejorative comments from their male co-workers. And they are reluctant to complain about working conditions or harassment, believing that troublemakers get dismissed quickly when there are plenty of unemployed replacements.
 
An Uneasy Peace
 After winning a foothold in the late 1970's and achieving an uneasy peace with male co-workers and bosses in the 1980's, women in the construction industry are seeing their numbers dwindle and their gains disappear. Some quit because the early hours, heavy lifting and danger of the work were not to their liking. But others left because they tired of what the felt was a hostile environment.
There are no definite figures about the number of women in the construction trades in New York City, in large part because union officials say they do not track their membership by sex. In 1990, the NOW Legal Defense Fund estimated that women made up about 4 percent of the almost 100,000 workers in the skilled trades, a number with which most industry experts agree. But they say the number has dropped since then.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which only keeps nationwide figures on the women in the construction trades, says women have dropped back from the minuscule advances they had made in the 1980's. The most recent figures show that women held 81,000 jobs in the building trades in 1991, or 1.9 percent of the total, down from 2 percent the year before.
In New York City, women may be having a particularly hard time because of the hard times hurting all construction workers: union officials estimate that between 50 and 60 percent of the work force is currently unemployed.
"Women who would have entered the industry are not entering because of the job situation," said Raymond O'Kane, assistant to the president of the District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters. "And women who are part of the union but have a family to feed or themselves to feed are dropping out because they can't find work."
But Peggy Crull, the director of research for the city's Human Rights Commission, said the recession was not totally to blame.
 
'Women Are Discouraged
 "It's not that the numbers are dropping because of the recession," said Ms. Crull, who is compiling a report from hearings the commission held in 1990 on minorities in the construction trades. "The numbers are dropping because women are discouraged. My sense is that women are being discouraged."
The women who do remain readily admit such discouragement. Ms. Narducci, who began training as a carpenter 11 years ago, said she was less willing than she used to be to ask for such things as separate bathrooms.
"I am sticking my neck out," she said. "Here I am waltzing onto the job, telling them to hire more women, and now I want a bathroom."
And the stereotypes women encounter on the job have not changed very much, despite years of women getting the work done.
Paul McEnery, project manager for the Perini Corporation, the contractor on the Coney Island sewage plant site, which is actually in Sheepshead Bay, said women cannot be expected to lift 200-pound slabs of concrete, for instance. But Ms. Narducci and another carpenter, Dolores Laureano, built a small upper floor of the plant out of those very concrete slabs.
Ms. Narducci said one of her foremen had questioned whether she could carry the wooden poles used to make scaffolding.
"That really upset me, because once they think you can't handle something, then you're expendable," she said. "Even if the doubts are only in their imagination."
One of the general foremen on the site, Gene Kelly, said he could trust Ms. Narducci and Ms. Laureano to do any work he gave them. "The only problem," he joked, "is I can't yell at them the same way I do my other workers." Why? "I'm afraid they would cry."
In the face of such enduring stereotypes and of continued harassment, women are leaving or not entering the trades, and those that remain are trying to maintain the few concessions they have won over the years. Many of them regret that they did not do more to recruit other women in the 1980's, when openings were plentiful during the city's building boom.
"We all think that the heyday was in the 80's, but it wasn't much of a heyday," said Barbara Trees, a carpenter. "We were all learning our trades, trying to survive on our job sites, trying to get used to it all. I don't think we had a chance to build a movement."
That is why she and Ms. Narducci began a women's committee of carpenters this summer. They want to push to maintain the number of women in the trade and to look for ways to recruit more.
Both women were surprised when the District Council of the union responded favorably to their idea for a committee. In many ways, the women and their union leaders acknowledge they are working toward more common goals than ever before.
The women want job security and better working conditions, and they know the union must be part of providing those. The union leaders need more strong pro-union employees and enough women to fill hiring goals on government jobs, and they realize that their female members can help them with both.
At the Coney Island water pollution plant, as on most federally financed projects, the declining number of women vying for jobs means it is more difficult to meet the 6.9 percent hiring goal fixed by the Department of Labor. There are more than 90 workers on the site, 6 of whom are women.
That may sound like it is easier for women to get hired these days but that is not always the case. For instance, the contractor was only able to meet the goal when Ms. Narducci, who was not sent by her union, asked for a job and then recommended another female carpenter.
Most contractors do not have to meet hiring goals, because they only exist on Federal jobs. And they say they are glad to avoid the problem.
"It's difficult to set a number or a percentage and say there have to be that many women on the site," said K. Robert Najarian, a vice president of A-J Contracting Company Inc. "There may not be enough women in certain trades. That may create some false economics."
Frank McArdle, managing director of the General Contractors Association, said the contractors his trade group represents -- more than 700 heavy and highway construction companies -- must comply with Federal hiring numbers on Government jobs. He said the only trade that has caused a consistent problem has been the iron workers, who have had difficulty finding women who can pass the agility and confidence tests. The union and the State Department of Transportation have had meetings to discuss recruiting more qualified women for the trade.
Some women resent the pressure to put them on Government-financed jobs. But private jobs have all but ceased in New York, as have those financed by the city. And with them have gone most chances for younger women who want to break into the building trades. The electricians' union, for example, stopped its apprenticeship program this year.
Many contractors are also hiring nonunion employees, which means there is even less pressure to hire women.
Nontraditional Employment for Women, a local organization that provides training for women, has cut back its programs for would-be construction workers. In July the group began a new program to train women for maintenance and repair jobs, which pay less than construction jobs but have more openings at this time.
Even more experienced women are becoming fed up with continuing battles on the work site and in the union hall.
"There is a high dropout rate among women in general," said Laura Kelber, who has worked as an electrician for 11 years, "especially when they become journeywomen and realize that they're not going to be treated any better."
Mr. McArdle of the contractors' association said he did not see the high dropout rate in the construction trades as a gender issue. "A lot of people decide this is not what they want to be doing for the rest of their lives," he said.
But the women who remain in the construction trades say the benefits are worth fighting for, and many remain optimistic. "Think about those women 90 years ago, who died in jail on hunger strikes for their rights," Ms. Narducci said. "It could be worse."
The women point to the high pay they receive for the work they love and say that is all they've ever wanted -- to be able to do their work and earn wages equal to men's.
"Women working in the construction trades was not a romantic idea," Ms. Trees said. "We were saying, 'If you won't pay us equally for so-called women's work, we will go where you are and you will have to pay us the same.' "

Lisa Narducci, operating a drill under the watchful eye of a co-worker, Tom Moroney, finds herself fighting battles she thought were won in the late 1970's and the 1980's.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 25.94 in a Rebound From Last Week's Decline

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks closed sharply higher yesterday, rebounding on bargain hunting after the previous session's loss of nearly 38 points.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 25.94 points at 3,276.26. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a modest 158.8 million shares, down from 213.7 million in Friday's active session.
In the broader market, advancing issues led declines, 908 to 791.
 
Decline in Nasdaq
 Despite the gain in blue chips, Nasdaq stocks ended lower on continued weakness in health-care issues and losses in some high-technology stocks.
A recovery in General Motors' stock after news of a tentative strike settlement at a Lansing, Mich., plant helped the entire Dow industrial average, said Ron Doran, director of institutional trading at C. L. King & Associates.
The strike that began on Friday, the second in a month for the auto maker, was tentatively settled yesterday afternoon, the United Automobile Workers union said. G.M.'s shares rose enough in late trading yesterday to finish at 32, unchanged from Friday's close.
Another analyst, David Holt, director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan, said of the market, "Right now, I don't see anything on the horizon that has the power to shake the market out of its trading range either on the upside or the downside."
News on the economy, earnings and politics has essentially remained the same, even though the possible re-entry of Ross Perot into the Presidential race has caused some nervousness.
"Oils were strong," one trader said. But other than that, he said, "there's no business going on."
Investors are eager to see if Friday's employment report for September will provide the Federal Reserve with a reason to lower interest rates.
Robert Caputo of the Swiss Bank Corporation said stocks were reversing some of last week's selling. "We took a lot of damage last week across the board," he said.
In addition, some of the drug stocks may be looking more attractive after their recent battering, he said.
Mr. Holt said the cessation of end-of-quarter portfolio adjustments also contributed to the slower trading. "Last Friday was the last day institutions could, on a trading basis, execute their window dressing," he said.
As for politics, Mr. Caputo said the market "seems to be trying to adjust to the probability of a Clinton win."
Amid the uncertainties, stock selection will be crucial, he said. "It has become a stock pickers' market without a clear trend other than it will stay choppy through the elections."
Some medical-related stocks continued to decline as concerns lingered about possible price controls on drugs and medical services.
United States Healthcare was down 3 1/4, to 61, and Amgen lost 1 3/8, to 62 1/2. Merck was off 3/8, to 43 3/8; Schering-Plough fell 1 3/4, to 55 1/2; United States Surgical sank 1 5/8, to 61 3/4; HealthSouth fell 2, to 18 3/4, and T2 Medical lost 5/8, to 21 1/4.
Among high-technology issues, Microsoft dropped 1 3/4, to 77, and Apple Computer slipped 3/4, to 44 3/4.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 2.27, to 416.62. But the American Stock Exchange index lost 1.24, to 377.25.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.97, to 228.70. The average share gained 15 cents.
The Nasdaq index was down 1.86, to 575.34.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of Big Board, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 4,009.500, up 12.118, or 0.30 percent.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Competing Plans For Californians

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
CALIFORNIA, hit hard by a recession compounded by military cutbacks and permanently lost jobs in electronics, is giving special attention to health care policy and political issues. At least six million Californians do not have health insurance. With 9.8 percent unemployment, even more people are in danger of losing coverage.
This week Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to sign a measure that would make it harder for insurers to raise premiums steeply for small businesses when an employee becomes seriously ill. 
 In another important development, the Governor is expected to veto a bill sponsored by the State Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, that would take steps toward establishing a medical system financed by a 7.75 percent payroll tax.
And the California Medical Association, which has 38,000 physician members, is asking voters to approve Proposition 166 on Nov. 3. It would require employers to pay at least 75 percent of basic health costs for employees who work at least 17.5 hours a week.
The medical association proposal would require insurers to offer coverage to businesses with 100 or fewer employees, at premiums within 30 percent of a standard community rate in their geographic region. The doctors say the measure would assure coverage to at least four million small business employees and their dependents.
Dr. Richard Corlin, a Santa Monica gastroenterologist who is the association's president, said the proposal was favored by a 2-to-1 margin in polls commissioned by the group. But the measure has been attacked by consumer, business and labor groups. Anne Eowan, counsel of the Association of California Life Insurance Companies, said, "Their polls are different from our polls."
Maryann O'Sullivan, executive director of Health Access, which favors a government single-payer system like Canada's, said the insurance industry was expected to "spend millions against Proposition 166."
Ms. Eowan added, "The public is very sensitive to the effects the proposal might have on the economy -- jobs, jobs, jobs." A study by University of California economists for the Bay Area Business Group on Health, a group of 15 large employers, contends that Proposition 166 would cost small businesses $6.2 billion a year.
Patricia Powers, the group's executive director, contended that the uninsured would get less than one-fourth of the money because most of it would go toward lightening the load of large employers and insurers, which now pay indirectly for the uninsured through higher charges, and doctors and hospitals, who would have fewer unpaid bills.
As for the Garamendi proposal, the Commissioner's aides said he would continue to push it, even if vetoed. He may ask private foundations to finance a commission to flesh out the details.
Ms. O'Sullivan said there was "antagonism" between the Commissioner, a Democrat, and the Governor, a Republican, who are widely expected to end up as rivals in the 1994 governor's race. Dr. Corlin accused Mr. Garamendi of planning to use health care reform "as a campaign issue." Under the Garamendi bill, the Democrats would appoint a majority of the commission to carry out the proposal.
Many business executives and health policy experts say they are intrigued by the Garamendi plan. It calls for health maintenance organizations and other managed-care networks of doctors and hospitals to bid competitively on regional contracts, which would provide basic coverage for all Californians. In both the Garamendi plan and the doctors' Proposition 166, there would be a unified system, consolidating employee health benefits with medical coverage under workers' compensation and auto insurance. How to accomplish all this is still to be detailed. It would eventually require legislative approval.
Michael R. Peevey, president of the Southern California Edison Company, which has worked vigorously to keep employee medical costs under control, had urged the Governor to approve the Garamendi bill. "California's health care system is in crisis," Mr. Peevey said in a Sept. 17 letter to Mr. Wilson. Mr. Peevey added that a commission to work out "comprehensive and far-reaching reforms" would be "a very workable model" for seeking solutions to the problems of containing costs and providing universally available care.
But Dr. Corlin and Ms. Eowan at the life insurance association said the 7.75 percent payroll tax in the Garamendi plan could fall short in paying for universal coverage. "It might be grossly underfunded," Ms. Eowan said.
People on all sides of the California health insurance battle say that the state, which claims to have one-eighth of the nation's population and one-sixth of the national economy, can be a model for national solutions to the difficult problems of health care. But some noted that the new Congress and a possible Clinton Presidential victory would move the issue to Washington. Even if that happens, Mr. Garamendi will "go forward with developing and promoting this model in Washington and other states as well as California," said Walter Zelman, a deputy commissioner in the California insurance department.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Off the Trail -- Visits With Americans;
To Ex-Deserter, Urban War Should be the Real Debate

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Jack Colhoun wears a gray pigtail, a modest relic of a life disrupted by seven years of exile and protest in Canada as a military deserter during the Vietnam War.
The real pain for him in this year's Presidential campaign is that his old issue, the war, has emerged only as a kind of grotesque aside in his eyes, a cynical evasion of far more immediate problems, he says. He cites an issue haunting America right outside his window here: the nightly specter of teen-agers shooting at one another with semiautomatic pistols as a symptom of scandalous national failure. 
 "I'm not talking urban America in the abstract; I'm talking about my daily life, the gunfire, two killings in the last two months," says the 47-year-old freelance political writer and resident of the lethally tattered Capitol Hill neighborhood.
"I mean, Vietnam? This is an absurd debate," says this voter with a Ph.D. in American history who scoffs from ground zero at this year's Beltway political stratagems.
 
Two Separate Avoidances
 At first glance, considerable self-interest might be expected in Mr. Colhoun's abhorring the latest echo of Vietnam. But he rolls his eyes at the chance to debate the relative manliness of Bill Clinton and Dan Quayle in their separate avoidances of the military draft in the long-ago.
They only proved they were veterans in good standing among the Vietnam-era middle class, says Mr. Colhoun, begging the nation to look with a quick, cold eye at the statistics of that still unreconciled time and then shift its passion toward the future, not the past.
"It was the middle-class birthright to explore the many options for avoiding the draft," he says, recalling a candid, controversial memorandum 27 years ago by Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, director of Selective Service. He wrote that manpower needs were only one task of a system that was also "heavily occupied" in shunting registrants toward deferments and so "developing more effective human beings in the national interest."
Mr. Colhoun notes, "The statistics clearly show that the vast majority of the male population of the Vietnam generation found ways within the system to avoid the war -- entirely legal loopholes built into the system."
"They paid no price, and the numbers are astounding," he says, reading from the uncontested documentation of the Ford Administration's clemency board. "There were 26.8 million men in the Vietnam generation and 15.4 million of them were deferred, exempted or disqualified. Those who served in Vietnam totaled 2.1 million." These, he notes, were largely the urban and rural poor and members of minorities. "So we're talking 15.4 mil people -- the majority -- who did something similar to what Bill Clinton did. Bill Clinton did the norm."
Mr. Colhoun, the son of a "patriotic, Republican family," had completed college as a second lieutenant in the Army R.O.T.C. when he decided the war was unjust, and when his term for service approached, he took exile in the flow of tens of thousands to Canada.
In having opted to pay a price of years away and public scorn for his views, Mr. Colhoun feels closer now to Vietnam veterans than to the majority of men in that era who found the legal loopholes. "We do need a debate of this issue, but it should be about reconciliation, not the debate going on now, this year's Willie Horton diversion from our real problems," he says, stressing truer issues of economic and sociological breakdown echoing in the gunplay outside his window.
Back in America since a general Presidential pardon 15 years ago, Mr. Colhoun remains one tough critic of his homeland. On the one hand, he accuses the Republicans of "chicken-hawk" hypocrisy in pressing the draft issue on Governor Clinton.
"Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, George Will, Newt Gingrich -- all these people were for the war," he says, enumerating a Beltway group, including bipartisan scores in Congress, who were part of the legally spared male majority. "They thought it was great; it's just that someone else would fight it for them. Bill Clinton at least was opposed to the war and didn't want to fight it. He can't make this point now because he wants the votes of the Bubbas and the 'burbs, the Reagan Democrats."
On the other hand, Mr. Colhoun accuses Mr. Clinton of skirting discussion of the urban decay and violence that are the most tangible symptoms of the economic issue. "I have to say he's two-faced and doesn't want to talk about the ills of urban America, because that means talking about black America, and he's afraid of alienating those Bubbas and 'burbs," says this voter, who is debating whether to leave his Presidential ballot blank.
Time has left Jack Colhoun something of a gray-bearded expert on the guilt that lurks around the Vietnam era, and this year he finds it decidedly undifferentiated.
"My own feeling is that whenever any male has an opinion on this issue -- whether a journalist or a politician -- they ought to say up front, like a Surgeon General's warning, 'This is what I did in Vietnam.' "

HEADLINE: For Absent Fathers, a Ray of Hope

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
In an old law office building on East Hanover Street here, a dozen men, all fathers of welfare children, are trying to leave the rootlessness of street life behind and learn how to become responsible parents, wage earners, maybe even husbands.
These are the goals of Operation Fatherhood, the New Jersey version of a federally assisted experimental program called Parents Fair Share. While there are numerous programs to help welfare mothers, the program's reasoning goes, little has been done to help the absent fathers straighten their often tangled lives so that they can take responsibility for their offspring and start paying child support. 
 But for the dozen or so men in the program here, the goal is a less lofty one: They just want a job that pays better than minimum wage. It does not have to be much better.
"Here's the difference this place makes for me," said Leroy Johnson, a recovering alcoholic who brought his 9-month-old daughter Aleena with him to class. "It's making $7 or $8 a hour instead of making $4 or $5 an hour. That's all I'm asking."
But even that step up from work in a fast-food restaurant to a job in a company mail room or as a security guard can be difficult for men without high school diplomas, with a history of arrests, and with a habit of ignoring small problems, like a traffic ticket, until they become catastrophic.
"They've been in a different society from the rest of us," said Al Walker, the executive director of Operation Fatherhood. "They're from the society of sneakin' and runnin' and duckin'. Now we've got to introduce them to the mainstream society."
Along the way, the program organizers hope, the man may learn to work things out in their relationships with women instead of simply running from them. They may even learn tenderness when, during a class on making relationships last, they field questions like, "What is your partner's favorite movie?" "What is her shoe size?" "What's the one thing she is really afraid of?"
 
Emphasis on Achievement
 Operation Fatherhood is open only to fathers of children on welfare who are not the parent with custody. About half a dozen participants, the older ones, have been referred to Operation Fatherhood by the Mercer County welfare office with the promise that their child-support obligations will be lowered or suspended while they are enrolled.
The younger men, who must acknowledge paternity of their child or children to remain in the program, come for the promise of help in getting a job.
But before they can join the Job Club and apply for work with sympathetic employers that Operation Fatherhood has recruited, they must take the four-to-six-week peer support program, the core of the program to change attitudes and outlooks.
"This is the first place I've been to where they tell you how life really should be," said David Chaviez, an 18-year-old who dropped out of school at 15 and who, a year later, became the father of Devonica, now being raised by her mother, who is on welfare.
"I was scared being out in the world," Mr. Chaviez said. "I didn't know what I was going to do from the next day to the next. I feel like I have some hope now."
Larry Davis, a 35-year-old who owes about $15,000 in child support for his three children, conceded that he had been coached earlier in his life on the basics of job hunting -- be on time, wear a tie, look the interviewer in the eye. But he credits Operation Fatherhood with having a higher level of caring.
"The mother of my children will only let me come around and see them when I got some money," he said. He recalled discussing the problem with the welfare caseworker, "and she said, 'Well, I guess you better go out and pick up some cans.' That's their attitude -- go pick up some cans."
Since Operation Fatherhood started in July, 12 men have been found jobs, with the rest of the participants still in training.
Mr. Johnson said he just likes the way Joseph Steele, the peer support teacher, talked with the participants.
"See, I never had a father," he said. "I was brought up by my mother, and I learned from a woman's point of view. Everything else I learned in the streets. Joe Steele, he teaches me from a father's point of view. It's like a refresher course."
Barbara Kelley-Sease, the executive director of Trenton's Industrial Home for Children, which administers Operation Fatherhood for the state Department of Human Services, said the men were not used to anyone paying attention to their problems.
"People call them deadbeat dads or runaway fathers," she said. "But nobody has ever addressed these questions with them, no one has taken the time to help them develop into the kinds of parents they would like to be."
The program tries to help the men put the troubles and the turmoil of the street behind them.
The other day, some of the fathers were standing out on East Hanover Street, taking a break from the classwork inside, when a police van drove slowly by. Jonathan Ledlow, a big man in overalls, instinctively stiffened, but Al Walker laid a reassuring hand on his arm.
"Relax, Jon," he said. "You're with us now."
Mr. Ledlow, who owes $10,500 in support for two children by two women, has decided that, with such support, the basic middle-class dream -- a home, a wife, kids and a picket fence -- could one day be his after all.
"Maybe not the picket fence," he said on reflection. "Probably a barbed-wire fence. But the wife, the kids, a home, yeah. Maybe I can."

Pace Slows a Bit For Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
MUTUAL funds continue to attract investors who are dismayed by the low interest rates available on bank deposits, but the inflow of cash to stock and bond funds has slowed in recent weeks to its lowest level of the year, executives at mutual fund companies say.
"There has been some slowdown, but only compared to the pace earlier this year," said Jane White, a spokeswoman for T. Rowe Price Associates. "Any other year we would have thought our recent numbers were wonderful." 
 Stephen Gibson, director of retail marketing at Putnam Investments, a Boston-based mutual fund company, noted that the "sideways movement in the stock market and uncertainties created by the election" could account for the subsiding of investor demand. He added that holders of maturing bank certificates of deposit, who were a prime source of cash for mutual funds earlier this year, might now be more willing to renew their C.D.'s, even though interest rates are at their lowest in 20 years, with banks paying 3 percent or less on short-term C.D.'s.
The August inflow of cash to equity funds, at $3.5 billion, was the smallest since September of last year, according to data compiled by the Investment Company Institute. All of the gain for equity funds came from new investors, as exchanges of shares in one fund for those of another fund managed by the same company resulted in a $591 million decline for equity fund investments.
As investors seemed to become more wary, managers of funds also began treating their money more cautiously, holding 9.9 percent of the funds' assets in cash or short-term investments that are the equivalent of cash. The 9.9 percent cash level for equity funds was the highest since February of last year.
During September, Mr. Gibson said inflows of cash to equity funds, including reinvested dividends, were about 1 percent less than in August, with bigger declines of 7 percent in some taxable bond funds and 8 percent to 10 percent in tax-exempt bonds.
Michael Hines, senior vice president at Fidelity Investments, the biggest mutual fund company, said inflows of cash to equity funds in September were about the same as in August while inflows to bond funds were down slightly.
Bruce Speca, senior vice president at TNE Fund Group, an affiliate of the New England Company, said that reports from sales representatives show that "smaller investors are staying a little bit more on the sidelines, and most of the growth is coming from bigger customers." He added that all kinds of investors were taking longer to make investment decisions than was the case earlier this year.
Despite the decline in sales of stock and equity funds in August, mutual fund executives remain optimistic. Mr. Hines at Fidelity said that a monthly survey of investor sentiment it commissions from the University of Michigan showed that "people are now getting the same psychic gratification from investing as they used to get from spending." Among investors, he noted that those who intend to buy stocks in the near future far outweigh those who intend to sell, though the 33-point margin for September was down from 44 in August.
Analysts noted that the slower inflow of cash to mutual funds might reflect a growing awareness that stock prices, measured by the S.& P. 500 stock index, have been flat this year and have declined a bit in recent weeks. Since Aug. 3, the S.& P. 500 has fallen 2 percent.
Growth and income funds, a variety of equity fund that tends to avoid the riskiest stocks and focuses on better-known larger companies, fared the best during August, with a net gain of $1.9 billion. Aggressive-growth funds did not fare so well, as investors pulled $216 million from that sector, a sharp reversal from the previous three months when more than $2 billion flowed in.
Most of the decline in bond funds was among those that invest in tax-exempt issues of local governments. Only $1.76 billion of new cash flowed to those funds in August, down from $3.43 billion in July. Funds investing in mortgage securities attracted only $743 million of new cash, less than half the average pace of the previous three months.
Mr. Gibson of Putnam said he would expect some improvement in sales of municipal bond funds, because the yield on those funds remains well above the after-tax yield of most corporate and government bond funds.
The turmoil in foreign exchange markets and questions about the future of Europe's currency arrangements may have slowed the growth of overseas-oriented stock funds. International stock funds, which invest only in foreign markets, attracted $485.8 million of new cash in August, down from $641.7 million in July and the smallest amount since April. Global stock funds, which may invest in the United States and overseas, attracted $107.6 million, down from $195.2 million in July and the smallest amount since November 1991.
Global bond funds attracted $869.2 million in August, up from $558.6 million in July and the greatest monthly increase since January 1991.
Ms. White of T. Rowe Price noted that in September her group's international equity fund has been attracting more cash than its international bond fund. In fact, she said, the international stock fund is attracting more money than any other type of equity fund the company offers.

Treasury Issues Move Up in Price

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, lifted by speculation that forthcoming economic data could force the Federal Reserve to push down interest rates.
The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond gained 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, fell to 7.33 percent, from 7.35 percent late Friday. 
 There was little news to affect the bond market. Traders said they expected that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates again to stimulate the economy.
The main cause for this view is the Government's unemployment report for September, which is to be released Friday and is expected to show further weakness.
The August unemployment report caused the Fed to lower the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 3 percent.
The continuing weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange trading, however, is limiting any rally in bond prices. Another factor is that the higher interest rates available abroad are attracting investors who might otherwise put their money into United States Treasury securities.
At the Government's weekly auction, interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell to the lowest level in nearly 30 years.
The Treasury Department sold $10.2 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 2.73 percent, yielding 2.79 percent. An additional $10.3 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 2.85 percent, yielding 2.93 percent. The rates were the lowest since the fall of 1962.
 
Short-Term Maturities Up
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term maturities were up 2/32 point to 8/32 point and intermediate maturities rose 9/32 point to 12/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.73, to 1,280.57.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 2.82 percent as the discount lost 3 basis points, to 2.77 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 2.91 percent as the discount gained 1 basis point, to 2.84 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 3.03 percent as the discount lost 1 basis point, to 2.93 percent.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
The Federal funds rate was quoted at 3 3/8 percent, up from 3 1/4 percent late Friday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 97 5/32 , up 2/32 point from late Friday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 6.39 percent.

HEADLINE: Ministers Reaffirm Unity Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
European finance ministers said today that they opposed a "two speed" approach to monetary unification that would allow one group of nations to proceed quickly toward a single currency while leaving others to deal first with domestic economic problems.
The statement came at the end of a day in which European currency markets remained relatively stable. The franc gained in value against the German mark, removing the French currency from any immediate danger of devaluation. 
 [The dollar closed below 120 yen, falling to 119.65 yen Monday in New York from 120.75 yen late Friday, as traders grew increasingly concerned about the weak United States economy and the Presidential race, and sought a haven from the dollar and the turbulent European currencies. Page D17.]
Most European stock markets fell sharply, and analysts said investors were not yet convinved that the financial turmoil of the last several weeks was gone for good.
 
Exchange Rate System Backed
 The finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, issued a statement supporting their battered system of stable exchange rates and urging that all 12 European Community nations maintain their efforts to achieve a coordinated monetary policy and a single currency by the end of the decade.
They specifically tried to quell widespread speculation that Germany was set to lead a group of countries including France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg onto a "fast track" approach to monetary union.
"Everyone present emphasized their opposition to the concept of a two-speed Europe and reiterated that the object of the community was to proceed together," they said.
The statement said the exchange rate agreement, which was left in tatters after Britain and Italy withdrew earlier this month and Spain was forced to devalue its currency, should remain a key element in quashing inflation and bringing the diverse European economies into step with one another.
But the ministers did not say whether they would address the shortcomings in the exchange rate mechanism that became evident as the British pound, the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta and other currencies were swamped by waves of speculative selling.
British officials have called the exchange rate system flawed and have been pushing for discussions on ways to reform it when the heads of the European Community nations meet next month to try to salvage their treaty on European unification. But the finance ministers of several other countries told reporters today that they did not expect any significant decisions about the monetary system at the summit meeting, which is to be held on Oct. 16 in Birmingham, England.
"We shouldn't be talking about the failings of the European monetary system, but rather about the failure to apply the rules of the E.M.S. properly," said Horst Kohler, an official in the German Finance Ministry.
His statement suggested the continuing tensions between Britain and Germany over the causes of the currency crisis. British officials have blamed Germany for not blunting the rise in the mark by reducing interest rates; German officials in turn have suggested that the pound needed to be devalued and that Britain should have done so within the monetary system rather than pull out of it.
For now, at least, the currency crisis has ebbed. The French franc rose in value today to 3.3673 per mark at the close of trading in London today, stronger than its closing level on Friday of 3.3820 and well away from the floor price of 3.4305 to the mark allowed under the exchange rate agreement.
Still, the strains on some countries remain evident. Ireland, despite a severe recession and the highest unemployment rate in the European Community, pushed a key short-term interest rate up by three points, to 13.75 percent, today to defend the value of the punt. "This is a necessary short-term measure to cope with the turbulence on the money markets," Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said.
 
Anxiety in Stock Markets
 The uncertain outlook for Europe's economies also hurt equity markets. In Frankfurt, stock prices fell 2.5 percent as measured by the DAX index of 30 leading shares.
"Within Germany there are worries that the Bundesbank's tight monetary policies will slow the economy down and that the strength of the mark will hurt exports and dampen expectations for earnings in '93," said John Reynolds, the director of global strategy for County NatWest Securities in London.
In Paris, shares fell 4 percent on the CAC-40 index. Analysts said investors had decided there was little chance of an interest rate cut in France any time soon, despite the relative stability in the value of the franc.
Prices also fell by more than 1 percent in Zurich and by nearly 4 percent in Stockholm. In London, which has seen a sharp rise in prices since Britain pulled out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and cut interest rates, shares fell today as investors stopped to take profits, analysts said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed down 41 points, or 1.6 percent, at 2,560.0.

Currency Specialist Goes to Soros Management

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Robert Johnson, a managing director and foreign exchange specialist at Bankers Trust, yesterday joined Soros Fund Management, an investment firm with a reputation for making huge bets in the currency markets.
Mr. Johnson, a 35-year-old economist, says he likes the investment style of of George Soros, the firm's founder, and Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief portfolio manager, both of whom he has known for years. "They are fundamental, anticipatory risk takers with a longer-term time horizons," Mr. Johnson said. "And I believe that's my strength as well." 
 In the currency markets, Soros Fund Management, the investment adviser for the $4 billion in four funds in the Quantum group, is known as a classic speculator. Unlike the traders at banks, who typically try to anticipate currency movements for hours or days, patient speculators like the Soros Fund managers take longer bets.
"At Soros I'll be concentrating on a six-month to two-year time frame," Mr. Johnson said.
 
Political and Economic Trends
 These longer-term players try to unravel how political and economic trends around the globe translate into shifts in the direction of interest rates and currency values. The Hungarian-born Mr. Soros is known for his skill at taking such bets and his willingness to gamble huge sums of money that his judgment is correct. In 1991, Mr. Soros was one of the highest-paid people on Wall Street, earning $117 million, Financial World magazine reported, after making a multibillion-dollar bet in 1989 and 1990 that the German mark would rise after the collapse of the Berlin wall and the unification of Germany.
But not all his foreign exchange plays have been so deft. For example, Mr. Soros has admitted to guessing wrong in the currency markets during the 1981-85 period, when the United States dollar rose, steadily lifted by high interest rates, even though America's trade and budget deficits were climbing.
Mr. Johnson also focuses on longer-term trends. For example, he says he correctly saw that optimism last year about the strength of the American economy after the Persian Gulf war was overstated, meaning that the dollar was destined to fall in value once the underlying economic weakness became apparent.
Similarly, when the British pound surged this year after the Conservative Prime Minister, John Major, was re-elected, defying the predictions of opinion polls, Mr. Johnson again thought the currency move was unjustified and would be reversed after the post-election euphoria wore off. Once more, Mr. Johnson's judgment was on target.
 
Predictions Not Infallible
 Yet he says he expected German interest rates to peak this year perhaps four months sooner than they did, in July. And he recalls saying in a speech in Tokyo last December that the retreat of the Tokyo market had gone about as far as it should. Instead, the Tokyo market retreated a further 30 percent or so, before turning around in mid-August. "Perhaps there was too much economist in me and not enough trader," Mr. Johnson said.
Mr. Johnson, who earned his doctorate in economics from Princeton University, was the chief economist of the Senate Banking Committee before he joined Bankers Trust four years ago. An officer at Bankers Trust said Mr. Johnson's departure was amicable, adding that he was "highly thought of" at the bank.
At Bankers Trust, Mr. Johnson paid particular attention to smaller foreign exchange markets, including New Zealand, Finland, Malaysia and Thailand. The opportunities in the smaller markets, he says, can often be greater than in the currencies of major nations, which are more widely followed by analysts.
Looking ahead, Mr. Johnson says the dollar now appears to be undervalued compared with the major European currencies. So on the basis of currency values as well as underlying industrial competitiveness, the dollar and the dollar-linked currencies of Asian nations like Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong seem attractive, Mr. Johnson says.

Macy's Slump: Losses and Sales Decline Continue

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
R. H. Macy & Company's sales and profits continued to hemorrhage in August, documents filed yesterday showed, as the weak economy and the company's strategy of curtailing profit-eroding promotions intensified the struggle to get out of bankruptcy.
The troubled retailer reported a $34.7 million loss in August in papers filed with the Federal Bankruptcy Court. From February through June, Macy lost $329.5 million; it will report its July loss in its third-quarter filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Sales have also gone into a tailspin. Excluding stores that have been closed, sales in August declined 8.2 percent, to $462.4 million. Sales in stores open at least one year, which analysts regard as a better barometer of a retailer's performance, dropped 10.1 percent.
The company warned that it did not expect to see a reversal in what has been a string of declining sales and mounting losses before December. It projected that sales would "increase slightly" in December and January.
"While these results clearly are not satisfactory, they are essentially what were expected during this transitional phase until the complete implementation of the company's new business plan," Macy said in a statement that accompanied the court papers. The company outlined a sketchy business plan last month.
 
Late Labor Day Affects Sales
 Macy said the late Labor Day holiday cost it about 2.5 percent in sales in August, which it expected to make up for with September sales. It also cautioned that the closing of 56 stores made comparisons difficult.
"These results are terrible," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retailing Marketing Inc., "and their own prognostication for the future does not inspire much confidence either."
Macy said, however, that only its West Coast division failed to meet its income and cash flow targets because of the weak performance in its 62 stores in California.
Macy's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a rough measure of cash flow, were $3 million in August. To satisfy the requirements of its post-bankruptcy financing agreements, Macy's cash flow must reach $10 million in the fourth quarter, which ends Oct. 31.
Suppliers have been concerned that the company would not meet that requirement, which could cause the banks to rescind their financing.
The company had $1.5 billion of current assets on Aug. 29.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Losses And Closes Below 120 Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday, closing below 120 yen to the dollar, as traders grew increasingly concerned about the economy and the Presidential race.
In New York, the dollar fell to 119.65 yen, from 120.75 yen late Friday. In Tokyo, the dollar also closed at 119.65 yen, down 1.20 yen from Friday's close, and in London, the dollar was quoted at 119.50 yen. 
 "Believe it or not, the yen is being looked at as a safe haven" at a time of turmoil in Europe and economic weakness in America, said Hugh Walsh, a trader with ABN Amro Bank in New York. The haven status is usually accorded to the dollar.
With little economic news to affect the market and with the turmoil in the European currency markets settling down, traders returned their attention to the weak domestic economy and the uncertainty over the Presidential race, Mr. Walsh said.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7280, from $1.7140 late Friday. In New York, the pound traded at $1.7295, up from $1.7150 Friday.
In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.4525 German marks, from 1.4870 on Friday. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.4525 marks from 1.4795.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.26975 Swiss francs, down from 1.2945; 4.9000 French francs, down from 5.0070; 1,222.5 Italian lire, down from 1,238.5, and 1.24795 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24015.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday, were: 1.2690 Swiss francs, down from 1.2985; 4.8940 French francs, down from 5.0365; 1.6325 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6723; 1,221.00 Italian lire, down from 1,244.50, and 1.2478 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2403.
Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $347.60 an ounce, down $1.70 from Friday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $347.85 an ounce, down $1.45.
Gold fell in London to $348.00, compared with $349.40 late Friday. In Zurich, the closing bid was $347.95, down from $349.35 late Friday. But in Hong Kong, gold was up $1.02 to close at $349.37.
Silver fell in London to a late bid of $3.74 an ounce, from $3.82 bid late Friday. On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery was quoted at $3.730 an ounce, down from $3.799 late Friday.

Slump Seen By Goodrich

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, Sept. 28

 BODY:
B. F. Goodrich Inc. said today that the continued economic slowdown had undercut its performance and that it would report third-quarter 1992 earnings below what had been expected.
The specialty chemicals and aerospace company said its third-quarter results would be significantly below results from the second quarter and below the levels analysts had projected. The company said it expected to report only a modest profit for the third quarter. It did not provide dollar-figure estimates. 
 "Our specialty chemicals and polyvinyl chloride businesses depend in large measure on the strength and vitality of the economy, and improved results have been difficult to sustain under current conditions," the chairman, John Ong, said in a statement.
Goodrich said it had continued to take steps toward increased profitability, including cost-cutting measures and limited capital spending.
"When the economy rebounds, our businesses are well positioned to respond very positively," Mr. Ong said.
Goodrich's shares lost 50 cents each today to close at $41.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Aristide as a Hero of Haiti's Downtrodden

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Over the centuries, the Haitian people have known more than their share of misery. "Haiti: Killing the Dream" covers the most recent event, the military coup a year ago that sent the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's first democratically elected President, into exile.
Father Aristide, a young Roman Catholic priest who was influenced by the liberation theology movement, began gathering support among the poorest of his country's mostly poor and illiterate people after the overthrow of the unlamented Duvalier dictatorship. By tonight's account, his plans to take from the rich and give to the poor angered the country's elite, which joined with Army commanders and a bought Parliament to bring him down. The camera does not fail to contrast the fancy villas of a few with the shacks of the many. 
 "Haiti: Killing the Dream," which the narrator, Ossie Davis, calls insipidly "the saga of a priest who became President," follows the line set forth by the Haiti Commission for Inquiry Into the Sept. 30 Coup d'Etat, a long title for a few Americans assembled and led by Ramsey Clark, the sometime Attorney General and longtime critic of American foreign policy. Its conclusions are in accord with his predilections. Father Aristide, seen rallying supporters before the coup and in an interview afterward, is treated as a hero of the people, and the United States is criticized for being behind the coup or at least tolerating it.
Mr. Clark and Noam Chomsky are recurrent presences in this hour. Mr. Chomsky, the professor of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is known for his tough language about Washington, accuses American business interests of seeking to restore the wealthy class to power in Haiti to keep a supply of cheap labor.
Father Aristide's supporters who are now on the run also express certainty that Washington did it. "With the pieces of information I have," says one, "I am absolutely certain that the coup has been engineered by the American Embassy." Few pieces of information are advanced to support the speculation, which is denied by a State Department official. In programs like this, the denials are never presented quite as forcefully as the charges.
But you don't have to accept all the premises of this well-made, if tendentious, documentary to sympathize with Father Aristide, who is to speak to the United Nations tomorrow afternoon. Whatever his failings (if he has any, they are not elaborated on here), he seems to have represented some hope to a beaten-down people.
And Washington's refusal of sanctuary to Haitians fleeing the current dictatorship may trouble even Americans who do not take the Clark-Chomsky conspiratorial line. Even if the Immigration and Naturalization Service position that most of the boat people are seeking economic improvement rather than political freedom has some truth, it is difficult to avoid the suspicion, voiced by Mr. Davis, that the fact that the refugees are black has more than a little to do with the way they have been treated.

HEADLINE: Manufacturers Urged to Make Environmentalism a Goal

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
When making commercial products, American companies should consider the effects on the environment at every stage in the manufacture and life of the product, the Office of Technology Assessment says in a new report.
Instead of focusing solely on the elimination of pollutants and solid waste that result from products, manufacturers should use a design process in which protecting the environment becomes a goal rather than a constraint, the Congressional agency said in the report released Friday. 
 Congress should encourage development of such a process, in part through new environmental regulations, such as requiring manufacturers to take back products once consumers discard them, the agency said. The manufacturing industry, though it supports companies' individual efforts to take such steps, says it is opposed to new regulations.
Representative George E. Brown Jr., the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said a crucial step in reducing waste was "to design commercial products from the beginning with the environment in mind."
Dr. Indira Nair of the department of engineering and public policy at Carnegie-Mellon University said a lot had been done to regulate pollution and waste but not enough had been done to prevent it.
"We have addressed the waste problem after it occurs," Dr. Nair said at a hearing Friday on environmental technology held by Mr. Brown's committee. "Waste prevention is a relatively new concept."
Despite fear in industry that environmental regulations undermine the economic competitiveness of companies, the report says that such design changes offered these economic benefits:
*Manufacturing costs can be reduced by lowering the quantity of materials used in products.
*The rising costs of pollution control and waste disposal can be cut by lowering the amount of hazardous materials used in products.
*Growing public concern about the environment can benefit companies that improve the environmental soundness of their products.
The manufacturing industry takes issue with the report. Mary Pigott, director of environmental quality at the National Association of Manufacturers, said: "We haven't seen their report, but N.A.M. believes that regulatory programs tend to stifle innovation. We do not support the promulgation of regulations because we believe that a new regulatory program won't give the same benefits of companies' efforts on their own."
Seventy percent of the cost to develop and manufacture a product is determined at the design stage, the report says.
New design could reduce the weight of packaging by 10 percent a year, the report said. Households in the United States produce about four pounds of trash per person each day.
Greg Eyring, director of the project that produced the report, cites the General Motors Corporation as one of the companies that had reduced its use of chemicals by turning to a single supplier whose profits depend on those from the plant's product, not on the amount of chemicals sold. So the supplier is concerned with the most efficient use of as few chemicals as possible, Mr. Eyring said.
In 1991, Germany passed a law that makes manufacturers and retailers responsible for taking back and recycling parts when a car is discarded. As a result, car companies like BMW and Volkswagen are producing cars whose plastic parts can be dismantled into parts that are recyclable. Traditionally, companies remove batteries and fuel tanks from a car and then shred what remains. The metals are removed from the shredded material and the plastics go into landfills.
But these plastics are "semi-hazardous" waste, contaminated with oil, automotive fluids and lead.

HEADLINE: Gregory Needed the Divorce

 BODY:
After Gregory Kingsley was allowed to "divorce" his natural mother, the 12-year-old boy greeted Florida circuit court judge Thomas Kirk, who made the ruling, with a smile and a handshake. The decision struck a valid blow for children's rights. Beyond the smile, however, is the painful recognition that the interests of children and their parents are not always the same.
With all the Presidential campaign rhetoric about "family values," this may look to some people like a dangerous precedent. But given the troubled circumstances, it's the right result. 
 During his young life, Gregory had been placed in foster care at least three times because his biological mother, Rachel Kingsley, a 30-year-old unemployed waitress, was unable to care for him. She had last returned him to foster care in 1990, leaving him in Orlando, Fla., while she went to Missouri and tried to provide for his two younger brothers.
After staying in a youth center, Gregory was placed with George and Lizabeth Russ, who have eight children of their own, and who wanted to adopt him. He became eligible for adoption when he remained in foster care about twice the 18-month period required before state authorities can move to terminate parental rights.
Florida authorities at first sought to reunite Gregory with his mother. But Gregory, encouraged by his foster father, who happens to be a lawyer, sued to sever ties with his mother. He accused her of alcohol and drug abuse and said he had been a victim of neglect and "mental and emotional abuse." The judge found convincing evidence that Gregory had been "abandoned and neglected." For her part, Ms. Kingsley said she only meant to leave Gregory in foster care temporarily until she pulled herself together financially. But in fact, Gregory only lived with his mother a total of seven months over the last eight years. His father surrendered his parental rights in May.
Gregory's ties with the Russes are so much stronger than his estranged relationship with his mother that the judge's decision seems the best for his welfare.
The decision need not and almost assuredly will not lead to a flood tide of suits by children seeking to "divorce" their parents. Not every child who has been neglected or abused has the maturity to act in his own behalf, even with the help of foster parents like the Russes, who could negotiate the legal system.
In most cases social service agencies are designated and best suited to determine what setting would be in a child's best interest. But such agencies, understaffed and overworked, are not infallible. It is useful, as a last resort, to have another avenue of legal redress for children in trouble.
Gregory's case vindicates the views of Hillary Clinton, a longtime advocate of children's rights. Her suggestion that children, in extreme cases, be given legal standing independent of their parents has been caricatured by Republicans as inviting children to sue their parents to avoid taking out the garbage.
But Gregory presented just the kind of extreme circumstances in which the divergent interests of a child and parent ought to be recognized by the law.

HEADLINE: Bush, This Time in Election Year, Vetoes Trade Curbs Against China

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Juggling yet another delicate issue handed him by Congress at peak election season, President Bush vetoed legislation tonight that would restrict China's trade with the United States unless the Chinese improved their records on human rights, free trade and arms proliferation.
It appeared that there would not be enough votes in Congress to override the veto, meaning that Beijing's favorable trade status would continue for another year.
 
Bush's Rationale
 In a statement issued in Dallas, where he was campaigning, Mr. Bush said he completely shares the objectives of the legislation. But he argued that punishing China by restricting its American trade would only hurt ordinary Chinese citizens and American companies that sell goods there. 
 "It is easy to be discouraged by the pace of progress in this area," he said, "but it would be a serious mistake to let our frustration lead us to gamble with policies that would undermine our goals."
The veto sets Mr. Bush on the same sort of collision course with Congress that he chose in March, and before that in 1991, when he vetoed similar bills despite protests that he was refusing to punish Beijing for its violent crackdown on the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
Republicans in the Senate predicted tonight that the President's veto would be sustained there. The current bill was passed in both houses by voice votes earlier in the month. In March, an attempt to override Mr. Bush's China veto drew a vote of 60 to 38, well short of the two-thirds needed.
The political calculus of the current legislation is more complex. While the President is likely to be criticized for his action by human rights advocates, he may win praise from farmers. They have come under threat that the Chinese might end purchases of American wheat in retaliation for Mr. Bush's decision, earlier this month, to sell American-made jet fighters to Taiwan.
The President's Democratic opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton, had no immediate comment on the veto tonight. But last December he savaged Mr. Bush's position on this issue, asserting that he had "let his friendships in China obscure what those kids did in Tiananmen Square."
Mr. Bush was head of the American liaison office in Beijing in 1974 and 1975 under President Ford, and developed a personal interest in Chinese affairs that he has maintained to this day.
This evening, the Democratic majority whip in the House, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, renewed his accusation that Mr. Bush was being insensitive to rights violations by Chinese authorities.
In a written statement telephoned to reporters, Mr. Gephardt said: "Democrats and Republicans in the Congress believe a country like China that violates the human rights of its people and trafficks in weapons of mass destruction should not receive special trade benefits from the United States. Unfortunately, George Bush does."
Congressional Democrats worked overtime to send this bill to Mr. Bush's desk in time to force a formal, visible veto, rather than letting the President allow it to die without his signature after Congress adjourns next month.
 
Family-Leave Bill Vetoed
 It is the second piece of contentious legislation that Mr. Bush has rejected in the last few days. Last week, he vetoed the family-leave bill, a politically popular Democratic-sponsored measure that would have required many large employers to give their workers up to 12 weeks' unpaid leave to tend to newborn babies or ill relatives.
In both the family-leave and China-trade cases, the White House issued the veto message late in the day, and the vetoes were not reported on most of the main network newscasts.
One House Democratic political strategist said that Mr. Bush's foes hope to use the China veto to tarnish his foreign policy reputation by depicting him as taking a craven position on a moral issue. But in an election that is being fought over issues like jobs and the economy, he said, the impact on Mr. Bush is probably marginal.
The legislation vetoed tonight would end in 1993 the most-favored-nation status now given for exports of goods made by China's state-owned industries unless the White House certifies in writing that Beijing has made progress in human rights and other areas of concern.
 
Many Are 'Most Favored'
 Despite the exclusive-sounding name, most-favored-nation status is routinely granted to most countries. It means that they will not be subject to artificially high tariffs on goods sold here. The Congressional restrictions would not apply to items made by privately owned Chinese businesses.
The decision to restrict trade curbs to state-owned industries, and to leave intact the low tariffs for private businesses, represents a new tack for opponents of normal trade relations with China. They maintain that their legislation targets those responsible for Beijing's record on arms sales and human rights, while promoting increased trade with China's emerging capitalists.
Mr. Bush argued otherwise tonight, saying small businesses in China are "interlinked in the manufacturing process with state-owned factories," and would be equally damaged by higher tariffs on exports to the United States.
The trade sanctions, he also said, "would cost us this growing market and thousands of American jobs."
"We would cede this market to our foreign competitors, who impose no restrictons on their trade with China, at a time when China is taking market-opening measures that our trade negotiators fought to obtain," the President declared.
 
Would Use Existing Channels
 He agreed that Beijing's stance on human rights is "inadequate," and that "business as usual is not possible until they take steps to resolve our differences" on that and other issues. But he maintained that existing trade laws and continuing negotiations between the two Governments on other issues are adequate for the present to address American objections.
The legislation would establish trade barriers against state-owned firms next year unless Mr. Bush certifies that Beijing has accounted for and released democracy campaigners rounded up during the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.
It would also require the White House to state that China had started to follow international human rights standards, had begun lowering prohibitive tariffs against American exports, and had stopped exporting goods to the United States that were assembled by prison laborers.

HEADLINE: Perot's Budget Cuts: How He'd Do It

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Unless we take action now," wrote Ross Perot in the preface to his deficit reduction plan, "our nation may confront a situation similar to the Great Depression -- and maybe even worse."
 Relatively few mainstream economists buy Mr. Perot's jeremiad at face value. And fewer still believe that the Perot plan, suddenly in the spotlight again now that he seems poised to re-enter the Presidential race, is more than the roughest of drafts for what amounts to a sea change in budget priorities in the midst of a recession. Nowhere does Mr. Perot tackle the sticky question of how many jobs or how much output should be sacrificed in order to put the plan into effect if the economy has not yet fully recovered. Nor does he acknowledge that the plan asks relatively little sacrifice of those who benefited most from the great tax cuts of the 1980's. 
But after years of frustration with Washington's inability to cope with deficit spending -- and months of watching the Presidential candidates duck the deficit issue -- economists are not about to rain on Mr. Perot's parade. "There's more to like than not to like," said George Perry of the Brookings Institution.
 How to balance the budget? "Reduce spending and generate revenues," Mr. Perot writes. "It's that simple." And at least in the context of agonizing deliberations that preceded the more modest cuts imposed by Congress and the White House in 1990, the Perot plan does seem simple.
 To generate revenue, Mr. Perot offers a laundry list of changes, everything from raising the top tax bracket to 33 percent from 31, to reducing deductions for business entertainment and mortgage payments on very expensive houses, to tightening the tax rules for multinational corporations.
 But the big-ticket items are a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline (phased in over five years) and the elimination of the deduction for employer-paid health insurance that exceeds a rock-bottom outlay of $4,000 a year. Even accounting for offsetting tax cuts to encourage investment and training, the tax package would raise $85 billion in 1998.
 Every broad category of spending in the budget would take a hit. The defense build-down would be accelerated, with annual savings reaching $17 billion more than could be expected from President Bush's proposed defense outlays. Across-the-board cuts of 10 percent in all discretionary budget items would save $23 billion more. But the most important economies would come from so-called entitlement spending -- the open-ended commitments to provide benefits that generated most of the spending growth in the 1980's.
 Agricultural subsidies and tax-favored Social Security checks for affluent retirees are prominently featured. Most of the money, though, would come from tough cost containment of health-care outlays.
 Over all, savings on the spending side of the budget would exceed $115 billion annually. Combine that with the revenue gains of $85 billion, season with a projected $64 billion savings on interest payments on the Federal debt as interest rates fall and the deficit shrinks and you have a recipe for balancing the budget in 1998.
 
Some Educated Guesses
Some of the components of the total savings are, at best, educated guesses of what could be achieved. Some $51 billion, for example, comes from unspecified measures to contain the growth of Federal outlays for Medicare and Medicaid. An additional $10 billion comes from unspecified cuts in discretionary spending on programs that are "unnecessary or outdated." And the savings on debt payments depend on projected cuts in interest rates over which neither Congress nor the White House exercises control.
 But budget analysts agree that most of the projected savings are reasonable. Indeed, Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, notes that most of the estimates are lifted directly from his agency's annual compilation of spending and deficit reduction options. The real question, then, is not whether the plan is a serious one, but whether deficit reduction with these priorities, managed on this scale and at this speed, would be worth the sacrifice.
 The immediate issue is timing. Mr. Perot would "begin his forced march to a balanced budget in 1994," Mr. Reischauer pointed out -- just a year from now. And by the reckoning of most computer models, a 1994 deficit reduction of $50 billion as called for in the Perot plan would reduce the nation's output by about 1 percent.
 Some -- perhaps all -- of the economic contraction could be offset by an easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Moreover, the adoption of a credible deficit reduction plan could lead to a sharp cut in long-term interest rates, as investors reduced their expectations of inflation down the road. But changes that depend on the reaction of government agencies or the alteration of investors' expectations is uncharted territory. And by almost everyone's reckoning, it would be risky business to lock in cuts in spending and increases in taxes before the recession has fully run its course.
 Deficit reduction might, of course, be postponed or slowed to match the pace of recovery. But presumably the content of the plan, the priorities implied by the tax increases and spending cuts, would have to be set in concrete from the outset. And here, the Perot outline, drafted by John P. White, an executive at the Xerox Corporation, gets only mixed reviews.
 One problem is the distribution of the pain among income classes. The affluent would indeed bear the burden of some of the high-profile changes -- notably, the limit on mortgage deductions and the repeal of the cap on Medicare payroll taxes. But the great bulk -- everything from the gasoline tax to limit on tax-free health insurance to the tobacco tax -- would hit the broad middle class. "It's not very progressive," Mr. Perry, the Brookings economist, conceded.
 Another concern is the across-the-board nature of the cuts in discretionary spending. While it might be politic to call for a 10 percent reduction in all programs, the plan begs the critical question of deciding where the fat really is. "You want to think long and hard about cutting meat inspection, I.R.S. audits, customs agents" and dozens of other discretionary programs, Mr. Reischauer said.
 But the most serious unanswered -- perhaps unanswerable -- question is whether deficit reduction would compete with other worthy goals. If middle-class Americans are asked to pay more in taxes and receive less in Federal benefits, will they be less apt to underwrite the multibillion-dollar cost of welfare reform? If gasoline taxes go up by 50 cents a gallon, will they tolerate still higher prices at the pump to finance less-polluting fuels?
 Perhaps most important, will deficit reduction have to be oversold to be sold at all? While economists are generally eager to get Washington out of the business of spending more than it taxes (at least in good years), bequeathing extra resources to the private sector may not produce a miraculous change in economic growth. "There's an open question about the payoff," Mr. Perry concluded.

HEADLINE: Don't Undermine Basic Research

BYLINE: By Harold E. Varmus and Marc W. Kirschner; Harold E. Varmus was co-winner of the 1989 Nobel Prize in medicine. Marc W. Kirschner is a former president of the American Society for Cell Biology.

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md.

 BODY:
Biomedical research is facing its annual mo ment of truth the House-Senate conference tomorrow to decide on appropriations for the National Institutes of Health. This year, basic research faces the ax. That would hurt medicine.
The economy, the deficit and the election will affect N.I.H.'s portion of the dwindling Federal pie. There is another reason to worry: the view on Capitol Hill that more of the N.I.H. budget should go for predetermined goals like cures for specific diseases and improved competitiveness in biotechnology. 
 Congressional efforts to preserve such politically sensitive programs threaten to stifle an essential but less visible component of the N.I.H.'s mission -- free-ranging studies of the fundamental properties of cells. For the first time in recent memory, Congress is reducing the Administration's request for funds for biomedical research. This means basic research is likely to be squeezed.
Under the Senate bill, the fiscal ax is placed on the neck of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the N.I.H. component that supports work on the basic principles of cell biology and genetics. That institute, which traditionally receives less than 10 percent of the N.I.H. budget, would absorb the largest cut -- about $38 million less than originally requested by the Administration, with much of the withheld money reallocated to other, more focused purposes. More, not less, financing is needed for unrestrained basic research.
Like most Americans, we have lost close friends and relatives to cancer and other diseases, and we understand the pain that leads people to fight for money to study the disease that has most affected their lives. But we are convinced that the most effective long-term approach to improving health lies in fostering the research that increases understanding of genes and tissues. Basic biomedical science cannot promise specific cures in a defined time, but a general understanding of cells will lead to cures for many diseases.
Fundamental research has provided countless dividends. New tools for detecting genetic derangements in tumor cells, for attacking tumors with novel antibodies and for protecting normal cells during chemotherapy are beginning to change the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Prospects for the early diagnosis and therapy of cystic fibrosis has been dramatically improved by the isolation of the gene that causes it.
These advances and many others would have been impossible without recombinant DNA technology. Development of methods for recombining DNA was a direct outgrowth of studies of bacterial genes and enzymes -- the sort of work most vulnerable to the budgetary knife today.
America remains the world leader in basic biomedical research because of enlightened policies that have encouraged investigators to try to unscramble the huge puzzle represented by each cell. In cells from the liver, lungs, brain and other tissues, more than 10,000 proteins work together to perform many chemical functions. Research that increases our understanding of these processes in each cell is the foundation on which new therapies for diseases will be based.
Unscrambling the puzzle of the cell cannot be done well by financing focused on specific diseases. What works best is a system in which the choice of research projects is not imposed by Congress and is free of specified methods, materials and goals.
The National Institute of General Medical Sciences subscribes completely to the unfettered approach. Those who make appropriations should appreciate that research on specific diseases will suffer if they do not sustain the basic science that feeds it.

HEADLINE: Campaign Concerns Prompt White House To Drop Waste Plan

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The White House has dropped a proposal to allow manufacturers to dispose of hazardous wastes in town dumps, senior Bush Administration officials said today, because of concern that the Bush campaign has become vulnerable to Democratic criticism on the environment.
The decision was made by the White House chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d. Aides said he was worried about the criticism that the Administration had tilted away from environmental protection. It struck down a proposal championed by the Council on Competitiveness, a cabinet-level group headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, which in the last 15 months has successfully advocated relaxing environmental regulations deemed to be needlessly burdensome to business. 
 Two senior White House officials said Mr. Baker was personally involved in the internal debate over the proposal, which would have allowed businesses to treat millions of tons of dangerous chemical wastes the same as household garbage and dispose of the material in ordinary landfills. Businesses are now required to detoxify such wastes carefully and bury them in special disposal sites or burn them in licensed toxic-waste incinerators.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Baker was worried that the Administration's yearlong effort to relax economically burdensome environmental rules had "tilted out of balance" and might become a political liability. In particular, the officials said, Mr. Baker was concerned about Mr. Bush's latest campaign promise on the environment, a pledge made in the Pacific Northwest two weeks ago to rewrite the Endangered Species Act to reduce protection for wild areas and threatened species when jobs were at stake.
The decision to drop the proposal was made Monday, a day before several prominent Democrats, among them Senator Max Baucus of Montana and Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, were scheduled to hold a news conference to attack the proposal as a threat to public health and the environment that could increase the poisoning of the nation's ground water. At the news conference today they said their criticism influenced the Administration to withdraw the proposal.
Senator Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for Vice President, issued a statement today that the Administration's decision to withdraw the proposal was "an election year flip-flop that reflects the phony environmentalism that has marked the Bush-Quayle Administration."
The Administration's action is a blow to Vice President Quayle, who has often been at odds with Mr. Baker on policy issues. Mr. Quayle and the young staff of his council took command of the Administration's agenda on the environment in mid-1991 by convincing President Bush that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs could be saved through accelerating the development of timber, oil, coal and other minerals and by reducing the reach of environmental regulations.
 
Vice President's Reaction
 A spokesman for Mr. Quayle said today that dropping the rule was a single decision and did not indicate that the Administration was going to withdraw its support for speeding up development of natural resources or for reducing environmental regulations it considered harmful to business.
"The Environmental Protection Agency received hundreds of comments and they felt it was appropriate to take the action they did," said Jeffrey A. Nesbit, the spokesman, who said the issue could be taken up again after the election. "We don't see this as the start of a trend."
But officials of the E.P.A., the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture said today that other proposals written by the Competitiveness Council and approved by Mr. Bush are also undergoing scrutiny by Mr. Baker's staff, including a 1991 plan to open half the nation's wetlands to development.
In the background of the Administration's decision on Monday lies a tangled political and legal history of the nation's program to manage and dispose of its most dangerous chemical wastes safely. In 1980, the chemical industry challenged two of the most important new rules the E.P.A. had issued under the 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
One rule said that if a hazardous waste was mixed with other wastes, the resulting mixture was hazardous and must be treated and carefully disposed of. The other rule says any sludges, residues or other byproducts of treating hazardous wastes are also considered hazardous unless there is proof that they are not.
The two rules cover 45 million to 50 million tons of hazardous wastes generated each year, mostly by manufacturers, said Dr. Joan B. Berkowitz, an independent market analyst in Washington, who based her estimate on her own research and figures provided by the E.P.A. Many companies argued that much of this waste was dirt or sand or other materials that contained insignificant amounts of chemicals, and was not a health or environmental threat, yet cost industry billions of dollars to treat, burn or bury.
In December, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out the two rules, saying they were issued improperly. The court said the E.P.A. could reissue the rules but must begin a formal process to write new ones.
Before the decision of Monday, William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the E.P.A., unsuccessfully fought for months to have the Competitiveness Council's ideas dropped from the proposal. When Mr. Baker took control of the President's campaign in August, Mr. Reilly appealed again to Robert E. Grady, a member of Mr. Baker's staff. Mr. Grady, who had been executive associate director of the Office of Management and Budget, has long been Mr. Reilly's closest ally in the White House.
Mr. Grady helped to establish the Administration's early record on the environment, when the President supported a strengthened Clean Air law and took other strong actions in support of tough rules to protect natural resources.
But until Mr. Baker became the White House chief of staff, both men were consistent losers for two years in policy debates about how aggressively the Bush Administration should pursue a strategy aimed at removing environmental restrictions and rewriting environmental laws.
Mr. Grady brought the disputed proposal on hazardous wastes to the attention of senior White House officials and then took the lead in the talks with the Vice President's staff that led to the Administration's decision to drop the proposal.

HEADLINE: Niagara Crash Of 2 Copters Kills 4 People

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Sept. 29

 BODY:
As hundreds of stunned tourists looked on, two sightseeing helicopters collided over Niagara Falls this afternoon, causing one to plummet into a wooded hillside, where it crashed, killing all four people on board.
The collision, which occurred on the Canadian side of the falls shortly after noon, rained metallic debris onto a parking lot filled with cars and a nearby restaurant on the edge of the Horseshoe Falls. No one was injured by the falling pieces, but sightseers who were picnicking, strolling or gazing at the mists of the falls did not know whether to gape at the spectacle overhead or run for cover. 
 The Canadian authorities said they could not comment on the cause of the collision, which involved a helicopter owned by an American company and one owned by a Canadian company. But witnesses said they saw the main rotor of the American-owned helicopter sheared off by the landing gear of the larger, Candian-owned aircraft.
 
Struck Landing Gear
 Robin Talbot, a tour-group leader from Montreal, said he was standing along the ridge above the crash site when he saw the red, American-owned helicopter rise rapidly and strike the landing gear of the other aircraft. "It seems to me he didn't see the other copter," Mr. Talbot said.
"His top propeller hit just near the right side door. Then the propeller just went flying off. He had no more control. He went forward a little and dived, nose first."
The second craft limped to the parking lot of a nearby tourist attraction, where it was able to land. Its pilot and its four passengers survived, but the pilot was slightly injured, Canadian officials said.
The downed American craft, carrying a pilot and three passengers, fell on an embankment where a cable car ferries tourists up a hillside to an observation point. The cable ride closed for the season after Labor Day, and officials said that if it had been in operation, more than 100 people could have been killed when the helicopter crashed.
Under portable lights tonight, investigators combed the hillside around the crash for clues. The red helicopter lay nose down at the bottom of the steep wooded ridge. Its tail section was sheared off and pieces of the twisted craft were spread out over a half-mile area on the embankment.
"I heard a bang, like a shotgun," said Robert Benoit, a 46-year-old tour-bus driver from Montreal, recalling the crash. "I saw the red copter going down, nose first. The other was drifting off to the left.
"It was shocking," said Mr. Benoit. "You see that many times in Vietnam movies, but when it happens, you can't believe it."
 
Victims of Crash
 The passengers killed in the helicopter that crashed were a man and two women who were not immediately identified. Their pilot was identified by The Associated Press as Ben Poprawski, 43 years old, of Kendall, N.Y. The bodies were removed from the site late tonight. The helicopter, a Hughes 500 that carries four, belonged to Rainbow Helicopters of Niagara Falls, N.Y., while the other craft was a Bell 206 Jet Ranger owned by Niagara Helicopters Ltd. of Niagara Falls, Ont.
An owner of the Canadian company praised her pilot, Rudolfo De Castro, for bringing down his damaged craft safely in the parking lot of a theme park. "He handles himself very, very well," said the owner, Ev McTaggart. "He was flying a damaged aircraft. Everybody walked away from it."
The helicopter's landing gear was crushed beneath it. Its right front windshield was smashed and its right door was dangling from one hinge.
The Canadian police said the two helicopters were hovering just above the falls behind the Table Rock restaurant, a popular sightseeing spot. Bill S. Bowie, an inspector with the Niagara Regional Police Force in Canada, said that after the American-owned helicopter fell through the air, the second helicopter labored to the parking lot of Marineland and Game Farm, a theme park about three-quarters of a mile from Horseshoe Falls.
He said that Mr. De Castro had broken his collarbone and that three of his four passengers were being treated at Greater Niagara General Hospital for minor injuries.
Ms. McTaggart said that Mr. De Castro was trained to fly helicopters and flew extensively with the Philippines Air Force. She said he had flown for her company since the spring.
 
A Growing Industry
 The accident came just as residents of the area had begun to lobby to control a growing industry that offers visitors flights over the falls. The flights take off from both sides of the falls on the United States-Canadian border.
"There are just too many of them converging on the area at one time," said Rob Nicholson, a member of the Canadian Parliament from Niagara Falls. Two weeks ago, Mr. Nicholson filed a bill seeking to control the helicopter companies registered in Canada. Currently, he said, anyone with a license to carry passengers can set up a tourist business and schedule flights over the falls without considering other companies' schedules or flight patterns.
Mr. Nicholson said today that he had acted after hundreds of people complained about noise and safety concerns. The number of companies offering helicopter rides over the falls grew dramatically in the last several years, Mr. Nicholson said, because economic problems encouraged anyone with a flying license and an aircraft to try to cash in on the tourist business.
Ms. McTaggart said her company might have as many as three helicopters in the air at any time and logs as many as 100 eight-minute rides each day.
Some witnesses to the crash today stood frozen as a quiet afternoon turned tragic. "You could hear the 'woof-woof' of the rotors not being able to turn" as the helicopter fell to the ground, a Niagara Falls resident, Michael Folemsbee.
 
Heavily Congested
 Mr. Folemsbee said the area was heavily congested with air traffic not only from the tourist helicopter companies but also from major airports and a military base in the area. The air space above the falls, he said, "is like a major highway at rush hour."
Bobby Moss, a tourist from Atlanta, was one of the first people to reach the wreckage of the helicopter that plunged down an embankment on the side of the falls. Mr. Moss described the wreck as "just a twisted mess with a hand and a foot coming out of it."
Niagara Falls has been the site of previous aviation accidents. On May 30, 1989, a tourist helicopter much like the ones that collided today crash-landed on a nearby golf course without injuring any passengers.
In 1985, 22,000 people watched as two planes from the Navy's precision flying team, the Blue Angels, hit each other during a manuever. One of the pilots was killed; the other ejected to safety.

HEADLINE: Woodstock at 25: Adults Take Over

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BETHEL, N.Y., Sept. 29

 BODY:
For Johnny Jules, who sleeps under the stars on a sway-backed pink couch in this rural Catskills town, the site of the Woodstock Festival in 1969 is sacred ground where the seeds of peace and brotherly love were sown.
Lately, he says, this peace has been disturbed by the bickering of government leaders who see a gold mine in the nearby field that was the site of the rock concert that defined a generation for millions of Americans. 
 With a hard eye on revitalizing tourism, town and county leaders are now fighting over ways to cash in on the 25th anniversary of the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair in 1994. There's talk of worldwide satellite uplinks, a music stage a la Tanglewood and using "virtual reality" technology to allow audience participation thousands of miles away.
All of this is a change of heart for local leaders who for 23 years have been ambivalent, at best, about the legacy of the concert they remember for loud music, garbage and those in the crowd of half a million who didn't keep their clothes on.
 
Visitors Leave Mementos
 The traditional feelings are made clear by local laws banning mass gatherings and by the snow plows the town government hauled out this summer to block the path of those making an annual pilgrimage to the festival site. Trying to distance themselves from the concert, people here have not even cared that the town of Woodstock, 50 miles to the northeast, gave its name to the festival, which moved here at the last minute after Woodstock officials rejected it.
But the dollar has a strange way of healing bitter feelings, says Mr. Jules, a construction worker. "If they leave all the greed alone, they could have a concert like it was in 1969," he said. "If they do the wrong thing, it's going to blow up in their face."
As many as 20,000 people passed through Bethel to celebrate Woodstock's 20th anniversary in 1989 and created a sort of spontaneous happening, but the event was without the sanction of government officials. A local hotelier tried to capitalize with an extravagant celebration, but it attracted only several hundred people. The hotel now sits defunct.
 
Town and County at Odds
 Otherwise, no one has paid much attention to those who visit the 38-acre privately owned field, which is marked by a small gray monument shaped like a sound speaker and embellished with the Woodstock logo of a dove perched on the neck of a guitar. The pilgrims leave roses and personal messages like the one on rice paper for Jimi Hendrix that says, "Your Memory Lives On."
But now local political leaders are becoming territorial about the legacy of what happened here from Aug. 15 to 17, 1969. Sullivan County is struggling to find its way out of a recession that has closed many of the big resort hotels and driven tourists away. There are threats of major layoffs of county government workers and an $11-million-dollar budget deficit in a county budget of $104 million.
"It's pure desperation," said Jerry Ebert, who heads the county's new Revenue Generating Advisory Committee. He answers his office telephone these days with a new mantra, "Peace, Love and Revenue."
"The people of Sullivan County have suddenly come to the realization that their only hope is that field in Bethel and we want it to be a field of dreams rather than a field of schemes," said Mr. Ebert, chief organizer for Teamsters Local 445, representing 750 county employees.
Two plans are being advanced. Bethel's town supervisor, Allan C. Scott, is negotiating with the original Woodstock promoters, John Roberts and Joel Rosenman, to produce a two-day concert at the Woodstock site, expected to draw up to 250,000 people with an admission price of $100 each.
The county envisions a smaller festival with 10,000 to 20,000 concert goers. In recent days, top county officials have begun talking about trying to buy the land. And they have been courting Lincoln Center officials in the hope of forming an alliance to produce a summer series of anniversary events.
Besides the fighting between the two local governments, there is a legal dispute over who actually owns the Woodstock site, June Gelish of Brooklyn, the property owner on record, or a woman who now claims it because she is a former wife of Mrs. Gelish's deceased husband, Louis Nicky. Mr. Nicky had purchased the property from the owner at the time of the concert, Max Yasgur.
All of this adds up to "utter chaos" in the view of Bert Feldman, the Bethel town historian, now 69 years old.
About the recent squabbles, he said, "Nobody knows what they're doing and they all want to do it."
In the local diners, plans for 1994 have replaced tax rates as the prime topic of conversation.
Ted Yeomans, the proprietor of Andy's Diner, says a replica of the events of 1969 would be best.
"The country needs it," he said. "They need that togetherness. Even the kids need it."
Six miles down the road, the owner of Blanche's Diner, Blanche Masters, shudders at the thought of another big invasion, although she takes some comfort in the fact that those who came to the first Woodstock are now in their 40's and perhaps more sedate.
"I don't think they can keep the people out," she said. "They're going to come one way or the other."
But some would suggest that Woodstock is no longer a place but a state of mind.
Richie Havens, the singer who opened the original concert and now lives a half a tank of gas away in Manhattan, believes there will be another Woodstock but he does not know when or where.
"Most people didn't go there for the music," he said. "Most people didn't know the people who were playing. It was people gathering for the first time to show numbers of likemindedness. They came from all over the country. As far as I'm concerned, it was the first modern people's festival of the United States. It was a coming together of the consciousness that had already been raised in the 60's."
Mr. Havens, who performed again at the 20th anniversary festivities, said he has yet to receive an invitation to the silver anniversary and, with the current local battle, he is not certain he wants one. "The youth will be angry enough to put on their own," he said, "and I hope they invite me."

HEADLINE: Ousted Haitian Chief, at U.N., Denounces Vatican

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept 29

 BODY:
The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted Haitian leader, denounced the Vatican at the United Nations today, calling it the only state in the world to recognize the Government that overthrew him.
In an address to the General Assembly the radical Catholic priest, deposed exactly one year ago after becoming Haiti's first freely elected President, also called for a tighter economic blockade against the Caribbean country, which has one of the lowest standards of living in the world. 
 "What a scandal!" he cried from the speakers rostrum to applause and cries of support from Haitians packing the Assembly hall's public galleries. "Rejected by all the states of the world, these criminals are still recognized by the Vatican, the only state to bless the crimes it should have condemned in the name of the God of Justice and Peace."
"What would have been the Vatican's attitude if Haiti was inhabited by whites?" he said. "What would have been Pope John Paul II's attitude if Haiti had been Polish?"
 
'George Bush Must Go!'
 Noting that the Pope will be visiting the nearby Dominican Republic next month, Father Aristide expressed doubt that the Pontiff would he also stop in Haiti to make an effort to settle the strife there.
As he spoke, a big crowd of mainly Haitian demonstrators, estimated by the police to have reached 10,000 at its peak, rallied outside the United Nations to support the ousted leader, chanting: "No Aristide! No peace!" and "George Bush must go!"
The demonstrators marched peacefully over the Brooklyn Bridge to the United Nations, waving their fists in the air, carrying placards and chanting for peace in Haiti.
Some carried coffins drapped with banners saying "Stop racism" and depicting President Bush with a red tongue and horns, reflecting the demonstrators perception that the United States, like most other countries, is loosing interest in Haiti and is no longer pushing vigorously for Father Aristide's return.
"I want democracy," said Rosette Elien, a 40-year-old Haitian from Brooklyn. "Bush is not for democracy."
Among the speakers at the demonstration was Jon-Christopher Bua, a spokesman for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who said that if elected the Democratic candidate for President would reverse President Bush's policy and allow fleeing Haitians to apply for political asylum in the United States.
This was Father Aristide's second address to the United Nations, which still recognizes him as Haiti's legitimate head of state.
And the applause delegates gave him was still warm and friendly, though the chances of his returning as Haiti's President are smaller now following the collapse of two agreements the Organization of American States thought it had negotiated to allow his return.
 
'Crime Against Humanity'
 The O.A.S. also imposed a trade embargo on Haiti after Father Aristide was overthrown by military units supported by a business class frightened of his radical reformist ideas.
But the United States subsequently exempted American-owned companies on the island from many of its provisions to enable them to continue manufacturing and preserve some employment there.
Father Aristide called for that blockade to be tightened further, saying that despite criticism that it would only make Haiti poorer still, "the Haitian people again say yes to the embargo."
He called the coup that unseated him "a crime against humanity" and described present-day Haiti as a country where "blood runs, corpses pile up and repression grows greater."
Like last year, Father Aristide's address was a colorful, theatrical affair, in which he vaunted his attachment to the radical liberation theology. While popular among impoverished Roman Catholic classes in Latin America, those views have put him out of favor with the conservative Vatican.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Gore Says Bush's Efforts to Befriend Iraqi Leader Led to Gulf War

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Attacking President Bush's conduct of foreign policy, Senator Al Gore asserted today that the Administration's efforts to befriend Saddam Hussein in the years before he invaded Kuwait led directly to an unnecessary war.
In an effort to transform what was once viewed as the President's greatest foreign policy success -- the Persian Gulf war -- into a political liability in the final weeks of the campaign, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate seized on an issue at which Democrats in Congress had been chipping away for months. 
 Citing recently declassified Administration memorandums and cables, Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush and his immediate predecessor, President Ronald Reagan, forged ahead with a policy of conciliation toward the Iraqi leader, approving the sale of sophisticated technology useful in Iraq's arms buildup and extending billions of dollars in loan guarantees despite evidence of Mr. Hussein's support for Palestinian terrorists, his military programs and his regional ambitions.
Mr. Gore's speech before the Center for National Policy, a nonpartisan public policy research group, offered no new disclosures of the Bush Administration's failed efforts to change Mr. Hussein's behavior by giving him economic and political incentives.
 
American Lives at Risk
 But by sharpening the Democrats' personal attack on the President's character, the Tennessee Senator sought to portray Mr. Bush as a weak leader who followed an error-filled, duplicitous, amoral policy before Iraq's invasion and takeover of Kuwait in August 1990. This policy, Mr. Gore said, also put American lives at risk and made too many concessions when the gulf war was over.
The Tennessean maintained that Mr. Bush's "poor judgment, moral blindness and bungling policies led directly to a war that should never have taken place."
As part of the Democrats' larger effort to neutralize the issue of which candidate can be trusted, Mr. Gore also said the President not only mishandled policy on Iraq but also was less than truthful about it, and he contended that such blunders made him unworthy of a second term. The Senator said that on two recent occasions Mr. Bush erroneously stated that the Untied States did not enhance Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological or ballistic missile capability.
"Bush deserves heavy blame for intentionally concealing from the American people the clear nature of Saddam Hussein and his regime, for convincing himself that friendly relations with such a monster were possible, and for persisting in this effort far, far beyond the point of folly," Mr. Gore saidin his speech, which was so dense with details that a heavily footnoted text was distributed to reporters.
The White House and the Republican leadership immediately dismissed Senator Gore's remarks as patently untrue.
"This is another effort by the Democrats in Congress to rewrite history to conceal their opposition to the war," said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, called Mr. Gore's speech a "reckless election-year attempt at rewriting history" that he said "only highlights his own ticket's dangerous incompetence when it comes to foreign affairs."
Mr. Gore, who voted in favor of the Senate resolution to go to war, did have praise for Mr. Bush's display of "fortitude and skill" in mounting an international coalition against the Iraqi leader after his invasion of Kuwait and confronting him with war.
Although Mr. Bush "wants the American people to see him as the hero who put out a raging fire, he is the one who set the fire," the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee said. "He not only struck the match, he poured gasoline on the flames. So give him credit for calling in the fire department, but understand who started the blaze."
The speech addressed only briefly the issue of whether the Bush Administration's policy toward Iraq was not only flawed, but also criminal. Some Democrats in Congress have maintained that the Administration willfully ignored evidence of Mr. Hussein's aggressive behavior in pursuing its admittedly failed policy toward Iraq and then obstructed justice and lied to Congress to cover up its mistakes.
Senator Gore referred to "substantial evidence" that the Administration intentionally falsified export records and reports to Congress, a reference to a 1990 Commerce Department list of high-technology items to Iraq that was tampered with to conceal militarily useful items before the list was sent to Congress.
 
Democrats' 'Division of Labor'
 The Senator's aides said Mr. Gore, rather than Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, delivered the attack on Mr. Bush because of the Senator's prominence in foreign policy matters and as "an effective division of labor" between the Democratic candidates during the campaign.
But Republicans have portrayed Mr. Clinton as weak-willed on the decision to go to war, and Senator Dole today again repeated the Arkansas Governor's ambiguous remarks on whether he would have voted in favor of the Senate resolution to authorize the use of force in the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Gore noted today that he protested Mr. Hussein's use of chemical weapons against his Kurdish citizens in August 1988, a month after the Iran-Iraq war ended, and urged the imposition of sanctions against Iraq. But he, like most members of Congress, earlier supported the Reagan Administration policy of insuring that Iraq not lose the war against Iran.
Mr. Gore defended his record in the Iran-Iraq war, telling reporters later today, "I do believe that a different standard ought to be used in judging the mistakes made toward Iraq while the Iran-Iraq war was going on, compared to the one that should be used after that war was over in 1988, because the strategic justification for looking the other way at their acts of terrorism was all of a sudden gone."

HEADLINE: To Fill Its Schools, a Rural Town Opens Its Homes

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLAYTON, N.M.

 BODY:
In the old days in the rural West, students who lived on distant ranches sometimes boarded with a family in town during the school year, rather than ride 40 miles of dirt back roads to class.
Then the practice mostly vanished, as students in the countryside were able to zip to school on black-topped roads. But like schools in many small towns, the Clayton district now faces a new problem, declining enrollment. So, in the hope of surviving, school officials here have taken a page from the past: they have revived the practice of families' boarding students. But now there is a twist: the boarders come from the city. 
 Since 1980, tough times in cattle ranching and mining -- the economic mainstays around Clayton -- have forced many families to move, cutting the school enrollment by more than 20 percent, to about 700. The losses have cost Clayton tens of thousands of dollars in state aid, which is allocated on the basis of a district's student population.
 
The Small-Town Experience
 So the school has begun a campaign to recruit students from other cities and states. In an advertisement this summer in The Albuquerque Journal, the school urged parents in cities to consider giving their children the experience of school in a small town.
So far, two students have moved to Clayton to board there. Their families pay their room and board, and the Clayton school district reaps $1,845 a student in state aid.
School officials say they have received about 70 other inquiries. In a few cases, parents who investigated Clayton became so enamored of the small-town charm that they moved here themselves. Their children are among the 14 new students in the town this year.
"We were thinking hard about what we could do to increase the enrollment," said Claude Austin, the school superintendent. "It occurred to me that people used to board a lot of students from the country. And then I thought, Why not advertise ourselves as a private school? We're just as good."
One of the new students, Russ Kaplan, was attending a high school in San Antonio, about 650 miles southeast of here, where the enrollment of 3,000 was larger than the Clayton town population of 2,500.
 
'It's Just Outstanding'
 "It's just outstanding being here," said Russ, a 16-year-old sophomore, who sat on a living room couch wearing a football jersey and waiting for a carload of friends to pick him up for burgers at a local drive-in restaurant. "At my old school, the football coach said I was too small to play. But when I came to Clayton, the coach asked me to come out for football."
The student-to-teacher ratio here is about 14 to 1. This year's senior class has 37 students. The average score here last year on the American College Testing exam, a college-entrance test, was three points over the national average of 20. The crime rate is negligible. Gangs are nonexistent.
With the small school population, students can easily participate in several extracurricular activities. Besides playing football, Russ is a photographer for the school paper.
His father abandoned the family when Russ was an infant, and his mother died when he was a toddler. He was sent to live with an aunt, who died four years ago. He had been living with an elderly grandmother, who sometimes became overwhelmed by the stress of raising a teen-ager. She pays $400 a month for his room and board to a couple here, Joe and Dolores Kokaly, who volunteered after reading about the idea in the local weekly newspaper.
"We raised seven children, and this house was just too big for only the two of us," said Mr. Kokaly, 64, a retired engineer for the Caterpillar Tractor Company. "Russ has been a joy to have around, except, of course, for the telephone ringing all the time."
When he first arrived in Clayton, which has a movie theater but no bowling alley, he dreaded the prospect of monotonous small-town life and feared that cliques would refuse to make room for an outsider.
But he had known rejection at his old high school, too. He figured he could take whatever Clayton had to dish out. Even so, he recalled, "I was real nervous."
On his first day in town, a rather popular boy approached Russ with an outstretched hand. "I'm Charlie Campbell," he said. "I hear you're new. Let's go cruising sometime."
The other newcomer, Michael Green, came to Clayton from Santa Rosa, Calif. He is staying with a family on a ranch just outside town. His mother believed that he could get a better education in a small school, he said. At first he was reluctant to go. But that has all changed.
"We're getting some new cattle in soon," Michael said in the matter-of-fact way of an old hand.
The teachers and administrators had prepared the students for the arrival of newcomers. They had reminded them that a new school would be difficult, especially for two young boys coming without their families.
At first a few students were skeptical. Nici McClure, 17, said she was not sure Clayton needed any new people. "I was used to the old people," she said. On the other hand, her friend Patience Carmichael, 16, said, "We need some new blood."
One recent night these girls and two others came to the Kokaly house to pick up Russ and go cruising. As a native of a big city, Russ has found that he is regarded as rather exotic. Other students listen wide-eyed to his stories about the vicious street-gangs back in San Antonio.
Not everything is so different. He was offered a chance to buy marijuana on one of his first days here.
Many of the Clayton students seem surprised that the newcomers would like their little town. "It's so boring," they often say.
But Russ sees it differently. He talks enthusiastically about Rabbit Mountain near Clayton, with its view of five states: Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas. At a state park nearby, there are fossilized dinosaur tracks 100 million years old. And when he makes a nice play on the football field, the people in the stands roar.
"It's not boring at all," he said, as the telephone started to ring.
"It's probably for Russ," said Mr. Kokaly, with a smile and a roll of the eyes. And it was.

HEADLINE: Hospital Executives' Pay Rose Sharply in Decade

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The rise in compensation for executives at nonprofit hospitals in the 1980's was one of the fastest-growing components of the overall rise in medical costs, with the earnings of a few executives at the most prestigious institutions approaching or exceeding $1 million.
Although executive pay represents a small fraction of total revenues in any hospital, it is a matter of particular interest to Internal Revenue Service auditors. Special audits of about 20 hospitals nationwide are under way, examining if these educational and charitable institutions, in their zeal to compete in the high-stakes health-care field, are straying from the ground rules governing tax-exempt status. 
 Among other things, these rules prohibit nonprofit organizations from providing "excessive" benefits to private individuals, a definition open to a range of interpretation. I.R.S. officials said executive salaries were one of the issues under scrutiny in their audits.
 
A Variety of Packages
 While salaries for top hospital executives around the nation tend to run in the $200,000 range, with compensation routinely $100,000 to $200,000 higher for doctors serving as chief executive officers, a few hospitals pay at double or triple the base rates.
Federal income tax returns and other information filed by a sampling of the nation's largest health-care institutions show a variety of pay packages, including these:
*Dr. Paul A. Marks, president and chief executive officer of New York City's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, made more than $1 million in total compensation in both 1990 and 1991. A 1988 "signing bonus," paid in return for Dr. Marks's pledge to stay with the institution through 1994, brought his total compensation for that year to $2.2 million. The center employs 5,600 and has a $700 million budget for 1992.
*Dr. H. Richard Nesson, head of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, made $872,628 in total compensation in 1991. The teaching hospital, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, employs about 8,000 people.
*The Mayo Foundation and the Mayo Foundation for Education and Research, which, together with Rochester Methodist Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital, are part of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., paid Dr. Robert R. Waller, the chief executive of the two foundations, $394,324 in total compensation in 1990.
*Larry Mathis, president and chief executive officer of The Methodist Hospital System in Houston, was paid $374,623 in 1990.
While all the institutions involved said the pay their administrators received was reasonable, interviews with experts in medical economics showed a broad debate over salary levels. Some felt that salaries at the top end of the range for medical centers were justified by the complexities of the business and the high salaries being paid in other industries. Others argued that high administrative salaries are at odds with the mission and tradition of a nonprofit enterprise.
 
'I Think It's Ridiculous'
 "I think it's ridiculous myself," said Eli Ginzberg, director of Columbia University's Eisenhower Center and an emeritus economics professor specializing in labor costs in the health industry. "If you paid a man $250,000, he couldn't complain legitimately that he was being underpaid."
David Himmelstein, national spokesman for Physicians for National Health Insurance and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, said of the high salaries: "I don't think it's reasonable or proper. But most people who came to work in hospitals a long time ago came to realize that hospitals are only nonprofit in name. The highest priority of the institution is financial success."
Victor Fuchs, an economist at Stanford University, said of the salaries, "From the perspective of any one institution, it's justified because they could lose the man." He cautioned that whatever the inflation in executive pay, it had little or no bearing on the inflation in overall health costs.
As in most salary debates, comparisons are made from varied perspectives. Revelation of William Aramony's $469,000 salary-and-benefits package was a central element in the scandal that led to his ouster as president of United Way of America earlier this year. For years, corporations have been asked to justify salaries like the one-year pay-and-bonus package of $78.2 million paid to Steven J. Ross of Time Warner in 1990.
According to the new surveys, hospital directors' salary increases in the 1980's were exceeded only by of those paid executives in profit-making industries, whose compensation increased by 212 percent in the 1980's, according to Business Week magazine.
Overall data on hospital executive income, compiled in a confidential 1991 survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges, showed median executive compensation in all non-veterans' hospitals increased by at least 123 percent and as much as 142 percent from 1981 to 1991.
 
How Other Costs Grew
 For the same period, the nation's medical costs increased by 115 percent and overall consumer costs grew 50 percent. Citing confidentiality agreements, the association refused to release the data from its survey of 178 institutions, but they were made available by a person working in the field.
A second 1992 survey sponsored by the Hay Group, which specializes in hospital management issues, and the American Society for Healthcare Human Resources Administration contained data from 1,268 institutions, 26 percent of them for-profit hospitals.
Among its conclusions, summarized Sept. 5 in Hospitals magazine, was the observation that "although salary increases are moving up faster now among hospital executives than among their counterparts in industry, their overall compensation continues to lag."
Salary is only one of the issues I.R.S. auditors are pursuing in their examination of Sloan-Kettering and other institutions. Others include the relationship between nonprofit health care centers and related for-profit entities, which are often linked in complex financial arrangements.
 
Definitions Are Crucial
 One of the questions at issue for nonprofit status is the extent to which a "community benefit," said Marcus Owens, Director of the I.R.S.'s Exempt Organizations Technical Division. This benefit can mean services like free care or the presence of an emergency room open to the community.
Asked what yardsticks the I.R.S. uses to determine if a pay package is appropriate, Mr. Owens said, "What we look at from our standpoint is not just the absolute dollar amount." He added that, "abrupt increases in compensation might be indicative of unreasonable compensation. A salary fixed many years in advance is something that might be an indicator, or the lack of any very clear substantiation of the duties or the salary itself."
Hospital executives, particularly those with medical degrees, have long been viewed as the economic aristocracy of the nonprofit sector of the economy. Those who argue that higher compensation is justified point to the complexity of hospital management in a highly competitive, highly regulated and highly technological enterprise whose mission is to save lives. They also note that many doctors in private practice, particularly surgeons, gross more than $1 million annually.
Dr. Floyd D. Loop, chairman of the board of governors of the Cleveland Clinic, made $916,374 in 1989 in total compensation, but this included pay for his work as a thoracic surgeon. In that role, he performed more than 200 open-heart operations that year.
 
'Salaries Were Catching Up'
 "Health area salaries were catching up from the artificially low levels of the 50's and 60's," said Bill Quirk, a partner at Towers, Perrin, a firm specializing in executive compensation. "They are catching up with proportion of for-profit entities. Certainly they are going to be lower than for-profit. They should be. But they shouldn't be dramatically, dramatically low."
"You are correct that we do take into consideration that we are a non-profit," said John R. Gunn, executive vice president of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, one of the three nonprofit entities which provided Dr. Marks's total compensation.
"On the other hand," Mr. Gunn said, "we are a complex organization with a lot of employees. And there are some high-paid individuals here. Dr. Marks shouldn't be penalized for working for a not-for-profit."
"With the change in the marketplace, you need better management," said Dr. Ralph A. Straffon, chief of staff at the Cleveland Clinic. "If you can't manage costs, you can't play the game today. Managing costs takes better management and better training. Hospitals recognize that good leadership at the administrative level is the difference between closing doors or remaining viable."

HEADLINE: The Freedom to Worship, the Freedom to Park;
With a Nod Toward Mecca, Weary Car Owners Give Thanks for a Parking Reprieve

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
New York is a city that never stops asking for more, and its residents clearly know whom to ask.
Their City Council has responded to their requests by extending suspension of alternate side-of-the-street parking to two Muslim holidays, a move that makes the streets a little dirtier and reduces municipal revenue by more than $500,000. But so what? In so doing, the municipal Solons mightily pleased millions of New Yorkers. 
 The Council voted unanimously on Thursday to add six days to the 33 holidays to which the rules already do not apply. For New Yorkers who loathe the days they have to scurry around moving their cars to make way for street sweepers, it was surely a step in the right direction.
 
Lest We Forget Moluccans?
 Already, Irish-Americans have asked for a St. Patrick's Day suspension. Hindus and Buddhists clamor for the same thing. Where will it all end?
New Yorkers could care less. It is impossible to overstate what a pain in the neck it is to bolt from one's apartment in whatever clothes one can throw on and feverishly search for a spot on the proper side of the street before the rules go into effect. The Catch-22 is that you can't do it the night before, because double-parkers will likely hem you in.
What drives this madness are fines of $55 in Manhattan below 96th Street and $25 elsewhere. In June, the latest month for which figures are available, the city passed out 74,667 tickets for violating alternate-side parking regulations.
"A day without alternate-side-of-the-street parking is a day of joy," exuded Henry J. Stern, the president of the Citizens Union who served on the Council when it extended what were originally exemptions only for Jewish holidays -- when Orthodox Jews cannot drive -- to Catholic feast days.
Since then, parking suspensions have been granted to numerous components of the gorgeous mosaic, a process requiring approval by either the Council or the state Legislature. Last year, the state legislators added two one-day holidays, Holy Thursday and the Orthodox Catholic version of the same holiday, only to have their ecumenical generosity surpassed by city counterparts.
"If you give everybody else, you can't deny the Muslims," said Noach Dear, an Orthodox Jew who as chairman of the Council's Transportation Committee championed the measure.
And that logic may apply to others. Irish-Americans are strongly lobbying for St. Patrick's Day to be exempted, although some might argue that saints already get their due with the All Saints Day suspension on Nov. 1. Naturally enough, Hindus and Buddhists say they want the same consideration.
"I'm not going to discount anybody," promised Mr. Dear, who calls himself "a nice Jewish guy from Brooklyn." But, he quickly added, "I'm not going to do something irresponsible."
Alternate-side parking is such an enormous part of New York life that use of the term will likely continue indefinitely despite the fact that the Transportation Department formally abandoned it last spring. The legal term is now "street cleaning regulations."
As the agency's spokesman, Joseph DePlasco, put it, "Alternate-side-of-the-street parking is part of the folklore at this point."
 
Worry Over Costs
 It reached the height of absurdity two years ago when a Queens entrepreneur did a brisk business for awhile selling a calendar indicating which days the rules are not enforced, even though a list of suspended days is available free from the city Transportation Department. And comedians, of course, find fine fodder in the rules.
Brian Brown, a local comedian, does a routine on how the exigencies of parking in New York helped give shape to his retirement. "With no job to go to, alternative-side parking is my incentive to get out of bed," he says. He calls suspended days "a frightening vacuum."
Alternate-side parking regulations were first enforced on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in August 1950 to make it easier for the new mechanical sweepers to move around. Previously, humans with brooms swept around cars.
But the Orthodox Jews who congregated on the Lower East Side could not drive on holy days, and thus could not move their cars. By the mid-1950's, their leaders persuaded the city of the necessity of suspending the rules on religious days. Holidays of other religions were gradually added to what had become a citywide program.
Today, the rules are suspended for 39 holidays as well as Sundays. Budget cuts last year necessitated the suspension of regulations on Wednesdays and Saturdays as well. Because some of the holidays fall on days when parking is already suspended, the impact is always less than what would be the theoretical maximum, 195 days of alternate-side parking.
But there are two inescapable costs in all these suspensions. One is revenue the city loses by not issuing tickets. Each day the rules are suspended costs the municipal treasury about $90,000, according to the Transportation Department.
The other cost is filthier streets. "You do start to get a general increase in dirtiness," said Emily Lloyd, Sanitation Commissioner. "We feel we're sort of at the limits."
Ms. Lloyd nonetheless believes the growing number of Muslims living here merits the new suspensions. But she said the Federal Environmental Protection Agency has expressed concern about the suspensions because residue from increased street debris may find its way into waterways.
John J. Doherty, Deputy Commissioner for Operations of the Sanitation Department, said the action last week was only the latest blow to clean streets. Since 1987, the street-cleaning force has fallen from 2,200 to 600, while cleaning days have continued to decline.
Nevertheless, Mr. Doherty said streets were not appreciably dirtier, according to inspections by the Mayor's Office of Operation. Indeed, he said, the inspections showed that 72 percent of streets are "acceptably clean."
This miracle, he suggests, is the result of heightened enforcement, improved sweepers and perhaps a decrease in trash caused by the sagging economy. "I don't think people are throwing as much stuff around," he said.
 
Legitimacy in the Mosaic
 Mr. Doherty also refuted a suggestion that parking-rule suspensions allowed sanitation workers to sit around with nothing to do. Instead, he said they are assigned to clean under overpasses and other areas where rubbish has accumulated.
Such practical considerations miss the larger point. To be included in a parking-rule suspension is to gain legitimacy in a mammoth, hopelessly snarled, largely anonymous metropolis. One of the principal proponents of including the Islamic holidays, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, was Imam Al-Amin Abdul-Latif, president of the Islamic Leadership Council of New York.
"We must have a say in how this city is run," he said, speaking for an estimated 600,000 local Muslims.
This strikes a responsive chord. Brian Rohan, a reporter at The Irish Voice, said including St. Patrick's Day might help Mayor David N. Dinkins repair his relations with Irish-Americans angered at his support of gays seeking to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade.
 
Sikhs Deny Agenda
 And Walter L. McCaffrey, the Queens Councilman who plans to introduce a bill to include St. Patrick's Day, cites practical considerations. He said many people drive to subway stations in Queens and the Bronx to take the train to the festivities, creating parking problems in the neighborhoods where they leave their cars.
So who's next? Hindus, who themselves count as many as 500,000 adherents in the region? Maybe. "We desire to," said Anand Mohan, executive director of the Hindu Temple Society of North America in Queens.
Buddhists? The Rev. Chung Ok Lee, of the Won Buddhist Temple in Flushing, said yes. "We feel like outsiders," she explained.
Sikhs seem content to wait awhile. "I don't remember this issue ever coming up," said Gurinder Singh Mann, a professor at Columbia University and Sikh leader.
 
Free Speech and Free Parking
 For those concerned about the separation of church and state, the more parking holidays the merrier. Laura Murray, legislative director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the First Amendment also mandates that government make free expression of religion possible -- the whole idea behind the religious parking holidays.
At the very least, she says, the city should forgive parking tickets that occur as a result of people observing religious holidays. Hindus and Buddhists say this doesn't happen now. When there are too many such instances, her prescription is a general suspension. "It's just a practical judgment on the part of the city," she said.
More often, a political one. Mr. Dear, the newly ecumenical Councilman, is not adverse to making light of this peculiarly New York tangle. When asked about the St. Patrick's Day proposal, he said, "We took care of the Irish who are Muslim in this bill."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
I.B.M. Says Buyouts Will Trim 40,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
I.B.M. said yesterday that twice as many employees as originally anticipated had taken incentives to retire early or resign, which will mean the elimination of 40,000 jobs this year. It also said it was planning to cut back its manufacturing in response to "rapid changes in technology, shifting marketplace demand and prolonged worldwide economic weakness."
The company said that by the end of the year, it will have cut its employment by 25 percent since 1985 and reduced its manufacturing capacity by 40 percent. 
 A spokesman for the International Business Machines Corporation said most of those leaving their jobs in the United States had already done so in response to incentives and early retirement programs that had a deadline of July 31.
"This is not a new pink slip program," said the spokesman, James M. Ruderman.
Of the total job reduction, he said, about 28,000 will be in the United States, about 8,000 in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and the remaining 4,000 in Asia and elsewhere. He said the manufacturing consolidations would be concentrated in the company's ailing mainframe computer operations and semiconductor sector, but he would not specify which plants would be affected.
The announcement came after the close of the stock market. I.B.M. shares closed at $81 each on the New York Stock Exchange, off $1.75 in moderate trading.
The company said it would reduce 1992 earnings by $2.1 billion in connection with the cutbacks, but that that would largely be offset by an accounting change worth $1.9 billion. As a result, it said, the cutbacks "essentially do not involve the use of cash."
 
Operations Overhaul
 Late last year, the world's largest computer maker announced a sweeping overhaul of its operations and a major incentive program it estimated would see the departure of 20,000 people. It took a charge of $3 billion against 1991 earnings.
In July, the company announced that the total job cuts would grow to 32,000, and it took a charge of $1.2 billion against 1992 earnings.
The company said yesterday that it would take another charge of $415 million against this year's earnings for faster depreciation of the value of some of its software.
Since its employment peaked at 407,000 in 1986, the company has pared its work force in a series of cutbacks. By the end of last year, I.B.M. was down to 344,000 workers. The 1992 job reduction amounts to a reduction of about 12 percent from that level.
Since the mid-1980's, I.B.M. has been struggling to deal with an environment in which powerful, off-the-shelf compatible computer systems from many manufacturers have been increasingly displacing the company's custom mainframe machines.
The company is the major employer in Dutchess County in upstate New York, with approximately 20,000 jobs, many of them at big plants producing semiconductors and mainframe computers.
The I.B.M. spokesman said the plants in East Fishkill, Poughkeepsie and Kingston, N.Y., would be affected by the manufacturing cuts, but declined to say how much employment would decline.
"We are not choosing to break it down on a site basis," Mr. Ruderman said.
The company said some employees would be relocated as a result of the reductions in manufacturing capacity, but did not say how many individuals would be involved.
 
$4 Billion Cost Reduction
 The company also said that the reduction in employees, the manufacturing cutbacks and a restructuring announced late last year would reduce costs by $4 billion a year starting early next year.
"Our business units have been carefully evaluating their capacity requirements," John F. Akers, the company's chairman, said in a statement. "With this announcement, I.B.M. will achieve an improved balance between assets and current business needs."
The popularity of the buyout program, in which payments are based on length of service, appears based on fear that future programs may not be as generous. I.B.M. has maintained a tradition of not having involuntary layoffs, but company executives have said that may change at some point.
I.B.M. said the accounting change was prompted by Financial Accounting Standard 109, which requires companies that have accumulated unrecognized tax credits to recognize them no later than the first quarter of next year. The company said it decided to recognize the credits in the current year.

HEADLINE: Bush to Visit Newark Union For Support

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

 BODY:
President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton will both be in New Jersey today to pick up support, financial and fraternal, for their campaigns. Mr. Clinton will attend a fund-raising event in Somerset, and Mr. Bush will visit a construction union's offices in Newark in what the local's leader pictured as a prelude to an endorsement.
Richard Tissiere, business manager of Laborers Union Local 472 of the Heavy and General Construction Workers Union, said the endorsement might come during the President's scheduled hourlong visit to the local's headquarters on Raymond Boulevard but will more likely not be made until next Monday, when the 7,000-member local holds its next regular meeting. 
 Mr. Tissiere said he extended the invitation to the President during Mr. Bush's most recent campaign visit to the state last week. "He said he would like to come," Mr. Tissiere said. "But we didn't hear that he would actually be here until a couple of days later.
"We want him to talk about jobs and the economy, but this goes beyond labor matters," Mr. Tissiere said. "Our membership includes people who have served in each war since World War ll, and we love this country and want to have the best leadership we can have. Mr. Bush helped restore respect for us as a nation. Before he and President Reagan got in, every rinky-dink country in the world was taking shots at us."
Mr. Tissiere credited former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican and chairman of the New Jersey Bush campaign, with paving the way for Mr, Bush's warm reception by the union. He said Mr. Kean visited Local 472 several times during his eight years in office. The former Governor also appointed Mr. Tissiere to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. His term expired last year.
Mr. Tissiere said Local 472 "is not a Republican union," adding that he did not intend to invite Mr. Clinton to talk to the membership. "I'm not negative," he said. "I like to be positive and I'm basing my support for the President on the issue of leadership."
Referring to Mr. Bush, Mr. Tissiere said: "Is he perfect? No. Are we perfect? No." He added that he believes the individual states bear some responsibility for finding ways to revive the country's sluggish economy.
Members of Local 472 work on bridge, tunnel and road projects and are paid a minimum of $24 an hour.

HEADLINE: Millions Cast Votes in Angolan Election Amid Fears of a Return to Violence

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Under intense international scrutiny, millions of Angolans voted today in the first broadly contested democratic elections in this war-ravaged country's history.
But as they voted in the first of two days of balloting, Angolans were surrounded by uncertainties about whether they were making a great democratic leap or were about to slip into the sort of disorder, violence and ethnic antagonisms that plagued them in 16 years of civil war. No violence was reported today, however. 
 Although there are 13 parties and 18 candidates vying for seats in the new Parliament and as President, the focus is largely on the contest between the governing party's leader, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and the veteran guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi, each of whom insists that in a fair election he would be the sure winner.
 
Close Vote Expected
 The outcome is likely to be close, most analysts say. Initial returns are expected on Wednesday.
The Government is believed to have more support in the towns, while Mr. Savimbi's group is dominant in rural areas, especially the central highlands, where his power base, the Ovimbundu ethnic group, live.
Angolans and foreign diplomats say they believe that both sides have stored large amounts of arms in case the fighting resumes.
Mr. dos Santos has spent the last two days in Luanda, the national capital, while Mr. Savimbi has traveled to Huambo, the main city in the Ovimbundu people's home region.
 
An Extension of the Cold War
 Both the governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola and its main rival, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, fought Portuguese colonial rule from the 1960's onward. After independence in 1975, they turned on each other and ended up as proxies for the world's superpowers in the cold war, with the Soviet Union and Cuba backing the Popular Movement, which won control of the country.
Unita, with American- and South African-backing, waged a guerrilla struggle until a truce agreement, brokered by the United States and the Soviet Union, was signed in Washington in June 1991. That accord provided for today's election.
On the surface, the balloting today seemed to be relatively smooth, with strong signs of a heavy voter turnout and no clear evidence of obvious and widespread fraud.
 
Polling Stations Closed
 Arthie Schimmel, a member of Parliament in the Netherlands and an election monitor here, said the first three polling stations she stopped by this morning were all closed: at one, there were no keys to open the building, at another there were no tables and chairs, and at the third the ballots were not ready.
Still, Ms. Schimmel voiced optimism about the process. "It's a bit disorganized, and it's starting slowly, but it's working," she said.
At the Maianga polling booth in a suburb south of Luanda, Muteba Jesus, a 39-year-old plumber, complained about the "incredible amount of confusion here." He said people had begun lining up as early 4 A.M. at polls that were supposed to open at 7 A.M. However, the doors were not opened until 9 A.M. Asked who he would vote for, he said that he is a "M.P.L.A. man."
"I just don't like Unita's mentality," he added. "They're not the right people for me."
At another polling booth in the Luanda suburb of Rocha-Pinto, Mgonanau Yanba, a mechanic, was Asked which party he expected to vote for. Mr. Yanba responded that it was a secret. His answer and similar replies by many other voters today apparently reflected the National Electoral Council's repeated statements urging voters to make their own decisions about who to vote for and they need not reveal it to anyone.
Much will depend on popular perceptions of whether the balloting today and on Wednesday are tainted by major irregularities. The biggest fear, analysts say, is that if the vote is close, the loser will reject it.
 
Unita Charges Fraud
 Just hours before the voting began, Unita held a news conference to denounce what it asserted were the Government's attempts to rig the elections, giving rise to suspicions that the group is laying the groundwork for a challenge of the results if the vote does not go its way.
Violent clashes have flared between rival political groups during the monthlong campaign, leaving more than 40 people dead and antagonisms so severe that they may not be easily soothed.
But Margaret Anstee, head of the United Nations observer delegation, said the level of violence could have been much higher.
"There will be some violent incidents," she told reporters, "but as long as things do not get out of hand, I do not see that as reason for declaring the elections not free and fair." Nearly 1,000 international observers are here to supervise the polls.
 
Defection of Savimbi Aides
 When Mr. Savimbi agreed to the truce last year, most political commentators and Western analysts here thought he would win handily. However, two of Unita's senior commanders, Miguel Nzau Puna and Tony Da Costa Fernandes, deserted the movement and accused the 57-year-old Mr. Savimbi of atrocities, including the summary execution of two high-ranking party leaders whose opinions differed from his own, along with their wives, children and guards.
The accusations of the former Unita members, which have been repeated constantly on the Government-controlled radio and television networks, have become a major campaign issue, at least in the cities.
Mr. Savimbi and other opposition leaders have focused their attacks on the dismal economy, picturing Mr. dos Santos and other Government leaders as disciples of failed Marxist ideals.

HEADLINE: Quiet on the Set: Costs Mire New York in a Film Slump

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER

 BODY:
Chris Rosen has a steadily growing circle of friends in Los Angeles, a city that holds little appeal for him -- or them. But that's where a number of New York film technicians are migrating as a two-year slump in the movie business drags on.
"They would have preferred to stay here," he said. But the work has gone west, and elsewhere. 
 For almost a decade, Mr. Rosen, 33 years old, had more jobs than he could handle as a gaffer, or head electrician on the set of commercials and movies. But Mr. Rosen's business has slipped by at least a third since a seven-month-long boycott of New York by film producers that ended in May 1991. In the early months of 1992, Mr. Rosen said, "I don't think I worked a day." And though he says he could never follow his friends, he is not optimistic about the film business here: his appointment calendar has only two days blocked out.
The producers boycotted New York during protracted labor negotiations with several theatrical unions. Although consultants are only now beginning to assess the lingering financial impact of the boycott, it is clear that what was once one of the city's largest industries is only a shadow of its former self.
 
On to Baltimore
 
 
Six feature films are now shooting in the city, a fraction of the usual fall activity. Through August of this year the city had issued about 50 film permits, compared with more than 80 for the same period a year ago -- despite the boycott that was in effect for the first five months of 1991. In 1989, the year before the boycott, 110 film permits were issued. Most of the moviemakers found that certain streets in Baltimore and Pittsburgh could be made to look like New York's -- in many cases at a lower cost.
As a result, a number of grips, who rig cameras and block lighting, have gone into carpentry. Camera assistants, who move and clean heavy film equipment, are accepting jobs as laborers. And while actors and others in the film industry have always waited tables and sold shoes to survive between jobs, the current crisis has forced a number of professionals to accept other work for the first time.
 
Lowered Expectations
 "Actors cater; assistant directors don't cater," sniffed Alan S. Gordon, Eastern executive secretary of the Directors Guild of America. Or they did not, he said, until recently.
Patricia Curtice, who had worked steadily for 20 years as an assistant director, is now planning parties and weddings to pay her bills while she waits for the business to come back.
Last week, as Ms. Curtice signed up prospective clients at a bridal fair aboard the Spirit of New York, she still could not help but feel responsible for the fair's set. Swaying back and forth with the motion of the boat, vendors were having a hard enough time shouting over background music and a loud wedding video. But after the sun set, the vendors also found themselves working in almost total darkness.
"Are you with this boat? Can you get us some lights?" Ms. Curtice shouted to a man in uniform. He turned out to be the disk jockey, but she eventually got the lights turned on. Having worked on hundreds of commercials, she did not need such practice.
Along with the departing film industry veterans, even the next generation of film makers seems to be leaving New York.
 
Following the Business
 "People coming out of film schools go to L.A. now," said Mona Mangan, executive director of the Writers Guild of America, East. She said there was a growing feeling in the film industry that New York is too difficult and expensive, and they feared being left out of an increasingly insular California film community.
Writers and directors who cannot or will not leave New York have long complained that the city has done little to woo producers back from locations in Chicago or Toronto that they discovered during the boycott.
Many in the business also fear that any problems in upcoming negotiations between the major studios and the theatrical local of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in New York, whose members deliver equipment and drive actors' trailers, could lead to a renewed boycott. The teamsters contract with most of the major studios expires at the end of October.
Labor leaders fear the film studios will use the contract negotiations to break the union. "The producers wanted to make sure they hurt us very badly during the negotiations" that led to the recently ended boycott, said Myron Odegaard, a spokesman for Local 52 of the Motion Picture Studio Mechanics.
 
Pessimism Among Producers
 Martin Bregman, who has produced films like "Serpico" and "Sea of Love," is among those who feel a renewed boycott is almost inevitable. "My strong perception is there will be a boycott unless somebody in the city gets involved -- the Mayor," he said.
Jennifer Kimball, a spokeswoman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said the Mayor "stands ready to lend his good offices" if called into the negotiations. And James Leavey, of Teamsters Local 817, dismissed the dire predictions.
"I don't think it's as dismal as everybody's making it out to be," Mr. Leavey said. He said preliminary contacts had been promising, and cited good relations with a growing number of independent film makers.
But Mr. Bregman said New York's film industry has already been decimated. "We've lost the industry here; it's gone," he said. "It won't be back in my lifetime."
 
Search for Important Post
 He blames the Dinkins administration for failing to grasp the enormity of the industry's problems.
A permanent replacement still has not been named to fill the post of director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, a job last held by Jaynne C. Keyes, who resigned five months ago. A successor who would attract business is seen as vital in the local film industry.
But more than a month after city officials trumpeted a fresh start in the search, which was taken over by an executive search firm, there are few signs of progress. The search firm, Russell Reynolds Associates, only recently received a job description for the post.
In a Sept. 21 memo to members of the Mayor's Advisory Council for Film, Television & Commercials, the acting director of the Mayor's film office, Nina Streich, noted that the City Council is considering tax incentives for producers and suggested that news reports of the proposed incentives could substitute for action. "If concept is circulated by media," she wrote, "resulting attention may revive NYC industry regardless of whether model is ever realized."
While a pitched battle over the job vacancy continues, it seems unlikely that any director of the Mayor's film office can be expected to orchestrate an economic turnaround. Worldwide, English-language feature film production declined 20 percent in the first six months of 1992.
New York film technicians frequently argue that New York is not as expensive a location as it may first appear because the experienced technicians based in the city can complete their work more quickly than apprentices in other cities. But in the current environment, budget projections are crucial, and financial considerations even more likely than usual to prevail over creative factors, like the way the city looks on film.
"The film industry is changing a lot in this economy," said Ms. Streich. And, she warned, New York could continue to lose out to other locations "if you're looking solely to the bottom line."

Deutsche Bank Names U.S. Chief

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank, pushing to take advantage of its financial strength and expand its American business when some other banks are licking their wounds, said yesterday that it had hired John A. Rolls to be chief executive officer of its business in North America, effective Nov. 1.
Mr. Rolls, who is 51 years old, has never worked for a bank. Rather, he has spent most of his career as a corporate finance officer responsible for selecting banks and arranging the best possible terms for his employer. Since 1986 he has been chief financial officer at the United Technologies Corporation, and before that he was with the RCA Corporation and the Monsanto Company. Though he was familiar with the Deutsche Bank name, he has never done business with it, he said. 
 "Now I must make the transition from being a buyer of banking services to being a salesman," Mr. Rolls said, adding that the task should be easier because Deutsche Bank's financial strength is held in high esteem by corporate treasurers. As one of a handful of banks with top-notch triple-A credit ratings from every major rating agency, Deutsche Bank is well positioned for arranging transactions, like interest rate swaps, with corporations that want to make sure that their partners in such swaps will be able to meet their obligations.
"In this weak economy, with questions about some financial institutions, corporate treasurers are much more interested in cultivating good relationships with strong banks," Mr. Rolls said. "A lot of people have been made nervous by the disappearance of large banks who once devoted a lot of resources to corporate lending. They want a bank that is sure to be there when it is needed."
The lack of a banking background was not unusual for Deutsche Bank, which has hired top executives from other industries. Alfred Herrhausen, Deutsche Bank's chief executive until he was assassinated in 1989, was formerly a utility executive, and Ronaldo H. Schmitz, Mr. Rolls's boss and one of 13 directors who run the German banking company, was hired from BASF, the chemical company, and given a mandate to run the North American business.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves a Tax Bill Offering Benefits for Many

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Six months after the Los Angeles riots unleashed a Congressional drive on urban aid, the Senate today finally approved a broad package to give tax incentives to businesses investing in impoverished city neighborhoods -- along with a medley of tax benefits for every other economic group.
With the memory of the disturbances fading, the legislation sailed to passage on election-year crosscurrents. Provisions tacked on ranged from $500 million in fresh financing for social programs like Head Start for the poor, to an expansion of individual retirement accounts for the middle class, to a cut in luxury taxes on furs, yachts and expensive automobiles for the wealthy. 
 But the lawmakers would also make permanent two tax increases for the very wealthiest taxpayers to pay for many of the $32 billion in revenue that would be lost over five years. President Bush agreed to the two provisions -- limiting itemized deductions and gradually discontinuing personal exemptions for the wealthy -- as part of the 1990 budget deal. Since the Republican convention, however, he has insisted he would veto any legislation that raised taxes.
The bill passed by a vote of 70 to 29, with 22 Republicans joining 48 Democrats supporting the measure; 8 Democrats and 21 Republicans voted to defeat the bill.
During four days of often fractious debates, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, accused Senate Democrats of attempting to set a campaign trap for Mr. Bush by forcing him to veto another popular bill. But many Republicans joined the Democrats in supporting the measure, some because of last week's attachment of a politically attractive measure cutting health costs for the self-employed and small businesses.
"It's a traditional Christmas tree tax bill," said a senior White House official, who said President Bush would veto the bill unless it was radically changed in conference.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee and primary sponsor of the bill, said the package fulfills "goals like revitalizing our cities, increasing savings and capital formation, aiding troubled families, and improving business competitiveness."
Indeed, the Senate tax package would touch the lives of almost all Americans, even if in modest ways, in the unlikely event it is enacted. Middle-income families would receive a tax credit of up to $2,500 for buying a first home. Disadvantaged children would become eligible for expanded foster care and nutrition services.
And in a modest concession to the White House, Senate Democrats included a capital gains write-off on long-term investments made by small start-up business ventures, halving the top tax rate on the earnings to 14 percent for investments held at least five years.
The Senate bill would expand individual retirement accounts to allow nearly all taxpayers to deduct their installments, up to $2,000 annually. In addition, middle- and upper-income taxpayers would benefit from the establishment of a new form of I.R.A. The "special I.R.A." would allow taxpayers to make nondeductible contributions, with nontaxable withdrawals of capital gains, interest and dividend earnings as long as the funds were kept in the I.R.A. for at least five years.
"The list of winners in this bill goes on and on and on, each group narrower than the last, each group reaping benefits at the expense of all of the rest of the taxpayers," said Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, as he noted that tax write-offs were being distributed like so many pork barrel projects to cotton warehouse owners, ferry boat operators and gunsmiths. "This bill has been promoted as an urban aid bill, but for an urban aid bill, surprisingly little goes to the poor in our inner cities."
The bill would establish 125 enterprise zones around the country, 75 of them in inner-city neighborhoods, set up with $6 billion in tax benefits. Businesses would receive up to $4,500 in tax credits for wages to employees who live in the zones, up to $30,000 in first-year deductions for purchases of equipment and accelerated depreciation schedules for construction and equipment. It also authorizes the issuance of tax exempt bonds for building new businesses in the zones.
After the Los Angeles riots in April, the Bush Administration dusted off a $1.9 billion plan setting up 50 zones, 15 of them in rural areas. For businesses expanding or locating in the zones, the Administration wanted to eliminate capital gains taxes on the sale of investments made in the zones and held for at least two years. It also proposed to give tax deductions of up $50,000 a year for people who buy stock in small companies doing business in the zones.
Mr. Bentsen struggled for months to keep capital gains write-offs out of the enterprise zones because, he said, "capital gains preferences benefit people who sell businesses." He added, "Preferences don't support businesses while they struggle to become vital long-term enterprises, and that is what we're trying to do after all."
Some urban experts have expressed little enthusiasm for enterprise zones, saying those that have been tried in 36 states have a mixed record at best. But other experts say enterprise zones cannot be judged until the tax benefits include write-offs on Federal taxes.
 The House has passed a far smaller bill -- its cost is $17 billion -- that contains far fewer new I.R.A. benefits and enterprise zones. But the 50 it does establish would reduce the capital gains tax rate on new assets in zones held for five years to 14 percent.
"We'll have to get closer to the provisions of the House bill for enactment," predicted Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in an interview today.
"There's a lot of work to be done in a very short time," added the Illinois Democrat, who will serve as chairman of the conference committee. "If it can't be done in a few days, it won't be done. The critical question is whether the President will accept tax hikes."
Under the Senate bill, the Housing Secretary and other Cabinet members would select which urban and rural areas would qualify for the tax write-offs, making it difficult to predict how New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will ultimately benefit.
Brad Johnson, Washington counsel to Gov. Mario Cuomo, said a provision to grant tax credits to low-income housing builders would provide New York State with $22 million in annual credits. But he said he was concerned about the limitation on itemized deductions for the wealthiest taxpayers, which he said would raise New Yorkers' Federal taxes by $700 million in 1996 and 1997 when the current rule is extended. An aide to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, however, said he was confident that measure would not be in the final bill. He said New York City would certainly qualify for enterprise zones, and that Buffalo would be in the running.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
In Their Own Words

 BODY:

 PRESIDENT BUSH
In a speech yesterday at a campaign rally in Knoxville, Tenn.
"Governor Clinton wants you to trust that the American economy is going to improve if you turn full control of your paycheck over to the crew that already runs the United States Congress. And he wants tax-and-spend Government planners, those kind of planners, to have total control over the executive branch, too.
And they tried this 12 years ago. And we ended up with double-digit inflation. We had interest rates sometimes as high as 18 percent. And we had a misery index over 21 percent, unemployment and inflation added together. And it took years to wring inflation and high interest rates out of the American economy. 
 And I want to strengthen our economy and protect your paycheck from the ravages of inflation. We cannot go the tax-and-spend route any more."
 
GOV. BILL CLINTON
In a speech yesterday to a campaign rally in Louisville, Ky.
"I want America to promote progress, not poverty. And it doesn't serve the interests of the workers in the United States or Central America when employers close their factories down here that provide workers with a decent standard of living and open up sweatshops to pay starvation wages in another country.
"60 Minutes, " listen to this, the "60 Minutes" program actually showed film of a United States Government employee promising what he thought was a business prospect that there would be no union activity in the Central American country because -- listen to this, listen to this -- because the prospective troublemakers could be fired and blacklisted so they would never be hired. That is a violation of all of our trade agreements, and this Administration has supported it."
 
 SENATOR AL GORE
In response to a question about debates as he arrived yesterday in New Castle, Del.
"Governor Clinton was in Michigan ready to debate. He was in Louisville ready to debate. And he will be in San Diego ready to debate this Sunday. Let's start the debate's right there, and then sit down with the commission and work out the all of the other details of other debates that will be forthcoming. We're ready to go. Governor Clinton will be in San Diego, and if Bush is serious, he will be there also to start the series of debates."
 
 VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE
In a speech yesterday at Ronald Reagan's boyhood home in Dixon, Ill.
"When Jimmy Carter went out of office, interest rates, interest rates were at 21 percent. Where are they today? About 6 percent. Inflation? Inflation was at 13 percent. Today it's about 3, 3 1/2 percent. Remember the misery index that Jimmy Carter created during the 1976 campaign: unemployment and inflation? Well it was about 20 percent on Carter's watch, and now under our watch it's about 10 percent. We've cut it in half, and we're proud of it.
 When Ronald Reagan became President, 22 nations around the world were Communist. Today, five. We now have, thanks to the Republican leadership, we have a stronger America. Our children are safer today than they've ever been before. We have got a great record, and now it's time to take our agenda for the future to the American people. "

HEADLINE: Questions on Race

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Without making a ruling or filing a lawsuit, the Department of Education has managed not only to change the way the law school at the University of California at Berkeley admits minority students, but also to cast a pall of uncertainty over all college admissions policies that have to do with race.
On Monday, the department's Office of Civil Rights announced that after a two-year investigation, the law school had voluntarily agreed to end its practice of giving special consideration to minority students by having them essentially compete only against each other, not against the general pool of applicants. 
 Berkeley officials did not admit that their policy violated anti-discrimination laws, as had been alleged. They said only that they would change their procedures so that applicants would not be separated by race.
Berkeley's decision to alter policies that it continues to say are proper and legal raises questions about what other colleges and universities might do about their own minority admissions policies.
 
'A Good Hard Look'
 Nearly every college and university catalogue includes a stated goal of increasing the enrollment of minority students. While such efforts entail heavier recruitment and a special understanding of minority student needs, they usually also mean that at some point special consideration is given to an applicant's race.
"The department knows good and well that every college and university in the country that has programs designed to do what Berkeley's intended to do is going to take a good hard look at it," said Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents most of the nation's colleges and universities, "and they may pull back for fear of what it could lead to."
The agreement between the department and Berkeley is likely to cause the same sort of anxiety and uncertainty that surrounded several other department decisions dealing with the delicate balance between forging diversity and setting quotas.
When Michael L. Williams, Assistant Secretary of Education for civil rights, tried to end scholarships based on race, starting in December 1990, he kicked up a furor that turned into a political embarrassment for the Bush Administration. The department eventually backed down from its original stand and adopted a less rigid policy that allowed race to be considered as one factor but not the determining factor in decisions about scholarship aid at colleges and universities that receive Federal funds.
College officials remain confused about what is allowed and what is not. The Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, has issued proposed regulations on minority scholarships that seems to go both ways, saying that such scholarships violate anti-discrimination laws but that they are allowable in certain circumstances and under certain provisions. The regulations, proposed last Dec. 4, have not yet been formally adopted.
The department has also challenged the use of a "diversity standard" by the organization that grants accreditation to colleges and universities in the Northeast.
All these actions were guided by the precedent set in the 1978 decision by United States Supreme Court that a white man, Allan Bakke, had been denied admission to medical school at the University of California at Davis because of rigid racial quotas. Since that decision, conservative concerns about ending anything resembling quotas have driven ever more deeply into university affairs.
The Education Department's actions involving admissions, financial aid and accreditation standards all seem to complement each other. In essence, they form a rigid approach to questions of access saying that while, for the good of society, race can be considered in education decisions, it cannot stand as the sole determining factor.
This position draws on conservative fears of racial quotas, while trying to avoid the appearance of being racist. Richard A. Samp, chief counsel of the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest and policy organization, called the Berkeley agreement "an encouraging sign." The foundation filed the complaints that led to the department's ruling on minority scholarships.
"Colleges around the country know that 'quota' is a dirty word so they lie and cover up to make it look as though they are using race as just one factor," Mr. Samp said. "The only difference between Berkeley and hundreds of others schools is that Berkeley simply didn't cover up what it was doing."
Not everyone is persuaded that Berkeley's agreement represents a significant new issue for colleges and universities. Some believe its admissions policy was so specifically drawn that few other institutions would be subject to the same restraints.
The department also has been investigating Berkeley's undergraduate admissions policies as well, but Patrick S. Hayashi, the associate vice chancellor, said he was confident the practices will be found to be in compliance with anti-discrimination regulations.
Mr. Hayashi said the university admitted about half its students strictly on test scores, grades and other academic standards. The other half, he said, must be among the top one-eighth of all high school students in California but are chosen with race, economic standing, age and other factors taken into consideration.

HEADLINE: Arthur Mosher, 82, International Expert On Agricultural Aid

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
Arthur T. Mosher, a former president of the Agricultural Development Council, an international agricultural development organization, died Sunday at his home in Black Mountain, N.C. He was 82 years old.
Dr. Mosher, who lived for many years in Ithaca, N.Y., before moving to North Carolina last year, suffered from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease for several years, his son Richard said. 
 For nearly two decades Dr. Mosher headed the agricultural council, a nonprofit organization founded in 1953 by John D. Rockefeller 3d. The council helps train people in economic development and agricultural extension services in countries around the world. He was the council's executive director from 1957 to 1967, and its president from 1967 to 1973.
Dr. Mosher, a native of Ames, Iowa, received a bachelor's degree in agriculture from the University of Illinois in 1932, a master's degree in agricultural economics from that university in 1941 and a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago in 1946.
He spent part of the 1930's as a missionary for the Presbyterian Church in India and then returned to India in 1948, serving for five years as principal of the Allahabad Agricultural Institute.
Dr. Mosher was a member of the President's Science Advisory Council's Panel on World Food Supply from 1966 to 1967, and was chairman of the Research Advisory Committee of the Agency for International Development from 1965 to 1971. He retired in 1973.
Among his many awards was the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1984, and in 1976 he was named a Fellow of the American Agricultural Economics Association, that organization's highest honor.
He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Alice Wynne Hall; a daughter, Anne Wimsatt, of Lewistown, Pa.; three sons, William, of Swannanoa, N.C., Ted, of Laurel, Md., and Richard, of Minneapolis, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Boeing Asks To Sell Jets To Iran Air

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The Boeing Company has tentatively agreed to sell nearly $1 billion of commercial jetliners to state-owned Iran Air, if American policy changes to allow such exports, two Boeing spokesmen and a lawyer for Iran Air said today.
But Richard Boucher, a spokesman for the State Department, said at a news briefing today that the Administration continued to bar the sale to Iran of American planes or aircraft with many American components. A Boeing spokesman said the company's executives were trying to get the policy changed and had met with Commerce Department and Justice Department officials. 
 Iran Air is particularly unlikely to benefit from any change in American policy because the Commerce Department is already accusing it of illegally buying American equipment for testing aircraft navigational gear. The equipment, which consisted of radio-signal generators, is on a list of products that may not be sold to most non-Western countries without an export license from the Commerce agency. Iran Air denies that the purchase violated American law.
Boeing has a small chance of winning the policy change because the American economy is weak, an American official said. "People don't start new policy initiatives four or five weeks before an election except if there's $900 million in sales -- then the policy gets reviewed," the official said, citing President Bush's recent decision to allow the sale of advanced American fighter aircraft to Taiwan despite Chinese objections.
The tentative accord calls for Iran Air to buy 16 Boeing 737-400 jetliners with option to buy four more, according to an affidavit filed last Friday in the Iran Air case against the Commerce agency. The aircraft would be equipped with CFM-56-3C jet engines from the General Electric Company and Snecma of France.
Boeing competes for market share with Airbus Industrie, a four-nation European consortium. Iran Air is threatening to do business with Airbus if Boeing does not get the licenses. "If they're not granted, Iran Air is going to look elsewhere," said Thomas J. Whalen, a partner at Condon & Forsyth here who represents Iran Air.
Airbus said in April that it would sell two A300 jets to Iran Air, an order valued at an estimated $170 million. These aircraft use G.E. engines, so the export of the planes to Iran required the Commerce Department's approval.
Iran Air bought the American-made signal generators in Germany seven years ago and says that it was not told that the generators could not be re-exported without a license. The Commerce agency contends that Iran Air should have known about the requirement, and last month the department imposed a $100,000 fine and banned American companies from doing business with Iran Air for as long as two years.
The airline has appealed the ban to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which on Monday blocked the fine and the ban from taking effect until the case was resolved.

HEADLINE: Yields on Deposits at Banks Have Another Down Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit trended down in the week ended today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a Florida-based interest rate publication.
Analysts at The Monitor said the pace of the decline had slowed from the previous week, but they cautioned that yields might continue to decline amid a struggling economic recovery and the possibility of another Federal Reserve move to lower interest rates. 
 Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said, "If the Fed does cut the discount rate, it will be the fifth cut this year, with the first four producing zero results." This Friday's employment figures will decide what course the central bank takes, he added.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-and six-month bills held Monday, rates took a downturn, reaching their lowest levels in nearly 30 years.
The auction is regarded as a reliable indicator of the rates that banks could set on deposits in the weeks ahead. The average rate for a three-month bill at Monday's auction was 2.73 percent, down 18 basis points from last week, while the six-month bill fell 8 basis points, to 2.85 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The combined average yield on money market accounts in the New York area showed a moderate decline of 3 basis points, to 2.88 percent, while yields of three-month and six-month certificates of desposit were both off a basis point, to 2.92 percent and 3.09 percent, respectively.
Among the commercial banks, yields showed a decline only for money market accounts, off 3 basis points, to 2.71 percent, with three-month and six-month certificates unchanged at 2.79 percent and 2.93 percent, respectively.
Depositors at savings banks saw yields fall across the board, with a money market account down 3 basis points, to 3.05 percent, and three-month and six-month certificates both down 2 basis points, to 3.06 percent and 3.25 percent, respectively.
Banks making the largest adjustments on deposits during the latest week include Hudson City Savings Bank of New Jersey, which dropped the average yield on a money market account by 26 basis points, to 3.30 percent, and Banco Popular, which added 20 basis points to its three-month certificate, for a yield of 2.99 percent, and 41 basis points to its six-month, for a yield of 3.30 percent.
Outside the New York market, yields at the 20 large banks surveyed were unchanged for money market accounts, which remained at 2.77 percent, but were down for six-month C.D.'s, falling 3 basis points, to 2.92 percent.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Drop 0.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The Government's chief index for predicting the economy slipped two-tenths of 1 percent in August, suggesting to analysts that the current torpor will extend at least into early 1993.
"The economy is going nowhere," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. "It looks like the stagnation will persist another three to six months." 
 It was the second decline in the index in three months, following an unbroken string of advances from January through May. And while the Commerce Department report contained no significant surprises -- most of the components of the index of leading indicators were published previously -- it served to confirm assumptions that a spirited recovery is still not in sight.
 
'Insufficient Momentum'
 "There's just insufficient momentum to move the economy ahead," said David L. Littmann, chief economist for Comerica Bank, Detroit. He noted that over the last 18 months or so, the economy had expanded only about half as much as the 3 percent that many analysts believe is required to prevent the unemployment rate from moving higher.
On Friday the Labor Department is to report on the labor market for September, the final reading before Election Day. Expectations are that the report will show payroll jobs fell an additional 100,000 or more, while the unemployment rate remained about unchanged at 7.6 percent.
And the mood of the consumer, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, showed no sign of improvement. Measured by the Conference Board, consumer confidence slipped in September to 56.4 from an August reading of 59. This was the third straight decline and brought confidence near the early-1992 lows, the worst in more than a decade.
The decline of two-tenths of 1 percent for the leading indicators was accompanied by drops of nine-tenths of 1 percent for its index of coincident indicators and one-tenth of 1 percent for its index of indicators that lag behind turns in the economy.
Without Hurricane Andrew, however, the coincident indicators -- gauging current economic conditions -- would have risen two-tenths of 1 percent, a department spokesman said. The hurricane's main impact was on personal incomes, but industrial production was also hurt.
 
Positives and Negatives
 Seven of the 11 leading, or predictive, indicators contributed to the August decline, with lower prices for materials especially sensitive to the business cycle having by far the biggest effect.
The other factors dragging on the index were higher first-time claims for unemployment insurance, faster deliveries to businesses from suppliers, lower backlogs of unfilled orders for durable goods, lower new orders for manufactured consumer goods, a decline in building permits and a lower M-2 money supply.
The three positive components were higher consumer expectations, an advance in share prices as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and higher contracts and orders for new plant and equipment.
The Government's index uses University of Michigan data to assess consumer attitudes, and that series, unlike the Conference Board's, rose in August.
The 11th component, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged, the department reported.
Two privately compiled forecasting gauges showed little or no change for the month. Safian Investment Research in White Plains said its index edged up one-tenth of 1 percent as 10 components rose, 12 fell and 2 were unchanged. Herzog Heine Geduld's index was unchanged with a reading of plus 155.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Consumer Confidence
 By Reuters -- Consumer confidence fell in September for a third straight month, the Conference Board said yesterday.
The report was seen as bad news for supporters of President Bush's re-election hopes.
The board's consumer confidence index fell to 56.4, from 59 in August. Economists had expected only a half-point drop in the index, which is based on a 1985 average of 100.
"It's certainly not a good omen for George Bush," said James Fralick, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
The Conference Board said that over the last two decades the incumbent party has lost the Presidency whenever the index reading fell below 100 this close to an election. The previous lowest level just before an election was 80 in 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated the Democratic incumbent, Jimmy Carter.
Economists said that the lack of a pickup in jobs was likely to be one of the biggest obstacles in Mr. Bush's re-election bid.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Sharply Again, Mainly Against the Mark

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN, By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply again yesterday, pushed lower by concerns that the Federal Reserve Board will respond to continued weak economic data by cutting short-term interest rates again soon, possibly as early as Friday.
The dollar lost the most ground against the German mark, because a rate cut in the United States that is not accompanied by a similar move from the German central bank would widen the already enormous differential between short-term American rates and short-term German rates. Currently, that spread is 6.5 percentage points. 
 The dollar closed at 1.4126 marks, down from 1.4530 marks yesterday. The drop brought the dollar closer to its low of 1.3860 marks, set Sept. 2. As recently as Friday, the dollar was trading at 1.49 marks.
The possibility that Germany will accede to intense pressure and cut its interest rates seemed to fade yesterday, when Lothar Mueller, a Bundesbank official, said German rates must remain high. Mr. Mueller said he hoped Germany would be in a position to cut rates in about six months.
"The currency markets are reacting to the notion that the Fed will be stampeded into easing monetary policy on Friday, and the fading possibility that the Germans will do anything friendly," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
Speculation that the Fed will move to cut both the overnight Federal funds rate and its discount rate was heightened yesterday after the Government reported that its index of leading economic indicators fell in August for the second time in the last three months, suggesting the economy's extreme sluggishness will extend through the fourth quarter and into early 1993.
In addition, analysts and traders alike expect that September employment data, scheduled to be released on Friday, will also be weak. The Fed cut short-term rates earlier this month after a surprisingly bad August employment report.
Nervousness over the twists and turns in this year's campaign for the Presidency is also hurting the dollar, analysts said.
"The dollar collapsed the last time Ross Perot announced he was a candidate," said Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "That may happen again."
The dollar also slumped against the Japanese yen, falling to 119.31 from 119.65 yesterday. Its closing level yesterday is just above its all-time low of 119.14 yen.
In other trading, the British pound closed at $1.7806, compared with $1.7303 on Monday. The dollar also lost ground against the Swiss franc, falling to 1.2292, from 1.2682 francs on Monday, and 4.7865 French francs, from 4.9 on Monday.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Making Coal More Useful By Cooking Out the Water

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Powder River Basin in Wyoming has huge amounts of very clean coal, but nature does not organize itself for mankind's benefit: the deposit is a long way from market and shipping costs are bloated because the coal has a low energy content per pound.
But coal, like oil, can be refined, and this month a pilot plant built by Encoal, a subsidiary of Shell Oil, began full operation. The plant daily cooks 1,000 tons of coal from the Buckskin Mine in Gillette, Wyo., turning it into more valuable hydrocarbons. The process was developed by SGI International, a developer of energy technologies based in La Jolla, Calif. 
 The raw material is low-sulfur coal with a heat content of 8,300 British thermal units a pound -- about half the energy in a pound of gasoline. Some 30 percent of the coal's weight is moisture. The coal can be pyrolyzed -- subjected to heat and pressure -- to give off a gas rich in water and hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons are condensed into a liquid that resembles heavy fuel oil.
The remaining coal, which weighs less because it has much less moisture, has a heat content of about 12,000 B.T.U.'s a pound. The lighter weight cuts about 45 percent off the price of shipping a million B.T.U.'s. More important, once processed, the coal can be used in the boilers of utilities in the East and Midwest that are designed for local grades of coals.
The SGI process is the only one that produces two products from coal, said William M. Owens, chairman and chief executive of the company. "Even if oil is at $10 a barrel, this has the potential to be competitive," he said.
The pilot plant cost $72 million, half paid by the Department of Energy. Mr. Owens said he thought a larger plant would be economically competitive even if unsubsidized.
The Clean Air Act is creating demand for low-sulfur fuel. Another potential market for the technology may be Indonesia and other places in East Asia, where clean, low-B.T.U. coal is common and shipping systems are not well developed.

An experimental process by Encoal at a Wyoming plant enables low-energy, low-sulfur coal to be refined into a liquid resembling heavy fuel oil and a coal that contains about 45 percent more energy per pound than the raw material.
 
The pyrolyzer subjects the coal to light heat and pressure and separates the resultant hydrocarbon gass from the coal solids.

HEADLINE: China Warns Of Trade War

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 29

 BODY:
A senior Chinese trade official warned today that Americans would lose jobs and business opportunities and pay higher prices for toys and shoes if the United States began a trade war with China.
Tong Zhiguang, Vice Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said the United States would be entirely to blame if a trade war broke out. 
 Washington plans to impose punitive tariffs of up to 100 percent on $3.9 billion worth of Chinese products if Beijing does not agree by Oct. 10 to open its markets and dismantle trade barriers like import quotas and licensing fees. The final round of negotiations on the barriers is to open in Washington on Thursday.
"China will naturally take relevant measures should the United States hit China with high tariffs," Mr. Tong told the official New China News Agency. "However, we do not wish to see it happen."
American trade officials have been negotiating with the Chinese for nearly a year to open up China's markets. But Michael Moscow, the deputy United States trade representative, said two weeks ago that "a significant gap" remained.

HEADLINE: Bailout Near For Insurer

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 29

 BODY:
New Jersey regulators said today that they expected to get the insurance industry's backing for the $800 million bailout of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company by the end of the week.
So far, the plan has the backing of insurance guarantee associations in 33 of 42 states where policyholders are residing, officials said. The insurer has $8 billion in assets. 
 In most cases, policyholders in states that do not back the reorganization would receive 88 percent of their benefits under the plan. Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan and New York -- four of six states with the highest concentration of Mutual Benefit policyholders -- have yet to back the plan, and officials have said their guarantees are crucial.
Creditors have until Nov. 16 to file claims against Mutual Benefit, and Judge Paul G. Levy of Superior Court has set a Jan. 28 hearing to consider certifying the reorganization, said Mary Ann Green, a company spokeswoman.
Mutual benefit has an $800 million deficit, but the state estimates that the value of its real estate and other investments will improve enough to make up 75 percent of that over seven years.
Under the bailout plan approved Aug. 4, the state guarantee associations would assure full death, disability and retirement benefits, full account values and minimum interest rates for Mutual Benefit policyholders and tax-deferred annuity holders.
Mutual Benefit had $14 billion in assets and $14.8 billion in liabilities when it was seized in July 1991 after reports of weak real estate investments touched off a run on the company by policyholders.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Use of Shopping Coupons Is Up

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The weak economy is creating a nation of coupon clippers.
Bargain-hungry shoppers redeemed 4.1 billion coupons in the first six months of the year, an increase of 10 percent from a year earlier, according to NCH Promotional Services Inc., a large coupon processing firm in Chicago.
And manufacturers, in response to the demand for cost savings, issued 193 billion coupons in that period, an increase of 7 percent, according to CMS Inc., a coupon processor in Winston-Salem, N.C. 
 Food companies and the coupon processors said, however, that for the full year the percentage of coupons redeemed would probably be about 7.7 percent, the same rate as last year. The redemption rate may even fall for the year, they said, if food companies end the year with a flurry of coupons.
CMS said that in 1991 "the recession seemed to jump-start consumer response to couponing," with the redemption rate increasing by 5 percent over 1990.
"There is a strong link between consumer confidence and coupon usage," said Jane Perrin, senior vice president of marketing for NCH. "Since the end of 1990, we've seen a growth in coupon usage among consumers because of the economic situation."
Kerry J. Smith, managing editor of Promo magazine, said that the latest wave of coupon use seemed to be attracting more than the traditional customers. In the past the typical coupon user had an annual income of $29,000.
A recent NCH survey found that 74 percent of those who earn more than $50,000 a year have used coupons, compared with 86 percent of those who earn between $40,000 and $50,000. The survey also found that 83 percent of those who earn less than $15,000 have used coupons.
Jeffrey Nedelman of the Grocers Manufacturers Association, a trade association for the largest food companies, said the proliferation of coupons was leading to a great deal of "brand hopping" among consumers. "We are dealing with the most value-conscious, least brand-loyal consumer we've ever encountered," he said.
NCH said the face value of coupons continued to rise, to an average of 51 cents this year, compared with 47 cents last year.

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
THE symptoms can run the gamut from headaches and chest pains to memory loss and extreme apathy. The diagnoses can range from heart disease to Alzheimer's. But the real cause is often depression, a disorder of epidemic proportions that is typically unrecognized, misdiagnosed or improperly treated.
According to various surveys and studies, fewer than half of Americans consider depression to be a health problem, and more than two in five say it is a sign of personal weakness. People who complain of depression are commonly admonished to snap out of it. Countless others with physical symptoms like recurring headaches or backaches never realize that their complaints emanate from depression. 
 As a result, many depressed people never bring their problems to medical attention. And when they do, they typically see doctors who are not specialists in mental health and who are likely to miss the diagnosis of severe depression at least half the time, according to the findings of a 1989 study by the Rand Corporation, a research institution in Santa Monica, Calif.
The rate of misdiagnosis is even higher for the more common milder forms of depression. Even when the diagnosis is correct and medication prescribed, it is frequently the wrong drug or too low a dose. Such mistaken treatment, in turn, feeds into the popular notion that not much can be done about depression, when in fact at least 80 percent of patients can obtain significant relief through modern antidepressants and relatively brief psychotherapy.
 
Free Screenings
 Mental health professionals are striving to reverse the pessimistic view of depression, alert people to its many signs and properly recognize and treat patients with this life-impairing disorder. On Thursday, Oct. 8, National Depression Screening Day, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals in all 50 states will volunteer their time in an effort to uncover some of the millions of cases of undiagnosed depression. The program was developed by Dr. Douglas Jacobs, a Harvard University psychiatrist, in cooperation with the American Psychiatric Association, Harvard's Department of Psychiatry and the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association.
Free screenings for signs of clinical depression will be offered to an estimated 30,000 people at more than 300 hospitals, mental health centers and college health services. A toll-free number, (800) 562-8686, has been set up to help people find out where and when to go for a confidential screening.
Last year's screening day saved the lives of at least three people with strong suicidal feelings who required immediate hospitalization. In addition, more than half the people screened, who, of course, were self-selected, were found to score positive for depression.
 
Size of the Problem
 The magnitude of depressive illness in this country dwarfs many other major health problems that receive far more public and professional attention. Each year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression strikes 15 million Americans. At any one time, according to experts at the University of Michigan Medical Center, 6 percent to 10 percent of the population is clinically depressed, with women twice as likely as men to be suffering from this debilitating problem.
The cost to society is staggering, but it is usually poorly measured and underappreciated. In 1986 the economic burden of depression was estimated by psychiatric and public health experts at Duke University to be $16.3 billion a year for major depression alone. Lesser degrees of depression are far more common and, as a result, even more costly. People who suffer from depression miss more days of work than those with heart disease. While they are at work, their productivity commonly suffers, and at home their family and other personal relationships often become severely strained.
Depressed people are also more likely to seek medical care, frequently ending up on a medical merry-go-round, moving from one doctor to another in search of a cause for physical symptoms that are commonly the guise of depression.
 
Disguises
 In its most classic forms, depression results in feelings of sadness, loneliness, apathy, worthlessness, guilt, pessimism or hopelessness. Normal drives are severely diminished, resulting in a loss of appetite and sex drive, sleep disturbances and emotional withdrawal. Memory may be impaired and mental functions and body movements may be slowed.
But instead of telling doctors that they feel sad or hopeless, at least half of depressed patients complain of a physical problem: headache, constipation, chronic fatigue, weight loss, insomnia, backache or indigestion, prompting a battery of tests that reveal nothing about the real cause and may result in mistreatment.
Some patients, unaware that they are depressed, instead admit to feeling extremely irritable, angry or hostile. Or they may complain of an overwhelming listlessness, apathy and a loss of interest in things they once enjoyed.
As if depression in adults was not hard enough to detect, in children and adolescents the symptoms may be even more obscure. A depressed infant may fail to grow properly, a toddler may have protracted tantrums, a nursery school child may become overly aggressive or withdrawn, a child in elementary school may try to avoid school and an adolescent may refuse to eat, notes Colette Dowling in her recently published book "You Mean I Don't Have to Feel This Way?: New Help for Depression, Anxiety and Addiction" (Charles Scribner's & Sons, $19.95).
The physicians at Duke University Medical Center believe a revision is needed in the diagnostic criteria used in determining whether a person is depressed. Too many patients with significant though lesser degrees of depression are now missed, they found through personal interviews in five counties of North Carolina. Yet those with such minor depression, which is also highly treatable, are at increased risk of having an anxiety disorder or suffering a major depression within one year, their follow-up survey showed.
 
Treatment
 Although most depressed people get better on their own within 6 to 24 months without treatment, early diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the length and intensity of depression. Treatment may also help to reduce the chances that the depression will recur. If the depression is severe or if the symptoms interfere seriously with a person's life, antidepressant medication is commonly prescribed. These drugs are not addictive and do not adversely affect behavior.
Instead of medication or in addition to it, psychotherapy may be offered. One popular approach is short-term counseling that focuses on the patients' distorted thinking and negative views of themselves and the world. Another relatively brief approach focuses on the patients' conflicted relationships with others. Longer-term analytical therapy that seeks insights into a person's childhood rarely achieves better results in alleviating depression, although this approach may be desirable for other reasons.

9. I get tired forno reason.
10. I feel hopeless about the future.
 
Rating your responses: If youagree with at least five of the statements, including either item 1 or 2, and if you have had these symptoms for at least two weeks, professional help is strongly recommended. If you answered "yes" to statement 3, get help immediately.
 
If you want information and help in obtaining proper treatment, send a stamped, self-addressed envelope, with a suggested contribution of $5, to the National Foundation for Depressive Illness Inc., P.O. Box 2257, New York, N.Y. 10016.

Small Garage Gives Big, Ritzy Indy-Type Racers a Run for the Money

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARRINGTON, Pa.

 BODY:
Along Route 611 in this town a few miles north of Philadelphia is the Ritz Garage, an antique-car showroom. A few yards behind it is another garage, one that by Indy-car standards is decidedly less ritzy.
It is the home of Derrick Walker Motorsports, a team that is battling rivals that have more than triple its budget and manpower. But if money means so much in Indy-car racing, the Scotsman Derrick Walker and his Canadian driver, Scott Goodyear, have at least proved that with enough hard work and heady driving, it doesn't mean everything. 
 This is the team that came from last place to within half a car length of winning the Indianapolis 500 on May 24. And on Aug. 2, Goodyear showed that was no fluke by winning the only other 500-mile race on the Indy-car circuit.
"I will say that the guys are working harder than any other team," Goodyear said recently.
 
Hard-Working Small Staff
 Hard work is their only choice. Walker's building here is small compared with most Indy teams' headquarters. His full-time staff, 12, is about a third the size of Bobby Rahal's. Walker has only two cars; Paul Tracy, a driver for Penske Racing, has destroyed more than that in 1992.
Walker's office is at the end of a loft that overlooks the work floor of the 6,500-square-foot building. The big silver trophy from the 500-mile victory in August sits on his office floor, as if it feels too ashamed to be seen in such humble surroundings.
"I don't think we're so special at getting the most out of a dollar," the 47-year-old Walker said, his Scottish accent still evident after 13 years in the United States. "It's just that we don't have a lot of money, and so we've just got to concentrate on getting the most out of what we've got."
Each of Goodyear's pit stops is proof of that. At Indy, the team had the lowest aggregate pit time, and it finished second in the seasonlong pit stop competition.
 
Close Look at the Competition
 "The technology isn't the competition," Walker said of pit stops. "The competition is man-to-man, so that's an area we look at and say that's an area we can win in."
Walker also takes more chances with race strategy than front-running teams, something he learned as vice president of racing for Penske.
It can backfire, as it did at Loudon, N.H., in July when Walker called Goodyear into the pits too soon after a yellow flag came out. "We could have won that race," Walker said. "That was one I threw away."
His matter-of-fact tone makes you believe he would try it again. He notes that for a time during that race, the TV announcers were focused on his car -- and his sponsor. "They're only going to talk about you if you're doing something," Walker said.
Looking down at the lone 1992 Lola-Chevy on the floor of Walker's garage, you realize it is a fragile vessel to be carrying the team's hopes over tempestuous, crash-filled seas.
But Walker has a steady navigator in the 32-year-old Goodyear. "He has a particular driving style that suits our economic situation," Walker said. "He doesn't take a lot of unnecessary chances. He drives with his head."
Walker concedes one thing to his better-heeled rivals. "They all have the ability to dig into their own pockets if they have unexpected expenses," Walker said. "I'm sure they don't have to lay people off. Yet I would have to if I got short."
This weekend, Walker will have a chance to add something to the lint in his pockets at Pennsylvania International Raceway, a one-mile oval in Nazareth, about two hours from New York and 50 miles north of here.
On Saturday, a 100-mile exhibition race, the Marlboro Challenge, offers $300,000 to the winner, and Goodyear will be one of the 10 starters. With a good finish in Sunday's 200-mile main event, the penultimate race on the tour, Goodyear can hold on to fifth place in the title standing, which will pay $100,000 at season's end. That $400,000 would represent about 10 percent of the team's 1992 budget, Walker said.
Last February, all this was close to never existing. "At that point, I was about two to three weeks from scuttling the whole company," Walker said. With the season opener a little more than a month away, he and his 1991 driver, Willy T. Ribbs, had no sponsor. "We had tried everything," he said, describing his search for a driver with some money behind him, "from Willy to anybody who had two legs and a helmet."
Goodyear was in the opposite fix: a driver with a sponsor -- Mackenzie Financial, a Canadian firm -- but no stable team. "There were many times in 1991 I was on the phone with Neil Mickelwright, my team manager, trying to find out what was really going on because we were being told different stories by the team owner," Goodyear said.
 
A Team Without a Rudder
 When Mickelwright left the team, it was rudderless. Walker heard about it and offered a deal to Robert Tezak, the team owner. If Tezak signed over his contracts, he would give him some shares in Walker Motorsports.
Tezak agreed, and pretty soon, Goodyear was still making frequent phone calls to his team, but the topics were considerably less troubling. "It's about totally different things," Goodyear said. "It's about down the road and the future and what we need to do to win races."
At least one richer team owner has already tried to woo Goodyear away, and another has presented him with a lucrative offer for next season. Walker said he expects a decision from Goodyear this weekend, but if the driver leaves, the sponsorship may go with him, leaving Walker back where he was last February except, of course, "with a lot of fond memories of 1992."
Walker thinks Goodyear will consider the human element, which will be in his favor, when weighing the offers available to him.
"It hasn't gone to his head," Walker said, "like we're no longer good enough for him."

Mamet's Real Estate Sharks and Their Prey

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
They're guys on the edge. They are real estate salesmen on the North Side of Chicago, working out of a shabby office with a water cooler, trying to make ends meet by selling second-rate home sites in Florida and Arizona with names like Glengarry Highlands and Rio Rancho. Everything they earn comes from commissions, which can mount up. Yet it's not easy selling real estate even in the best of times. When money is tight, forget it.
The salesman has to hustle. He has to go out on "sits." That's when he hangs around for hours in the clients' kitchens, eating yesterday's store-bought crumb cake, while the clients lean this way and that until, at last, it's apparent they have no intention of buying anything. They just like having company. 
 Times are tough indeed in "Glengarry Glen Ross," the splendid film adaptation of David Mamet's 1984 Broadway play, adapted by him for the screen and directed by James Foley in a manner that should finally put him into the big time. Most of the members of the ensemble cast are already in the big time, but not one has ever done better work: Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Pryce and Kevin Spacey. Here is a movie for which everybody deserves awards.
"Glengarry Glen Ross" is a mordantly funny "Death of a Salesman" for the 1990's, though it's not a tragedy. Nor is it quite a comedy. Instead of Arthur Miller, it more often suggests the work of Georges Feydeau, at least in part because it is played with the self-absorbed intensity of classic farce. At the end, there's even a bewildered policeman wandering around the premises trying to find out exactly what happened.
Yet unlike a Feydeau farce, "Glengarry Glen Ross" is about actions that have real consequences, sometimes brutal ones. The reason the film prompts laughter, and finally elation, is not because it's jolly or has any feel-good words to live by. It's because of the utterly demonic skill with which these foulmouthed characters carve one another up in futile attempts to stave off disaster. It's also because of the breathtaking wizardry with which Mr. Mamet and Mr. Foley have made a vivid, living film that preserves the claustrophobic nature of the original stage work.
In adapting his play, Mr. Mamet has introduced a vital new character who sets the scene for everything that comes after. Blake (Mr. Baldwin) is an emissary from "downtown," that is, from Mitch and Murray, who run this real estate firm and who, though remaining off-screen throughout the film, take on the importance of twin deities, probably in polyester suits. Mitch and Murray hire and fire. They make the rules. At the beginning of "Glengarry Glen Ross" they dispatch Blake to the North Side to whip up enthusiasm for the latest sales drive.
Blake is unsmiling and coldblooded. He's a shark in neat haberdashery. He begins his pitch by recalling a few tired slogans, including A.I.D.A., meaning attention, interest, decision and action. The men groan. Blake tells them matter-of-factly that they are tired, incompetent, lazy, stupid and old. They've lived the easy life too long. The men listen, bemused. They already know that the contest's first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado and that the second prize is a set of steak knives. The third prize? Says Blake, "You're fired."
The office's star salesman, Ricky Roma (Mr. Pacino), doesn't bother to come to the meeting. He's across the street at the China Bowl, romancing James Lingk (Mr. Pryce), someone who has chanced to sit in the next booth and become a potential client. Ricky is a kind of poet. Talking fast and with terrific sincerity, he dazzles the shy, prissy Lingk with a monologue composed of a magnificent assortment of non sequiturs. Too much of life, he says, is spent looking forward or backward. He pauses, then asks, "Where is the moment?" Moving on as if possessed, he touches on marriage, sex and spiritual aspirations, which somehow lead into a sales pitch.
Meanwhile, back at the office after Blake's departure, the other men are coming apart at the prospect of losing their jobs. Shelley Levene (Mr. Lemmon), who was once the star salesman and now sweats a lot, is past his prime but refuses to accept the fact. He can't afford to quit, but his sales record is lousy. He blames the young office manager, John Williamson (Mr. Spacey), for not giving him the good leads. Dave Moss (Mr. Harris) is younger but equally desperate. He's also devious and full of dangerous fury. He goes out for a drink with the mild-mannered George Aaronow (Mr. Arkin) and proposes a plan that would make some easy money for both of them and humiliate the loathed Mitch and Murray.
This is by way of being the setup for the darkly farcical events that provide "Glengarry Glen Ross" with what, onstage, would be its second and final act. The payoff is simultaneously priceless and heartbreaking. It's been said that "Glengarry Glen Ross" is about the evils of the free-enterprise system, which may be true, though that's to underrate the breadth of Mr. Mamet's vision. The film, which seems to address the 1990's even more accurately than the play did the 1980's, is as much about fate and the cosmos as about any particular economic system.
That's what forever separates Mr. Mamet from his contemporaries. Though "Glengarry Glen Ross" deals in particulars, with the ways in which this real estate office works and with the jargon of the trade, Mr. Mamet has the vision of a moralist outside of time. He never nudges the audience toward what it's supposed to think. He also has an evil angel's gift for a spoken language that sounds realistic, but is a kind of shorthand for psychic desperation.
Even when they are face to face, Mr. Mamet's real estate salesmen talk to one another as if communicating through a faulty long-distance telephone wire. They speak at the same time, loop back to earlier unfinished thoughts, don't listen or simply repeat the last thing the other said. They are barely in touch, which is why the moments in which they do connect are so moving.
Among this cast of equals, Mr. Pacino and Mr. Lemmon stand out, if only because each has, in the recent past, been hobbled by material that didn't allow him to express the explosive measure of his talent. In Ricky Roma, Mr. Pacino has a character he can inhabit with deceptive ease. Ricky is a big, complex, driven personality, also a little mad. For Mr. Lemmon, Shelley Levene is a variation on all the other end-of-the-tether characters he's played, but one stripped of sentimentality. Shelley is not only desperate; he is also tough. The superb quality of the writing is reflected in the clean, sharp edge of the performance.
The contemporary plays most difficult to turn into films are those that, like "Glengarry Glen Ross," are set in severely restricted but supposedly realistic locations. How to open them up so they don't look like filmed theater, but without losing the theatrical life?
Mr. Foley and Mr. Mamet do it gently, with extreme care and intelligence, as if handling a soap bubble, or maybe nitroglycerine. They crosscut between simultaneous actions. They follow Shelley out on a night when every call he makes ends in defeat, sometimes hilariously. Yet they never push the camera around just to create the sense of movement when there is none. They are stingy with close-ups, which then count when they're used.
The film makers' ultimate secret: they trust the text.
"Glengarry Glen Ross" is very fine. There's not another such adaptation I can think of at this minute that comes anywhere near it. Or: go.
"Glengarry Glen Ross," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), is stuffed with language that is vile, obscene and gratuitously vulgar, which is its method.

HEADLINE: Mr. Perot: Where's the Cattle?

 BODY:
There was never a question about Ross Perot's appeal to millions of disenchanted Americans, or about his ability to articulate widespread frustration with economic decline and political stalemate. The big question about him was always this: Is he fit to lead? With Mr. Perot flirting shamelessly with a late re-entry into the Presidential race, that question burns more brightly than ever.
Mr. Perot would best serve the nation by not running at all. He has no chance of winning. And his eleventh-hour entry may only confuse an increasingly sharp battle between two candidates who, unlike him, have stayed the course. But if Mr. Perot goes through with the charade of honoring a "summons" from his hand-picked supporters, he'll have a final chance to display the political courage that he has conspicuously failed to show during his quixotic and self-indulgent journey. 
 Ross Perot certainly hasn't lost his capacity to inspire political fear. Witness Monday's obsequious pilgrimage to Dallas by high-level emissaries from President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton. Their task was to persuade him and his 50 state coordinators that they share his concern about the Federal budget deficit.
The state coordinators said they were not impressed, and chances are that in a few days they'll return to Dallas and persuade Mr. Perot to run. At which point the questions that so annoyed him the first time around will begin anew -- although he will have artfully reduced the time in which to ask them to less than five weeks.
There were, to begin with, questions of character. Reporters dug up impressive evidence of his penchant for espionage and intimidation. There were questions about his willingness to seek favors from the Washington establishment he professed to despise; and questions about his theories of governance -- particularly his devotion to an "electronic town hall" that would bypass the constitutional powers of Congress.
Maddeningly, he refused to adopt and defend a set of reasonably clear policy proposals. He was contemptuous of reporters who wanted to know his positions "on everything from mosquitoes to ants." He promised to produce a platform within 60 days, then reneged. He finally produced a detailed economic program -- but only after withdrawing from the race.
So here's one more question for the next phase of the Perot campaign, assuming there is one. Is he willing to take his ideas to the people? His economic program is detailed in a book called "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country." It calls for higher taxes for many Americans, new taxes on some beneficiaries of entitlement programs, sharp limits on deductions for mortgage interest and cuts in many Federal programs.
These are powerful ideas. To many economists, they would reduce the deficit too fast, causing economic harm during a recession. To many pundits they're political suicide.
Still they are worthy of serious debate. But all Ross Perot has really done is wave the book at talk-show audiences and say, "read this," while asking Bill Clinton and George Bush to do the dirty work. That's not leadership. So far, as Lyndon Johnson might have said, Mr. Perot has been "all hat and no cattle."

A Feeling Called Mama

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
At Children's Village, a residential treatment center for 300 kids in New York's Westchester County, there are boys who will tell you that Mama walks on water. Could be that Mama said she was coming on visiting day and didn't show. Could be that Mama said they'd live together soon and then disappeared. Could be that Mama hit hard and said mean things.
Doesn't matter. It's not Mama they're really thinking of. It's something they can't put a name to, something like being under a warm blanket on a cold morning with sunshine coming through the blinds. It's security and stability. It's being happy. 
 At the moment Gregory Kingsley stopped thinking of that feeling as Mama, Rachel Kingsley had already lost him.
In a landmark custody case, 12-year-old Gregory got his own lawyer, went to court and said he'd been bounced around long enough by his 30-year-old mother and a system that had served them both poorly. Over Rachel Kingsley's objections, a judge ruled last week that Gregory is now the adopted son of the Florida couple who took him from a group home.
The case may not set any sweeping legal precedent, despite the fears of some conservatives. But perhaps it will serve notice on policy makers. It was as though Gregory had shouted: Remember the Children.
"I just thought she forgot about me," he said of his biological mother.
Instead he dismissed her. He found a happy home, and he wanted to stay, to know where he would wake up from month to month, year to year. Ms. Kingsley's attorneys argued that the boy merely chose an affluent home over a poor one, but it seemed more likely that he chose stability over uncertainty.
He'd lived with Rachel Kingsley for only seven months of the last eight years, been placed in foster care three times. The black eye Gregory said his mother got from her boyfriend, the late-night parties he testified occupied her time, the vagaries of hard luck -- the trial testimony was sad and sordid, pitting needy mother against triumphant child.
Rachel Kingsley made some good points in court about how the system treats the poor. In New York City, for instance, an unemployed mother with two young children receives $577 a month in public assistance, according to the Human Resources Administration. If each of those children goes to a foster home and their mother remains on welfare, the total comes to around $1,250. An intact family gets half as much financial support as what you might call an untact one.
Rachel Kingsley says she put Gregory in foster care because she couldn't support him. That's how lots of children wind up there. We give parents time to get their lives together. But the clock is running on the kids.
Nan Dale, the executive director of Children's Village, says that it is not uncommon for the facility to get children who have lived in half a dozen foster homes. Some are as young as 5 and will never be freed for adoption or reunited with their biological mothers. "Not only the child but the system clings to this fantasy that biology is always better," says Ms. Dale.
Here's heresy: There's nothing magical about motherhood if you don't work at it. The phrase "natural mother" should be retired; it is insulting both to those women who have adopted children and those who have to work so hard -- "natural" implying effortless -- to nurture their kids. Rachel Kingsley didn't write and she didn't call. She didn't send a card at Christmas. She says Gregory was always in her thoughts. That's just not enough. He was in limbo, too.
The extraordinary thing about this case is not that it is believed to be the first time a minor was granted independent legal status to sue his parents. It is that Gregory Kingsley was whole enough to envision a future and fight for it. Ms. Dale says that at Children's Village they now have kids violent and angry beyond words, whose nomadic existence from rejection to rejection has taught them, above all, that they are subhuman.
Children like these are being sacrificed for a false ideal that Gregory Kingsley refused to accept, the ideal that biological is always better. The child welfare system in this country is driven by that ideal today, and because of it we are victimizing thousands of children who wait in foster homes and group homes and treatment centers for parents who, like Godot, somehow never come. We demand that young children sacrifice for the sake of what's best for their parents. It's supposed to be the other way around.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Weak Dollar Brings Rise in Rates

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A sharp decline in the dollar kept United States credit markets from enjoying any gains yesterday from the sort of economic reports that usually propel bonds higher.
A decline in the leading economic indicators and a disappointing consumer confidence survey reported yesterday both implied that a robust recovery was still many months away, a condition that tends to support bond prices and lowers rates. 
 But as investors sold dollars for marks, pounds and yen, most interest rates rose. The 30-year Treasury bond yielded 7.36 percent in late trading yesterday, up from 7.33 percent Monday.
Supporting the dollar has been a low priority for American policy makers, well behind such imperatives as stimulating the economy and getting re-elected. For Americans, all the European talk about the need to defend currencies might as well be in a foreign language.
 
Brake on Federal Action
 Yesterday's activity, some traders and economists said, offered evidence that the currency markets might somewhat limit Washington's ability to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates.
"The dollar is not viewed as a profitable place to be," said Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at First Boston.
The dollar's decline, some said, largely resulted from expectations that the Federal Reserve would respond to a downbeat unemployment report on Friday by cutting its rates, making dollar-denominated debt less attractive. The Bundesbank also sent signals that it was unlikely to lower its short-term rates anytime soon, a posture that strengthens the mark against the dollar.
Add to these misgivings the questions about who will be running the country in January, and whether any candidate can reduce the deficit.
"It's economic uncertainty and political uncertainty," said Patrick Rothstein, the head of government trading at Merrill Lynch. "The marketplace doesn't seem too excited about either of these candidates."
 
Rally Is Halted
 Yesterday's retreat halted a three-day rally in expectation of news on Friday that the number of jobs continued to shrink in September. The Wall Street consensus is that jobs will increase by about 30,000 over all, but fall by 125,000 in the private sector, with the unemployment rate rising one-tenth of 1 percent, to 7.7 percent.
The risk is that bond prices already reflect a weak report and a Federal Reserve easing that is by no means certain. The Dow Jones news service quoted Jerry Jones, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, as cautioning against a rate cut in response to the report.
Many were trading with a light hand yesterday, unwilling to make major commitments until they have the unemployment numbers. Volume was weak and the range of prices fairly narrow.
"The credit markets are locked into the unemployment number and fairly oblivious to other things that might be going on," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.
The 30-year bond was offered late in the day at 9821/32 , down 9/32 , or about $2.81 for each $1,000 of face value, to yield 7.36 percent. Prices were down at shorter yields as well: the two-year note fell 3/32 to yield 3.80 percent, and the five-year note was off 9/32 to yield 5.33 percent.
The discount rate on one-year bills rose two-hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.04 percent.
 
Municipal Refinancings
 Municipals fared better than governments, with prices largely unchanged despite a heavy, $7 billion schedule of new long-term issues this week. But about half the new bonds are going to pay off older, higher-yielding issues, limiting the net increase in supply.
"The issuers are selling bond issue A, using the proceeds and calling bond issue B," said James J. Cooner, who leads the tax-exempt bond management division at the Bank of New York. "It is a recycling operation."
The possibility of a Federal tax increase, making the tax-free income from municipal bonds more valuable, has also supported prices, he said.
Nonetheless, the heavy supply has recently raised yields in the short end of the municipal spectrum. As California prepares to sell a record $5 billion in notes maturing in January, April and May today, short-term tax-free yields exceed the taxable yields available on Treasury issues with similar maturities.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 1, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about trading in the credit markets misstated Wall Street's expectations about the September unemployment report. The consensus is that while payrolls fell by 125,000, the private sector gained about 30,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: Brazil's House Impeaches Collor; Suspended, He Faces Senate Trial

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Sept. 29

 BODY:
President Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached today by the lower house of the Brazilian Congress, clearing the way for a trial on charges that his family and friends had accepted huge bribes on his behalf in return for Government favors.
 Losing by a 441 to 38 margin in the Chamber of Deputies, the President, who in 1989 won Brazil's first presidential elections in 30 years on a clean-government platform, will be stripped of his powers for 180 days and will face a trial in the Senate. 
As early as Wednesday, Vice President Itamar Franco will become acting President, assuming stewardship of the world's fifth largest nation and ninth largest economy.
 
President Called Indignant
 Mr. Collor made no statement tonight. But his spokesman, Celio Borja, said that although the President had received the news "with great indignation," he planned to allow the transfer of power to the Vice President "as fast as possible."
 "There is no need to procrastinate," said Mr. Borja, Brazil's Justice Minister. The President also asked his ministers, who submitted their resignations today, to remain in office until Mr. Franco has chosen a new Cabinet.
 The impeachment is the first time in Brazil's 103-year republican history that a President has been removed by constitutional means other than by election. The commitment to democratic procedures came in a country that until 1985 was run as a military dictatorship.
 "Today, our country gave an example to our suffering America and the world," said Ibsen Pinheiro, president of the Chamber of Deputies. "We are proud that such a deep crisis has been resolved entirely within constitutional norms."
 Aristides Junqueira, the nation's chief independent prosecutor, said on Monday, "We are showing ourselves that it is possible to resolve a political crisis within constitutional channels, without swerving off into an authoritarian or arms solution.".
 Alfred Stepan, a Columbia University political science professor, said that this was the first impeachment of a President in any country in at least 50 years. "Usually talk of impeachment in Latin America ends in a military coup," Mr. Stepan said. "Or, if the Congress tries it, the President closes the Congress."
 Fireworks, samba dancing and joyous block parties erupted across the nation as Brazilians learned the outcome of the vote. In the afternoon, this nation of 150 million people largely stopped work to watch live broadcasts of the debate and vote in the Chamber of Deputies. Hundreds of thousands of students and workers gathered before huge television screens mounted in the central squares of major cities.
 The 43-year-old Mr. Collor is unlikely to return to public office in this decade. Two-thirds of Brazil's senators have said they intend to vote for a conviction, which under the Brazilian Constitution would strip him of his right to run for office for eight years.
 Today's impeachment vote marks a precipitous plunge for a leader who only four months ago won international acclaim as the host of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the largest diplomatic gathering in history.
 An outsider in national politics, Mr. Collor campaigned in 1989 disdaining major party support. Vowing to slash inflation and to wipe out corruption, he swept Brazil's first direct presidential elections in three decades.
 Mr. Collor was largely responsible for the dismantling of Brazil's nuclear bomb program, reducing Amazon deforestation, doubling reservation land for Indians, starting a program to privatize state companies, and opening Brazil's highly protected economy to free trade.
 
Lost Opportunity Lamented
 But in his two and a half years in office, consumer prices rose by about 8,500 percent and the nation plunged into a deep recession. Efforts to correct these problems collapsed in recent weeks after congressional investigators charged that an influence trafficking ring run by Mr. Collor's former campaign treasurer, Paulo Cesar Farias, funneled at least $32 million to friends and family of the President, including his wife, Rosane.
 "I feel very frustrated," said Jarbas Passarinho, a pro-impeachment senator who resigned as Mr. Collor's Justice Minister in January. "We have lost an excellent opportunity in Brazil to modernize, to privatize, and to break up monopolies."
 A congressional corruption inquiry, televised live in June, July and August, provoked millions of Brazilians to demonstrate in favor of impeachment in the last month.
 Fearing riots if the President won the vote, the police mounted the largest security operation seen in the 32-year history of this modernistic capital on Brazil's high plains. The federal district's entire police force, 13,500 men and women, was deployed to protect the Congress building, the presidential palace and the headquarters of two federally run banks that the Government used recently to funnel millions of dollars to patronage projects favored by swing-vote members of Congressional.
 
'Thief! Thief! Thief!'
 A half-mile security cordon was placed around Mr. Collor's private residence, a lakefront estate that became a symbol of scandal this month with the revelation that a $2.5 million garden had been built there with proceeds from the trafficking ring.
 "Thief! Thief! Thief!" chanted a crowd of more than 100,000 who camped outside the Congress building this afternoon.
 Inside the bowl-shaped hall of the Chamber of Deputies, votes for impeachment crossed Brazil's political spectrum. Roberto Campos, a 75-year-old free-market advocate, arrived here today on a stretcher from a Rio de Janeiro hospital in order to cast the first vote in favor of impeachment.
 Gambling on the unpopular President's removal, Sao Paulo's stock market rose eight percentage points today. Last week, spreading certainty that the President would be impeached helped push stock values up 26 percent.
 A dwindling minority accused their fellow members of Congress of trying to mount a legal coup d'etat.
 "They're not voting for morality, they're voting to grab power," said Ronaldo Caiado, an anti-impeachment deputy.
 But Mr. Collor faced solid opposition from Brazil's major business groups, from major newspapers, magazines and television networks, and from 23 of 26 state governors. In an impeachment debate on Monday afternoon, only 4 of 38 deputies argued in favor of Mr. Collor's staying in power.
 In a national poll made public today, 80 percent of those surveyed wanted the President removed. In the event of an impeachment vote by the lower house, 68 percent wanted the President to resign.
 According to a Gallup Poll made public on Sunday, 8.5 percent of those polled nationwide described the performance of the President as "good" or "very good." In contrast, 79.5 percent described his performance as "bad" or "very bad." Those are the worst ratings for a Brazilian President that Gallup has measured since 1980.
 
Lawyers Are Divided
 Reflecting the effect of four months of corruption charges, the percentage of respondents who "don't trust Collor" jumped from 54 percent in June to 72 percent this month.
 Without any precedents as guides, constitutional lawyers were divided today over the timing of the transfer of presidential powers from Mr. Collor to Mr. Franco, Brazil's 61-year-old Vice President.
Opposition lawyers argued that Mr. Collor would lose his powers on Wednesday when a Senate secretary is to go to the presidential palace to deliver a letterfrom the president of the Senate formally telling him of the vote in the lower house.
 Government lawyers argued that the Senate must name a 21-member committee to review the chamber's impeachment actions and then vote to accept or refuse the chamber's request for a Senate trial.
 This process could have taken up to 10 days, but the announcement by Mr. Collor's spokesman that he would not impede the transfer of powers appeared to make the issue moot.
 
Criminal Charges Expected
 According to newspaper polls, more than two-thirds of Brazil's 81 senators intend to vote to convict the President.
 Until the Senate's verdict, the President will have the right to half of his $22,000 salary, to live in the official presidential residence and to enjoy protection and secretarial assistance.
 If the Senate convicts the President, Mr. Franco automatically assumes the title of President until the end of Mr. Collor's term on Jan. 1, 1995. If the Senate finds Mr. Collor not guilty or is unable to reach a verdict within 180 days, he reassumes full presidential powers.
 This week, Brazilians noted proudly that the political crisis had been handled without any factions calling on the army, a traditional arbiter of politics here for the last century.
 Directing a parallel investigation of the President's reported benefit from the corruption ring, Mr. Junqueira, the chief independent prosecutor, said of Mr. Collor, "There is no doubt that he committed various crimes."
 The prosecutor said that he expected to ask Brazil's Chamber of Deputies for authorization to indict Mr. Collor on criminal charges by early November. For a criminal indictment and trial in the Supreme Court, the prosecutor also needs approval of two-thirds of the Chamber of Deputies.

HEADLINE: Blueprint for a Wider War

BYLINE: By George Kenney; George Kenney was the State Department desk officer for Yugoslavia until Aug. 25, when he resigned to protest U.S. policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Everything in the Yugoslav conflict follows from Serbia's fundamental goal of creating a larger, ethnicallly pure state. Only counterbalancing force -- Western air power, arms and training for the Bosnians -- can halt Serbian aggression. Only a military standoff will lead to a lasting peace, by reversing Serbian expansion.
The consequences will be much more tragic in the former Yugoslavia if the U.S. and Western Europe do not intervene militarily. Thousands of people have already been killed, and the Yugoslav refugee tide is already causing strains in Europe. If nothing is done, hundreds of thousands of innocent people may die, and the refugees will destabilize the Continent. 
 Conflict will spread through the Balkans, drawing in Islamic nations. Two NATO members, Greece and Turkey, may take opposite sides. Ultimately, the West may be forced to intervene militarily, but costs will rise exponentially as we delay.
Given the risks, consider how events might unfold.
Serbia has three short-run strategic aims it will not abandon unless it confronts a credible deterrent. First, it wants control of a corridor across northern Bosnia linking Serbia and Serbian-occupied ares of Croatia. Second, it demands an eastern corridor along the Bosnian-Montenegrin border, giving Belgrade access to its only naval base on the Adriatic. A Greater Serbia demands that "ethnic cleansing" continue in these areas until all non-Serbs are killed or driven out. Third, Serbia wants the destruction of Sarajevo, symbol of multi-ethnic Bosnian statehood.
About 400,000 non-Serb Bosnians remain in northern Bosnia. Most are in a pocket above Bihac in the northwest, surrounded by Serbian forces. Perhaps an additional 100,000 remain along the border with Montenegro. "Cleansing" these areas leaves no one to object to local puppet governments that work to "legitimize" a Greater Serbia. Although Serbian forces have not fully consolidated control over these areas, they have advantages in mobility and logistics. Given current conditions, they will achieve their aims over time.
Nevertheless, in the north and southeast, near the coast, some intense fighting will continue. To the north, Croatia will try to break Belgrade's supply lines and cut off parts of Serbian-occupied Croatia. By the coast, Croatian forces do not intend to cede control of the hills above Dubrovnik. Serbia is set on denying Croatia control of this region, which dominates the entrance of the bay leading to Serbia's only naval base.
A further 100,000 or so Bosnians -- Muslims and Croats as well as "disloyal" Serbs -- are interred in Serbian concentration camps. A typical camp consists of a cattle shed or other structure housing about a thousand men on straw pallets. Many die of sickness, hunger and beatings; guards dispose of others in "recreational killings." This winter, most internees will die of exposure. The International Committee of the Red Cross, the U.N. and the West will continue to demand access to all camps and supervision of camp conditions -- demands the Serbs will continue largely to ignore. Prisoners will be shifted from camp to camp in a shell game while Western negotiators visit detainees in model camps. Western governments will remain loath to force access.
The winter war may take up to 350,000 Bosnian lives. Freezing temperatures will greatly help the Serbian sieges around Sarajevo and other towns. Snow will close roads. Cutbacks in humanitarian aid will hurt; getting fuel to the large towns will be nearly impossible. Scores of besieged hamlets, whose names we do not know, will be wiped off the map.
Belatedly, the West will acknowledge a defeat. Cynically citing humanitarian concerns, Western diplomats will agree to terms with Serbian forces for a massive exodus of Bosnians from concentration camps and besieged areas to areas out of Bosnia.
Croatia will turn further refugees away. It has nowhere to put them, nor can it afford them. Having little choice, hundreds of thousands will pour across the borders of Austria, Germany and Italy, despite attempts by those countries to refuse asylum. Austria already views Yugoslav refugees as a threat to its national security. Germany and Italy will soon share that view. In 1991, the Italian Government was damaged by its inability to handle Albanian refugees; this new influx will add significantly to Italian political instability. Germany will face increased neo-Nazi violence.
From the first, the Serbians said they planned to strangle Sarajevo. They are patient. Whether Sarajevo withstands the siege or falls, its defenders will strain trust among ethnic communities. Bosnians, Croats and Serbs will turn away from the Government; it will become predominantly Muslim and radicalized.
Moderate leaders will seek help from Islamic states; Iran and Libya will respond, as will Turkey, which is troubled by what it perceives as its responsibility to Balkan Muslims and also wishes to use the crisis to provoke Greece over other disputes.
Throughout the winter, Serbian forces will make incremental gains. Fighting in Bosnia will enter a false lull. In Croatia, Serbians will continue to violate terms for the cease-fire in U.N.-protected areas. Serbian refugees from other regions will move in, non-Serbs will be forced out, often brutally. Local legal and administrative procedures and political institutions will be modeled increasingly on Serbian standards. Because the cease-fire agreements do not specify how U.N.-protected areas are governed, Serbians will be able to claim they are only defending their "rights."
By spring, the Croatian Government will conclude that further time in negotiations means more opportunity for Serbia to lock in its gains. Zagreb will regroup; by spring, its forces will become far stronger than Serbian forces in Croatia, though not yet a military match for the entire Serbian Army. The Croatians will decide to recover territory by force but will wait for the right tactical moment.
Croatia will appear calm. Bosnia will be quieter, even though Serbians will not control it fully. Western governments will move forward with the Geneva talks. They dare hope for a settlement despite the winter deaths, the refugee problem and disconcerting signs of the involvement of Muslim states. The West will continue to refuse to believe a military deterrent is necessary. Belgrade will talk while it fights.
But sanctions begin to have a big effect on politics as the Serbian economy collapses. President Slobodan Milosevic then does what dictators typically do: He turns attention elsewhere -- to Kosovo, a rally point for Serbs.
No Serb, whether of the opposition or a Milosevic supporter, would give up the "cradle of Serbian civilization." Kosovo's 90 percent Albanian population, however, demands independence. Conflict is inevitable. Serbian militants in Kosovo are armed and trained; they despise the Albanians and plan an ethnic cleansing, to push as many Albanians as possible into Albania. At Mr. Milosevic's signal, Serbian irregulars attack, backed by the army and air force.
It is worse than Bosnia. It is a massacre. Albanian Kosovars are neither armed nor organized. Indiscriminate shelling and air bombardment kills thousands. A half-million Kosovars, about a quarter of the population, flee to Albania.
The Government of Albania mobilizes immediately and goes to war. Macedonia, with a 30 to 40 percent ethnic Albanian population of its own, decides it has a better chance of survival by joining Albania. It is too risky for Macedonia to wait and face a victorious Serbia alone. Each side inflicts heavy casualties; the war bogs down. Muslim states are outraged. Mr. Milosevic made a fatal error by discounting the possibility of their intervention. They openly send "volunteers" and arms.
In Kosovo and Bosnia, Serbian forces, which were never so strong, fall back. Croatia seizes the opportunity to reopen its own front against Belgrade. U.N. forces in the region come under attack from all sides. Greece cannot conceal its ambitions for a slice of Macedonia; it weighs the opportunities and risks of coming to the aid of Serbia. Turkey threatens Greece. NATO, torn by refugee problems, by indecision, flounders. The West cannot stop the conflict from spreading.
This is not a worst-case scenario. In my judgment, the probability of such a chain of events is greater than 50-50, the point being that the U.S. is unlikely to get for free the option of non-involvement. It may well be that by next spring, the U.S. will find itself proposing to lead a force of Western ground troops under U.N. auspices to make peace in the ex-Yugoslavia and keep the peace in Europe.
Should we choose not to deter Serbian aggression when we can? Compare the likely cost of intervention tomorrow with the cost of limited military intervention today and consider that the cost will keep going up and the problem won't go away.
