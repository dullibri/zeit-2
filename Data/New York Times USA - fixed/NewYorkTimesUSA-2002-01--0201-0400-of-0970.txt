HEADLINE: In Last Days For Comment, Victims' Fund Is Under Fire 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

 BODY:
From the day the overseer of a fund to compensate victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks announced a set of draft regulations for distributing the money, there have been those who have criticized his guidelines on various grounds.
 Now, with a deadline looming for changes to the regulations, which will go into effect Jan. 21, some politicians and victims' relatives are stepping up their opposition to the guidelines set forth by the fund's special master, Kenneth R. Feinberg. 
 The fund represents the federal government's attempt to compensate victims' relatives, who would in exchange forgo the right to sue over the disaster. Those who apply to the fund stand to receive compensation for noneconomic losses like pain and suffering, which Mr. Feinberg has said will vary according to whether a victim left behind a spouse and children, and for economic losses, which will vary according to a victim's earning potential. 
Yesterday, four members of Congress and dozens of relatives of victims gathered for a news conference outside Mr. Feinberg's Manhattan office, charging that he had set too low a figure for compensating families for their noneconomic losses. For such losses, Mr. Feinberg's guidelines call for a uniform award of $250,000, with an additional $50,000 for a surviving spouse and for each child. Some families have argued that these awards should vary with each family's circumstances.
"If these families went to court, I believe they would receive far more," said Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island who set up the conference. "He says, 'I don't want to play Solomon with people's pain and suffering.' Well, that's what juries do every day." 
Mr. King's other chief complaint is more complicated, related to the economic compensation that the families of the highest wage earners stand to receive. While Mr. Feinberg has said there is no cap on the compensation, he has also said that awards of more than $3 million would "rarely be appropriate." 
Mr. Feinberg has estimated that the average award under the guidelines would be about $1.65 million, before offsets for life insurance and death benefits. 
In addition, tables that Mr. Feinberg released, showing the rough correlation between the awards, and income and age, did not include salaries above $225,000 -- leading some observers to believe that Mr. Feinberg will impose a cap on compensation for families of high earners. 
Mr. King, who was joined by Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney, Felix J. Grucci Jr. and Vito Fossella, said that given that the World Trade Center was a target partly because it was seen as the embodiment of financial success, those who achieved such success should see that reflected in their awards. 
"They were the symbols of American capitalism, the symbols of American business, and they were murdered because of what they were," Mr. King said. "Now they shouldn't be deprived of what they're entitled to." 
Interviewed yesterday, Mr. Feinberg noted that he has a great deal of discretionary power and said he would evaluate the particular circumstances of each case, and determine an award accordingly. 
"The guidelines are just that, guidelines," he said. "Anybody can come in with their own tailored information and explain why the guidelines are inapplicable to them." 
Mr. Feinberg stood by his prediction that awards of more than $3 million would be rare, but said this was because few people would be able to prove such high earnings, not because of limits. He said he was still meeting with families and keeping an open mind about the guidelines, which are the subject of a 30-day comment period that ends Jan. 20. 
"I want as many people as possible to be supportive of the program," Mr. Feinberg said. "If it takes some adjusting to bring more people on board, we'll do what we can. We'll take everything under advisement."

HEADLINE: Let the Mayor Run the Schools 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to take responsibility for New York City's troubled public schools. It is a worthy mission for the new mayor, and the State Legislature should make certain he gets the authority he needs to do it.
 At this point, Democrats in the New York State Assembly, led by Speaker Sheldon Silver, are standing in the way. They have sent signals that Mr. Bloomberg's wish to abolish the city's Board of Education or at least add enough new appointees to give him control is a newcomer's fantasy. Assemblyman Steven Sanders, the Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the education committee, declared mayoral control of schools "highly unlikely." Maybe Mr. Sanders and Mr. Silver are simply stating a negotiating position, part of a vastly more complicated strategy interwoven with questions about teachers' salaries, state school aid and more. This issue does not need to suffocate under all that intrigue. School governance, as this matter is generally called in Albany, deserves its own separate spot on the agenda. More than that, it deserves to be dealt with swiftly. 
 A year ago, a group of New York City business executives appealed to Albany to streamline the education system and give the mayor more power. Their reasons were straightforward: the current division of power doesn't work, and New York City schools are not producing enough graduates who can thrive in a competitive economy. Unfortunately, former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who supported the group in principle, used such harsh rhetoric to make his case that he helped make the argument for his opponents, who fear mayoral power. But if Mr. Giuliani presented his arguments badly, the underlying rationale is compelling. There must be a clear line of responsibility and authority for the quality of the city's schools, ending at the city's top elected official. It has been altogether too easy for any mayor to shrug off any problems with schools by blaming the school board or the chancellor picked by that board.
The board itself is an odd governmental contraption, seven members, one appointed by each borough president, and two appointed by the mayor. Its purpose was to dilute the mayor's power over schools and to give each borough some chance to demand its share of educational benefits. To no one's surprise, what goes missing often is a citywide view of what is best for the system as a whole.
The board does, at least in theory, provide the public with more lines of access into the school system. One proposal from people who like that aspect of the status quo has been to expand the board to 11 members, giving the mayor a majority of the appointees. The fact that Mr. Sanders did not seem to leave the door open for such a compromise strongly suggests that the Assembly's concern has more to do with protecting political perks and power than with improving the educational system.

HEADLINE: Bush's South Asia Strategy: Keeping Terrorism as Villain 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WACO, Tex., Jan. 6 

 BODY:
In the three weeks since a deadly attack on the Indian Parliament, President Bush and his foreign policy team have scrambled to avoid war in South Asia with a simple formula: in daily phone calls to both sides, they have tried to reframe the conflict as a battle over terrorism, not territory.
 They have carefully offered no opinion on the question of who should control Kashmir, an emotionally explosive issue in both countries. They have not volunteered to oversee negotiations, a role the United States has played so often in the Middle East and elsewhere. 
 Instead, they have acted as if the Islamic extremist groups accused of carrying out the assault were stateless terrorists similar to Al Qaeda and perhaps linked to it -- and that they threaten the stability of Pakistan, where they are based, as surely as they threaten India. 
It is partly a convenient fiction. President Bush has made no public mention of the fact that the terrorist groups he says must be crushed have often acted as a surrogate for Pakistan's intelligence service. 
Yet so far the strategy appears to have worked, or at least bought some time for the opponents, who met this weekend at a tense summit meeting in Nepal. Page A6. 
The president's aides here and in Washington say they believe that their constant barrage of telephone calls to India and Pakistan probably prevented a rapid escalation of the conflict into a war between two hot-headed nuclear powers.
"We decided early on that the purpose now is not to solve Kashmir; it is to defuse the crisis," one senior administration official in Washington said the other day. 
Another added, "The question is how long will that work -- how long can you keep both sides from making a big mistake?"
At the core of the strategy has been constant pressure on Mr. Bush's new ally, Gen. Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan. At the urging of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and then the president himself, who called from his ranch, Mr. Musharraf has begun a roundup of the leaders of the Islamic groups suspected in the attacks, and a few who are not suspected. The administration's thinking was that each round of arrests makes it more difficult for India to justify an attack that would almost certainly turn into war. 
Mr. Bush, describing his conversations with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India, said last week that, "while I understood his anger," he should "give us all a chance to work with President Musharraf to bring the terrorists to justice." 
"Terror is terror," Mr. Bush said, before buying a cheeseburger in the small gas station and deli near his ranch, "and the fact that the Pakistani president is after terrorists is a good sign."
The Indians were suspicious of the strategy. They had been outraged at Mr. Bush's characterization of the two main terrorist groups operating in Kashmir as "stateless," which they saw as a crude pander to Mr. Musharraf. And they noted that despite repeated acts of terrorism in the last few years, Lashkar-e-Taiba, or the Army of the Pure, and Jaish-e-Muhammad, or the Army of Muhammad, were never placed on the State Department's list of terrorist groups. The administration belatedly remedied that on Dec. 27, more than two weeks after the attack on the Parliament.
Now Indian officials say they want "guarantees" from the United States that Pakistan would wipe out the groups. Administration officials say they have heard no such request, and they doubt they could offer such a guarantee anyway.
But they can continue to pressure General Musharraf, who by all accounts has so far offered little resistance to the American call for a crackdown, perhaps seeing an opportunity to consolidate his own power.
While General Musharraf has long identified himself with the Kashmir issue, American officials were betting that he was nervous about the Islamic radicals in his midst and the terror groups' brewing anger about Pakistan's decision to side with the United States in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. 
"The unspoken part of this deal," said one White House official, "is that Musharraf has a brief window of opportunity to act against these guys before they threaten him. And he's feeling a lot stronger than he did a few months ago." But in many conversations with senior American officials, General Musharraf expressed growing alarm about the size of the Indian military buildup on his border. 
Defusing a crisis of this magnitude is not what the Bush administration envisioned when it came to power. All last spring and summer, the president and his aides focused on India, not Pakistan. While Mr. Bush's team has few charitable comments about Clinton-era diplomacy, they saw an opportunity to build on Mr. Clinton's courting of Indian leaders, and the strengthening of economic ties. 
In contrast, they saw little potential in building a relationship with Pakistan: its support of the Taliban, its proliferation of missile technology and its constant dalliance with economic default made it seem, in the words of one American diplomat, "only a few shades better than North Korea." Hard-liners in the Pentagon, moreover, thought a tilt toward India would help in the containment of China, India's other great rival. 
Sept. 11 changed all those calculations. Now Washington finds itself, to India's distress, with an equal interest in both countries. But it does not yet have a strategy to meet that new reality.
Assuming that the current crisis can be defused, officials say Mr. Bush must begin to address both the substance of the Kashmir dispute and the threat posed by both countries' nuclear arsenals. Eventually, that will require creating some kind of arms control framework that gives officials in Islamabad, New Delhi and the rest of the world some assurance that a firefight over the Line of Control does not risk rapid escalation into a nuclear exchange.
But for now the Bush administration is starting small. On Friday, Secretary Powell suggested that he was ready to send an American envoy to the region. That envoy may be Secretary Powell himself, or his deputy, Richard Armitage, or Richard Haass, who heads the State Department's policy planning operations and has long experience in defusing past India-Pakistan crises.
The hope is that the envoy will convince both sides to pull back their troops, reducing the chance of an inadvertent disaster. They are mindful, they say, of the warning from Brig. Muhammad Yaqub, the Pakistani Army's commander in Kashmir, who told a reporter the other day, "When you've got two armies standing eyeball to eyeball, even a little accident can lead to a chain reaction."

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Recent Bushisms Call for a Primer

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
Like a cantankerous parent telling teenagers they cannot have the family car for a road trip, President Bush announced in California on Saturday that the Democrats would reverse his tax cuts of last year "over my dead body." Actually, Mr. Bush said "not over my dead body," thereby mangling a familiar idiom, but the crowd's roar of approval indicated that everyone knew what he meant.
 So did the headline writers, making the president's "my dead body" the first memorable Bushism of 2002, and the first since Sept. 11 to address the indisposed economy. But it was only the latest in a string of phrases, from "smoke them out of their caves" to "the evil one," that have punctuated Mr. Bush's speech and are destined to live on as signposts of his presidency. 
 Herewith, a primer of the newest Bushisms.
"Over my dead body": White House aides said that Mr. Bush was speaking in California from notes, not a text, and that the remark was ad-libbed. The declaration immediately evoked memories of Mr. Bush's father's reneged and politically disastrous promise, "Read my lips: no new taxes," but in fact "over my dead body" has been a favorite of politicians, sometimes with unpleasant results, for some time.
Ronald Reagan announced in Little Rock, Ark., in his 1984 re-election campaign that there would be tax increases only "over my dead body," a promise he had to modify in his second term. Prime Minister John Major of Britain said in 1992 that the pound would be devalued only "over my dead body," and soon enough the currency was down 15 percent. 
White House officials did not return calls yesterday seeking to determine if Mr. Bush had used the phrase with his own twin daughters, or if he had heard "over my dead body" from his parents while growing up. But Homer may have been the first to use it, in the "Iliad," when Hector tells his wife, Andromache, that he will "let the earth come piling over my dead body" before he will allow the fall of Troy and hear her cries as she is dragged off by the Greeks.
In that same passage, in what could be read as another literary allusion to the family Bush, Hector lifts his infant son and asks the gods to grant that the boy "rule all Troy in power and one day let them say, 'He is a better man than his father!' "
"The evil one": Mr. Bush has regularly used this phrase to describe Osama bin Laden. Among evangelical Christians, it is an obvious reference to Satan, and appears throughout the Bible. (From Matthew, in the New American Standard Bible: "When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart.")
Mr. Bush was raised an Episcopalian, became a Methodist after his marriage and then in 1986 said he was recommitting his heart to Jesus Christ -- a born-again experience, at least in the words of evangelicals, although the president has not used that term to describe himself. Still, evangelicals recognize the terminology of "the evil one" as their own.
But some in the evangelical movement have questioned the phrase.
"The problem with 'the evil one' is that in Christian thought, the only one who is totally, hopelessly evil is Satan," said Richard J. Mouw, the president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif., the largest seminary in North America for the mainstream evangelical movement. "We don't really believe that anybody is beyond redemption until their dying breath, if they reject Christ." Calling Mr. bin Laden "the evil one" supernaturalizes him, Dr. Mouw said. He added that saying Mr. bin Laden was wanted dead or alive, as the president had done, trivializes human life. "That's not an example of moral leadership, or spiritual leadership," Dr. Mouw said.
"Smoke them out of their caves": Mr. Bush has with great relish promised to smoke the Taliban and Al Qaeda out of their hiding places. In the early days of the war, his reference to caves was thought by some to be metaphorical. But the bombing of Tora Bora proved that the president was speaking more literally than most people may have realized.
Then on Dec. 19, appearing on the South Lawn of the White House with Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana, Mr. Bush suddenly used the phrase in connection with rabbits, leaving the press corps perplexed.
"I know the governor likes to hunt rabbits down in Louisiana," the president said. "Sometimes those rabbits think they can hide from the governor. But, eventually, he smokes them out and gets them. And that's exactly what is happening to Mr. bin Laden, and all the murderers that he's trying to hide in Afghanistan."
Mr. Foster later explained that Mr. Bush was referring to a rabbit hunting trip he took with Mr. Bush on the Louisiana coast during the 2000 presidential campaign. "You let beagles loose, and they howl and go after the rabbits and chase the rabbits out in front of you," Mr. Foster said.
"I guess you could smoke them out," Mr. Foster added, "but I don't know anybody who hunts them that way."

2002 Follies: New Cast, Familiar Plot

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
 A new year, a new mayor, a new set of predictions:

DEMOCRACY IN ACTION -- Bitter arguments about an appropriate memorial at the World Trade Center site will prevent approval of any design this year. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will ask Nathan Leventhal, his favorite troubleshooter, to make peace.

DEMOCRACY AND INACTION -- The new City Council, intent on replacing the iron leadership style of Peter F. Vallone, the former speaker, with openness, will find itself more deadlocked than liberated.

BLESSED BE THE DONORS -- Two major scandals will erupt from the distribution of money from Sept. 11 charities.

JOBS FOR THE UNNEEDY -- Unemployment will continue to rise, except among politicians forced out by term limits, though few are likely to match the $125,000 a year for Howard Golden, the former Brooklyn borough president just named executive director of civic and governmental affairs by the district attorney in Brooklyn, Charles J. Hynes.

NOVEMBER SURPRISE -- Imaginative cost-cutting, restructuring of the debt and the national economic rebound will wipe out sizable city and state deficits and yield modest surpluses to be announced just before Election Day.

CAMPAIGN REDUX -- Just as in last year's mayoral contest, the Democrats will indulge their well-practiced art of self-destruction. H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo will duel themselves out of contention and hand a third term to Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican.

SPOKESWOMEN -- The Bloomberg women (his former wife, Susan Bloomberg, his elder daughter, Emma B. Bloomberg, and his girlfriend, Diana Taylor) will continue to give interviews to help protect the mayor's desire for privacy.

LET'S MAKE A DEAL -- Mayor Bloomberg, working for a dollar a year, has promised to cut his office budget by 20 percent; he will include his uncollected salary in his count, shaming the resistant city comptroller and public advocate into making reductions of at least 15 percent.

SYMPATHY VOTE -- New York City will get commitments this year to hold the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in 2004. Rudolph W. Giuliani, president of Lincoln Center, will be his party's keynote speaker.

CITY HALL DROPOUTS -- As in most administrations, at least two deputy mayors will end the year with so little to do they may leave office altogether.

ROUND TWO -- Mark Green will lead a campaign to revamp the city's campaign finance law, to help candidates running against billionaires. He will fail, thwarted once again by Mayor Bloomberg.

RAISING THE ROOF -- Following the lead of "The Producers," now selling $480 tickets, several Broadway theaters will be renovated, to install corporate sky boxes.

WORK NOW, PAY LATER -- The city's contracts with unionized workers will offer healthy increases -- payable in 2004 and 2005.

UNION MUSCLE -- The teachers' union will get its new contract only if its president, Randi Weingarten, agrees to use her influence with the State Legislature to lobby for significant mayoral power over the Board of Education.

PAX PRESIDENTIAL -- The Rev. Al Sharpton and Mr. Giuliani will finally appear in public together at joint rallies, as Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Giuliani test the national political waters.

HOME AWAY FROM HOME -- The Clintons come clean and admit they have been staying in a Park Avenue apartment but vow to visit Chappaqua every Election Day, to vote in their "home" district.

MOBILE BETS -- To satisfy a statewide desire for gambling, Governor Pataki will design casinos on wheels. Competing mayors and county executives may volunteer as drivers.

PUBLICITY PREACHMENTS -- Senator Charles E. Schumer will receive an honorary doctor of divinity degree in recognition of his Sunday television sermons.

PILLOWS ON THE PEWS -- Houses of worship, having won the right to shelter the homeless on their front steps, will match their civility with humanity by allowing them to sleep inside.

NICE TRY -- Sympathy for firefighters will defeat the efforts of Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta to close underused fire houses.

REFINANCING -- The Yankees and Mets will offer to sell two players each to pay for their new stadiums, valued at a combined $1.6 billion.

BACK TO NORMAL -- David Letterman will signal New York's recovery by resuming his nasty old put-downs of the city.

HEADLINE: Tribe Prepares for Renewed Fight Over Gold Mine 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN 

DATELINE: WINTERHAVEN, Calif., Jan. 5 

 BODY:
The only sound in the desert is a whistling wind, almost imperceptible. Chips of black volcanic basalt and white quartz mingle underfoot, like a jumbled, prehistoric chessboard. As afternoon falls, waves of sand turn to shimmering gold.
 Standing on a small hill, Lorey Cachora, an archaeologist and member of the Quechan tribe, pointed to a path in the rocky terrain where his ancestors ran, sometimes for hundreds of miles, to deliver messages and trade with sister tribes south into Mexico and north along the Colorado River. Bending down, Mr. Cachora pointed to faint markings on a rock, and said they were made at least 7,000 years ago by Quechan storytellers, who wove powerful myths through "dream trails" and other spiritual tools. 
 It is here, on what is now federal property administered by the Bureau of Land Management, that Glamis Gold Ltd., a company with mining operations in Nevada, California, Mexico and Honduras, wants to dig a 1,600-acre, open-pit gold mine. The company's eight-year effort gained ground two months ago when the Bush administration reversed a ruling by Bruce Babbitt, President Bill Clinton's interior secretary, that digging such a mine would irreparably harm the environment of the Quechan ancestral lands.
"We're going to fight until the end on this," said Mike Jackson, 54, the president of the Quechan Tribal Council. 
Mr. Jackson, sitting in his office at the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, 14 miles southeast of the proposed mine at Indian Pass, said he had tried to arrange a meeting with Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton to express tribal opposition to the mine, to no avail. "Gale Norton really needs to meet with us," he said. "If she doesn't listen, we're headed for a meltdown. Right now, across the country, all tribal nations are very disappointed in the Bush administration. Nobody's history should be destroyed. Putting this mine here would be like putting a McDonald's on the South Lawn of the White House."
Ms. Norton suggested in an interview in The New York Times in November that the decision to rescind the Babbitt order was part of an effort to counteract the Clinton administration's pro-environment tilt. "Many of the things that we have done are to put in place common-sense approaches that we feel are a better balance," Ms. Norton said.
Mark Pfeifle, a department spokesman, said that the Babbitt order denying permission to mine at Indian Pass had sprung from "baseless legal reasonings." Nevertheless, Mr. Pfeifle said, a Bureau of Land Management official told Mr. Jackson and the tribe's lawyer, Courtney Ann Coyle, that Ms. Norton's retraction of the Babbitt order was simply one step in a long process and that the bureau had yet to decide whether Glamis Gold had a valid claim.
"Once that's done, it would be at that point in time that the economic concerns, the environmental concerns and the spiritual concerns would be evaluated," Mr. Pfeifle said. "We're committed to working and listening and cooperating with the American Indians and hearing their concerns."
David Hyatt, vice president of investor relations at Glamis, said the company was willing to alter its plans out of respect for the tribe. "We've offered to move some of our waste stockpiles to accommodate these trails of dreams and whatnot," Mr. Hyatt said. "We certainly understand their feelings. We've tried to sit down with the tribe, but each time they and the antimining groups change their demands. What they don't understand is that miners are just as much environmentalists as they are. We don't want to destroy the environment where we live and work."
Speaking from Reno, Nev., Mr. Hyatt said that, in any event, the Quechan ancestral landscape was already scarred by railroads, highways, power transmission lines and pipelines, although there are none of those intrusions at Indian Pass, where the only evidence of modern man is a row of mining-claim stakes driven into the ground in the midst of creosote shrubs, cholla cactus and cat's claw trees.
For at least 10 years, about 150 miners would toil in three open pits, each as deep as 850 feet. Two pits would be filled in after mining, but the third would be left open. 
"It's not cost-effective to fill in the last hole when you're done mining," said Mr. Hyatt, whose company this year expects to reap about 225,000 ounces of gold -- worth some $70 million -- from its various mines.
Thirty-one members of Congress, including Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California, signed a Dec. 6 letter to Ms. Norton saying that the "unmitigable environmental and cultural impacts" of the proposed mine required denial. They wrote that Mr. Babbitt's decision to stop the project was based on a public review process lasting five years and an exhaustive study of the social, cultural, economic and environmental consequences of the plan.
Ms. Coyle, the Quechan lawyer in San Diego, said she was troubled by the administration's willingness to roll back rulings long in the making. "When can anyone ever rely on the decision of a government when a succeeding administration can reach back in time and undo that decision?" she asked. "It raises a lot of serious questions about how this government feels about Native American sovereignty."
The Quechan, who number about 3,000, held most of this territory as recently as the 1800's, when they had some 880 square miles. Their reservation now is about 45,000 acres, much of it unsullied desert, although there are several mines, some dating back to gold-rush days in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
In Winterhaven, a down-at-the-heels, one-strip town with two liquor stores, a closed nightclub and a senior center, the prospect of an economic revival stemming from a new mine was not enough to make some of the locals go along.
Mr. Jackson, the tribal president, said it was crucial to preserve the past etched in the land so that it could be passed down.
"Since time immemorial, no one has touched it," Mr. Jackson said. "It's a pristine area and we just want to keep it that way."

HEADLINE: FACING OFF; 
On the Front Line in the O.R.

 BODY:
Certified registered nurse anesthetists are nurses who complete three years of advanced training in anesthesia that legally allows them to give anesthesia without a doctor's supervision in 50 states. But Medicare rules, which tend to set standards for all patients, require physician supervision in hospitals. In November, the Bush administration rejected a Clinton administration proposal to let nurse anesthetists work unsupervised in hospitals. Gale Scott spoke to members of opposing professional groups about the issue. Following are edited excerpts of those interviews. 
 YES. Certified registered nurse anesthetists offer safe quality care to their patients. One indicator of that is that our malpractice insurance premiums have decreased 50 percent over the last decade. According to the National Practitioners' Data Bank, nurse-anesthetists made one-seventh the malpractice payments that doctors made in 1990 to 1997. 
 What is really at issue here is a turf war between doctors and nurses, not patient safety. The proposed change in Medicare rules that would have allowed us to work without direct physician supervision was in the best interests of all Americans. Instead we're left with a rule that lets states opt out of that requirement only if they meet cumbersome requirements.
In two-thirds of the nation's rural hospitals nurse anesthetists are the sole providers of anesthesia. There's a shortage of physicians who want to work in these hospitals and many inner-city hospitals because the pay isn't that high. The new rule would have helped these facilities.
Instead there may be less access to care for patients who use these hospitals. The 28,000 nurse anesthetists in our organization are part of a profession that started administering anesthesia over 100 years ago. The first anesthetists were nurses at the Mayo Clinic who gave patients chloroform and ether to relieve pain and suffering. 
The issue of supervision arose because surgeons have been given the idea that they are responsible for what the nurse-anesthetist does. This is a misconception. Case law has shown time and again that a surgeon's liability is the same whether anesthesia is provided by a nurse or a doctor. 
When we are caring for a patient we are not working alone. We have the ability to consult with an array of specialists if a problem arises.
Even in a rural setting where there is less staff, whatever is available to a physician providing anesthesia is available to us. 
We get nearly the same training in anesthesia as a physician, including training in resuscitating a patient in an emergency. We don't have a medical school background; we have a nursing school background. But as far as the technicalities of administering anesthesia, we are on a parallel educational track. 
Anesthesia is safer than ever because of advances in technology. That's been documented by two groups that monitor patient safety. Six studies since the 1960's have shown that there is no difference in patient outcomes when nurse anesthetists provide anesthesia compared to the outcomes when doctors provide it.
Our concern is that if surgeons continue to push to have another doctor present to supervise us, surgical services and thus anesthesia services will become more costly and less available. Surgical services generate revenue. For struggling rural hospitals less revenue could mean closures and a big impact on patient care. 
NO. The Bush administration was absolutely right to restore Medicare's anesthesia safety standards. The Clinton administration's attempt to allow nurses to deliver anesthesia without supervision would have been a step backward. It's a question of patient safety. Hospitals know that. 
In a study at the University of Pennsylvania -- a review of the medical charts of 217,000 Medicare surgical patients -- for every 10,000 patients there were 25 to 40 more needless deaths when an anesthesiologist was not involved in care. 
Many people don't realize that our job is to keep patients alive while the surgeon does things that could kill them.
We delicately balance the delivery of drugs and gases with sophisticated monitoring to allow the brain and the heart and other vital organs to survive the trauma of surgery. 
Over the years we've seen remarkable changes in the specialty. When I started out 30 years ago there were only about 8,000 anesthesiologists in the United States. We had a high volume of patients, and we trained nurses to provide us with technical help. 
But the results were not good. One patient in 5,000 was dying from an anesthesia mishap.
That was an alarming rate. So we campaigned to recruit more physicians to enter the field of anesthesiology. We pioneered research on monitoring patients, drug interactions and protecting organs.
Our efforts have paid off. Today there are more than 30,000 anesthesiologists practicing. The mortality rate has dropped to fewer than one death in 250,000 patients. 
Nurses are very valuable because they can extend our ability to give care. The problem comes when there's a patient who has a heart attack under anesthesia, or an asthma attack. 
As physicians, anesthesiologists have from 12 to 13 years of medical training, including college, medical school and residency training under intensive supervision.
Nurse anesthetists have far less education. A nurse with a two-year nursing certificate can get another two years of training and become a certified nurse anesthetist. One study found that many did not have college degrees.
Nurses are valuable, but they are no substitute for trained physicians who give comprehensive medical care before, during and after surgery. 
The issue of guaranteeing quality medical care in rural hospitals goes way beyond anesthesia. Some 96 percent of these hospitals are regularly referring complex procedures to regional medical centers where more sophisticated equipment and personnel are available. They don't want to handle these cases.
Nor is this an economic issue. Medicare reimburses the same amount for anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists. Nurses practicing independently might actually cost more because they lack medical expertise and need more medical consultations and more lab tests for their patients. That can cause delays and canceled procedures, a big expense for hospitals.
It comes back to patient safety. When you are on that table in the operating room, you want the best trained person available -- and you deserve it.
The very fact that nurses believe they are the same as doctors is dangerous. Patients' safety should not be negotiable through politics.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The Facing Off column in Science Times on Jan. 8, about the roles of anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists, misstated the conditions in which state laws permit the nurse anesthetists to work. In most states, nurse anesthetists can administer anesthesia only with a doctor's supervision, not without it. 
The column also misstated the organizational title of Dr. James E. Cottrell. He is president-elect, not president, of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. 
The column misstated two of Dr. Cottrell's assertions. He said that nurse anesthetists now receive additional anesthesia training after earning bachelor's degrees, not after earning two-year nursing certificates. And he said that in a survey 96 percent of rural hospitals reported that they were doing all the surgery they wanted to do -- not that 96 percent of rural hospitals regularly referred complex surgery to regional medical centers.

HEADLINE: Argentina Devalues, and the Spanish Feel the Loss 

BYLINE:  By EMMA DALY 

DATELINE: MADRID, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
When the Argentine government decided over the weekend to devalue the peso, it also decided on several measures to spare its citizens some of the pain of devaluation. The brunt of the costs of those measures will be borne in Spain.
 Banks in Argentina have been told they must allow loans of less than $100,000 to be paid off in pesos at the predevaluation exchange rate, rather than the dollars they were promised. Two of Argentina's biggest banks, with one-fifth of the market, are Spanish-owned. 
 Gas, electric and telephone utilities have been told they must keep their rates the same as before devaluation and must accept payment in pesos. Most major utilities in the country are Spanish-owned. 
A new tax on oil exports is intended to help the government pay some of its debts. The largest oil company in Argentina is Spanish-owned.
In all, Spanish companies have some $39 billion invested in Argentina, more than those of any other country. According to a report by Santander Central Hispano, Spain's largest banking group, they stand to lose nearly $3 billion almost immediately because of the devaluation. 
Investors were so concerned about the exposure of Spanish blue-chip companies in Argentina that they hammered the benchmark Ibex index down 3.4 percent today.
Amplifying the frustration for Spanish companies is the fact that many of their investments are recent ones. Spanish companies have been leading buyers of privatized Argentine businesses, whose value depended in part on the dollar revenues they generated before the devaluation. The roster includes five of Spain's largest companies -- Santander and its main banking rival, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria; Repsol-YPF, the oil company, whose stock plunged almost 8 percent today; Telefonica, the dominant Spanish phone company; and Endesa, the biggest electric utility. None have yet officially commented on the crisis, pending talks with Argentine officials; many businesses in Spain were closed today for the Epiphany holiday, though the stock market was open.
The Argentine devaluation marked down the value of the peso, which had been held at parity with the American dollar for a decade, to 71.4 cents. During the decade of parity, the great majority of bank assets and liabilities in the country were denominated in dollars. Now, the government's edict that all bank loans, including mortgages, of $100,000 or less be converted to pesos at the one-to-one rate squeezes banks in the middle, with customers repaying loans in pesos but the banks' own liabilities still payable in dollars. The banking industry as a whole will lose some $10 billion to $20 billion from the change, according to bankers -- or $6 billion by the government's calculations.
The two Spanish banks have about $15 billion in loans outstanding in Argentina, including $6.5 billion to governments and state-sponsored entities, two-thirds of that by Banco Bilbao and $2.4 billion by Santander. Between them the two have already set aside $1.25 billion to cover bad debt losses in Argentina; a Banco Bilbao spokesman said those provisions now look insufficient.
Merrill Lynch analysts estimated that the crisis would cost Banco Bilbao $940 million and recommend that investors sell its stock. Other analysts were even gloomier, predicting losses of up to $1.6 billion for Santander and $1.5 billion for Banco Bilbao in Argentina.
Santander shares fell 4.37 percent in Madrid on Monday, while Banco Bilbao was down 3.25 percent.
Responding to widespread criticism that its policy will wreck the banking system, the Argentine government has said that it plans a new oil export tax, producing up to $5 billion in revenue over five years that may be used to back bond issues that could help shore up the banks.
But the tax will punish Repsol-YPF, which stands to lose as much as $257 million a year in the worst case, according to analysts in Madrid. The company had not been expected to suffer much from the peso devaluation because its exports could still be sold for dollars, so the new tax plan rattled investors. Repsol's stock has fallen 11.5 percent since Thursday. 
Miguel Pareja, a broker at Eurodeal, told Reuters that operations in Argentina were likely to account for half of Repsol's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in 2002. 
The freezing of utility bills will hammer Spanish companies that had enthusiastically bought privatized assets the last few years. Telefonica earns about an eighth of its global operating income from its Argentine fixed-line subsidiary. Endesa gets about 7 percent of its global revenue in Argentina.
Analysts at Ibersecurities in Madrid said that the price freeze could reduce Telefonica's pretax operating income by $536 million this year. But they said those losses were already factored into its stock price, which fell 4.4 percent today. "What is hurting its price is uncertainty," the analysts' report said.
Endesa, which had poured $12 billion into Latin American investments the last decade, has now postponed plans to invest a further $3.7 billion in the region. Analysts said Endesa was expecting about one-tenth of its operating income in 2002 to come from Argentina.
Gas Natural, a rival Spanish utility owned by Repsol, said that its Argentine affiliate, with 1.3 million clients in Buenos Aires, would suffer, but that only 5 percent of its global profit depended on Argentina; its stock traded off only 2.06 percent today.
"I think the program will be very negative for Spanish companies, especially the banks," said Ramon Ortega, a trader at the Safei brokerage house in Madrid.
Government and European Union officials were less worried. Pedro Solbes, the union's economics commissioner, told an interviewer on Spanish national radio that Spanish companies would get through the crisis. "I am convinced that they are in a good health and can weather the storm," he said.
Jose Maria Aznar, the Spanish prime minister, was said in news reports here to have had a tense telephone conversation last week with the Argentine president, Eduardo Duhalde, reminding him that Spain had contributed $1 billion to an international bailout package two years ago. But this week, officials of the Spanish government, which currently holds the rotating European Union presidency and sees itself as the bridge between Europe and Latin America, were keen to emphasize Spain's close ties to Buenos Aires.
"Relations are solid and historic," said one official. "Spain is willing to help."
Representatives of the Spanish companies are scheduled to meet with the new Argentine government in Buenos Aires on Tuesday, with the banks expected to argue that without modifications the new policy will destroy the banking system. Some analysts said they expected the banks to threaten to abandon the market unless they received some compensation. Spanish news media reported today that Telefonica, Repsol, Endesa and Gas Natural were discussing joining forces to begin legal action against the utility price freeze.
But the Spanish foreign minister, Josep Pique, said that everyone must do what is necessary to support the reform plan. "Given the gravity of this situation, all sectors must make an effort and make sacrifices, and of course, that includes business interests, whether they are Spanish, foreigners or Argentines," he said.
The Spanish economic daily Expansion tried today to evaluate the costs of the reform package to Spanish businesses but concluded that it was too soon to know. "At this level we do not believe that the institutions themselves really know what the cost of these measures will be, but the minimum estimates are around 1,500 million euros," said analysts at Link Securities who were quoted by the paper.

Compaq to Post Profit And Beat Estimates

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
Compaq Computer, the No. 2 personal computer maker, said yesterday that it would report stronger-than-expected sales for the fourth quarter and a profit instead of the narrow loss it had predicted.
 With little elaboration, Compaq said preliminary figures from the quarter ended Dec. 31 indicated that the company had surpassed its own forecasts and the expectations of Wall Street analysts. 
 Sales still lagged the fourth quarter of 2000, by nearly one-third, but showed sharp improvement from the troubled third quarter, when the Sept. 11 attacks and other unexpected events cut sharply into sales and profits, the company said. The company suggested that the progress reported yesterday served to refute claims by rival computer makers that the beleaguered plan for Hewlett-Packard to acquire Compaq had distracted both companies from their daily business. 
"These results represent strong execution and Compaq's solid momentum in the marketplace," Michael D. Capellas, chairman and chief executive of Compaq, said in a statement. "I am extremely proud of our employees and their continued focus on our business and our customers."
Compaq, based in Houston, said it would report sales of at least $8 billion, compared with its earlier prediction of $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion. The better-than-expected sales will yield a profitable quarter, the company said, beating Wall Street's expectations of a loss of 3 cents a share.
Arch Currid, a spokesman for the company, said it would report a profit "no matter how you slice it," either including or excluding one-time items, when it reports final results on Jan. 16.
Wall Street analysts, who predicted a dreary fourth quarter for many computer vendors, said Compaq was helped by better-than-expected sales in Europe and in American retail stores.
Gateway, a rival computer maker, failed to improve its sales from its third quarter. Gateway yesterday repeated its prediction that it would post a profit for its fourth quarter, excluding one-time items, but said preliminary figures indicated sales of $1.16 billion, down from $1.4 billion in the third quarter.
According to a study put out yesterday by Salomon Smith Barney, consumers in the United States bought more personal computers during the holidays, after poor demand for most of 2001. Sales doubled during Thanksgiving week and finished the year strong, leading to a 30 percent gain from the third quarter to the fourth. Compaq gets about 15 percent of its revenue from consumer PC sales.
Still, Richard Gardner, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said that corporations continued to spend frugally on new computers. PC makers sold fewer machines during the holidays than during the comparable period in 2000 -- an excellent year for computer sales. Salomon Smith Barney said it did not expect that trend to reverse until the economy begins to recover, possibly in the second half of the year.
Shortly before Compaq released its preliminary figures yesterday morning, Lehman Brothers upgraded its rating on the company's stock to strong buy. Daniel T. Niles, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said he thought that programs begun last year to cut costs, reduce inventory and better mimic the direct sales model used by Dell Computer would bear fruit in 2002.
Mr. Niles said corporate customers have apparently stayed with Compaq, despite growing uncertainty surrounding its deal with Hewlett-Packard. A bitter proxy fight between Hewlett-Packard and one of its board members, Walter Hewlett, has threatened to derail the merger plans. But since the deal was announced in early September, Compaq has continued to sign large contracts with customers like Ericsson, Raytheon and General Motors.
Mr. Currid, the company spokesman, said Compaq had beaten Dell, the world's leading PC maker, and other rivals in head-to-head competition for several contracts since the merger was announced in early September. "We're continuing to win in the marketplace," he said.
In regular trading, shares of Compaq rose 29 cents, to $11.68. Gateway gained 43 cents, to $10.25.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DIPLOMACY; 
China, Russia and 4 Neighbors Seek Common Front on Terror

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
After a daylong meeting here, foreign ministers from China, Russia and four Central Asian countries said today that the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan did not end the terrorist threat and that their governments would continue to work together against "terrorism, separatism and extremism" to promote regional stability.
 In their joint statement, the ministers tried to link their countries' sometimes controversial efforts to suppress Islamic fundamentalists and separatists within their own borders to the larger United States-led war on terror. The six countries, which have formed a loose economic and security alliance called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, had long "been threatened by terrorism and drugs" from Afghanistan, the statement said, adding that they "have actively participated in the international alliance against terrorism and have adopted measures to further strengthen the group's antiterrorism work. 
 "It should be ensured," the statement said, "that there is an effective struggle against terrorist threats at every level -- globally, regionally and nationally -- and this struggle should not engender bias or adopt double standards." 
On a broader level, today's meeting represented an effort by China and Russia to form a counterweight to growing American influence in the region.
In addition to urging "restraint" in the conflict between India and Pakistan, the ministers warned against outside interference in Afghanistan. 
Today's declaration made few specific recommendations, other than encouraging the development of an international "Comprehensive Covenant on Terrorism," and announcing that the group would establish an "antiterrorist body" based in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The statement sought to gloss over national differences, giving members relatively unqualified support for combating "terrorism," however they might choose to define that term.
In addition to China and Russia, the organization includes Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. All of the countries have Muslim movements that their governments would like to rein in, although these groups often have little in common other than their religion. 
Russia has been fighting a prolonged battle with Chechen separatists, some of whom were trained in Afghanistan. China has experienced little more than occasional car bombings, thanks in part to intense surveillance and repression of its Muslim Uighur ethnic minority. While many Uighurs in China's far western Xinjiang region say they yearn for an independent homeland, that interest is at least as much cultural as religious. There is little interest in Islamic fundamentalism there.
Still, since the beginning of the United States-led campaign, China's government has asserted that about 1,000 Uighurs have trained in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, and a few Chinese citizens have recently been detained in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Ford's Plans for Revamping May Shut New Jersey Plant 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
A Ford Motor Company plant in Edison, N.J., which makes Ranger pickups, might be shut down as part of the major reorganization the automaker is set to announce on Friday, a top Ford official said today.
 "It is a vulnerable plant -- we have to say it -- as are several others," said the official, James J. Padilla, Ford's new vice president for North American operations. 
 "It's because of the product, not because of the work force," Mr. Padilla added. "If not Edison, then where? It's one among the ones we have to look at." 
Ford is expected to report a loss for 2001, its first annual loss since 1992. Under its new chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., the company has continued the cost-cutting begun under his predecessor, Jacques A. Nasser, in an attempt to return to profitability and to stabilize its tumbling market share.
Speculation about Ford's financial shape has hung over the North American International Auto Show this week and has overshadowed Ford's introduction of new vehicles here, including a jumbo canary yellow pickup, the Ford Mighty F-350 Tonka, a concept vehicle modeled on one of Hasbro's toy trucks.
The plant in Edison, a community about 25 miles southwest of New York City, is seen as a low-hanging fruit by some financial analysts who say that plant closings and thousands of additional job cuts should be part of the plan Ford announces this week.
Edison is one of Ford's older plants. Even though the Ranger has been a top-selling compact pickup for more than a decade, it has not been redesigned in several years, and its sales have been slowing.
Mr. Padilla said that the overall market for compact pickups had declined somewhat and added, "I'm not eager to have plants producing products that don't sell."
Ranger sales fell 17.5 percent from 2000 to 2001, according to AutoData, a research firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.; during that year, Ford's overall market share fell to 21.9 percent from 23 percent.
The Ranger is also produced in St. Paul. Many analysts say that Ranger production will be consolidated as part of Ford's revamping.
Mr. Padilla said that neither Edison nor St. Paul was an optimal site. Much of the work in the automotive industry is now done by suppliers, and having their assembly plants as close to the suppliers as possible enables automakers to reduce inventories and control costs. Engines and transmissions for the Rangers come from Michigan and Ohio, he said.
Still, Ford seems to have tipped its hand in picking between Edison and St. Paul. In December, it announced it would shut down one of Edison's two shifts in February, idling some 600 of the plant's approximately 1,700 employees.
The current mood in Edison -- even at the offices of Local 980 of the United Automobile Workers -- seems to be largely wait and see.
The mayor of Edison, George Spadoro, said he had tentative plans to go to Detroit next week. "I would certainly like to speak with Ford to understand better the economic reasons and see if we can craft a plan to save the plant," he said. Still, he added, the community was big and diverse enough to withstand a closing.
Employees, too, were measured in their response. "The bottom line is the company needs to make money, just like we all do," one assembly line worker said. "It's been rumored for a while," he added, "but until the fate of the plant is sealed there is no use being worried."
In Detroit, Mr. Padilla said: "We know in this market there is excess capacity. We've set some targets for where we think the industry is going to be and what we think a realistic share for ourselves will be."
"Having said that," he added, "we have to right-size our business to take care of what we think is a realistic piece of the action."
The bar set for the turnaround plan is high. A confluence of factors is clouding the outlook for Ford, including a strengthened General Motors, Asian automakers empowered by strong products and a weak yen, an expected decline in overall vehicle sales and the automaker's burdensome costs for incentives like low-interest loans and cheap leases to attract customers.
Ford also has morale woes, quality problems and withering margins at its financing arm, Ford Credit.

HEADLINE: N.J. Transit to Increase Bus and Train Fares 10% 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
New Jersey Transit today approved an average 10 percent fare increase for its 380,000 daily train and bus riders, but withdrew or modified some other parts of its original proposal, which had drawn sharp criticism at public hearings around the state last week.
 The fare increase, which will take effect on April 1, will be the first in a decade for the nation's third-largest public transit system, which has been run by the agency since 1979. 
 Several of the agency's board members said that although they were approving the increase reluctantly, it was long overdue;the system's farebox revenues fell 29 percent since 1991, adjusted for inflation, while expenses rose 67 percent.
"In the first decade of N.J. Transit's operations we probably raised fares too often," said John L. McGoldrick, who has been on the board from the agency's beginnings as an agglomeration of troubled and bankrupt commuter lines. "But in the second decade of N.J. Transit the fare increases came too infrequently. This is a fair fare increase." 
Tom Wilson, a spokesman for Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, said that the governor had approved the board's action this afternoon, just hours after their vote and a day before he officially leaves office at noon on Tuesday. Mr. Wilson said Mr. DiFrancesco believed that the board's modifications strengthened an already reasonable plan. 
Jo Astrid Glading, a spokeswoman for Governor-elect James E. McGreevey, said -- as Mr. McGreevey's office has said since the fare proposal was unveiled on Dec. 11 -- that he had not had a chance to review it and would have no comment. 
Among transit advocates and officials in Trenton, it was widely speculated that the timing of the increase and its approval by a lame-duck governor were intended to lessen the political fallout. In response to some of the criticisms leveled by scores of speakers at public hearings last week, Jeffrey A. Warsh, the agency's executive director, had recommended that several of the original proposal's features be dropped, and board members agreed.
These included lowering the discount for riders 62 and older to 50 percent from the current 55 percent discount; eliminating round-trip, off-peak excursion discounts, and consolidating some bus zones under a higher fare.
At Mr. Warsh's urging, the board also withdrew its proposal for automatic fare increases in each of the following five years, pegged to the inflation rate. The board can still seek such increases, but members agreed that public hearings must be held first.
The features that were deleted drew some of the most critical comments at six hurriedly scheduled public hearings held simultaneously around the state last Wednesday.
"We take our roles as public stewards seriously, and we heard the public outcry on some of these proposals," said Mr. Warsh, taking note of the widespread cynicism about the pace of the process. 
"We heard loud and clear that some people thought that the automatic inflation increases were a violation of their rights. We heard person after person say that we were railroading it through when we knew all along that it was a very fluid proposal."
With the changes, the fare increase will generate $38 million in additional revenue for the agency rather than the original projection of $44 million, Mr. Warsh said. The increased revenue is meant to help the agency close an annual deficit estimated at $169 million. 
Many of the transit advocates and commuters who turned out for the board's meeting today applauded the modifications to the plan.
But they generally continued to oppose fare increases without efforts to increase state subsidies or draw more support for transit by increasing the state's gasoline tax.
"I applaud the board for the sensible changes they have made in the proposal," said John Weber, a spokesman for New Jersey Citizen Action. "But for many people this 10 percent increase is still a one-way ticket to the poorhouse." Vito Forlenza, chairman of the New Jersey State Council of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents 5,000 employees of New Jersey Transit bus lines, said the increase was fair and necessary, allowing the agency to more properly spend its capital funds on new equipment.
But repeatedly, speakers said that the idea of fare increases should be deferred to the administration of Mr. McGreevey, who will take office on Jan. 15.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Why Do More With Less? Just Whistle

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
OUR new mayor has called for all New Yorkers to make sacrifices during these lean times, but the message doesn't seem to have gotten to the union whistle-blowers on my street. 
 These are not the kind of whistle-blowers who report on union scandals. They are literal whistle-blowers. Since November, they have been congregating on the sidewalk to blow a chorus of whistles. Sometimes they've awakened the block at 8 a.m. and blown the whistles all day; sometimes they go for an hour around noon. The unpredictability may be part of the torment. 
 Their gripe is with my landlord, who is building six new floors on top of an old six-story building of rental apartments on the Upper West Side. Living in the middle of a two-year construction project is even worse than you might imagine, but it does at least offer an education on housing issues. We could put a sign over our front door: "New York's Permanent Housing Crisis: A Case Study in Unaffordability." 
In 2000, as some readers might recall, we tenants got a firsthand look at the hassle and cost ($12,500 per apartment) of installing new sprinklers in old apartments. Neither the tenants nor the landlord thought the sprinklers were worth the expense and aggravation, but we were no match for the labor unions and sprinkler companies that lobbied for the new law mandating them. 
Now we're getting another look at union muscle. On a typical weekday, a dozen guys in hooded sweatshirts gather across the street, next to a 15-foot-high balloon of a rat, to protest the nonunion workers building the new floors. The protesters blow whistles and shout at the nonunion workers and the drivers delivering materials. They chant slogans like, "We are the union, the mighty, mighty union."
They hand out fliers accusing the nonunion contractor of "lowering the quality of life in New York," not a terribly persuasive argument to tenants whose quality of life has been destroyed by six weeks of whistling. The protesters, though, say that we're getting off easy. "At other sites we've blown the whistles for 12 straight hours every day," one carpenter told me. 
He said the protest is for our own good, because it's not safe for us to live under floors built by carpenters making $20 per hour instead of the union wage, $58 (including benefits). I share his concern for safety, since I prefer not to have the floors collapse on my home. But I also suspect that the owner of the building and his insurance company have given that possibility a lot more thought than anyone in the carpenters' union. 
So why isn't he using union labor? "Because this project would be unaffordable," said the owner, Adam Katz. "It would cost 30 to 50 percent more with union workers, and it wouldn't be any safer or better. The union guys can't compete economically, so they have to resort to economic terrorism." 
The guys on the picket line, as well as officials with their unions, all insisted to me that there was no threat of violence. But it was easy to see why the owner had hired round-the-clock guards, and why so many other developers would rather not build than risk union wrath.
OF all the reasons for New York's housing shortage, probably the single biggest factor is the high cost of union labor. Wage rates here are typically a third to a half higher than in Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities, according to a 1999 study at the New York University School of Law. Even more problematic than the wage rate, some developers say, is the unnecessary cost of peculiar work rules and featherbedding. 
These extraordinary costs are accepted as inevitable here. "New York is a union town," progressive politicians have long said with pride. But now that the city is desperately short of cash for new housing, now that politicians want radical steps to speed to rebuilding downtown, why is it still taboo to ask for sacrifices from construction workers? These workers, after all, stand to pocket a hefty share of the billions in federal aid for reconstruction. Couldn't they give something back?
The unionized carpenters outside my building may think of themselves as oppressed workers, but their wages are not exactly proletarian. James A. Parrott, the deputy director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research organization, estimates that the median hourly wage in New York State, including benefits, is $15 to $20.
Why is it progressive to defend carpenters demanding three times the norm? They themselves seem to realize it's artificially high. If their work was really worth $58 per hour, they wouldn't need to reach into the toolbox for a whistle.

HEADLINE: Judge's Domestic Violence Ruling Creates an Outcry in Kentucky 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky., Jan. 4 

 BODY:
The violent arena of domestic abuse litigation has grown a bit more volatile here, now that a judge has decided to hold two women in contempt of court for returning to men who had been ordered to stay away from them.
 "You can't have it both ways," said Judge Megan Lake Thornton of Fayette County District Court in recently fining two women $100 and $200 respectively for obtaining protective orders forbidding their partners from contacting them, then relenting and contacting the men. 
 Ruling that the order was mutually binding, Judge Thornton also cited the men for contempt.
"It drives me nuts when people just decide to do whatever they want," said Judge Thornton, who is experienced in the state's thick domestic abuse docket, which produces close to 30,000 emergency protective orders a year. Kentucky officials say there is a virtual epidemic of abusive relationships in the state. 
Judge Thornton's ruling has alarmed advocates for battered women, who plan to appeal it. The advocates say the finding goes beyond existing law and is unrealistic because some renewed contacts often prove unavoidable in domestic abuse cases, which involve economic and family dependency and other complications of daily living.
The state office on domestic violence has pointedly agreed, warning that the ruling could cause abused women to hesitate in bringing their plight before the courts for fear of being chastised for their trouble.
"The reality is it's easy to say they should never have contact," said Sherry Currens, executive director of the Kentucky Domestic Violence Association, an advocacy and legal protection group. "But we're talking about people in long-term relationships. They may have children in common. It's pretty hard to say, 'Never speak again.' People have financial difficulties. They may love the partner. It's not an easy thing."
But Judge Thornton declared in court, "When these orders are entered, you don't just do whatever you damn well please and ignore them."
The ruling stunned Cindra Walker, the lawyer for the two women, who is with Central Kentucky Legal Services, which represents many of the thousands of indigent women caught in abusive relationships.
"For over five years, I've been in court practically every day on these abuse cases," Ms. Walker said, "and I've never before had a victim threatened with contempt." 
"The domestic violence law is a tool for victims to use to be safe," not a device to punish them, she said. 
One of the women in the ruling said she eventually moved back with her partner while the other had occasional contacts, Ms. Walker said.
Judge Thornton's office said judicial rules barred her from commenting on the cases. But her two rulings made clear that she expected the original orders against all contact to apply equally to the person suspected of abuse and the abused.
"They are orders of the court," the judge declared, according to court transcripts obtained by The Lexington Herald-Leader. "People are ordered to follow them, and I don't care which side you're on."
Carol Jordan, the director of the Governor's Office of Child Abuse and Domestic Violence, said she disagreed with Judge Thornton's ruling even as she sympathized with the professionals who must try to oversee violent domestic situations.
"These are tough cases for judges," Ms. Jordan said. "They are dealing with complex human emotions. They are dealing with danger."
But if the ruling stands, Ms. Jordan warned, some abused women will conclude that they will not be treated fairly if they seek refuge in the courts. This sort of ruling "absolutely increases abused women's level of risk" by seemingly encouraging their abusers, Ms. Jordan said.
In Kentucky, as in much of the rest of the nation, abuse victims have increasingly turned to the courts as protective orders have become more accepted, said Billie Lee Dunford-Jackson, assistant director of family violence law and policy for the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. Most judges "have been making clear to the batterers that the issue is between the state courts and them," Ms. Dunford-Jackson said, rather than a domestic issue between two parties. 
A "sizable minority" of judges may still regard the conflicting parties equally in their rulings, she said, but newer state laws have increasingly put the focus on violent abuse as the main problem requiring state intervention.
Ms. Walker's two clients, Jamie Harrison and Robin Hull, declined to be interviewed.
Ms. Walker, one of two legal service lawyers handling hundreds of abuse cases in 17 counties, said, "Our big concern now is the chilling effect this will have."
Two years ago, the Kentucky Legislature considered a proposal to apply the protective orders equally to the accused and the victim, Ms. Jordan said, but the notion of mutual protection, equating the two parties, is not part of state law.
Judge Thornton's ruling, she contended, will "establish a barrier that stops abused women from seeking protection of the courts."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Teenager Drew 1,000 Investors And the S.E.C. With His Plan

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The Internet stock bubble may have burst, but the dream of getting rich quick lives on.
 How else to explain the success of Cole Bartiromo, a California teenager who raised more than $1 million from investors late last fall by guaranteeing returns of up to 2,500 percent? In less than two months, Mr. Bartiromo, 17, persuaded more than 1,000 people to send him money by promising to make risk-free bets on sporting events, according to a complaint yesterday from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Then he transferred much of the money to an account he held at a casino in Costa Rica. 
 The high risks of investing in the Internet or biotechnology stocks were not for Mr. Bartiromo's financiers. They preferred the safe, sure riches promised by wagering on collegiate and professional sports.
Through his Web site, Invest Better 2001, Mr. Bartiromo promised investors that he had a "team of bettors who were very good at what they did and only bet on sure things," said Alexander Vasilescu, senior trial counsel for the S.E.C. "It's fair to say that some people who invested weren't sophisticated."
Some early investors did receive the promised returns, as Mr. Bartiromo paid off his first backers with money from later investors, Mr. Vasilescu said. But by early December, the scheme had begun to break down, and investors were complaining on a bulletin board on the Invest Better Web site that their money had disappeared.
On the site, which proclaimed that "Invest Better 2001 is already the No. 1 investment service in existence," Mr. Bartiromo gave investors a choice of four investment packages. They offered returns that ranged from 125 percent for three days to 2,500 percent for six weeks -- the "Christmas Miracle" package.
On Dec. 13, the S.E.C. filed an enforcement action in federal court in Manhattan to stop Invest Better 2001 from raising more money, although it did not name any individuals in its complaint.
Yesterday, the S.E.C. amended its action to identify Mr. Bartiromo, who lives with his parents in Mission Viejo, Calif., north of San Diego, as a principal of Invest Better.
Mr. Bartiromo agreed to return profits from the fraud to investors, including $900,000 he had transferred to the casino account, Mr. Vasilescu said. The S.E.C. and Mr. Bartiromo have not reached agreement on how much money he will ultimately have to return or whether he will face fines or other civil penalties.
The complaint does not name other defendants, and Mr. Vasilescu declined to say whether Mr. Bartiromo acted alone or had help. 
A lawyer for Mr. Bartiromo did not return calls for comment. Mr. Bartiromo did not return a message left at his parents' house.
About two years ago, a 15-year-old New Jersey student, Jonathan Lebed, made almost $800,000 using the Internet to inflate the prices of penny stocks before the S.E.C. forced him to stop. In September 2000, Mr. Lebed settled an S.E.C. complaint and was allowed to keep almost $500,000 of his profits.

HEADLINE: With Ceremony Under Somber Skies, QE2 Returns 

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
An idyllic cruise-ship-brochure day? Not. Evil winds buffeted the Queen Elizabeth 2 yesterday morning as it docked at Pier 88 on the West Side of Manhattan and hundreds of shivering passengers headed up the gangplank, pelted by a pitiless confetti of snow under a titanium-gray sky. 
 Nevertheless, the boarding was "a symbolic moment, and we're pleased and proud to be here today," said Paul Wright, the liner's master -- or captain, to landlubbers. 
 Though the 33-year-old liner has tied up in New York hundreds of times, it was the first time that any scheduled trans-Atlantic cruise ship had picked up travelers in the city since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, when passenger ships were banished for security and logistical reasons. The QE2, on its way to Manhattan that day from Southampton, England, was diverted to Boston.
The QE2's return was the first hopeful sign of a reprise of sunnier days. "We sincerely hope that this signals the start of a return to normalcy," said Pamela Conover, president of the Cunard Line, the QE2's operator. 
The cruise-ship industry annually pumps $600 million into the New York State economy and accounts for 11,000 jobs, according to NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau.
About 400 New York passengers endured stringent security procedures with good humor as they waited to join 800 passengers who had boarded in other ports. "We are hoping for more sun in Hawaii," said Wolfgang Altmueller, a computer engineer who had flown in from Germany with his wife, Barbara, to join the six-continent, 108-day world cruise. Those sailing on the 1,791-passenger liner were paying $24,195 to $374,515 for the privilege. 
The QE2 began its day in New York Harbor before sunrise. At 6:45 a.m., the crew slowed the liner's engines, lowered its flag to half-mast and laid an evergreen wreath offshore from the World Trade Center site. Virtually all of the passengers and crew members assembled on deck for the memorial, and endured chilly breezes until they had all finished singing "Amazing Grace." The ship then gave three long memorial blasts of its whistle. 
Before the QE2 set sail in the late afternoon, Cunard gave a 100-guest luncheon for what Captain Wright called New York's "unsung heroes," the chefs, hoteliers and hospitality managers who fed, housed and welcomed the ground zero recovery workers and their families. "This group of heroes has gone unnoticed for too long," said Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, which sponsored the luncheon. 
"I'm in awe," said Don Pintabona, chef at Tribeca Grill. He was honored at the luncheon for spearheading the three-week volunteer effort to provide 500,000 meals for recovery workers at ground zero, prepared mostly on donated Spirit cruise ships anchored in the harbor. "If only we'd had the galleys of the QE2 to work with after 9/11."

HEADLINE: Turkey, Well Along Road to Secularism, Fears Detour to Islamism 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
Nowhere does the war against Islamic extremism have more resonance than in Turkey: for eight decades, the country has used draconian laws and the threat of force to crush pro-Islamic politicians and protect secular ideals.
 But with Turkey haunted by economic stagnation, scandals and weak leadership, the generals, who wield the real power, have had their hands full containing the popularity of a former Istanbul mayor who is trying to shed his fundamentalist background and wrap himself in a cloak of moderation. 
 The government's problems are giving the ex-mayor, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a chance at a national electoral victory in 2004 that no aggressively Islamic politician has ever achieved.
Mr. Erdogan was a rising star in Turkey's Islamic political movement as Istanbul's mayor in the 1990's; even critics acknowledge that he cleaned up the streets, improved public services and reduced the endemic corruption. 
But his insistence that religion play a greater role in political life collided with secular Turkey's unbending prohibition against mixing religion and politics. He was forced out of office and jailed for publicly reciting a poem that was deemed seditious.
Today Mr. Erdogan (pronounced ehr-doh-han) is making a strong comeback at the helm of a new party, aided by public disenchantment with the three-party governing coalition and its inability to halt inflation and curb rising unemployment. 
"The world is a different place and I am a different person," Mr. Erdogan, 47, said in an interview at the sleek headquarters of his Justice and Development Party in Ankara. "Turkey should become a model for the Muslim world in terms of science, lifestyle, international relations and economics."

The Nation
The Tug of War Between Old and New
Mr. Erdogan's popularity suggests that he could become the next prime minister, but the prospect of an Islamic politician, however reformed, leading Turkey sends shudders through secular-minded Turks and Western allies, particularly the United States. 
In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Turkey gained new importance to the coalition against Osama bin Laden, and for all its flaws on human rights, Turkey is a stable synthesis of democracy and Islam in a volatile Islamic world. Many regard it as a model for moderate Muslims and a counterweight to the angry voices of radicals.
With Muslims worldwide rejecting the secular values of the United States and Europe, Turkey reflects the faith's less ferocious and more tolerant face. Even its most ardent religious leaders and Islamic-oriented politicians do not advocate violence or oppressive orthodoxy.
On a practical level, Turkey, the only predominantly Muslim member of NATO and an ally of Israel, is also an essential American friend: It granted access to its airspace and provided bases to American warplanes, and has promised to send troops to Afghanistan. If the United States attacks neighboring Iraq, Turkey will be even more vital, and the inherent tensions between its religion and its Western orientation will become more acute.
To many, Mr. Erdogan represents a threat to the rigid safeguards that have held religion in check and maintained Turkey's status as the most moderate and Western-oriented Muslim country.
But Mr. Erdogan is trying to shift his image. The religious rhetoric has been scrubbed away and his old opposition to NATO and the European Union set aside. That way he hopes to avoid any retribution by the generals, who could come back at him if he proves too religious for them. Elections are set for 2004; pollsters say his party would win handily if the vote was held now.
The country he may lead is complex. Western ways, embodied by television, films and tourism, are widely embraced. In Istanbul, short skirts are as common as religious head scarves, and alcohol flows freely.
"Turkey is not Iran," Meltem Eke, a stylish woman in her 30's, said at her bagel shop in the upscale Nisantasi district. "I am from a neighborhood that values the woman no less than the man."
But Turkey is at once modern and backward, democratic and repressive. The differences are sharp between the urban bustle and the sense that time stands still in the villages. There is a divide between the secular generals and business leaders, and those like Mr. Erdogan, who would like to see more religion in the mix of governing.
Within those contradictions lies a tension that is always just below the surface and always the object of careful monitoring by the generals. A further tightening of measures to control Islamic movements and businesses is now under review by the National Security Council.

The History
From Broad Tolerance To Rigid Secularism
Turkey's singular position among Muslim nations is rooted in history. 
The Ottoman sultans brought Islam to what is now Turkey by defeating the Byzantine emperor Constantine XI in 1453. In time, the Ottomans ruled an empire stretching from southern Europe to northern Africa and the Arabian peninsula.
The sultans were simultaneously political leaders and supreme rulers of the Muslim world. Rather than a strict religious government, however, they kept state and religion separate and demonstrated tolerance for other religions and customs.
"From the Ottoman period to today, our experience and traditions have made Turkish Islam more open to secular development than was the case in other Islamic societies," the foreign minister, Ismail Cem, said in an interview.
After the Ottoman empire shriveled in the late 19th and early 20th century, the sultans were followed by Ataturk, the general and determined secularist who founded the Turkish republic in 1923. For Ataturk, religion was the greatest threat to his dream of a European republic at the gateway to Asia.
Ataturk's insistence on secularism was ruthless. Control over education was taken away from religious leaders, Islamic courts were closed, equal rights for women were championed. The Islamic calendar was scrapped in favor of the Gregorian calendar used in the West; Arabic script was replaced by the Roman alphabet. 
Those who opposed Ataturk were hanged. 
His methods persist in moderated form. When the country's first pro-Islamic prime minister, Necmettin Erbakan, was deemed to have detoured too far from the secular path in 1997, generals directed his ouster.
Turkey practices its own brand of secularism: The government builds the mosques, employs those who preach in them and dictates sermons.
Still, political figures and parties have risen beneath an Islamic banner to challenge the militant secularism. Each time, they have fallen victim to laws that prohibit advocating alternatives to the secular state.

The Heartland
Exporting Rebellion To the Uneasy Cities
The resentments on which Mr. Erdogan builds his support are most evident in the heartland, where religious fervor lingers, polygamy is still practiced and illiteracy is high among women because families often do not send girls to school.
Konya is one of Anatolia's oldest cities, the place where Jalaluddin Rumi, the founder of the Islamic Sufi sect of Whirling Dervishes, gathered his disciples in the 13th century to preach his mystical message. His tomb rests inside the domed Mevlana Tekke, and every day dozens of women, their covered heads bowed, pray there.
But Konya is also a bustling city of nearly a million, with high-rise buildings and large agriculture businesses, many financed by devout bankers who observe the Koran's prohibition on interest.
"Traditions have been preserved here because there has not been much internal migration," said Osman Okka, an economics professor at Selcuk University in Konya. "Still, the Turkish people have lost a lot of their religious identity. We know God. We know the prophet. We know Ramadan. But we are illiterate beyond that because of the secular policies of the state." 
But a quiet rebellion against secularism has been brewing among business executives in places like Konya and their counterparts who migrated to Istanbul and other cities to form a new urban middle class during the past 15 years.
Its leader is Ali Bayramoglu, an industrialist who founded the Independent Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association to fight what he sees as government-backed discrimination against devout Muslims.
"We don't categorize a government as Islamic or secular," he said in the Istanbul office of the group, which represents 2,200 business owners and 10,000 businesses nationwide. "We have the idea that if we have a government with just and equal attitudes, that would be enough."
Mr. Erdogan wants to transform this disenchantment into a political mandate, but he must broaden his appeal beyond the devout, who have never mustered the political muscle to elect a national government. As a result, his speeches emphasize the economic failures and corruption of the current governing parties.
The message strikes home among the vast urban poor, particularly young men. Many arrived from rural areas during the past 20 years, bringing conservative values but few skills and little education.
One recent afternoon, several young men lounged outside a teahouse in Kasimpasa, a rough Istanbul neighborhood. None had a job, none supported the government.
"Maybe it's time for someone like Erdogan to shake things up," said Mehmet Osman, 22, who has never worked full time. "He knows what life is like for us."

The Islamist
A New Message Draws Skepticism
Mr. Erdogan grew up in Kasimpasa, selling lemonade and sesame bagels on the street to help support his family, which had migrated from the Black Sea region. He was so pious at a school for preachers that friends referred to him as hodja, or spiritual leader. He joined the Islamic political movement at 15 and got a degree in management at Marmara University.
He was elected mayor of Istanbul in 1994 on the ticket of the Islamic-oriented Welfare Party. Along with improving life in the city, Mr. Erdogan followed the tenets of political Islam. He banned alcohol in restaurants owned by the municipality, opposed the country's bid to join the European Union and advocated withdrawal from NATO. 
His language was blunt. In a 1995 speech, he said: "You cannot be secular and a Muslim at the same time. The world's 1.5 billion Muslims are waiting for the Turkish people to rise up. We will rise up. With Allah's permission, the rebellion will start."
Two years later, in an speech in Siirt, Mr. Erdogan recited a poem that included the line, "The mosques are our barracks, the minarets our bayonets, the domes our helmets and the believers soldiers."
That kind of talk gives the generals chills. Mr. Erdogan was arrested and convicted of "inciting public enmity and hatred." He was sentenced to 10 months in prison, stripped of his office and barred from politics for life.
He served four months in prison, and last year the political ban seemed to be lifted in a general amnesty. But prosecutors claim that the amnesty did not apply to him. A court decision is expected this month. 
Mr. Erdogan knows this is the time for moderation. In the interview, he exhibited none of the fire of earlier speeches. Those old words, he said, were misinterpreted. "This was not a statement in terms of war," he said, recounting his call for rebellion in 1995. "It is for modernizing the Muslim world."
He rejected the Taliban's brand of Islam, saying: "We never supported the Taliban rule. They represent blood and death."
When asked about the role of religion in government, he advocated freedom and tolerance, saying: "Islam is not an obstacle for democracy. Democracy includes Turks who are devout and those who are not."
It is impossible, say his secular-minded critics, to tell whether Mr. Erdogan has changed his mind or changed his message.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 8, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 8 about Turks' concerns that an Islamic political movement could undercut their long commitment to a secular government misstated the century in which the religion arrived. Islam began to spread in the 11th century in what is now Turkey -- not in 1453, when the Ottoman sultans conquered the area. A reader reported the error in January; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

HEADLINE: Isuzu and Hino Motors Plan To Merge Bus Units in 2003 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
Two of Japan's most troubled vehicle makers, Isuzu Motors and Hino Motors, said today that they had reached a deal to merge their bus-making operations next year, as they try to weather a steep sales decline across Asia.
 The companies, which have been negotiating the deal for two years, will begin joint production in October 2003. Together, they will be Japan's largest bus maker. The companies said they were also discussing a combination of their truck divisions. 
 Today's announcement is the latest move toward consolidation in a vehicle industry that analysts say has too many companies, factories and workers. With the Japanese economy floundering and the government slashing its public works budget, demand for trucks and buses has plummeted in Japan. Manufacturers built just 1.7 million of them last year, down 40 percent from 1990.
"Ensuring sustainable business is becoming harder than ever in the face of deteriorating profit," Isuzu and Hino said in a joint statement.
To compensate for the downturn at home and to take advantage of new markets and cheaper labor, Isuzu and other companies built assembly plants in Southeast Asia in the 1990's, but demand there dried up after the financial crisis of 1997. 
News of the consolidation buoyed the stock price of Isuzu; its shares rose 12.3 percent today. Forty-nine percent of Isuzu is owned by General Motors. But investors bid down shares of Hino, half-owned by Toyota Motor, by 3.3 percent.
Shares in both companies have been pummeled in recent months, with Isuzu touching a 31-year low. Isuzu, which also makes sport utility vehicles, expects to lose more than $200 million in the fiscal year ending March 31; its sales have fallen in seven of the last eight years.
Isuzu has already announced that it will shed one-third of its work force, close some factories and stop making Trooper sport utility vehicles in the United States. Still, investors remain skeptical that the company can cut costs fast enough.
General Motors appears to be among the skeptics. The G.M. executive in charge of operations in Asia and the Pacific, Rudy Schlais, said on Sunday that his company would make no more investments in Isuzu. The market value of G.M.'s stake has fallen by $900 million in a year.
"It's going to be a very tough road for Isuzu," said Chris Richter, a senior analyst at HSBC Securities in Tokyo.
The Japanese motor vehicle industry is increasingly being cleaved in two. A few companies, like Toyota and Honda Motor, can compete robustly around the world and have been able to expand their market share and pile up profits. 
The second-tier players -- without a strong overseas presence and often partly owned by foreign automakers -- are struggling to cut costs and shed assets to stanch losses at home. Examples include Mitsubishi Motors, partly owned by DaimlerChrysler, and Mazda Motor, controlled by Ford Motor. Over all, Japan's 11 sizable vehicle makers expect sales to contract by 0.7 percent in 2002, after a 0.9 percent decline in 2001.

HEADLINE: Lucent Finally Chooses a Chief Executive 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Lucent Technologies, the troubled telecommunications equipment giant, ended its long search for a chief executive yesterday by naming Patricia F. Russo, who was a top executive at the company before leaving 17 months ago.
 By rehiring Ms. Russo from Eastman Kodak, where she was president and chief operating officer, Lucent sent a clear message: the company does not plan a major departure from its current management policies as it tries to return to profitability. Lucent lost more than $16 billion and cut or spun off more than 70,000 jobs in the last year and a half. 
 The big question, analysts said, is whether the advantages Ms. Russo brings, as an executive who knows Lucent and its market, will override concerns that she is too closely associated with the business culture that led to Lucent's current problems.
"I would have liked for Lucent to move beyond its legacy management team," said Ed Oppedisano, a debt analyst at Deutsche Bank. "It's not clear whether an insider can help solve Lucent's complicated puzzle."
Ms. Russo, who is 49, assumed her responsibilities immediately yesterday, returning to the company where she worked for 19 years. She joined the company when it was still the communications equipment arm of AT&T and stayed after it was spun off as Lucent in 1996. 
Henry B. Schacht, who is 67, has relinquished his title of interim chief executive but plans to remain Lucent's chairman for about a year. Then Ms. Russo is expected to assume that post as well. 
Mr. Schacht was Lucent's first chief executive when it became independent from AT&T and left in 1997. He returned in October 2000 after the company's fortunes started to decline and the board ousted his protege, Richard A. McGinn. Lucent has been looking for a permanent replacement for Mr. McGinn since then.
But the search was tabled twice -- early last year, while Lucent unsuccessfully pursued a merger with the European equipment maker Alcatel, and later while Lucent fought off a debt and cash-flow crisis that raised liquidity fears.
That crisis has passed, but some analysts are skeptical about Mr. Schacht's forecast that Lucent can become profitable as soon as this year. 
Ms. Russo said in an interview yesterday that she intended to proceed with Mr. Schacht's efforts to repair the company. "I'm not naive about the work that needs to be done," she said, "but I would not have left Kodak for any offer but this one. I agree with the message that Lucent needs to perform more and talk less."
With Ms. Russo's appointment, Lucent will become the second-largest company in the United States to have a woman as chief executive. Hewlett-Packard, which is run by Carleton S. Fiorina, herself a former Lucent executive, is the largest. According to Catalyst, a nonprofit research organization that tracks women in business, the number of Fortune 500 companies with women as chief executives has grown to six from two in 2000.
During Mr. Schacht's first tenure at Lucent, Ms. Russo ran its business communications unit, later spun off as Avaya. She also oversaw business development and public relations as executive vice president for corporate operations. She left Lucent in August 2000, when she saw little room for further promotion under the chief executive at the time, Mr. McGinn.
When Mr. Schacht returned to Lucent in 2000, he helped arrange for Avaya to accept Ms. Russo as its nonexecutive chairman that December. Kodak lured her away a few months later. 
Ms. Russo returns to a company that has been hit hard by the recession in the telecommunications industry. Under Mr. Schacht, Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., shrank its work force to nearly 60,000 employees, from 150,000, by cutting jobs and spinning off and selling subsidiaries. Since mid-2000, its stock price has declined more than 80 percent.
Lucent shares fell 15 cents yesterday to close at $6.95.
Stymied by a wave of bankruptcies at small telecommunications companies and slower sales to large established customers, Lucent has had to revise its revenue and open its books to investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the company's liquidity crisis last year, a group of about two dozen banks agreed to lend Lucent money only if its assets were put up as collateral.
Mr. Schacht has vowed to return Lucent to profitability this year by cutting costs and focusing on selling gear to large telephone companies. But in light of Lucent's losses and the continued weakness in the telecommunications industry, some investors have called that goal unrealistic. 
Analysts and executives have also questioned Mr. Schacht's assessment that the telecommunications equipment industry will recover by 2003, allowing Lucent's business to grow at least 10 to 12 percent a year. They note the glut of communications network capacity created by entrepreneurial companies in the late 1990's, and they say that oversupply could curb equipment spending for another year or two. 
An executive at one of Lucent's largest customers, Verizon Communications, praised Ms. Russo's appointment yesterday. "Pat knows the customer base extremely well," said Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., Verizon's vice chairman. "As an insider, she brings knowledge of a very complex industry to the table."
But Mr. Babbio expressed caution about the state of the communications equipment industry, in which Lucent is the largest manufacturer. "At the end of the day, equipment purchases have to be driven by demand," Mr. Babbio said. "Right now we have too much inventory."
Mr. Schacht, for his part, defended Ms. Russo's appointment and Lucent's prospects yesterday. "She understands the industry and meets our criteria of having been a proven C.E.O. or C.O.O. of a multinational," he said. "Pat knows how to execute the plan that will put us on firm footing again." 
During its search, which was organized in part by the executive search firm Spencer Stuart, Lucent approached several high-powered executives, including Edward J. Zander, president of Sun Microsystems, and W. James McNerney Jr., the General Electric executive who became chief executive of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing last year.
But Lucent submitted a formal offer only to Ms. Russo, after the board met on Dec. 14. Mr. Schacht flew late last month to Boca Raton, Fla., where Ms. Russo has a vacation home, and the two discussed the offer over lunch on Dec. 29. 
According to a person close to the talks, Ms. Russo's annual base salary will be $1.2 million, or slightly more than Mr. Schacht's $1.1 million. Lucent said it would disclose Ms. Russo's other benefits in a filing with the S.E.C. in coming weeks.

HEADLINE: Bush Says He May Not Seek Balanced Budget This Year 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush said today for the first time that he might not propose a balanced budget this year. It would be the first time since 1997 that the government would spend more than it took in.
 Mr. Bush said the causes of the likely deficit were the war and the recession, not his $1.35 trillion tax cut, which increasingly aggressive Democrats have said was to blame in the opening days of this midterm election year. Democrats are hoping to use the economy against Republicans during the campaign. 
 Mr. Bush said he warned months ago that there might be deficits if the country were mired in a recession, a war or a national emergency.
"We're still in all three," the president said.
He then said that raising taxes would be a disaster, even though Democrats have not called for increases.
The president's comments, made at a White House meeting with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, within 90 minutes after Mr. Bush returned from 12 days at his Texas ranch, reflected his latest political moves linked to the languishing economy.
Mr. Bush also said he would include in his budget, to be submitted on Feb. 4, a stimulus plan to help unemployed workers. An earlier stimulus proposal died in fighting between the White House and Senate Democrats in December. Congress is to return to Washington on Jan. 23.
"I hope that when Congress comes back they will have listened to their constituents and that Congress will realize that America, like me, is tired of partisan bickering," Mr. Bush said at the meeting with Mr. Greenspan, which included Vice President Dick Cheney and Mr. Bush's senior economic and political advisers.
Moments after the president opened up what amounted to the day's political war, Democrats and Republicans began busily trading accusations and awakening the capital from a postholiday lethargy.
After the president's remarks, Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi and the minority leader, said on Oliver L. North's conservative radio talk show that Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the majority leader, was "Doctor No" and that he was blocking the president's economic agenda. Democrats, Mr. Lott added, "should lead, follow or get out of the way." 
Mr. Lott also accused the Democrats of hitching their hopes to a faltering economy. "I think they have concluded that a good economy is bad politics and a bad economy can work to their benefit," he said.
Democrats responded that Mr. Bush was falsely accusing them of calling for tax increases when they were not. Some Democrats, however, have asked Mr. Bush to rescind tax cuts that have not yet gone into effect.
"He's having a debate without an opposition here," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, who was commenting in the place of Mr. Daschle, who was in Hawaii. "He says he wants the partisan bickering to stop, and then he creates a straw man like this."
Mr. Dorgan, echoing other Democrats, also said the president should not include the economic stimulus package in his budget, which would not be passed until April 15 at the earliest. That would delay help for the unemployed for too long, he said.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said in a statement that he had "not heard one Democrat say he or she wants to raise taxes."
"This is a partisan blame game," the statement said, "and it has no place in the debate about the future economic health of this country."
Officials in the White House Office of Management and Budget would not say today how far they expected the government's $2 trillion annual budget to end up in the red. But Mr. Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., has said he expects the deficits to be similar to projections by the Congressional Budget Office and those developed by analysts of both political parties. 
The Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee has estimated that the deficit would be at least $43 billion next year and probably $70 billion or more.
The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee has estimated that the government would have a $1 billion surplus next year, though Republicans have said that they assume the deficit would end up in the tens of billions of dollars after the near certainty that Congress approves more money for fighting the war.
The Pentagon is seeking a substantial increase, about $20 billion or more, for its 2003 budget, senior military officials have said. That would be about a 6 percent increase over the current $329 billion Pentagon budget. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld is expected to argue that the Pentagon should stockpile laser- and satellite-guided weapons, which cost $20,000 to $1 million each.
"It makes sense to spend money necessary to win the war," Mr. Bush said. "It makes sense to spend money necessary to protect the homeland."
Mr. Daniels has said that some domestic programs, like the Women, Infants and Children Program that provides food to poor children and pregnant women, would get more money under the administration's budget.
But Congressional aides in both parties say that the administration intends to freeze or cut many other programs, including those run by the Smithsonian Institution.

HEADLINE: THE INDIA-PAKISTAN TENSION: DIPLOMACY; 
Musharraf Sees Blair and Plans to Announce Steps Against Extremists

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
Urging restraint on India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain flew here today from New Delhi and met with President Pervez Musharraf, who said Pakistan "rejects terrorism in all its forms and manifestations." 
 General Musharraf said he would spell out the steps Pakistan planned to take to fight violent extremists in a speech in the next few days. 
 Those steps, in addition to further restrictions on militant groups, may include bans on hate speech at Muslim schools and an end to open fund-raising for Islamic militants, officials said.
Western diplomats and Pakistani officials expressed hope that the speech, which could be delivered as early as Wednesday or Thursday, would provide a basis for scaling down the precarious buildup of military forces along the border and starting talks aimed at ending the crisis between the nuclear-armed rivals that began on Dec. 13 with an attack on India's Parliament. 
But even after the visit by Mr. Blair, India's government again rejected calls for dialogue, charging that Pakistan had not yet proved its sincerity in cracking down on the Islamic militant groups that India blamed for the attack.
"There's no question of any dialogue with Pakistan when there is no change in its attitude," India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, told reporters after a cabinet security meeting today attended by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
Today the two sides continued shelling each other in divided Kashmir, the predominantly Muslim border region they both claim, and about 20 people were reported killed there in shootouts. Large numbers of troops remained on high alert along the entire 1,800-mile border.
Officials said General Musharraf would meet with senior political and military advisers beginning on Tuesday to agree on measures to be announced in his speech. 
The general will have to tread a delicate line between persuading foreign countries of his determination to curb Islamic militancy and not appearing to jettison the cause of Kashmir, which has been so vital to Pakistanis since the country's inception in 1947.
General Musharraf, who often speaks in English, is considering delivering the speech in Urdu, advisers said, underscoring his need to convince a restive public that curbing religious fanaticism is vital to Pakistan's future.
"We have a plan for checking extremism in our society," General Musharraf said tonight at a news conference with Mr. Blair, emphasizing that he had initiated measures to halt terrorists and slash the number of guns in the country even before the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11.
In the last year, the general started a campaign to collect illegal automatic weapons, which swamped the country during successive wars in neighboring Afghanistan, and in August he banned the military wings of two Muslim sectarian groups that were involved in growing violence and assassinations inside Pakistan.
In recent weeks, under the shadow of India's military buildup and at the urging of Western countries, General Musharraf has intensified that campaign, arresting the leaders of two groups dedicated to jihad, or Islamic holy war, in Kashmir and detaining several hundred followers of those and other militant religious organizations. 
Vans are no longer been permitted to drive through Pakistan's towns and cities openly seeking recruits to holy war.
Pakistani officials say they have been frustrated by India's vague, increasing demands and its refusal to acknowledge the genuine and politically difficult steps General Musharraf has already taken to rein in the militants.
India, taking a cue from Washington and its unyielding military campaign in Afghanistan, has used the specter of war to push for all the concessions it can get from Pakistan over an issue that strikes deep emotional chords in both countries.
Pakistani political experts warn, though, that an effort by India to humiliate General Musharraf may backfire. "No Pakistani government can be seen to be caving in to Indian dictates," said Pervais Iqbal Cheema, president of the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, an autonomous study center.
After Sept. 11 and the formation of an international coalition to destroy the Taliban and Al Qaeda, General Musharraf made a wrenching change in policy, ending years of Pakistani support for the Taliban and joining in the American-led campaign.
But two egregious acts on Indian territory -- a suicide bombing on Oct. 1 at the state legislature in Srinagar, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, that killed 40 and the attack on the Parliament in New Delhi on Dec. 13, in which 14 people including the five attackers died -- threw the spotlight on fervent Muslim groups that have waged an increasingly violent struggle to end Indian rule in the southern part of Kashmir.
India charges, and Western diplomats agree, that Pakistan has aided such groups in the past. Pakistan makes the case, in turn, that India has been brutal and violated human rights in its effort to suppress a legitimate political movement.
In recent days, despite the evidence of a crackdown in Pakistan, Indian officials have said they are unconvinced. In part that is because Pakistani officials still talk about the struggle for liberation in Kashmir and in part because they have felt betrayed by General Musharraf in the past, when friendly meetings were followed by new attacks in the territory.
Indian officials also charge that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency, which funneled support to the Taliban and to Kashmir fighters in the past, may not be fully within the general's control -- a charge that he firmly denies. 
General Musharraf has changed the director of the agency and quietly transferred many of its hard-liners to different jobs.
The Kashmir dispute has alarmed Washington and London, which fear a splintering of the global war on terror as well as the danger of a cataclysmic war.
Mr. Blair, after three days in India and a day in Pakistan, did not appear to have achieved any breakthrough. But he said tonight that he felt both sides understood that the crisis could abate only if two principles were followed: that Pakistan unequivocally renounce terrorist violence and that both sides pull back troops and engage in dialogue.
Mr. Blair, who later flew on to Afghanistan, noted the material benefits that Pakistan had gained by joining with the global coalition against the Taliban and Al Qaeda -- including debt rescheduling, trade concessions and promises of economic and military aid -- and praised General Musharraf for his vision.
The American ambassador here, Wendy J. Chamberlin, said the United States planned to support Pakistan's crackdown through aid in three areas: improving an education system that too often breeds religious extremism, improving the quality of the police and law enforcement and boosting trade and investment.
"I really believe that creating jobs in this country is a way to protect American lives," she said.

HEADLINE: Propelled by Drug and Hospital Costs, Health Spending Surged in 2000 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
National health spending shot up 6.9 percent to $1.3 trillion in 2000, the government said today. It was the largest one-year percentage increase since rising costs led President Bill Clinton to propose guarantee health insurance for all Americans in 1993.
 Hospital and drug costs were the main factors in the latest increase. The report also cited more spending on Medicare and resistance to the constraints of managed care. 
 Growth in health spending outpaced the 6.5 percent growth of the economy as a whole in 2000 (before adjusting for inflation), the figures show. Health care now accounts for 13.2 percent of the nation's total output, up from 13.1 percent in 1999 and 12 percent in 1990.
Numbers in the report help explain why health care is roaring back as a potent issue in this election year.
The report, from the Department of Health and Human Services, says health costs and spending are likely to climb faster even though the economy has been weak. As a result, it says, consumers will have to spend more of their own money on health care, and employers may be less inclined to offer health insurance to workers because health benefits have become more expensive.
"Increased job layoffs in the slowing economy will lead to a less competitive job market, reducing private employers' incentive to shoulder rising health care costs, potentially increasing the number of uninsured persons," said the report, published today in the journal Health Affairs. "Competition may force employers to shift a larger share of rising costs to workers, who may no longer be able to afford accelerating out-of-pocket costs. Fewer employers may offer health insurance, and the recently unemployed are often left without coverage."
Consumer groups and employers have sporadically issued reports documenting a rise in drug prices and insurance premiums. But today's report is the first authoritative, comprehensive government study that pulls together data for all parts of the health care industry.
"The new national health spending estimates may well mark the end of an era of reasonably affordable health care cost growth," said Katharine R. Levit, chief author of the report. Ms. Levit is director of the national health statistics group at the department's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The surge in health costs puts pressure on politicians to respond, but also makes them anxious about the cost of expanding public programs or offering large new subsidies for the purchase of insurance. President Bush and Congressional Democrats have offered rival proposals to provide health benefits to the unemployed and prescription drugs for the elderly.
The nation spent an average of $4,637 on health care for each person in the United States in 2000, up from $4,377 in 1999, $4,001 in 1997 and $2,966 in 1991. These numbers were not adjusted for inflation.
Ms. Levit predicted "a stronger increase in the health spending share of gross domestic product in the near future." Health care employment, prices and premiums all increased last year, she said.
The study identifies two main reasons for the surge in health spending: resistance to managed care by doctors, hospitals and consumers, and a decision by Congress to restore money cut from Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled, which accounts for 17 percent of all health spending.
"Consumers increasingly choose less restrictive forms of managed care," which cost more than health maintenance organizations, the report said. In addition, it observed, "the consolidation of hospitals into networks and systems" has increased their bargaining power, so they can extract higher payments from H.M.O.'s and other insurers.
National health spending rose $83.9 billion in 2000, and hospital care and prescription drugs accounted for 45 percent of the increase.
Spending on hospital care rose by $19.9 billion, or 5.1 percent, to $412.1 billion, while drug spending grew $17.9 billion, or 17.3 percent, to $121.8 billion.
The figures for hospitals were significant because hospital spending had not risen more than 4 percent in any year since 1993. Outpatient hospital revenue is growing twice as fast as inpatient revenue. Hospitals say they need the money to cover rising labor costs. Weekly wages paid to workers in private hospitals rose 4.1 percent in 2000; in 1999, the figure was 2.3 percent, the report said.
Congress slowed the growth of Medicare when it passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. But an all-out lobbying campaign by hospitals and other health care providers persuaded lawmakers that the cuts had begun to harm patients. So Congress, in 1999 and 2000, passed laws increasing payments to providers.
"Medicare hospital spending made a comeback in 2000, similar to that in nursing homes and home health agencies," the report said.
The growth in prescription drug spending slowed a bit from 1999 to 2000, but drugs were still the fastest-growing category of health spending. Drug spending increased 19.2 percent in 1999 and 17.3 percent in 2000, the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. 
Total national spending on prescription drugs doubled in the five years from 1995 to 2000 and tripled in the decade from 1990 to 2000, according to government data.
The report cites several reasons for the rapid increase, including the effects of prescription drug advertising, wider availability of insurance to cover drug costs, an increase in the number of prescriptions written by doctors and a shift toward greater use of new, higher-price drugs. Some drugs can reduce health spending by reducing the need for hospital care, economists say, but that is not true of all drugs.
Hospitals accounted for 31.7 percent of all health spending in 2000, down from 42 percent in 1982. By contrast, prescription drugs accounted for 9.4 percent of the total in 2000, double their share in 1982.
The report also said that private health insurance premiums increased 8.4 percent in 2000, to a total of $444 billion, after rising less than 7 percent a year from 1996 to 1999. 
In addition, Medicare spending on home health care rose 0.8 percent in 2000, the first increase in four years. Medicare spending for home care had declined by more than 35 percent from 1996 to 1999, after growing for years at double-digit rates.
The report also said that spending for nursing homes bounced back in 2000, after growth slowed from 1995 to 1999. Spending rose 3.3 percent in 2000, to $92.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Deficit Politics Returns 

 BODY:
It did not take long after the New Year for President Bush and the Democrats to resume their squabbling over taxes and the federal budget. Unfortunately, their arguments have been covered with so much political padding that the country can hardly be expected to follow them.
 The tax cuts of 2001 have left the federal government ill equipped to deal with the demands of fighting both terrorism and a domestic recession. Congress scheduled most of the cuts to take place a few years from now. Projections by both the Democratic and Republican Congressional budget staffs suggest that unless at least some of them are derailed, the nation will plunge more deeply into debt or be forced to cut critical programs. 
 Mr. Bush has access to the same information everyone else does, but instead of making plans for a graceful retreat he seems determined to box himself into a hard-right scenario of continuing to cut taxes, mainly for the wealthy, at a time when more and more poor and middle-class Americans are finding themselves out of work.
Mr. Bush's behavior has been very much governed by his desire as chief executive to avoid the mistakes that cost his father a second term. The first President Bush, of course, vowed to oppose new taxes in his famous "read my lips" speech. Later, in a genuine act of bipartisanship, he went along with a compromise with Democrats to lower the deficit with a package of spending cuts and tax increases. The younger Mr. Bush has always drawn the wrong lesson from this story. He has told innumerable people that he will not make his father's mistake of provoking the wrath of the right wing. But the elder President Bush's mistake was not in agreeing to tax increases that helped set the stage for the big recovery of the 1990's -- it was making the reckless no-new-taxes promise in the first place. The public did not punish him for raising taxes but for breaking his word.
On the Democrats' side, the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, is on the attack himself, attempting to convince the country that last year's tax cuts were a prime cause of the current recession and budget deficit. Attentive listeners might presume that Mr. Daschle would want to see those destructive cuts repealed, but he has so far remained coyly silent. He is said by aides to be undertaking a slow path to an eventual confrontation with the currently popular president. That may make sense politically. But Mr. Daschle needs to start preparing the public for that moment by speaking out about the tough choices posed by the budget. 
Neither the president nor Congress has any easy solutions to these problems. Both sides only face some difficult choices. It would be best if they started talking about them candidly.

HEADLINE: The Quiet Man 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
On Sunday newspapers headlined George W. Bush's declaration that future tax cuts would be canceled "over my dead body." But the only news there was Mr. Bush's choice of words -- words he hasn't repeated, probably because his aides realized that they didn't sound very presidential, and were in poor taste in light of recent events.
 The interesting news story on economic policy, it seems to me, involves someone else -- and it involves his silence, not his words. Whatever happened to Alan Greenspan, the high priest of fiscal responsibility? 
 About Mr. Bush: Surely nobody expected him to give an inch, even though the surplus projections that were used to sell the tax cut have turned out to be nonsense. The Bush administration operates on the principle of "no enemies on the right"; it also operates on the principle that Mr. Bush is infallible. Whatever policies he may have proposed in the past, his aides always insist that they are perfectly suited to the present -- indeed, were devised with the present situation in mind. It's actually quite funny, though nobody dares say so.
 Last month, for example, Karl Rove explained that the tax cut, although originally proposed amid an economic boom, was designed to cope with the current recession. "All the signs were there in the second, if not the second, the third quarter of 2000," Mr. Rove said. When a questioner gently pointed out that Mr. Bush had laid out his tax plan way back in 1999, Mr. Rove brushed him aside. 
 And since Mr. Bush is infallible, why should he ever reconsider his decisions?
 But back to Alan Greenspan. A year ago Mr. Greenspan gave the new Bush administration decisive aid in its push for a large tax cut. Worrying that the national debt would be paid off too quickly, he urged Congress to cut taxes in order to put the budget on a "glide path" of gradually declining surpluses. 
 Some glide path; more like a nosedive. In 2000 America ran a record surplus; now, analysts from both parties agree that the federal budget will be in deficit for at least the next several years. They still project surpluses for late in the decade -- but if you believe those projections, I've got some Enron stock you might want to buy. 
 Mr. Greenspan ought to be upset. It's not just that during the Clinton years he became an icon of fiscal probity; the sudden plunge back into deficit undoes his own handiwork.
 You see, back in the early 1980's, before he became Fed chairman, Mr. Greenspan headed a commission that was supposed to secure the future of Social Security. The main result of that commission was an increase in payroll taxes, even as Ronald Reagan was cutting income taxes. The purpose of this regressive tax increase -- payroll taxes fall most heavily on low- and middle-income families -- was to generate a surplus that would, in turn, make it easier for the federal government to pay benefits to an aging population.
 But now, thanks to the disappearance of the budget surplus, the excess revenue collected by the payroll tax isn't being used to acquire assets, or even to pay down the federal debt; it's being used to cover deficits elsewhere in the budget. We're not talking small numbers here; only about 70 cents of each dollar in Social Security revenue is used to pay current benefits. In effect, the other 30 cents has now been expropriated for other uses -- mainly tax cuts for the richest few percent of the population. 
 Was this what Mr. Greenspan intended -- to raise taxes on the poor and the middle class, so that they could be cut for the rich? If not, why doesn't he say something? After all, a word from him could alter the landscape of economic debate, just as it did a year ago.
 It's true that to give that word Mr. Greenspan would have to admit, at least tacitly, that he was wrong last year. But he's not a politician up for re-election -- and if he's worried about his reputation, he should realize that if he continues to be silent history will not judge him kindly. Right now the provisional verdict is that he was a hypocrite: he sternly demanded fiscal responsibility while Democrats were in office, but had no complaints -- indeed, acted as an enabler -- as a Republican administration quickly squandered the fruits of all that austerity.
 That verdict doesn't have to stand. All it would take would be a few carefully chosen remarks. I'm all ears.

HEADLINE: Showing in Canada: The Mystery of the Falling Dollar 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
It's hard to say what they are, but Americans generally love them and Canadians hate them: the mysterious forces that have pushed the value of Canada's dollar relentlessly downward to new lows in recent weeks.
 The Canadian dollar -- nicknamed the loonie because of the loon depicted on dollar coins -- has been declining fairly steadily for three decades, a drop that has angered Canadians and puzzled the nation's leading economists. Experts are at a loss to explain why the exchange rate continues to erode even when the economy itself is fundamentally sound. 
 "Economists and others have run out of excuses to explain why the currency remains weak," said Alister Smith, deputy chief economist for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. "What's puzzling for a lot of Canadians is the fact that economists and others have said that once we improve the fiscal situation and stop running deficits, the currency will improve. Well, we've managed to do all that, but the exchange rate still hasn't improved." 
The deteriorating exchange rate has made Canada a bargain for American businesses, which have been buying Canadian companies in bunches, and for American tourists. 
At the same time, the weak Canadian dollar makes the United States and its products more expensive for Canadians, who have grown accustomed to buying American imports and taking vacations south of the border.
The value of the Canadian dollar has steadily declined since April 25, 1974, when it was worth $1.04. During trading on Dec. 24, 2001, it reached its lowest value so far, 62.3 American cents -- about 1.6 Canadian dollars to the United States dollar -- before recovering slightly. That capped a typically bad year in which the Canadian currency lost 6.25 percent of its value. It traded yesterday at 1.5988 to the dollar.
The deteriorating Canadian dollar is puzzling because it appears to defy positive indicators. For example, over the weekend the governor of the Bank of Canada, David A. Dodge, said the Canadian economy might actually have grown, however slightly, in the last quarter of 2001. If so, that would mean Canada has not technically entered a recession because it had only one previous quarter without growth in 2001. 
Despite that better-than-expected performance, the Canadian currency plummeted to new lows in the last quarter of 2001. Economists expect it to stay in that range for the rest of this year.
"Such things do cause people to scratch their heads," Mr. Smith said.
While unable to provide definitive answers for the question of what ails the Canadian dollar, economists have identified factors contributing to its plight. They say it has been undermined by a capital outflow as investors search for the most secure markets. That trend was worsened by a change in Canadian law that allowed a greater share of Canadians' individual retirement accounts to be invested in foreign securities -- 30 percent instead of 20 percent. 
Productivity may also be a factor. Much of the sophisticated equipment needed to improve productivity must be imported, and it is generally priced in ever more expensive American dollars. Companies in Canada usually find it easier, and cheaper, simply to add more workers and pay them in Canadian dollars instead of buying new equipment.
Some economists have argued that the declining currency makes a compelling argument for adopting a common North American currency with the United States and Mexico. But that would require Canada to surrender its ability to control interest rates, one of the most important tools in preserving the country's limited ability to steer its own economy. 
Of course, not every Canadian is unhappy about the nation's shrinking dollar. Some exporters like it because a weak currency gives Canadian exports a price advantage in foreign markets.
Dr. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto, said some of Canada's political leaders also seemed to think that a weak currency was not particularly bad because of its positive effect on exports. But they should be more concerned, she said, because the weak Canadian dollar "amounts to a national pay cut."
Similarly, the Canadian economy's heavy reliance on commodity exports like oil, gas, timber, minerals and grain, which are usually priced in American dollars, ought to be generating bumper earnings in terms of the Canadian currency. But the global prices of most of those commodities are low now as the world economy sputters. 
Since 1970, Canada has had a floating exchange rate, which means that the market, not the government, determines the currency's value. As long as the market prefers other currencies, Dr. Cooper said, Canada's currency will continue to deteriorate.
"There's no magic potion," she said, "that will turn the Canadian dollar around."

HEADLINE: Soviet Hotel In Moscow To Be Razed 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
A hulking glass, stone and concrete 1970 eyesore in the heart of Moscow, the Intourist Hotel, shut its doors for good today and awaits demolition, as the city prepares to remove a major Soviet-era wart from its skyline for the first time since the fall of Communism.
 The hotel, owned by the Moscow city government and situated half a block from the Kremlin at 3 Tverskaya Street, is 22 stories if you include the karaoke Chinese restaurant in the basement. The city says it wants a more glamorous, smaller building -- 12 stories are planned -- to better fit the otherwise elegant block, which includes a theater and another hotel, built in 1903. 
 The demolition is purely cosmetic, authorities say, and not related to security concerns raised worldwide after the terrorist attacks on the United States in September. Moscow is in talks with Hilton, the international hotel chain, over the management of the new hotel. 
As Russia's economy expands and state-owned stores and restaurants are gradually replaced by private enterprises, hotels like the Intourist have become relics of the past.
Built for foreign visitors, who by Soviet rules were required to stay in special locations under supervision, the hotel was a strange combination of East meets West as guests rubbed up against traders looking to make an illegal buck.
The 434-room hotel was erected in 1970, at the end of an unfortunate building streak that led to the bulldozing of sections of this city's historic downtown district. 
The hotel served many noted -- and notorious -- guests over the last three decades, including French and Russian astronauts. Aristotle Onassis, according to the Russian daily Izvestiya, was rebuffed by the Soviet government in an attempt to build his own hotel on the spot. 
After the fall of the Soviet Union, one of the most powerful crime figures in Moscow, Otari Kvantrishvili, rented an office in the hotel before he was assassinated in 1994. Two years ago, a bomb ripped through the top two floors in what authorities believe was part of a business dispute. And in a moment fondly remembered by many of the hotel's employees, a leading actress in a Mexican soap opera that was highly popular in the 1990's, called "The Rich Also Cry," came for a brief stay.
Today, a white piano, locked up and benchless, was the only thing that remained in the hotel's first-floor atrium, where guests used to sit and sip tea. Tables were stacked, chairs gone, and the central fountain no longer spouted. A woman worker removed lacquered Russian dolls from a glass cabinet nearby. 
Up on the fourth floor, 64-year-old Zoya Timoshina, the hotel's main cashier for all of its 31 years, was shuffling through papers in her small office, preparing for her departure. The hotel's closing leaves approximately 450 employees without jobs, according to its management.
"It's sad to leave, but it is time," she said, looking wistfully around her small office. "I came here as a young beauty, and now am going away as a grandmother. We earned good money. I had a driver, and a heater in my room. It's a good building. They have these in America."
The hotel's management opposes the demolition, which so far does not have an official starting date and will be done piece by piece with cranes instead of explosives. They say the hotel was profitable and could have been upgraded for much less than the $130 million the city expects is needed to rebuild completely. And compared with prices in the hundreds of dollars at the prestigious five-star hotels nearby, the National and Metropole, the Intourist was a bargain.
"We charged $50 a night for a room in the center of Moscow -- what do you want?" said Alexander Kolesnikov, deputy director of the hotel, responding to criticism that the building is unsightly. "Tourists loved this place. We had almost a 100 percent occupancy rate. Every epoch has its buildings. Why do we need to destroy this one? What about the McDonald's nearby -- does that fit?"

HEADLINE: Club Med Has First Loss in 4 Years and Closes 6 More Resorts 

BYLINE:  By KERRY SHAW 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Reflecting the plunge in international travel since Sept. 11, the resort operator Club Mediterranee said today that it would close six more of its locations and eliminate its dividend.
 The company reported a loss of 70 million euros ($62.5 million) for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, its first loss in four years and a sharp reversal of fortune from the previous year. 
 Club Med, which operates more than 100 "villages" on beaches and ski mountains around the world, cited the chilling effects of the Sept. 11 attacks on travel and the gathering recession in the United States for the company's weak results. 
"We are flying blind; it's not very comfortable," the chairman of Club Med, Philippe Bourguignon, told Reuters.
The company said in a statement today that its overall bookings were 19 percent lower in December than in the previous winter season and that travelers were making reservations much later than before. Bookings at a few villages gained from the trend, notably those at European ski resorts, where late bookings pushed overall business up 13.1 percent.
The company has not yet sorted out what the long-term effects will be. 
"It is clear that since Sept. 11, reservation habits have changed," the company said. "In these exceptional circumstances it would be unreasonable to give any forecasts."
Analysts said they had been expecting rocky results from Club Med and were not surprised by the figures. The company's stock fell 1.58 euros, or 3.4 percent, to 45.47 euros ($40.58) a share.
But the results nonetheless undermined Mr. Bourguignon's standing in the eyes of some analysts, who cited earlier promises of 10 percent annual profit growth that Mr. Bourguignon, who was brought in to turn the company around in 1997, backed away from last year.
The company said that much of its loss for the year was attributable to the costs of reacting to Sept. 11. Measures announced in October included reorganizing some villages, temporarily closing 24 of them, and shedding 154 jobs at the Paris headquarters.
Revenue rose 5.1 percent for the year, to 1.99 billion euros ($1.77 billion), but not enough to overcome the company's relatively high fixed costs. Unlike many competitors, Club Med owns and operates all its villages, and does not use local franchisees.
The six villages to be closed, scattered from Greece to New Caledonia, bring the total shut in the last year to 15, an 8 percent cut in capacity.
Five more villages, aimed at North American tourists, were shut for the winter season, and analysts expressed concern that the next summer season would also be weak.
Beyond its core business, the company lost 5.6 million euros ($5 million) on its Club Med World Paris retail and entertainment development, and said it would hold off for now on plans to develop similar complexes elsewhere.
But performance was strong at the Gymnase Club chain of French health clubs, which the company acquired a year ago, and at Oyyo, a young-adult-oriented club in Tunisia.

HEADLINE: Philharmonic Moves Into a New Era 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN and ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
With its chairman describing it as "an institution in transition," the New York Philharmonic yesterday announced a host of user-friendly changes for next season including a 7:30 p.m. curtain time, music lectures before performances three times a week and twice-weekly preconcert chamber music programs. The Philharmonic season, scheduled to start on Sept. 18, will be the first under its new director, Lorin Maazel. Mr. Maazel will conduct 11 of the orchestra's 34 subscription weeks.
 The choice of Mr. Maazel was viewed by several music critics as a staid one for the orchestra. As if partly in answer to this charge, the Philharmonic program announced yesterday included 19 works that were world premieres, New York premieres or are to have their first Philharmonic performances. The 10 that have not been played by the orchestra before, however, include established works like a Berlioz opera and a Prokofiev overture and shorter works by Krzysztof Penderecki and William Bolcom. 
 The 125 concerts to be played by the Philharmonic include music by 54 composers, of whom 34 were born or wrote their major works after 1900. While many of those composers are in the mainstream canon, the lineup also features less frequently performed works by Carl Nielsen, Witold Lutoslawski, Charles Ives and Edgard Varese.
"I would say right now this is an institution in transition," Paul B. Guenther, chairman of the Philharmonic, said in an interview after a news conference announcing the season's offerings. Mr. Guenther mentioned the orchestra's educational programs and its parks concerts, neither of which is new, and collaborations with Jazz at Lincoln Center -- the most recent being "Nutcracker Swing," as evidence that Zarin Mehta, the Philharmonic's executive director, has been "wonderful about broadening audience participation." 
Although some critics have suggested that the Philharmonic's repertory should be more adventuresome, Mr. Maazel said he did not believe in doing new work just because it was new. "I don't think playing new work or premieres for the sake of doing so is the name of the game," he said.
"I'm careful to ask all the guest conductors not to perform anything they don't believe in," he added. "We ask them to suggest contemporary music in which they believe."
Similarly, Mr. Guenther said that the orchestra had to strike a balance between testing new waters and hewing to tradition. "It's easy to say we should have people in jeans like they do up at the Miller Theater," he said, referring to the stage at Columbia University. 
"Do you want to have an orchestra in New York City? You've got to maintain the financial integrity of the organization," Mr. Guenther continued. "That doesn't mean you prostitute yourself. But you have to have a cross section to satisfy the city."
According to the master plan for the ambitious $1.2 billion redevelopment of Lincoln Center, the Philharmonic's home, Avery Fisher Hall, has several hundred empty seats at most of its performances -- 61 percent of its productions have fewer than 2,400 seats filled in the 2,738-capacity theater. 
The master plan raises the possibility of eliminating 338 of the hall's seats, to reduce the capacity to 2,400.
Mr. Mehta disputed the master plan's attendance figures yesterday, saying that, with the exception of the weeks immediately after Sept. 11, the orchestra has for the last 10 years sold 88 to 90 percent of its tickets for each performance. "We just have to fight to keep it there," he said. "That's what the problem is." Mr. Guenther said the orchestra was "very stable," that contributions were coming in as scheduled and that there were no plans to cut back despite a tough economic climate for the city's cultural institutions. 
One pressing question concerning the redevelopment -- which calls for spending $325.8 million on Avery Fisher Hall -- is whether the stage should be renovated or razed and rebuilt. While Mr. Maazel would not say which option he favored -- and that the outcome depended on a cost analysis by officials other than himself -- he acknowledged yesterday that the hall is inadequate. "They used to say there are no bad acoustics, just bad conductors," he said. "Having said that, there are limits. And rather than struggle all the time, you are dealing with a hall that is just not up to snuff."
Mr. Maazel added that he was one of the first to conduct at Avery Fisher Hall; the piece was "La Marseillaise," the French national anthem. "I heard it twice," Mr. Maazel said to laughter. "Things were pretty bad. We've come a long way since then."
The Philharmonic has made adjustments to its hall's acoustics since Mr. Maazel's maiden voyage, but many musicians and critics are still dissatisfied with the results.
While Mr. Guenther said Mr. Maazel was not a custodial appointment -- holding his position until the orchestra finds another, long-term maestro -- Mr. Maazel, who is 71, has signed on only through the 2006 season. "If his commitment is for four years," Mr. Guenther said, "we can begin to think about who should be Lorin Maazel's successor."
The season's first world premiere, the details of which have not been announced, is to be performed with Beethoven's Ninth during the first subscription week (Sept. 18-24). The Philharmonic is offering the program as a memorial to the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Corporate America's News Is Mixed, and So Are Shares

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Divergent signals on the state of business left investors cautious and prices mixed on Wall Street yesterday. 
 Optimistic comments from Microsoft and Tiffany encouraged the market, but disappointing statements from Gateway, Ciena and AOL Time Warner limited stocks' ability to advance. 
 Blue chips were weaker, falling back moderately after weeks of rallying, but technology shares managed modest gains. 
 As companies begin releasing fourth-quarter sales and earnings and some warn of weaker results, analysts expect a retreat, with investors cashing in profits from recent rallies.
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 46.50 points, or 0.5 percent, at 10,150.55, after falling 62.69 points Monday to halt a three-session 238-point winning streak.
 "We have earnings season upon us, and you are seeing some profit taking," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst for Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, Ky. "But I don't think it is anything serious. The Dow hasn't shown any conviction on the downside," The Dow's decline yesterday was smaller than the 175 points it has gained so far in 2002. Additionally, the Dow has risen nearly 24 percent from its low after the Sept. 11 attacks.
 The broader market was mixed yesterday. The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.64 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,055.74, but the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,160.71.
 Investors sold off the stocks of companies that reminded the market how tough business still was. Gateway slid 25 percent, down $2.56 at $7.69, on a fourth-quarter revenue warning.
 Ciena fell $1.05, or 6 percent, to $15.70, after the chief executive, Gary Smith, was quoted by the Dow Jones News Service saying that the company, along with other telecommunications equipment makers, will not rebound in the first quarter.
 "There is no clear sign of recovery," Mr. Smith said at a Salomon Smith Barney conference in Scottsdale, Ariz.
 AOL Time Warner, which reduced its 2002 earnings forecast on Monday, stumbled 68 cents, or 2 percent, to $32.
 While investors' increasing confidence in a healthier economy this year has bolstered stocks, analysts say the market's upside will be limited until there are concrete signs of a turnaround. 
 "Things are definitely looking better. But people are getting very excited, very quickly, and that's when things can pull back," said Gary Kaltbaum, market technician for Investors' Edge Partners.
 Still, positive news from several companies led to some buying. Tiffany climbed $1.95, or 6 percent, to $34.84, after saying its fourth-quarter earnings will be at the high end of previous estimates.
 Optimistic comments from the Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, helped the technology sector shake off the disappointments from Gateway and Ciena. In a keynote speech late on Monday at the International Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas, Mr. Gates said that Microsoft sold 1.5 million Xbox units during the holiday season and that it was the most successful game console introduction ever. Microsoft expects to sell six million consoles by the end of 2002.
 Microsoft rose 82 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $69.38, and its strength spread to other technology bellwethers. I.B.M. gained 65 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $124.70, and Intel rose 31 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $35.58.

Failed Rebel's Boast: At Least He Rules the Street

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad 

 BODY:
Older and seemingly unrepentant, Yasin Abu Bakr, the spiritual leader of the Jamaat al-Muslimeen, has endured, even if its infamous attempt to remake Trinidad did not. 
 In 1990, Mr. Abu Bakr, now 60, and several dozen followers, angered over delays in resolving a land dispute with the government, staged a coup. For six days the radical Black Muslim group held the Parliament hostage and controlled a television station while 26 people died in the ensuing violence. 
 Although he surrendered after being promised amnesty and releasing his hostages, Mr. Abu Bakr and his supporters were arrested, tried and sentenced to death. But in a turn of events that some saw as bordering on theater of the absurd, they were set free after two years in prison when courts ruled that the government had reneged on its promise of immunity.
"Everything happens by the will of God, so if God had willed it not to happen, it would not have happened," Mr. Abu Bakr said of the coup attempt in a recent interview. "But what we can do is reflect on the past, and see how it can help to guide you in the future." 
The fact that his office wall featured -- among other items -- a bumper sticker that read "The Best Is Yet to Come" not too far from an organizational chart of Trinidad's government might still cause some to question his plans. 
Even today, whispers of terrorist links and drug dealing swirl about the Jamaat al-Muslimeen, or Society of Muslims, and government officials say they keep close tabs on it and advise foreign governments when Mr. Abu Bakr travels overseas.
But Mr. Abu Bakr, a former policeman, insisted that today he is interested only in providing spiritual care to thousands of poor and disaffected black Trinidadians who converted to Islam. Although 6 percent of the country is Muslim, a majority are of East Indian descent and do not relate culturally or politically to the Jamaat. 
As he spoke of the moral decline of politics, aides politely interrupted him at times to ask his advice on things like what kind of joiners should be used for a construction job or how long the cement should set for a schoolhouse being built by his group.
"These are not the hands of a cloth priest," Mr. Abu Bakr admitted as he extended his hands to reveal scarred palms and fingers. 
Earlier this year there was speculation over another possible coup when United States authorities arrested a man they said was linked to the Jamaat after he tried to buy assault rifles and automatic pistols in Florida. 
In October, Basdeo Panday, the prime minister at the time, lambasted the group when he said one of its members had called on able-bodied men to fight for Islam in Afghanistan. 
Privately, however, officials of the ruling United National Congress discounted the group's threat. "They are a bogeyman," said one high-ranking party official. "Panday brings them out to scare the children."
Mr. Abu Bakr, who denounced the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, said the people quoted by the prime minister or arrested by American authorities were no longer associated with his group.
He added that he refused to attend an anti-American rally sponsored by one of them and insisted that he had no designs on political power or terrorist action. "How come nothing has happened to us?" he said. "How come I am not in jail?" 
Ever since they were released from prison and won close to $1 million from the government for wrongful destruction and occupation of their property, Mr. Abu Bakr and his adherents have planned to rebuild. But traces of past conflicts are scattered around the Jamaat's campus. 
For now, they have raised money by building and selling private homes, while building a two-story girls' school near the mosque. They also receive medical supplies from an Islamic charity based in Libya. The group's leaders said they now focused on providing counseling, health care and meals to the community. 
Although the group claims more than 10,000 members, others say the true number is about half that. The group's leaders say they still attract many youths who feel shunned by society. 
"I think that young people are fed up by the system as it exists," Mr. Abu Bakr said. 
One young member said he came to the group after he was stabbed at a party. Another said he grew tired of hanging out in bars and clubs. Others adopted the group after their parents left them to fend for themselves.
Mr. Abu Bakr said his ability to relate to some hard-bitten toughs in some neighborhoods helped his group broker the peace last month between warring gangs whose battles had claimed 37 lives. 
"We do what the government cannot," he said. "We rule the street."
But such closeness to the street, analysts and diplomats said, can come with an unpleasant price. There is widespread suspicion that members of his group have been involved with drug dealing or have hired themselves out as enforcers to collect bad debts. 
One diplomat said the group might no longer be as monolithic as it once appeared. He said that younger members felt that Mr. Abu Bakr was no longer the firebrand he once was and that he would rather tend to his family and business interests.
Maybe that was why the biggest splash Mr. Abu Bakr made in recent months was not about politics or international intrigue, but when he married his fourth wife. Still, there was a sort of international air to it.
"I have one wife who is mixed, an African wife, an Indian wife and one who is another mixture of Chinese and Indian," he said. "I now have the whole United Nations in my family."

HEADLINE: Old Rules Gone, Argentines Brace for the Unknown 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
For more than a decade, Juan Carlos Meluso and his wife, Silvia Cataldo, awoke each morning knowing that one Argentine peso was worth one American dollar. Although the system was far from perfect, at least the rules were clear. 
 But when banks resume normal activities here Wednesday, after operating under emergency restrictions since before Christmas because of an economic crisis, the Melusos and millions of other middle-class Argentines will confront a brand new, uncertain world. After the peso was devalued by nearly 30 percent Sunday night, fears of a burst of inflation are growing, basic goods are in short supply and the economy remains prostrate. 
 "Nobody has the slightest idea what happens next or how things are actually going to function," Ms. Cataldo said. "It has taken us 10 years to get into this mess, and my biggest fear is that it will take us another 10 years to get out because this new system turns out not to work either."
When it was introduced early in 1991, the policy of pegging the peso to the dollar brought economic stability to Argentina by halting runaway inflation. But in recent years it had increasingly become a straitjacket, crimping economic activity by making imported foreign goods artificially cheap and driving Argentine businesses into ruin.
The Melusos said that back when they and the country were doing well, they earned as much as $2,500 a month between them. But since Argentina entered a recession nearly four years ago, that amount has fallen by more than half. Mr. Meluso, 57, once owned a construction supply business that he inherited from his family, but he had to sell it. Then he hauled all kinds of freight until the recession led to such a dropoff in business that he "couldn't even pay for the maintenance on my truck."
Ms. Cataldo, 45, worked for many years as a podiatrist "with a steady clientele that I worked very hard to build up." But as the recession deepened, people sacrificed what they considered luxuries. Her practice collapsed. "With the crisis, nobody wants to cut their nails, they only want to cut their costs," she said."The only time that people ever came to see me was when they could no longer walk." She has turned to making lamps at home and selling them at barter fairs around the city.
It is little consolation to the Melusos that other people they know are facing similar difficulties. One next-door neighbor who used to have a small plant that manufactured motors for washing machines has gone bankrupt, while the other has moved his leather goods business from a factory into his house because demand has fallen so much.
"The whole country depends on small businesses and commerce being healthy, not just me," Mr. Meluso said. "The president has said that he is going to support producers, but in all the changes that have been announced, I haven't yet heard anyone explain how they are going to get those sectors back on their feet so that people like me can begin to work again."
For younger couples, the situation is even more daunting. Leonardo Coll, a 36-year-old plumber, and Veronica Dimant, a 34-year-old mathematics professor, have been living together for three years in an apartment that is a family inheritance. They worry that prospects will not improve for a long time. "We'd like to have children someday, but it seems foolhardy to do that in the middle of a crisis as serious as this," Ms. Dimant said. "It's hard enough to support the two of us right now, let alone three."
Both Mr. Coll and Ms. Dimant became adults at a time of four-digit annual inflation. So when inflation dropped to less than 10 percent a year after the one dollar, one peso formula was instituted, they were impressed. The first years under that policy also brought other benefits, they recalled.
"We saw a lot of imported goods coming into the country that we had never seen before," Mr. Coll said. "And a lot of people who couldn't afford to buy on credit during the inflation of the 1980's were able to buy appliances."
But with the recession, Mr. Coll found himself competing with other plumbers, "who were always willing to do the job for cheaper than the next guy," and Ms. Dimant grappled with cuts in the education budget. The final blow came last month when, fearing the flight of money abroad, the government imposed a $250-a-week limit on cash withdrawals from bank accounts.
"My phone hasn't rung since, and I don't think it will until people can have access to their money again," Mr. Coll said. "They have got to lift those restrictions if they want to get the economy going again, but there is no sign they are going to do that."
To ease the devaluation's impact on the middle class, the government has ordered that all bank debts up to $100,000 be converted from dollars into pesos. But Mr. Meluso, who is still paying for his 1999 Renault, said that his financial situation was so bad that he would not benefit from the measure.
"It doesn't make a bit of difference whether my car loan is 350 dollars or 350 pesos a month," he said. "No matter how you calculate it, I can't afford to pay back what I owe and am going to have to sell that car."
The Melusos already own their home, and their two children, Federico and Florencia, have jobs and are able to support themselves. But the Melusos have been unable to pay their property taxes and have received letters from the municipal government threatening repossession if they fall further behind.
Ms. Dimant, meanwhile, has spent much of her summer vacation standing in line outside the bank holding her life's savings, along with thousands of other frustrated depositors.
"Nobody can save any money in a situation like this," she said. "I just want to get back the dollars that belong to me. Maybe I should stick them under the mattress, which still looks like the safest place for them in this ghastly situation."

HEADLINE: Surge in Bias Cases Punishes Insurers, And Premiums Rise 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Many companies, alarmed by the increasing size of payouts to resolve harassment or discrimination claims by employees, have bought insurance policies over the last decade to protect themselves.
 But insurers, who offered cheap premiums and low deductibles to encourage this new line of business, now find that they underestimated the number of small awards that companies make every year and did not anticipate the growing size of jury verdicts, one-fifth of which are now for $1 million or more. 
 Most are jacking up their rates -- some doubling or tripling them -- while a few have quit the business entirely.
"We are not making money on this coverage line and have not been for some time," said Michael J. Maloney, an executive with Chubb, one of the largest providers of what is called employment practices liability insurance, which covers bias, harassment and similar claims brought by employees. "If carriers don't change the behavior of the last few years, it won't be a viable product for the future." 
While it is difficult to generalize about just how much of an increase in prices companies should expect, premiums could double or triple at some large companies that already pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, Mr. Maloney said.
The problem can be traced to an abundance of cheap coverage when the market developed in the early 1990's, according to insurance industry analysts and consultants who specialize in helping companies address problems like sexual harassment. The premiums and deductibles were so low that some corporations thought that they did not have to take potential harassment or discrimination problems seriously, analysts and consultants said.
The companies that bought insurance were able to treat discrimination as "just a cost of doing business," said Freada Klein, a workplace-bias consultant in Cambridge, Mass. They viewed complaints of bias or harassment as outside their control, like a flood or other natural disaster, she said, rather than as something they could address.
With insurance becoming more costly and insurers more careful about which companies they cover, companies will probably have to start thinking hard about what steps they can take to reduce the likelihood of being sued. "There will probably be more attention paid over time," said Phil Norton, an executive with Arthur J. Gallagher & Company, an insurance broker in Itasca, Ill.
When it was introduced a decade ago, employment practices liability insurance seemed like the perfect response to changes in federal law that increased the risks for employers. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which, among other things, gave employees who sued for discrimination the right to demand a jury trial and to seek punitive damages.
Worried about the possibility of multimillion-dollar judgments, many companies sought coverage, although the policies typically do not cover punitive damages. In the last decade, insurers regularly tapped into that fear with aggressive sales pitches pegged to large settlements or jury verdicts in sexual harassment or discrimination cases, as when a jury in Ohio returned a $31 million verdict against Olsten Health Services for age discrimination in 2000 or CBS settled a sex-discrimination lawsuit for $8 million in that same year.
Roughly 30 percent of the companies surveyed in 1999 by the Society for Human Resource Management and Jackson Lewis, a law firm specializing in employment issues, had some sort of employment practices liability coverage.
Companies typically decline to discuss what insurance they have. They worry that acknowledging that they have insurance will either make them targets for suits or leave people with the impression that they have a systemic problem. But most of the very largest companies in the United States have some sort of insurance, according to Mr. Norton of Arthur J. Gallagher.
One large company decided to purchase a policy for the first time in recent weeks, according to Mr. Norton, even though the premiums were 50 percent higher than the ones quoted a year ago.
Some of the higher premiums are inevitable as insurers come to grips with their experience in offering coverage. Insurance companies were eager to offer inexpensive policies as a way to build their business in this new market, and they significantly underestimated their costs. "It was easy to see, as an observer, that they were underpricing," said David Sterling, an insurance broker in Woodbury, N.J.
In addition, many insurers were all too happy to cover companies without paying too much attention to whether the companies were at significant risk for lawsuits. "Controlling risk is very difficult," said Jeffrey M. Tanenbaum, a lawyer with Littler Mendelson, a firm that specializes in employment issues. But insurers, he said, "have done a horrendously bad job at risk."
Despite the greater attention that companies are paying to issues like discrimination and harassment, the costs associated with these complaints have continued to increase. As the number of claims made each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has remained steady at roughly 80,000, the awards made in settlements and mediation have increased by nearly two-thirds in the last few years, to nearly $250 million for the fiscal year that ended last September.
Jury awards for employment practices, including wrongful termination, have also increased sharply, according to Jury Verdict Research in Horsham, Pa. The median award rose to $218,000 in 2000 from $151,000 in 1999, and a fifth of all verdicts now top $1 million.
Layoffs caused by the economic downturn are likely to make employers even more vulnerable to lawsuits. "In bad economic times, we see more litigation," Mr. Tanenbaum said.
This flood of litigation has proved too costly for insurers. "Insurance companies cannot afford to underwrite this any more," said Wanda Dobrich, a psychologist with D&D Industrial Consultants in Montclair, N.J. D&D works with companies to educate employees about harassment and discrimination issues.
The problem is not so much the multimillion-dollar awards, although they can be expensive, but the sheer number of relatively small complaints, settlements or awards for tens of thousands each. These smaller amounts quickly add up to significant sums when deductibles are set too low. "You have the death by a thousand cuts," explained Mark Larsen, a consultant at Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, which advises companies on insurance and risk management.
As the overall industry has taken a turn for the worse, especially after Sept. 11, insurers are now raising prices as much as they can. With returns from their investments lower than in previous years and the wholesale insurance companies that typically help share the risk increasingly wary, retail insurers are doing what they can both to minimize their own risks and improve profits.
The problem, according to Mr. Norton of Arthur J. Gallagher, was that the combination of low deductibles and low premiums was a recipe for losses. A small company, for example, might pay just $12,000 for $1 million in coverage with a $5,000 deductible. But that company might easily rack up some $25,000 in claims in a single year, as would many others insured by the same carrier.
"It doesn't work," Mr. Norton said. Today, he added, the insurer is likely to charge the same small company $20,000 for coverage with a $25,000 deductible.
Insurers are likely to put into place even more increases, according to Mr. Norton. "You're going to see insurance carriers continue to wake up and realize that they are losing this money," he said.
What kind of overall increases companies may see is difficult to estimate because pricing depends on many factors. But many insurers are planning to raise premiums about 25 percent in 2002, after double-digit increases in the previous two years, according to Richard S. Betterley, the president of Betterley Risk Consultants in Sterling, Mass., which recently surveyed carriers. "It's now getting into real money," he said.
Employers will also have to absorb much more of the risk by paying significantly higher deductibles, Mr. Betterley added. Some insurers are also decreasing the amount of overall coverage they will offer. While some still say they will offer as much as $50 million in coverage, they may insure companies for only $10 million, he said.
Some insurers have even dropped out of the market. Alistar, a small insurer in California, is no longer writing new policies. General Electric's Employers Reinsurance, which said it was never a significant player in the industry, stopped writing new stand-alone policies in 1999.
What, if any, steps could be taken to prevent lawsuits is debated. Some defense lawyers and insurance brokers argue that companies can do little to prevent claims from unhappy employees. But many companies simply fail to put into practice common-sense policies that would improve their workplaces, according to consultants who work with companies to develop better procedures. The consultants argue that many companies have not addressed brewing problems in their workplaces because they have not had to do so.
While insurers and others have offered services to help companies address any problems they may have, companies have been reluctant to take advantage of this help. "All of the carriers, Chubb included, have come out with loss-prevention products," Mr. Maloney said, but the response has not been overwhelming.
While executives may address issues like the risk of having an executive embezzle money, many of them pay little attention to claims related to how employees are treated. "It's just not on the radar screen until it hits the lawsuit stage," said Robert Wellman, director of risk management for Risk International Services, a consulting firm in Houston.
But he predicts that such approaches will change as companies realize that they need to reduce their risks of being sued. "It's going to get there," Mr. Wellman said.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders and Consumer Borrowing Both Increase 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Factory orders excluding military aircraft and other equipment rose in November for the second consecutive month, the first back-to-back increase in a year, the government reported today.
 A separate report from the Federal Reserve showed that consumer borrowing rose more in November than at any time in almost six decades as shoppers took advantage of incentives from automakers to buy cars with interest-free loans. 
 The 0.8 percent increase in factory orders came after a 2.9 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department said. A record decline in military aircraft bookings, which vary from month to month, helped push down the value of all factory orders by 3.3 percent, to $321.7 billion, after a 7 percent increase in October. 
The report mirrors the latest surveys on manufacturing from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Institute for Supply Management, and it supports comments by Fed officials that the economy is showing signs of recovering from the first recession in a decade.
"I think we are in fact building a foundation for a recovery," Anthony M. Santomero, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said today. Recent statistics "indicate we are starting to see a better tone in the manufacturing world," he added.
Orders increased in November for computers, semiconductors and autos. Combined with a 10th consecutive decline in factory inventories, the report suggests increased production in coming months.
The Fed report showed that consumer debt increased $19.8 billion in November, or a 14.6 percent annual rate. That comes after a revised $11.2 billion increase in October, or a rate of 8.3 percent.
Low borrowing costs are helping underpin consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy. Nonrevolving credit, including auto loans, surged in November.
"Car sales were pretty strong, and most folks feel that there's going to be a recovery in the economy real soon," Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said before the report.
Even with a December unemployment rate at a six-and-a-half-year high of 5.8 percent, incentives are enticing buyers. Nonrevolving loans increased $14.4 billion in November after rising $14.7 billion in October.
The consumer credit report does not include loans like mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Refinancing surged to a record in November, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. That may have encouraged consumers to take on more debt for other purchases, like cars.
Credit card and other revolving debt rose $5.4 billion in November after falling $3.5 billion in October.
Still, since increasing at a 10.3 percent rate in the first quarter, borrowing has cooled. Consumer credit grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter after increasing at a 4.6 percent pace in the previous three months.

HEADLINE: Rates Remain High. Blame Bush Budget Or Big Expectations? 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Do budget deficits matter to the economy?
 Senator Tom Daschle, the highest-ranking Democrat in Washington, certainly thinks so. Last week, he blamed the Bush administration's fiscal policies for hampering an economic recovery. "The rapidly disappearing surplus is a key reason long-term interest rates have barely budged," Senator Daschle said. 
 But the economic evidence is not so clear. Though most economists agree that lower long-term rates would open the door to a new expansion, they do not all share the view that the government's worsening finances stopped rates from falling.
"There is just no evidence whatsoever that budget deficits by themselves have any influence on long-term rates," said John H. Cochrane, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. Professor Cochrane said that forecasts for an economic recovery played a much greater role in keeping rates high.
Peter Orszag, an economist at the Brookings Institution, disagrees. "The fact that long-term rates have not tracked the decline in short-term rates is consistent with the decline in the budget outlook," he said. He cited a range of models, including those used by the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office, that suggest that the Bush administration's budget changes will probably keep long-term interest rates a half to a whole percentage point higher than they would be without those changes.
Yet on Wall Street or in the ivory tower, Mr. Orszag might find himself in the minority. Though not all economists rule out the influence of the federal budget, most give it at best secondary importance.
For those who believe that the swing of the federal budget back into deficit explains why long-term rates have remained high despite cuts in short-term rates, the explanation goes as follows: because of new tax cuts and unanticipated spending, the Treasury Department will have to cancel plans to buy back hundreds of billions of dollars in debt to make up for the lost surpluses. To sell the extra debt to investors, supply-and-demand requires an extra reward -- higher interest rates.
Forecasts of the government's debts certainly have grown. Between May and August, the Congressional Budget Office lowered its estimates for federal surpluses over the next decade by almost $1.8 trillion, or about one-third, solely on account of legislative changes, mostly tax cuts. Economic and technical changes pulled down the surplus estimates by $461 billion more. And that was all before Sept. 11. Since then, Congress and the White House have circulated plans for hundreds of billions in new spending and tax cuts.
But Professor Cochrane was not impressed. "The kind of deficits we're talking about are just puny by international standards," he said. "The No. 1 thing you think about with long-term rates is inflation. If people think inflation's coming, then long-term rates go up."
His argument relies on forecasts about the economy. The sooner a recovery is expected, he explained, the sooner the Fed is likely to start pushing up interest rates to keep inflation under control. If it starts raising short-term rates, businesses will have little incentive to keep rolling over short-term debt rather than borrowing for the long term. For investors to be willing to hold more long-term debt, long-term interest rates would have to rise.
Alan Auerbach, director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California at Berkeley, echoed that argument. The recent increase in long-term rates "has got to be attributed to the fact that there's more confidence in the recovery," he said. But the overall balance between the two, he added, is "more a matter of debate and religion at this point than hard evidence."
"There may be some background movement associated with the budget," he said, but "all the discussion of the Clinton period on salutary effects of deficit reduction -- it's just that, a discussion."
Giving the federal budget a smaller role also makes sense to James Goldberg, chief economist at Trust Company of the West in Los Angeles. "It's more expectations of recovery than the government's fiscal policy, although that is not a big plus," he said. "The change in the fiscal situation is just a little icing on the cake." 
At Credit Suisse First Boston's bond trading desks, each of the two theories garnered some credence. "Both are large issues in our market," said Brian Edmonds, co-head of treasury trading at the company.
He cited a big change in expectations about the scope of the government's indebtedness. Not long ago, many experts expected the debt to shrink to nothing. But the situation has turned around. Mr. Edmonds noted that the government issued $23 billion in two-year notes in December, up from only $10 billion in April.
He added, though, that these days, bond traders thinking about higher rates concentrate more on the prospects for an economic turnaround. "The real risk to the market, given where interest rates are right now," he said, "is that we see a much more robust recovery."
The two theories could also interact. "The recovery play itself rather takes away any big Treasury issuance scare," said John Ryding, chief market economist at Bear Stearns. A strong recovery, he reasoned, would generate enough tax revenue to remove the threat of more federal debt. "I don't think the fiscal picture is going to be a big issue," he said.
Mr. Ryding also doubted that the Fed would act quickly to tighten the supply of credit. "I think that the bond market is prematurely pricing in interest rate increases," he said. "I suspect that both short- and long-term interest rates will decline by the middle of this year."

HEADLINE: Europe Plan Would Give Bumped Fliers More Money 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
To the expected relief of bedraggled fliers, the European Commission has proposed a law to make airlines pay at least the equivalent of about $670 to every passenger bumped from a European flight.
 Few expect the measure to become law anytime soon. But the airlines moved quickly to protest the proposal as excessively harsh and menacing to a system of controlled overbooking that they say makes the reservation system flexible and helps bring down their fares. 
 The proposal was prompted in part by incidents like one last year in Madrid on the first day of Spanish schoolchildren's Easter holidays, when more than 300 passengers, including families with youngsters, were bumped off overbooked flights. 
Sensitive to such treatment of passengers, European airlines agreed last May to a kind of passenger bill of rights, similar to one adopted by American carriers in 1999, to stave off legislative action by the European Commission.
Among the airlines' commitments, which are to be enacted in mid-February, is a policy to reward passengers who give up a reservation on an overbooked flight.
So on Monday, the airlines were surprised when the commission's highest transport official, Loyola de Palacio, who happens to be from Spain, proposed a law to make the airlines pay 750 euros, about $670, to every passenger bumped from a flight of fewer than 2,100 miles, and to double the amount for passengers bumped from longer flights.
By contrast, current regulations in force since 1991 require that the airlines pay 150 euros for the shorter flights, and 300 euros for those longer than 2,100 miles.
"The overbooking situation has worsened," said Gilles Gantelet, the spokesman for Ms. de Palacio in Brussels. In 1999, he said, more than 250,000 passengers in Europe were bumped from overbooked flights. And while that represented only a little more than one-tenth of 1 percent of total passengers, he said, "there is no one who does not know someone who has been a victim."
The proposed law, he said, would also require the airlines, as American airlines do, to offer to pay volunteers 100 euros to take a later flight. 
The airlines, as expected, immediately cried foul.
"Unfriendly and untimely," was how Karl-Heinz Neumeister, secretary general of the European Airlines Association in Brussels, described the proposal. Untimely, above all, because European carriers are already suffering from a sharp falloff in air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Moreover, he said, the association's passenger bill of rights, which will take effect next month, already contains an American-style proposal for a call for volunteers.
While few expect the proposal ever to become law, Mr. Neumeister said that if it did, it would mean that airlines would indeed have to stop overbooking.
In effect, the proposal is part of a struggle between the airlines and Ms. de Palacio, who came into office seeking to offset what she saw as an imbalance between benefits provided the airlines, like deregulation, and those for passengers.
Spurred by a swelling wave of passenger complaints, Ms. de Palacio began proposing new rules about two years ago that would require airlines to provide services like telling passengers which airline's plane they would be on if a flight was shared by more than one airline, and assuring free phone calls, meals and accommodations to passengers bumped off accidentally overbooked flights. At that time, she also proposed abolishing intentional overbooking.
"An airline ticket is a contract, and as in every contract, there are two parties," Mr. Gantelet said.
Mr. Neumeister said the airlines had argued that overbooking, "if done properly and responsibly, is good for the airlines, good for the economy, and good for low fares." Ms. de Palacio then withdrew the proposal.
Mr. Gantelet rejected the argument, put forth by the airlines, that passengers would opt for the larger statutory payments, saying that many passengers, including most business travelers, who had meetings to attend or appointments to be kept, would not volunteer for later flights.
Mr. Gantelet said that in any case the proposed legislation would require approval by the European Parliament as well as the Commission, the executive arm of the 15-nation European Community, before it would take effect. Such a procedure, he said, would mean the law could not be in effect before 2003 at the earliest.
If the airlines included a satisfactory compensation scheme for bumped passengers in their voluntary code of passenger rights, then the Commission would drop its proposal for legislation, he said.

PERSON: Gustav Rau 

HEADLINE: Gustav Rau, 79, Art Collector And Benefactor of Children 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
The art collector and philanthropist Gustav Rau, who amassed one of the world's major private art collections, died in Stuttgart last Thursday. He was 79.
 He died suddenly in a hospital, his Zurich lawyer, Dietrich Stettler, said. He had been recovering from pneumonia contracted a few months ago; no official cause of death was listed. 
 While working as a medical doctor in Africa, Dr. Rau regularly slipped away to Europe and the United States to indulge his passion for works by the old masters. Using the wealth he inherited from his family, who made money in auto accessories in Stuttgart, Dr. Rau bought hundreds of paintings and sculptures from five centuries, including works by Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet and Paul Cezanne.
Mr. Stettler represented Dr. Rau in his fight with former employees for control of the $600 million collection, which had been stored in a duty-free zone at Zurich airport. Dr. Rau, who never married or had children, willed the collection to the German branch of Unicef. The collection is second only in size to the Thyssen-Bronemisza collection in Madrid, his foundation said.
Dr. Rau "perhaps had a kind of naive attitude," Mr. Stettler said. "He didn't want to be a celebrity. He wanted to concentrate on carrying off his plans" for an investment that would significantly benefit children in the developing world, he added.
Although he prided himself on selecting and personally bidding on each piece, Dr. Rau parted company with most collectors and declined to surround himself with his choices. He had favorites, especially Jean Honore Fragonard's "Portrait of the Duke of Harcourt," but he did not hang art on his own walls. Instead, it was warehoused or on tour.
Dr. Rau, who used a wheelchair, made infrequent public appearances and refused most interviews. In recent months, he agreed to answer questions for The New York Times about his collection, explaining that he decided to invest his wealth in art because he was "wary of traditional investments" after seeing first-hand the economic turmoil in pre-World War II Germany.
He was drafted into the Nazi Wehrmacht at 19 but quickly deserted. At 40 he earned a medical degree, then sold the family business and moved to Africa. He worked first in Nigeria, then in the former Zaire, where he founded a hospital.
His return to Europe in 1997 set off a legal battle, mostly in Switzerland, over his art works. He medicated himself to offset the effects of a stroke and was found wandering the streets, disoriented, near his Monaco apartment. A guardianship ensued, and only after a series of rulings was his control restored last autumn over what he saw as his life's work.
Most of the paintings have already been moved to Germany, where they will be sold gradually to provide funds for vaccines, medical care and clean drinking water for children in the developing world, the German branch of Unicef announced.

HEADLINE: As the Governors Turn, Praise and Bipartisanship 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Using his brief stint in the governor's office to praise his party's legacy, John O. Bennett, the State Senate president, was sworn in as acting governor this afternoon, and one hour later delivered a State of the State address proclaiming that a decade of Republican rule had left New Jersey a stronger and more prosperous place. 
 Mr. Bennett, who will serve as acting governor for only 84 hours, used his unusual moment in the spotlight to laud the record of Republicans who seized control of the Legislature during a tax revolt 10 years ago, but who lost their majorities during last November's elections. 
 He also noted the accomplishments of Christie Whitman, whose second term officially ends on Monday. Mrs. Whitman, who was elected in 1993 and left office to join the Bush administration last January, led state officials to cut taxes repeatedly during her tenure and also invested in rebuilding New Jersey's crumbling public schools and preserving one million acres of open space, Mr. Bennett said. 
"Christine Todd Whitman often said that we should strive to make New Jersey a better place in which to work, live and raise a family," Mr. Bennett said. "Thanks to her and the direction she set, New Jersey is that better place." 
Mr. Bennett's speech was part of a whirlwind week in the state capitol, where one legislative session will end, a new Legislature will be sworn in and four people will serve as governor over eight days. New Jersey has no lieutenant governor, and a quirk of the State Constitution allows the Senate president to complete the unfinished term of any governor. When Mrs. Whitman left to become administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco assumed the role of acting governor. 
But Mr. DiFrancesco dropped out of the governor's race and did not seek re-election to the Senate, so when his legislative term ended at 11:59 a.m. today, the role of acting governor was passed on to the incoming Senate president. To further complicate matters, last November's elections left the State Senate deadlocked at 20-20, so Mr. Bennett will share the title of Senate president with Richard J. Codey, a Democrat, and each man will serve as acting governor for half the week. James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, is scheduled to be sworn in on Monday to begin a four-year term.
Acknowledging the Republicans' diminished role in the new political landscape, Mr. Bennett also sounded a decidedly bipartisan tone through much of his address. He praised Mr. Codey and Mr. McGreevey, saying he was eager to work with Democrats to cut property taxes, strengthen antiterrorism efforts and improve education. 
But the very fact that Mr. Bennett delivered the address was a sign of the disarray of New Jersey Republicans in the post-Whitman era. Mr. DiFrancesco, who spent the last year in the dual role of senate president and acting governor, had asked to deliver the State of the State address as a kind of valedictory address. Mr. Bennett refused, to the dismay of many Republicans, but he included several complimentary references to Mr. DiFrancesco, calling him "my dear friend and predecessor." 
However awkward their send-off, Republicans said that they reduced taxes while trying to preserve open space and rebuild the schools. Like other states, New Jersey also saw impressive growth during the Whitman administration and cut its welfare roles. Still, analysts disagree whether those improvements were a result of state policies or the robust national economic boom of the 1990's. In keeping with their reputation as social moderates, New Jersey Republicans enacted relatively few restrictions on abortion rights, but pushed for tougher sentences against criminals, such as Megan's Law, which requires that residents be notified when a paroled sex offender moves to their neighborhood. 
"It's a respectable record," said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University. "When we look at education areas, like school construction, they were forced to take actions by the courts, so I don't think they'll ever get much credit for what they've done." 
Since his election, Mr. McGreevey has warned that the state faces a serious budget deficit. Less than an hour after the State of the State address ended today, as Mr. Bennett basked in the congratulations from his colleagues, friends and family, Mr. McGreevey released a terse letter urging both of this week's acting governors to refrain from any discretionary spending. 
"We have an obligation to the residents of the State of New Jersey to work collaboratively and not expend fiscal resources the state does not have," he wrote.

HEADLINE: Judge Overrules Decision Allowing Logging of Burned Trees 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
A federal judge in Montana has blocked a Bush administration decision, issued last month, that would have allowed logging on more than 40,000 acres of the Bitterroot National Forest.
 It was not immediately clear how the administration would respond. The ruling was a setback for the timber industry, which was hoping to begin a large-scale salvaging project immediately for the trees harmed by fires in 2000 before they rot and lose their value. 
 In his opinion, Donald W. Molloy, chief judge of Federal District Court in Missoula, halted the project and took the administration and the Forest Service to task for issuing their decision administratively and avoiding the customary 45-day public appeals process. The move, Judge Molloy said, looked like "an extralegal effort to circumvent the law." 
"It is presumptuous to believe that the agency's final decision has a perfection about it that would not be illuminated by interested comment, questioning or requests for justification of propositions asserted in it," he wrote.
Judge Molloy, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, argued at some length that the Forest Service action strained credulity and said the idea that a signature by an administration official would carry enough weight to skirt the appeals process was "mystical legal prestidigitation."
The official is Mark Rey, under secretary for natural resources and environment in the Agriculture Department. He signed an administrative order on Dec. 16 that cleared the way for the sale of 176 million board feet of ponderosa pines that are dead or dying from the fires. The Forest Service estimated that the projects would create 4,000 jobs and pump more than $75 million into the local economy. The service also said some of the money from the timber sale would help replant trees and repair stream beds.
Mr. Rey, a former lobbyist for the timber industry, said at the time that the decision to bypass the appeals process was legal. He also said it was necessary because the timber needed to be salvaged quickly and because the environmental groups would sue anyway.
Mr. Rey said the judge's decision, issued late Monday night, was disappointing. He added that he would "work closely with the Department of Justice to determine what the next appropriate steps are." The administration could begin a public appeals process or it could appeal Judge Molloy's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.
Mr. Rey referred questions to Bill Mercer, United States attorney for the District of Montana, who issued a statement saying he would consult Mr. Rey and others before any appeal. 
Mr. Mercer's statement noted that the government had argued that the salvaging operation would cause no irreparable harm. He said that the environmental groups that had sought the decision would not eventually prevail on the merits of their case and that the public interest favored proceeding on the project, "given the environmental and economic benefits associated" with it.
Another Bush administration official said the decision was a Pandora's box because it could open to question other decisions made by the Clinton administration.
Spokesmen for the environmental groups that sought the court order based strictly on the lack of appeals and not on the merits of the logging operation said they did not oppose all logging in the Bitterroot.
Doug Honnold, a lawyer with EarthJustice, a law firm that represents the groups, said that Mr. Rey's initial action was an attempt to prop up a dying industry "under the guise of responding to a forest fire."
"It's an effort," Mr. Honnold said, "to reinstate a logging industry in a locale where it's hard to make a dime cutting trees because they're difficult to grow, you've got high elevations and a short growing season."

 BODY:
White House Walks Away From Fuel Mileage Project
The Bush administration is walking away from a $1.5 billion, eight-year project to develop high-mileage gasoline-fueled vehicles. Instead it is throwing its support behind a plan to develop hydrogen-based fuel cells.
 Environmentalists and energy experts favor the research. But critics said that the new program, like its predecessor, would let Washington and Detroit focus on vague, long-term aims while avoiding the more difficult task of improving the gas mileage of cars and sport utility vehicles in the short term.

Motorola Told to Pay Iridium Lenders
A federal judge has ordered Motorola to pay $300 million to Chase Manhattan Bank and several other lenders to repay part of a loan to the company's troubled satellite-telephone venture, Iridium. Some investors and Wall Street analysts said the court decision could spell trouble for Motorola in four pending lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars in damages, brought by investors in Iridium. Shares of Motorola fell 37 cents, to $14.80. C9.

A Downside to AOL's Big Charge

HEADLINE: Pataki Confidant to Direct Rebuilding Effort 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Louis R. Tomson, a former top adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki, has been selected to run the day-to-day operations of the state corporation in charge of rebuilding Lower Manhattan, government officials and downtown executives said yesterday.
 Mr. Tomson, who was a troubleshooter for Governor Pataki, will be appointed executive director of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation within a week, they said. He is taking on the formidable and delicate task of organizing the reconstruction effort, which the executives said involves balancing real estate development and the public desire to create a significant memorial at the site of the World Trade Center. 
 On Monday, John C. Whitehead, chairman of the redevelopment corporation, said the corporation was reviewing a long list of candidates, which included Carl Weisbrod, head of the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district for Lower Manhattan; Rebecca Robertson, former president of the 42nd Street Development Project; and Richard A. Kahan, a former state official. But Mr. Tomson, who lives near Albany in Voorheesville, was Governor Pataki's first choice, according to people briefed on the appointment. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. Whitehead and directors of the redevelopment corporation approved the selection.
From 1995 to 1998, Mr. Tomson was deputy secretary and later first deputy secretary to Governor Pataki, with responsibility for policy development for the state's 60 public authorities, including the New York Power Authority, the Long Island Power Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Until September, Mr. Tomson was also chairman of the State Thruway Authority. And he played a major role in advising the governor on dismantling the Long Island Lighting Company and creating the Long Island Power Authority.
"Whenever there was an impossible or contentious issue, the governor brought in Lou," said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association. "He did an extraordinary job on a number of issues, including the J.F.K. air train, Long Island Power and dredging in New York harbor. He's accessible, and he's very close to the governor."
Mr. Tomson did not return calls requesting comment. And Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, declined to comment. 
Mr. Pataki had to persuade Mr. Tomson to rejoin the public sector, which he left in 1999 to become senior vice president of corporate development at Plug Power, an upstate energy company that is developing an alternative electricity source called fuel cells. Mr. Tomson is expected to leave Plug Power.
In a lawsuit brought by shareholders, Mr. Tomson and two other company executives were accused of approving the release of positive public statements about the company in 2000 even after they learned about pending setbacks. The lawsuit claims that the executives profited from the sale of company stock just before the bad news became public and share prices dropped by 25 percent. Plug Power also received millions of dollars in loans and grants from the state.

HEADLINE: Terms Are Up, But They Land On Their Feet 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
The city's term limit laws managed to push four borough presidents and dozens of City Council members out of office. But in the week since their terms expired, many of the former borough presidents and council members have managed to avoid unemployment.
 Howard Golden, the former Brooklyn borough president, has taken a job as executive director of civic and governmental affairs in the office of Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney. Claire Shulman, the former Queens borough president, and Guy V. Molinari, the former Staten Island borough president, were named to the boards of divisions of the New York Community Bancorp, the holding company that owns a number of banks in the New York metropolitan region, including Richmond County Savings Bank and Queens County Savings Bank. 
 Mr. Golden, who was borough president from 1977 until Dec. 31, has been a longtime political confidant of Mr. Hynes. In his new job, he will be paid $125,000 a year, compared with the $135,000 salary for borough presidents.
"He is going to interface with community boards, community leaders and businesses," said Jerry Schmetterer, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. "We have programs that deal with alternative sentencing, recently released inmates and other law enforcement strategies," Mr. Schmetterer said. "He will be in charge of those programs. Mr. Hynes felt that Mr. Golden would be a tremendous asset in those areas."
Mr. Molinari and Ms. Shulman will be on the boards of the New York Community Bancorp divisions in their boroughs.
"We have 25 branches in Queens and 23 on Staten Island," said Ilene A. Angarola, a senior vice president of the company and corporate secretary. "And we have retained the local identity and our commitment to those communities." She said that the selection of Ms. Shulman and Mr. Molinari was intended to "provide advice, counsel and guidance in those areas."
Ms. Angarola said that, as directors, the former borough presidents are paid a fee, but she declined to disclose the amount. 
According to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, outside directors receive an annual retainer of $15,000 and a fee of $500 for attending each of the monthly board meetings. They also receive a retainer for committee service ranging from $1,000 to $8,000 depending on the committee and other fees for attending committee meetings.
Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, said that he planned to lead a public policy institute and that he would elaborate on his plans in a later announcement.
"And I will be doing something in the private sector," Mr. Ferrer added. "I have a number of offers that have been made, and there are a number of conversations that are taking place. I'm not ready to announce anything yet."
Many council members affected by term limits have secured new positions in government. Karen Koslowitz, a former councilwoman from Queens, has taken a job as deputy borough president in the administration of Helen M. Marshall, the new borough president in Queens.
For a short time last year, Ms. Koslowitz and Ms. Marshall, then a councilwoman, were both candidates for Queens borough president.
Ms. Marshall was ultimately endorsed by the Queens Democratic Party organization after its chairman, Thomas Manton, persuaded Ms. Koslowitz to drop out of that race. Ms. Koslowitz will receive an annual salary of $134,000, compared with her Council salary of $90,000.
Another former council member, Guillermo Linares, was selected by Betsy Gotbaum, the newly elected public advocate, to be deputy public advocate at an annual salary of $90,000. Mr. Linares, a Democrat who represented Washington Heights in Manhattan, was first elected to the Council in 1991.
One former city councilman is serving in a particularly high-profile position: Victor L. Robles of Brooklyn, who was the Council's majority whip, was selected as city clerk by the Council, with a term that expires in 2006. Mr. Robles, who earns $141,000 a year, supervises the office that administers marriage licenses and is in charge of city documents.
Another of Mr. Robles's duties has been to swear in the newly elected members of the Council and to collect the fee, set by city law at 15 cents, to register them as members.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Bereft by Fire and Grandmother's Death

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Tristan Christy was awakened one morning last March by neighbors banging on his door to warn of a fire in the apartment above him. They were telling everyone in the building to get out.
 Tristan, now 14, lived there with his grandmother, and they both got out safely, though it meant he would have to go to school without a shower. He thought everything would be fine, so instead of waiting to see if there was any damage to the building, he got on the bus and went to school. 
 When he came home, Tristan, whom everyone calls Tiryese, noticed that only a window in the apartment above his had been broken. There were no fire trucks, no flames, no smoke.
He found plenty of evidence of the fire, though, when he walked into his apartment. His bedroom had taken the brunt of the damage. The ceiling had fallen in and the floor was covered in sheetrock and dust. Everything was charred or waterlogged, and destroyed. 
"All my stuff was gone," Tiryese recalled. "My TV, my dresser, my clothes." With no renters' insurance and little income, Tiryese's grandmother, Cherie Christy, 45, asked her godmother, Roberta Slaughter, 49, to pay for new winter clothes for Tiryese.
Later, for summer clothes, he turned to charity. For some years, Tiryese had been working with counselors at the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, which offers counseling and programs to teenagers at a community center in Midwood, Brooklyn. The board is a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
In April, Tiryese went on a bit of a shopping spree at a small store across the street from the community center with his counselor, Victor Fredericksen. They bought him underwear, socks, T-shirts, and dress shirts with about $400 from the fund.
Even before the fire, life had not been simple. Tiryese's parents are separated, and he is not in contact with his father. He said he speaks on the phone with his mother every few months.
The counseling sessions at the community center helped him overcome some behavior problems, Ms. Slaughter and Mr. Fredericksen said. "One time he was really hard to handle, with his grandmother," Ms. Slaughter said. "He gave her some rough times. After he started coming here, things got better." 
After the fire at his grandmother's apartment, Tiryese slept on a couch in the living room and then at Ms. Slaughter's apartment in Starrett City, the large housing complex in southeast Brooklyn.
His grandmother, who had cared for him since he was born, died of a heart attack in March. He learned the news from Ms. Slaughter when he came home from school that day. "We've been working on talking about the death of his grandmother," Mr. Fredericksen said. "I don't want to push it on Tiryese too much yet."
Tiryese said simply, "I've just been sad about it -- I've been keeping it to myself."
As a way of helping Tiryese deal with difficult emotions, gain self-confidence, learn discipline and stay busy after school, Mr. Fredericksen is enrolling him in a karate program. 
Ms. Slaughter has gained legal custody of Tiryese, and receives $63 every two weeks in welfare to care for him. She is an unemployed cosmetologist who is raising five foster children for whom she is paid stipends, and said her income is stretched thin.

AD MARKETER SAYS PROFIT WILL MEET REDUCED FORECAST

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The R. H. Donnelley Corporation, an advertising marketer, plans to cut 100 jobs and says 2001 profit was at the lower end of its reduced forecast. Profit for the year was $2.35 to $2.37 a share, excluding $30 million in pretax fourth-quarter costs, partly related to eliminating the 100 jobs, at its Raleigh, N.C., publishing plant, Donnelley said. 
In October, the company lowered its forecast for the year to $2.35 to $2.40 a share from $2.40. The company said it would report final results in mid-February. Donnelley's advertising sales have been hurt as companies have curtailed spending in a slowing economy. The company, based in Purchase, N.Y., named David Swanson its chief executive on Monday, He will start in May, succeeding Frank Noonan.

HEADLINE: Learning From Enron 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "The Enron Post-Mortem" (editorial, Jan. 4) correctly notes that Enron's collapse "was a shocking national calamity" and that it might lead to new federal regulations. 
But Enron's collapse was also shocking and calamitous in the developing world. 
 The best body to assess the behavior of multinationals is the World Trade Organization. The Enron case should inform the W.T.O.'s impending revised multilateral agreement on investment, which reduces rather than increases regulations of foreign companies.

HEADLINE: Somalia Is No Hideout for bin Laden 

BYLINE:  By Nuruddin Farah; Nuruddin Farah, a Somali novelist, is author, most recently, of the nonfiction book "Yesterday, Tomorrow: Voices from the Somali Diaspora."

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN 

 BODY:
As a child in the Somali Peninsula, I was brought up to believe that during Ramadan Satan is locked away in a place from where he can do no harm. I'm revisiting this myth, with a view to revising it, given the recent horrors with which the world has become familiar. In the word Satan, derived from the pre-Islamic Arabic root Shatana, I now find a secular meaning: "the one who spreads destruction" or "the one who opposes the will of the community." You can work out for yourself the Satan who will fit the world's present context, but he has been very much on the loose, visiting havoc on the world's innocent and choosing to reveal his wicked intentions in different guises, all of them unpalatable. No wonder everyone wants to know where Satan is headed next.
 The pundits predict that he will call at a Muslim country, and one of those often mentioned is Somalia. Apart from speculations, no one has the slightest idea what the spreaders of destruction and those in hot pursuit of them will do once Afghanistan has ostensibly rid herself of Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda associates. But the assumption is that in Somalia, a land of grief, these destructive forces would find a haven because there is no central authority to flush them out, hunt them down or bring them before a court. 
 The United States and its allies, having long remained impervious to the ruin of Somalia, must think hard now about firing a missile or mounting an invasion, and so bringing more pain to a land that has not enjoyed peace for over a decade. And if the aim is the eradication of terror, I would argue that Somalia is not even a promising target.
An American intrusion into Somalia would destabilize the fragile peace that has been achieved under a transitional authority with the mandate to establish a permanent, all-inclusive government. And for what purpose? According to America's own intelligence sources, the Qaeda cells in Somalia are far less active than those in Italy and Germany. Their lack of a strong structure is not the only reason Mr. bin Laden and his associates seem unlikely, to me, to seek refuge among Somalis. I see many barriers to his being hidden and shielded in Somalia.
The majority of Somalis would hardly welcome anyone likely to bring them destruction. We have so many problems of our own making that we would not be tempted to court the problems of folks from elsewhere -- especially if those problems include pursuit by the United States military.
And which warlord or warring group would Mr. bin Laden safely be able to choose as his host? He could hardly expect them to unite under his banner; their hatreds and rivalries go far too deep. And nobody carrying on his head a prize of $25 million, as Mr. bin Laden does, should be so foolish as to seek refuge in a land where treachery among the political elite has been greater than anywhere else in the known world. He had better find his peace elsewhere, in a land where loyalties are more permanent and where he would be less likely to be sold.
Simply staying out of sight would be difficult. A quarrelsome lot, we Somalis take delight in informing on or opposing one another. For the warlords and their loyalists, this translates into making it a primary business to discover who their enemies' friends are, what they are up to, with whom they are plotting, against whom and why. I cannot for the life of me imagine Mr. bin Laden or one of his associates finding a hiding place for even a single weekend in a land where everything is an open secret.
I doubt, too, that Al Qaeda could raise enough recruits among Somalia's unemployed to fight under its banner. Many a Somali might die willingly for his clan family or for financial gains, but not for an abstraction, which is what, in the final analysis, religion is to the barely literate. Moreover, I doubt there are more than a handful of my countrymen who are prepared to lay down their lives for Islam, well aware as they are that the Almighty has supplied the faith with many other volunteers, from other parts of the world, eager to do a martyr's work.
The West should not be fooled by the misinformation doled out by both the Ethiopian regime and its allies in Somalia and by the untrustworthy men now leading Somalia's murderous factions. They can be expected to point censorious fingers at their rivals, describing them as associates of Al Qaeda.
The attention that Somalia needs from the international community is not an invasion in the antiterror war, but meaningful support of the government's effort to regain sovereignty over the whole country. The warlords will lead us nowhere but to a dead end, where anarchy rules. This will be to the profit of neither ourselves, our neighbors nor the Western nations threatened by terror.

HEADLINE: Thousands of Jobs Expected to Be Cut AtG.M. and Ford 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
The two largest American automakers are expected to announce the elimination of at least 15,000 jobs this week.
 General Motors plans to offer buyouts to about 5,000 white-collar workers as part of continuing belt-tightening in an automotive industry reckoning with recession. Later this week, analysts expect that Ford Motor will cut more than 10,000 jobs as part of a major restructuring plan. Ford officials declined to comment today on reports that as many as 20,000 jobs would be eliminated. 
 The prospect of cuts has somewhat overshadowed the North American International Auto Show here, where automakers from around the world are displaying new models for this year and concepts for the future.
G.M., the only one of the Big Three automakers that is expected to report a profit for 2001, appeared to be making the cuts less out of necessity than as a preventive measure. The company said today that it would offer buyouts to about 10 percent of its white-collar work force as part of an effort started in 2000 to trim its payroll.
"We can run leaner, and we should run leaner," said Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of G.M., who added that no plant closings were on the horizon for G.M. beyond the closing of a Canadian plant that was announced last year.
"The best companies work at competitiveness every day," he added. "When economics are tough, you've got a little bit of a sharper edge to it."
Though G.M. shares a number of concerns with the other members of the Big Three, including the weakness of the Japanese yen and the high price of sales incentives, analysts view it as the member of the Big Three with the most momentum. Today, Robert A. Lutz, G.M.'s new vice chairman who oversees products, led reporters on a tour to critique the competition's vehicles with a brashness that G.M. has long studiously avoided.
He even led a tour around the displays of Chrysler, where he served as president in the 90's, and offered his compliments to Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler's chief executive.
"No more sleepy Chrysler," Mr. Lutz said to Mr. Zetsche, adding that he would have preferred if the carmaker, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, was still sleepy and less competitive.
Other carmakers expressed surprise that G.M. was able to develop a concept car, the curvy two-seat roadster, the Pontiac Solstice, in the four months that Mr. Lutz has been at the company.
But most of the talk at the conference has focused on Ford and its financial health. Ford's cuts come as it tries to return to profitability after a miserable 2001 that brought a decline in its quality rankings, a sinking in the morale of its employees, a drop in its market share to 21.9 percent from 23 percent in 2000 and the removal of its chief executive.
The company, which is expected to report its first annual loss since 1992, is also expected to announce that some of its plants will be phased out, though Ford officials have said that no plant will be entirely shut down before the union contract ends in the middle of next year.
G.M., Chrysler and Ford all face similar obstacles this year. They will be challenged to increase sales during the recession and after drawing in customers by offering interest-free financing deals after Sept. 11. One side effect of the deals, which drove sales of new cars and light trucks to a record monthly level in October, is that the value of used cars declined. Falling residual values have hurt the outlook for the General Motors Acceptance Corporation because it affects the value of cars coming off leases.
"The biggest issue that GMAC faces from a financial side is residual values, and the worst of that seems to be behind us now," Mr. Wagoner said.
Referring to the job cuts, he said: "We've got to do what's right in our circumstances. I think at G.M. we have gone through some tremendous restructuring. There's not an activity at the company that hasn't been restructured. We had to do it because we had a very difficult performance in the late 80's and early 90's. We still have things we have to do."

HEADLINE: Wider Loss Forecast By Big Coal Supplier 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Shares of Massey Energy fell 19 percent today after the company, a large coal producer, warned that losses over the last two months of 2001 will more than triple earlier estimates, while projected earnings for 2002 will drop substantially.
Massey's stock fell $4.22, to $18 a share.. 
 Massey attributed the losses in part to having to add to a reserve fund in anticipation of a settlement with the state of West Virginia of a dispute over workers' compensation liabilities. Massey also added to a reserve fund in anticipation of losses from the bankruptcy of Enron, the failed energy trading company. 
 Results for the two-month period are scheduled to be released Jan. 30. Massey is switching its financial reporting from its fiscal year, which ends in October, to a calendar year. That led to the unusual report for two rather than three months.
Massey said that mild weather, lower steel demand and the general economic recession had led it to lower estimates of 2002 coal demand in central Appalachia, thereby lowering earnings forecasts.

HEADLINE: Focusing on Home Front, Bush Signs Education Bill 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush continued to emphasize domestic politics over war today as he signed into a law a major education bill that he reminded his listeners had been a central promise of his presidential campaign.
 "We're going to win the war overseas, and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home as well," the president told a cheering crowd before signing the bill in the gymnasium of Hamilton High School in Hamilton, Ohio, the home district of Representative John A. Boehner, a leading Republican supporter of the bill. 
 "The story of children being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories of America," Mr. Bush said. 
He promised that his bill would put American schools "on a new path of reform, and a new path of results." 
The bill, a bipartisan compromise reached even as Congress was consumed by the events of Sept. 11, is to greatly enlarge the federal role in public education, mandate annual testing of children in grades three to eight and provide tutoring for children in failing schools.
White House advisers today called the bill a triumph for Mr. Bush, even though he had to make major concessions for its passage, including giving up on a voucher program for private schools.
In what amounted to a victory lap and a political favor for the four main legislative supporters of the bill -- two Democrats and two Republicans -- Mr. Bush traveled from Washington to Ohio to New Hampshire and then to Massachusetts. It was his most extensive day of travel in the United States since Sept. 11, and marked a new emphasis on Mr. Bush's domestic agenda and the 2002 midterm elections. 
It may also have been one of the last displays of bipartisanship this year, as the president and Democrats wage war over the sputtering economy.
At Boston Latin, the nation's oldest public school, Mr. Bush appeared before a roaring crowd with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the main Democratic supporter of the bill in the Senate and typically a target of Republican attacks.
"I told the folks in the coffee shop in Crawford, Tex., that Ted Kennedy is all right," the president said, referring to a restaurant near his ranch where he had a cheeseburger last month. "They nearly fell out."
Mr. Bush and Mr. Kennedy, scions of the nation's two most famous and opposing political families with much to gain from the other, took time in each of their speeches at Boston Latin for extravagant compliments. 
"Now we remember the difference it has made this year with your leadership," Mr. Kennedy said at the school, the alma mater of his father and grandfather. The president, he added, "was there every step of the way making the difference on this legislation."
Mr. Bush, in turn, told the crowd that Mr. Kennedy had been with the first lady on Capitol Hill as they learned of the Sept. 11 attacks. "And I want to thank him publicly, in front of his home folks, for providing such comfort to Laura during an incredibly tough time," Mr. Bush said. He added, "So, Mr. Senator, not only are you a good senator, you're a good man."
Mr. Bush and Mr. Kennedy need each other politically this year for any deal on the patients' bill of rights, a major legislative goal for both men. 
In New Hampshire, the site of the nation's first primary, Mr. Bush attended his most political event since the attacks, a private reception for campaign donors in Durham. White House aides said it was not a fund-raiser, but a "thank you" for supporters. On Wednesday in Washington, Mr. Bush is to speak at a fund-raiser for his brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.
Among the group in Durham was Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the main Republican supporter of the education bill in the Senate and Mr. Bush's campaign manager during the 2000 New Hampshire primary. Mr. Bush lost the primary in a stunning upset to Senator John McCain of Arizona.
"I still invited him to come with me," Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gregg, to laughter.
Also along on the trip was Representative George Miller of California, the main Democratic supporter of the bill in the House. Mr. Bush traveled to California last Saturday.
Although Mr. Bush spoke in some detail about the provisions of the bill, he said in all three states that he had not looked at it closely.
"I wish you could have seen this piece of legislation," Mr. Bush said at Boston Latin. "It's really tall. And I admit, I haven't read it yet." As the crowd laughed, Mr. Bush added: "You'll be happy to hear I don't intend to. But I know the principles behind the bill."
One discordant note today came during Mr. Bush's remarks at the University of New Hampshire in Durham when a young man stood up in the crowd in the gymnasium and called out loud enough for the president to hear: "What about the dead Afghani children, Mr. Bush? What about the dead Afghani children?"
The unidentified heckler, who was evidently referring to civilians killed during the American bombing campaign in Afghanistan, was silenced by what appeared to be another member of the audience, an older man, who came up from behind him, firmly put a hand on what appeared to be the heckler's head or shoulder, and pushed him down. The president paused slightly, but continued with his speech.

HEADLINE: A Bush Event Signals All-Out Politics 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
After four months of steering clear of partisan political events, President Bush will appear on Wednesday at a fund-raising dinner here for his brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, the White House announced tonight.
 Mr. Bush had instructed his aides after Sept. 11 that it would be unseemly for him to engage in blatant politicking. Since then, his aides have debated about when he should resume political activities. 
 As the president returned to the road to pitch his economic prescriptions, he and his advisers decided it would be appropriate for him to appear on behalf of Jeb Bush, who is seeking re-election in November in one of the marquee contests of the year. Four Democrats, including former Attorney General Janet Reno, are competing to challenge Mr. Bush.
"There was some discussion in December about it," one of the president's advisers said of the conversations about whether the president should attend. "But there was a strong feeling that the president ought to do some political things and this was a good one to do."
In late October, Mr. Bush had been scheduled to be the big draw at a $1 million Republican fund-raising dinner to benefit the Republican Governors Association. But he sent Vice President Dick Cheney in his place.
Organizers of the event on Wednesday, at the Capital Hilton Hotel's presidential ballroom, only blocks from the White House, said it would be in two tiers: For $500 -- the maximum a donor can give directly to Jeb Bush's campaign -- participants can attend a reception featuring the president and the governor. Then there will be a small dinner to benefit the Florida Republican Party for about 50 couples, at $10,000 a couple. That high-dollar event will raise unregulated soft money, including corporate contributions.
The dinner had originally been scheduled for Nov. 28, but it was postponed because of the terrorist attacks and because Republican officials said they were having trouble raising money.
"Any time you have the president, it's an honor and a privilege," said Al Cardenas, the Republican chairman in Florida.
Donors had been told that the president "may or may not come," Mr. Cardenas said, but "they still want to be there to spend time with the governor."
The honorary chairs of the event are the president's and Jeb Bush's brother Marvin and his wife, Margaret, and their sister and her husband, Doro and Bobby Koch.
Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, said in a recent interview that the president knew that sooner or later he would have to return to politics.
"He recognizes that there comes a time when he has that responsibility as leader of this party to do that," Mr. Rove said. "But particularly in the first three months, he's felt very uninclined to commit to political activity."

HEADLINE: U.S. Ends Car Plan On Gas Efficiency; Looks to Fuel Cells 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE with DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is walking away from a $1.5 billion eight-year government-subsidized project to develop high-mileage gasoline-fueled vehicles. Instead it is throwing its support behind a plan that the Energy Department and the auto industry have devised to develop hydrogen-based fuel cells to power the cars of the future, administration and industry officials said yesterday. 
 The new effort, to be announced in Detroit today by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, aims at the eventual replacement of the internal combustion engine. Fuel cells use stored hydrogen and oxygen from the air to create electricity, and the only emission from engines they power is water vapor. 
 Environmentalists and some energy experts favor the research. But critics said that the new program would let Washington and Detroit focus on vague, long-term aims while avoiding the more difficult task of improving the mileage of existing cars and sport utility vehicles in the short term. Experts say that commercial production of cars with fuel-cell engines is 10 to 20 years away.
With hearings scheduled in the Senate next month on a Democratic alternative to President Bush's energy program, it has been unclear how either party will address fuel economy standards, which are equally unpopular with carmakers and organized labor. 
Yesterday, an administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the Transportation Department would offer a proposal later this year on tightening those standards. But he added that since any changes would be years in the making, the fuel-cell project could make them "a nonissue."
The original program, begun in 1993, aimed to develop affordable cars that got 80 miles to a gallon of gasoline. Vice President Al Gore, its most vocal backer in the Clinton administration, likened the project, known as the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, to the Apollo space program in its technological complexity. In addition to about $1.5 billion in government subsidies, the Big Three automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler -- together spent about $1 billion a year on related technologies. 
The carmakers all developed prototype vehicles that got at least 70 miles a gallon, and the project nurtured advances in aerodynamics and lighter composite materials now used in auto manufacturing. 
But none of the Big Three came close to commercial production of an 80-mile-a-gallon car. The average fuel economy of cars and trucks for sale in the United States has, meanwhile, steadily dropped, so that this year's fleet -- with its growing proportion of sport utility vehicles -- gets the worst gas mileage in 21 years, according to the government. 
The new program, called Freedom Car, will not require the automakers to produce a fuel-cell powered vehicle, according to the Energy Department. Energy experts expressed concern yesterday that without such clear targets, it too would do little to alleviate the country's growing dependence on oil.
"I think fuel cells are a useful long-term goal," said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a research and advocacy group in Washington. "But the big problem I have is that the Bush administration proposal doesn't seem to address anything for the next 10 years. There's a lot of technology that can go into cars in 2006 or 2007."
The new initiative was disclosed yesterday by The Detroit News. The administration said it would not discuss its proposed spending on the project until President Bush's 2003 budget proposal was released in February, but the program it replaces was to receive $127 million in federal funds this year.
Although gasoline prices are now low, the conflict in Afghanistan has thrown a spotlight once more on America's enormous appetite for fuel and has renewed calls for reducing American dependence on foreign oil. The United States, with only 5 percent of the world's population, consumes 25 percent of its oil, mostly in the form of gasoline. 
Mr. Abraham, in remarks prepared for delivery today at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, said the new project was "rooted in President Bush's call, issued last May in our National Energy Plan, to reduce American reliance on foreign oil." He added, "The eventual goal of this research are technologies that aim to solve many of the problems associated with our nation's reliance on petroleum to power our cars and trucks."
While the Clinton administration program focused on developing high-mileage family sedans -- vehicles that fell out of favor with consumers as the research progressed -- Mr. Abraham said the new project would give automakers the flexibility to use the fuel-cell engines in a range of vehicles.
"We should be developing energy-efficient components that can be adapted for use in several models throughout our fleet," he said.
The stocks of several companies that are developing fuel cells surged yesterday on news of the administration initiative. Shares in Ballard Power Systems, probably the best known of these companies, jumped 15 percent, to $34.96. FuelCell Energy rose 22 percent, to $21.85; Plug Power was up 39 percent, to close at $12.04.
The Big Three automakers are expected to introduce so-called hybrid vehicles, using gasoline-electric engines, by 2004. Toyota and Honda -- which did not share in the Clinton-era program's subsidies -- already have hybrids getting at least 40 miles a gallon.
The auto industry has steadily resisted government-mandated increases in fuel economy, with some carmakers arguing that such requirements would divert investment from fuel-cell research. Government standards, unchanged for more than a decade, require each automaker's cars to average 27.5 miles a gallon and light trucks -- including pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles -- to average 20.7 miles a gallon.
Kara Saul Rinaldi, the deputy policy director for the Alliance to Save Energy, a bipartisan advocacy group in Washington, said that she welcomed the investment in fuel cells but hoped the administration would explore improvements in fuel-economy standards. "We're looking at long-term technology when we haven't made the first step," she said. "Raising fuel-economy standards is the first step."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
A Wary Rank and File Watch Daschle's Attack

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Wondering why Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, attacked President Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut last week, but did not call for it to be changed? Just listen to a few of the 12 Senate Democrats who voted for the cut.
 Senator Zell Miller of Georgia is openly questioning the political smarts of his party leader and bristles at Mr. Daschle's charge that the tax cut probably likely worsened the recession. 
 "Maybe it's at a level that my brain can't reach," Mr. Miller said. "How do you have as one of your highest priorities to re-elect the moderate Democrats from South Dakota, Montana and Missouri on one hand, then on the other hand blame them for voting for a tax cut that he maintains has created this recession? Hello?" 
Senators John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Dianne Feinstein of California have defended their votes on television talks shows.
And Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey said today that he might have reconsidered his vote for the tax cut last spring -- had he known the country was about to face a terror strike, war and recession.
Even so, Mr. Torricelli said, "I think to advance changing the tax reduction legislation in the midst of recession isn't good economics and it's worse politics."
Such wariness is a sign of the deep divisions within the Democratic party and the daunting challenge facing Mr. Daschle. 
For every Democrat who fears revisiting last year's tax cut fight, there is another who insists that the party has an obligation to call for freezing or rolling back part of the tax cut for the very wealthiest Americans to pay for more domestic security and Democratic priorities like a prescription drug benefit or more education spending.
"We're not talking about raising taxes," said Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat. "We're talking about stopping future tax cuts for the wealthiest of taxpayers."
Still, Mr. Bush's approval ratings are stratospheric right now and even Democrats sympathetic to freezing part of the tax cut remember how Ronald Reagan hammered their party as big taxers and spenders.
Tax debates can be treacherous ground for Democrats, they say, particularly when facing a popular Republican president, and they are determined not to let Mr. Bush revive old images of their party.
"The Republicans and the White House will demagogue this like hell," said Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat. "It's right for Democrats to be careful."
Being careful means buying time by speaking in terms of fiscal discipline and waiting for the public to turn its attention from the war to the faltering economy.
"The war will wind down here and then people will take a hard look at what's happening to the finances of this country," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat.
To help focus the public's attention in this year of mid-term elections, Democrats will be doing their best to strike the same themes as Mr. Daschle: that the federal government is once again spending more than it takes in and that this will require painful choices.
President Bush, the Democrats will ruefully intone, never spoke about these painful choices but said only that federal surpluses were so plentiful that tax cuts, debt reduction and programs like prescription drug benefits were all affordable.
And the Democrats will say it is up to Mr. Bush to show presidential leadership and point the way to renewed surpluses.
"The Republicans have dug this hole," said Thomas S. Kahn, the minority staff director on the House Budget Committee. "It's now their responsibility to explain how they intend to fill it up.
"We look forward with great interest to the president's budget and State of the Union address," he said.
The Democrats have used this tactic successfully before, when Mr. Bush's father was president and pledging "no new taxes," even as the country was awash in deficits.
Then, too, the Democrats said that easing the deficit required presidential leadership, and they waited the senior Mr. Bush out, until he agreed to raise taxes in 1990.
This time, though, they are facing George Bush's son, who came away convinced that his father's chief political mistake was reneging on his pledge -- and so is unlikely to make the same move.
Some liberal Democrats are even privately complaining that their party leaders are making a mistake by focusing on the deficit and sounding like accountants at a time when they should be promoting plans for putting people back to work.
Still, at the very least, Democrats say, their focus on the deficit will allow them to resist any further long-term reductions in tax rates when the bitter debate over an economic stimulus package resumes.
Mr. Bush and other Republicans have been pushing hard for the measure to accelerate income tax cuts. Democrats have countered with short-term tax breaks for businesses that get people back to work and increase their payrolls.
Ultimately, standing pat carries risks for Democrats too. No longer in the minority, Mr. Daschle has responsibilities to show that he will not just block the president's program, but join Mr. Bush in governing. Mr. Daschle will eventually have to produce some budget plan that unifies his fractious party and pass it though the Senate.
Mr. Bush is already working to portray Mr. Daschle as an obstructionist. And Republicans say they will try to make the 2002 election a referendum on Mr. Daschle's role as a roadblock to the president's programs.
Indeed, Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, who heads the Republican re-election effort in the House, said that his candidates would argue to voters "it's the Democrats who are holding it up. Until they deliver a Republican Congress these matters won't be solved."

HEADLINE: Postal Service Plans Layoffs And 3-Cent Rise in Postage 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
The United States Postal Service said today that it planned to raise the price of a first-class stamp to 37 cents in June and cut as many as 15,000 jobs this year as a result of the weak economy, the attacks of Sept. 11 and the discovery of anthrax in the mail system.
 The last increase in the cost of first-class stamps was a one-cent rise in January 2001, to 34 cents. 
 Postal officials also said they had negotiated an agreement with many major customers to raise bulk rates as early as June 30 -- three months earlier than expected -- to shore up the service's finances. In exchange, the Postal Service is promising not to seek more increases before October. 
The settlement, which includes the increase for first-class stamps, is subject to the approval of the independent Postal Rate Commission, which is expected to vote in the spring.
The Postal Service first presented the request for rate increases to its board of governors on Sept. 11, just before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But the process is generally long, with months of hearings as the commission takes testimony from customers and other groups before making its decision.
Nina Link, the president of the Magazine Publishers of America, said the settlement was "in the best interest of the mailers and the industry," adding that without the agreement the service might have sought higher rate increases. 
The Direct Marketing Association, the Association for Postal Commerce and the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers joined the magazine publishers in the settlement.
Since September, the service has cut about 4,000 jobs, officials said. The cuts follow the earlier reduction of 11,600 jobs last year, when the service lost about $1.7 billion. 
As of the year 2000, the service said, it had 787,500 employees.
The postmaster general, John E. Potter, told the post office's board here that he anticipated cutting 10,000 to 15,000 more jobs during the remainder of this year.
Richard J. Strasser, Jr., the Postal Service's chief financial officer, said commercial, standard and express mail declined, in part, because of a "softening in the advertising market." Overall mail volume dropped by nearly three billion pieces from Sept. 8 to Nov. 30, a decline of 5.5 percent from the same period in 2000, he said.
The Postal Service asked for $5 billion from Congress in November to help cover losses caused by the Sept. 11 attacks and the cost of handling the anthrax crisis, including buying mail-sanitizing equipment.

HEADLINE: GARDEN NOTEBOOK; 
Plant a Few Rocks, and They Take Over the Yard

BYLINE:  By DIANE DORRANS SAEKS 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
LESS than a mile east of downtown San Jose's new Tech Museum of Innovation and half a mile from a convergence of freeways that encircle the heart of Silicon Valley is an alternative universe. On a mild-mannered street of sweet little 40's and 50's bungalows is a private quarter-acre landscape of rare Javanese stone deities, gold rush-era hand-hewn stone Corinthian columns, a koi pond and a fountain framed with centuries-old Chinese carved stone temple fragments, and a 10-ton Sierra white granite cube crowned with a plume of Japanese jungle bamboo.
 The stone garden was created over the last 11 years by Cevan Forristt, a landscape designer who describes himself as a rock nut and pronounces his first name "kevan." His lifelong obsession with old stone led him to salvage statues and architectural fragments from as far away as Bali, India, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Close to home, he has found pale gray granite plinths, stone orbs and slabs from extinct California quarries, along with wedges of chipped granite used as curbstones in San Francisco at the end of the 19th century. 
 "I started the garden with one salvaged Ionic capital and three Chinese stone baths, a Thai Buddha, a few granite blocks and a Mexican mortar stone, and became obsessed with finding really unusual stone pieces," said Mr. Forristt, who is 43 and has a degree in landscape design. His name was Kevin Abbott until he was 18, when a numerologist persuaded him that people with interesting names led more interesting lives.
"I like the sense of permanence and strength old stone gives to a garden," he said as he relaxed on a stack of granite under a Balinese temple umbrella. He knows the provenance of each stone and has a story for each Ganesha statue, stone bowl, marble chip and carved keystone.
"It all looks very random, but I place the rocks carefully so they look as if they've landed there over centuries," he said.
His omnivorous and pantheistic devotion to rocks becomes evident as soon as you enter the 80-by-90-foot front garden through massive handmade teak gates ornamented with rusted iron hinges and salvaged sheets of copper. Multilayered terraces of stone gargoyles, carved volutes, broken chunks of acanthus leaves, Greek-key frieze fragments, mossy Chinese dragons and exuberant Indian statues are poetry in stone.
In early light, this could be a remote corner of northern India, where the worlds of Alexander the Great, Buddhism and Hinduism collided. A zigzag of toppled California sandstone columns, chunks of cobblestones and four-foot-tall fluted columns suggest the Roman Forum. The stones speak, and the hand of the stoneworker is evident.
"I can see how the stone was carved out of a hillside, its fissures and chips and cracks, and I imagine stonemasons building a bank or a courthouse in 1870 or 1880," he said.
The garden offers a sepia-tone album of early California history. His collection of stone from Colusa, Calif., includes a three-foot globe, incised with stars, that adorned a 19th-century bank building in San Francisco. Granite slabs came from other quarries in the Sierra Nevada foothills. In one corner stands a 30-inch block of incised Sierra white granite salvaged when the chapter house at Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco was torn down. Three speckled granite slabs from Rocklin, Calif., are stacked to form an altar for a Javanese Vishnu figure of carved volcanic rock.
"It's the sheer avoirdupois of Cevan's garden that impresses me," said Marcia Donahue, a Berkeley sculptor and gardener. "He makes those five-ton stone columns look so effortless, but this garden is planned very precisely."
Mr. Forristt prepared his garden with hidden concrete foundations and a complex system of invisible earthquake safety reinforcements and bracing. Like the traditional Japanese Zen temple gardens that have been his inspiration, his domain is an idealized landscape of rocks and stones rather than a showcase for flowers. But in contrast to the legendary stone garden in the Ryoanji temple in Kyoto, which uses just 15 rocks in a sea of white gravel to evoke a whole world, Mr. Forristt's rockscape aims for more, not less. His plant selections are refined, bold and focused. Australian tree ferns hover near his Victorian saltbox house. Kaffir lime trees, Buddha's hand citrus and Japanese pear trees are espaliered along a 50-foot fence.
"I'm always looking for drama and excitement in my plants," said Mr. Forristt, whose silvery beard gives him the air of a friendly tree spirit. "I never use pastels. For my garden they are too wimpy."
He discovered his property in 1989, when small houses on quarter-acre lots in east San Jose were selling for around $200,000. "I saw two gnarled old Japanese persimmon trees framing a funky little Victorian house and I instantly knew this was the place for me," he said. "No one had fixed it up. It was pure potential." He had $45,000 in savings; two weeks later, he had bought the house, an 1870 cottage, for $140,000.
This time of year, the bare persimmon branches hold fruits that hang like orange light bulbs. When the house was built it stood in the lush farmland that supported the Santa Clara Valley economy until the high-tech and real estate booms shook the area in the 1980's. "The soil is a fantastic silty loam," Mr. Forristt said. His first plan was to put in a Japanese-influenced garden in the 320-square-foot space behind his house.
"Making the bones and working out the permanent landscape turns me on," he said. "I find specimen plants, like my sawtooth oak, and let nature take its course." His garden is now so full that Javanese and Indonesian gods and monsters grimace and smile along every pathway.
Recently, Mr. Forristt was lured by eight gracefully carved Javanese stone deity heads, each more than four tons. "I didn't stop to think about where I was going to put them," he said. "I rented a crane, wrapped chains around them and had the heads hoisted over the bamboo fence and into the garden." The grinning gargoyles look perfectly at home among the Buddha heads, bodhisattvas and bamboo. No doubt there is another stone god lurking in Mr. Forristt's future.

HEADLINE: BRIDGE; 
Romania's Road to Victory Lies Through the Internet

BYLINE:  By Alan Truscott 

 BODY:
Some countries have little opportunity to win major international titles, because economic circumstances make it difficult for their players to travel. One of these is Romania, which has, however, taken full advantage of the opportunity to play on the Internet. Two weeks ago four of its players, Dorin Petra Musat, Serban Criscota, Alexandre Feber and Catalin Popescu, calling themselves Romanian Beauty, won the third OKbridge Internet World Championship without leaving their homes. A year earlier they captured the same title but had to go to Birmingham, Ala., to contest the final. 
 Both times the Romanians overcame strong American opposition to take the title. This time they won by 23 imps against a group spearheaded by Lew Stansby and Chip Martel, who had won their fifth world title in Paris a month earlier. The other American players against Romania, in a team named Speed Demons II, were JoAnna Stansby, Jan Martel, Ron Gerard and Marty Fleisher. 
 On the diagramed deal, Popescu opened the West hand with one no-trump and Joanna Stansby overcalled two hearts as North. This promised hearts and a minor, but Lew Stansby indicated a very strong suit and a strong hand by jumping to three spades with the South hand. Showing great faith, North continued to four spades. If she had revealed her diamonds, South could have tried four hearts, reaching an unbeatable game.
Against four spades, West opened a heart and South won with the king. The diamond jack was led, and covered with the king and ace. The diamond winners were played, for a club discard, but West was able to ruff the third round. The club ace was cashed, and the queen was continued. South ruffed and tried a low spade, allowing for the possibility that West had begun with a doubleton ace. East won with the nine, and the play of a diamond would now have promoted an extra trump trick for West. But East led a club, and South escaped for down one.
Notice that South's trumps were not strong enough, by a hair. Trade South's six for West's seven, and the game could have been made by leading a top spade at the second trick. The declarer would lose two trump tricks and one club, but nothing more.
In the replay the Romanian South, Criscota, was highly cautious. He bid just three hearts after an opening bid of one one club and an overcall of two no-trump, showing the red suits, by Musat. Again a heart was opened, and South won. He led the spade king and allowed West to win with the ace, discarding a club from the dummy.
Another trump lead was won in the closed hand, and the spade queen was cashed, for a second club discard. Now South led the diamond jack, covered with the king and won with the ace. Trumps were drawn and 11 tricks were made, thanks to the fall of the diamond nine from West.
So Romania gained 6 imps en route to victory. The moral seems to be that with a choice of trump suits, internal solidity is often the vital factor.
The column on Monday about a six no-trump contract played by Bill Kroenthal misidentified the event in which it occurred. It was in the Board-a-Match Teams in the Greater New York Bridge Association's Regional Championships on Dec. 29, not the day before in the tournament's Greenpoint Pairs, which Mr. Kroenthal did win, as the column reported.

When the Going Gets Tough, Some Go Shopping at Museums

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
At a time when New York museums were still hurting from the shocks of September and shoppers were hunkering down for a national recession, the Metropolitan Museum of Art still managed to do a brisk business selling $35,000 amethyst pendants and one-of-a-kind embroidered Indian shawls, at prices ranging from $2,000 to $6,000.
 The success of this kind of high-end merchandise, inspired by the dazzling opulence of the special exhibition "Jeweled Arts of India in the Age of the Mughals," offered a small dash of comfort in what was otherwise a bleak holiday shopping season in New York's museum stores. 
 "The jewelry seemed to hit a note that people liked," said David E. McKinney, the president of the Metropolitan, who said that sales from the gift shop connected to the Mughal exhibition were two and a half times higher than anticipated. 
While sales at the Metropolitan's national retail empire, now numbering 15 stores from Long Island to Los Angeles, were down about 10 percent for the last six months of 2001 (compared with the same period a year ago), the shops inside the museum's Fifth Avenue building were down just 9 percent -- buoyed largely by the success of the shop for the Mughal show (which closes on Sunday). 
Shopping long ago became an integral part of the museum experience in the United States. According to a 1999 survey of 1,800 museums by the American Association of Museums, revenue from gift shops and publications accounted on average for 25.5 percent of earned income (general admissions is the next highest source, at 19.8 percent) and 7.1 percent of gross income, a figure that also includes philanthropic gifts, sponsorships and government grants.
Usually, the most extravagant shoppers are tourists, and late last year it was the tourists who were missing from New York city's museums, causing two -- the Solomon R. Guggenheim and the Whitney Museum of American Art -- to lay off staff members.
The slump in attendance, which began sharply in September, continued through the holiday season: at the Metropolitan for instance, attendance last month was still down 25 to 30 percent from a year earlier.
Coming on top of the decline in attendance, the drop in sales revenues has been a particularly painful blow. "This is the one area which has been really brutal," Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art said in a recent interview. "Retail makes most of its money in the last quarter," Mr. Lowry added. "This came at the worst time for us." Last year, as Christmas approached, gross revenues at the Modern's celebrated design store were $3 million below an expected level of $30 million, he said. "Right now, we are losing money in retail," Mr. Lowry said. "We will be really lucky if it breaks even."
But as bad as the news was, some museums could take comfort from the fact that the drop in sales revenues was less steep than the drop in attendance. In other words, while fewer people were visiting museums, those who went shopped -- sometimes even a little more than usual.
For the Met's managers, the lessons learned from the Mughal gift shop, which offered original items specially made by the heirs to a Jaipur jewelry-makers' dynasty, was that high prices can be overcome when shoppers feel inspired by the art. "It was a special event because the exhibition was a special event," Mr. McKinney said. "It was a one-time thing, but it may mean we can be more optimistic with what the market will bear, particularly if it ties in to a show."
Similarly, at the American Museum of Natural History, the popularity of the "Pearls" exhibition helped push the gift shop's sales of pearls well beyond anticipated levels, an official at the museum said.
At the Brooklyn Museum of Art, sales were up 25 percent over the same day in December 2000 during the one-day Members Only annual holiday shopping day. "We were offering a 20 percent discount, but then we always offer a 20 percent discount," said Sallie Stutz, vice director for marketing. "I think people just wanted to come and support their institutions."
At the Whitney Museum of American Art, "store sales were outpacing admission," said the director, Maxwell Anderson. "There is a holiday bump every year, partly because we are on Madison Avenue, which is a spending location."
The American Folk Art Museum also saw its special hand-crafted items fly off the shelves at the museum's recently opened new home, on West 53rd Street. "We have to factor in that it was a new building," said Marie DiManno, director of museum shops, "but it was phenomenal."
But at the Folk Art Museum's outlet at Lincoln Square, sales were down, just as they were at most other museums in the city. And at the Brooklyn Museum, poor attendance at the "Eternal Egypt" exhibition, brought here from Britain, lowered anticipated gift-shop sales by 25 percent, Ms. Stutz said.
Museum stores have an edge over their commercial competitors because their profits are exempt from business taxes, provided that the items they sell are in keeping with the educational mission of their collection. But the lines between mission and commerce have often blurred, as museum directors succeed in defining as educational tools baseballs bearing artists' signatures and packages of pasta in the shape of works of art. As a result, only a tiny percentage of museum retail sales are eligible for what the I.R.S. calls the "unrelated business income tax."
The Metropolitan Museum, which began selling art reproductions and publications soon after its doors opened in 1870, has been perfecting the art of retailing ever since. It now operates shops in SoHo, Rockefeller Center and La Guardia Airport as well as stores across the country and several franchise operations abroad.
In 2000 the Metropolitan Museum's gift shops reported gross sales of $76 million, of which just less than half came from the shops in the museum, according to recent financial reports. The net revenue, however, from the entire retail operation is only about $1 million a year, Mr. McKinney said. In addition to usual expenses like the cost of the goods, personnel, distribution and commercial rents, the Metropolitan Museum also offsets its profits with rent, utility and security costs charged to the main building's gift shops. 
Eighty-five percent of American museums do not charge their stores rent, according to a recent survey for the Museum Store Association in Denver. Mr. McKinney said the Met did so in order to keep closer track of the performance of the shops at the Fifth Avenue museum, which can then be realistically compared with satellite stores in other locations.
The most recent addition was a store that opened in the Aladdin Resort and Casino in Las Vegas last June, in the same city where the Guggenheim opened its latest satellite museum in October. Like other outlets in tourist meccas, the Las Vegas store has lagged behind expectations since Sept. 11.
But while tourist-related dollars were hard to come by, catalog and Internet sales were generally up, several museums reported. The Whitney reported a 100 percent increase in business conducted through its Web site, while sales from the Metropolitan's Web site were up 40 percent during the last half of last year.
"People are shopping more from home," Mr. McKinney said.

HEADLINE: Seeing The Future In All Its Hues 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
LISA HERBERT was winter white, and that wasn't good.
 "I mean, I just got back from Miami, but there was absolutely no sun there," said Ms. Herbert, the executive vice president of Pantone Inc. in Carlstadt, N.J., which develops, standardizes and forecasts colors for clients in the clothing, beauty, home furnishings and product-design industries. 
 With $2 billion a year in sales and licensing fees, Pantone is globally recognized for its 1,757-color palette (including 27 whites, excluding Ms. Herbert) and acknowledged as having the broadest reach worldwide, in a field of more than a dozen color forecasters. 
I.B.M.'s "big blue" is Pantone Blue plus Pantone Violet. Barbie Pink is also a Pantone custom color, trademarked for use in more than 100 categories, including bubble bath and breakfast cereal. Tiffany's is working with Pantone to standardize its signature robin's-egg hue, then secure it by trademark.
Ms. Herbert, dressed in a camel-color sweater (camel's yellow undertones convey warmth and relaxation, she said) and sitting in a rose-beige conference room that was like being inside a fresh suntan, looked great. "I'd call it a bisque, or a nude," she said. "If you go into bridal salons, the rooms for the brides are done in this kind of color. Everyone looks great."
Popular color isn't just "in the wind" each season. It's generated by high-wind machines like Pantone, whose more than 250,000 client companies subscribe to its palette and custom services, including Nike, Shiseido, Apple, DKNY and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Companies choose to accept or ignore the forecasting advice; then they decide whether to admit or deny that they have even looked at it.
Pantone's color forecast for 2002 was revealed publicly last month. Its seven suggested palettes include "Aqueous" and "Allusion" -- 20 atmospheric colors meant to intimate softness and calm. (They are largely pastel.) They would be instantly familiar to Pottery Barn customers. In the stores and the January catalog, titled "Relaxed Style -- Create Your Own Sanctuary," new pillows, bedding and paint finishes are nearly identical pastel tones that Pottery Barn, a Pantone client, has given names like Cloud and Sky.
At the housewares show next weekend in Chicago, retailers will see new KitchenAid mixers in Pistachio and Lavender that will complement Pottery Barn's colors nicely in the kitchen. Whirlpool, the parent company, is a Pantone client, too.
Crate & Barrel's windows on Madison Avenue are also displaying cutting boards and mixing bowls in pastels this month. Unlike Pottery Barn and KitchenAid, Crate & Barrel denied using the Pantone forecast in creating its new colors, though a company spokesman said it also looks at it.
Pottery Barn passed on "Rio" and "Sicily," deeper, darker palettes that may be more appropriate to categories other than home furnishings, which is in part why Pantone forecasts seven different palettes.
Pantone's Matching System, an exact dye-ratio index invented in 1963 by Lawrence Herbert, Ms. Herbert's father, has been called the Oxford English Dictionary of the language of color. In 1982, Pantone, increasingly aware of the commercial value of its knowledge about the composition of color and its influence on consumers, founded the Color Institute -- a corridor of offices and laboratories built beneath the shed roof of the New Jersey plant where Pantone prints and ships its color cards. The Color Institute publishes the Pantone View Color Planner, its projection of palettes, twice a year.
Pantone executives meet in London with an invited panel of six European color consultants and industry representatives to discuss sales performance and trends in their respective businesses, from makeup to cars, and public mood. The home furnishings forecast is developed separately later at Pantone.
What the participants bring to the table in London is a witches' brew of educated guesses, research and reports, large generalizations and safe bets. Rising Hispanic population in the United States? Tex-Mex food? Ricky Martin? Do reds. The projection for 2001 included "Fiesta," a palette of rich reds that did well in slipcovers for Pottery Barn. 
Is there concern about the state of the oceans? Do blue. "Aqueous," a response to that, is now arriving in stores.
Blue is the favorite color of some 35 percent of the American public, said Leatrice Eiseman, a psychologist and the director of Pantone's Color Institute, who leads the London meetings. "You know this palette is going to be pleasing to a large part of the population," she said. Ms. Eiseman also reads Variety to know what kinds of movies are in production two years out. 
Corporate clients who subscribe to Pantone's consultation services for fees running to the tens of thousands of dollars a year are investing in the belief that they are staying ahead of the game, which is consumers' taste. Pantone's companies have just received their forecasts for the spring and summer of 2003.
The panel met in London in November to determine the palettes for winter and fall of 2003. They will be the first projections to anticipate the lasting consumer reaction to events of Sept. 11.
"What we had started to see as the economy faltered, and what came into focus after September, was the whole idea of heritage and tradition," Ms. Eiseman said. "People feeling connected to each other, in a communal sense. People doing things in groups -- playing games together, coming together for food."
How does this type of socioeconomics translate into color? "A graying-down of the color families," Ms. Eiseman explained. "More natural colors, and heritage colors -- colonial blues, deeper teals, burgundy reds, earth brown."
The panel has proposed a palette of (hopefully enduring) early American colors called "Emblematic." The accents will be as bright and crisp as salutes. "In times of stress, people go to the colors of their flag," Ms. Eiseman said. "And there are product areas, like toys and plastics, where there is a need for brightness."
For skeptics who might think that projecting color trends is hoodoo, not hard fact, Pantone's headliner client list virtually guarantees that the universe of color will become, on schedule, a universe of products. Fashion -- and its need to replace itself to keep sales strong -- is forever.
"Because we're color leaders in small appliances, we get in and out of color, even on a short-term basis," said Brian Maynard, director of marketing at KitchenAid, which has worked with Pantone on product color since 1986. "Using a forecast helps you narrow down the choices, so you know where not to go." KitchenAid introduces three new colors each year at trade shows but does not produce them unless there is acceptance among visiting retailers.
Nike's global merchandising director for footwear, Todd Blumenthal, said of the Pantone forecast, "You can't afford not look at it."
Pantone makes trend presentations to Nike at its headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., and has developed custom colors for the company. But Mr. Blumenthal subscribes to 15 color-trend services, including Pantone.
"A large brand like Nike, you have to look and talk to everyone," he said. "Pantone definitely inspires us, but it's not how we develop our colors."
Subscribing to a color-trend service can be either market savvy or suicide. "The danger is to take them too literally," said Celia Tejada, vice president for product development at Pottery Barn. Her company, which is based in San Francisco, took inspiration from the Pantone 2002 forecast, but customized the color choices with a local vendor to establish a point of departure from competitors.
Unforeseeable events like Sept. 11 are the other danger, Ms. Tejada said. "We happened to be on the good side of the coin in this event," she said. Pottery Barn developed its soft, light palette for 2002 in 2000. "It made the color mood even more attractive -- the feeling of being embraced by a warm home full of romance."
Claire Armstrong, a retail analyst at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco, said realistic thinking about the merchandise, not color, is the key to customer approval. "Pottery Barn will succeed by staying mainstream and conservative, whether it's pastel or not," she said. "People want things they can keep in their homes year after year. It's not the color that's at issue."
In the laboratories at the Color Institute on Friday, Ms. Herbert, extending a pink nail, defended the value of divining color while conceding the drawbacks, including the tendency of some corporate customers to never give credit where credit is due.
"The clients, they don't like to admit it," she said, speaking of the use of Pantone's forecast palettes. "We have a client in France -- they won't even let us send a packing slip with the swatches, they're so afraid that someone's going to get that piece of paper that has the colors on it."
Next to her, a vast collection of bottles with clear dyes, patched by wire and pipette to a machine with a glass chamber and a control panel that looked like salon equipment for Frankenstein's bride, waited to make a vial of color. Is color forecasting a boon or a bust for consumers, who walk into a store and see not freedom of choice, but the palettes of a year-old prediction, or purchases that coordinate magically with everything else?
To Pantone, a $2 billion business now making licensing arrangements for its own proprietary line of home and contract furnishings, the answer is black and white.
"Clothing, carpet, paint," said Ms. Eiseman, the Color Institute director. "These palettes are a guideline for consumers. Without them, they're going to be too confused to buy."

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA; 
Radio Station Ponders Change, And Ole Opry's Fans Worry

BYLINE:  By PHIL SWEETLAND 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The longest-running marriage in the history of radio, the 76-year relationship between the Grand Ole Opry and its broadcast home, WSM-AM in Nashville, is teetering on the brink as the struggling station faces a likely change from its country music format.
 The Gaylord Entertainment Company, which owns WSM-AM, two other radio stations in Nashville and the weekly Grand Ole Opry live show and radio program, has been vilified this week by fans and artists who are infuriated at the anticipated changes. The company's president and chief executive, Colin Reed, said Gaylord was committed to finding another radio home for the Opry program, the longest-running radio show in the world, and for WSM-AM's country music format and was exploring national syndication of the Opry. 
 The Grand Ole Opry has been instrumental in starting the careers of country stars from Bill Monroe in the 1930's to Hank Williams in the 1940's, Patsy Cline in the 1960's and Garth Brooks in the 1990's. WSM-AM is an ABC affiliate whose traditional country format has been a Nashville staple since 1983, but in the most recent Arbitron ratings it placed third among Nashville's four country stations, and its sister station, WSM-FM, was last. Traditional country stations like WSM-AM feature older artists like George Jones and Tammy Wynette. Top 40 country stations have very tight playlists that emphasize younger stars like the Dixie Chicks, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. 
ESPN Radio, which is owned by ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Corporation, is said to be among those interested in taking over WSM-AM's operation. 
The change would come at a time of uncertainty on the Nashville music scene. Four big Nashville record labels closed last year. Gaylord itself lost $105.1 million in 2000 and $24.5 million in the third quarter of 2001. The top-selling country album of 2001, the traditional soundtrack of the movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" was issued not by an industry giant, but by a tiny imprint, Lost Highway/Mercury, and was virtually ignored by country radio.
In the midst of this, the talk of change at WSM-AM and the uncertainty over the Opry show hit hard, despite Gaylord's statements of support for the show and commitments to keep it going over different outlets. 
"The Grand Ole Opry is the mother of country music," Loretta Lynn, an Opry member -- that is, a permanent cast member -- said. "But it'll take more than the owners of WSM to kill country music." 
The show has been a foundation of country music since Nov. 28, 1925, when George D. Hay, a former Memphis newspaperman, introduced an elderly country fiddler named Uncle Jimmy Thompson to the WSM-AM audience on a program Hay first called the WSM Barn Dance. For decades, the Saturday night Opry broadcasts, which could be heard across 38 states thanks to WSM's 50,000-watt signal, were an escape for much of rural America. Young artists living far from Nashville, like Hank Williams in Alabama and Ernest Tubb in Texas, listened faithfully to broadcasts and dreamed of one day appearing on the Opry stage.
Yet many of today's younger artists, like Shania Twain, virtually never play the Opry, preferring more lucrative dates. The radio ratings suffer as a result, notwithstanding the devotion of other contemporary stars like Vince Gill.
Mr. Reed, of Gaylord, said the company's intentions had been misunderstood. He said that national syndication of the Opry would enable it to reach millions of potential listeners, instead of the hundreds of thousands who now tune in.
"One of the reasons we started to look at this whole issue was because of a notion we have that we think the Grand Ole Opry is in fact very, very precious," Mr. Reed said in an interview. "The issue for us is that if you look at the ratings of WSM-AM they've been flat for the last four years, and not very good ratings. We believe the consumer, the listener of music, has generally speaking in the United States migrated to FM formats."
Some experts say that despite the emotion, the move could be a wise one from a financial and ratings standpoint.
"Format decisions at all radio stations -- even legendary stations -- have always been driven by economics," said Lon Helton, the Nashville bureau chief and country editor of the radio trade paper Radio & Records. "That is perhaps more the case now than ever. Top 40 legends -- KHJ/ Los Angeles, WABC/New York and WSL/Chicago, among many, many others -- have all gone through a number of formats since their glory days."
That doesn't assuage the misery of many in this city, though. "It's like losing an old friend," said Hank Locklin, an Opry member since 1960.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a plan to end broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry on WSM-AM in Nashville after 76 years misstated the name of a Chicago radio station that is among famous Top 40 stations that changed their formats. It is WLS, not WSL.

HEADLINE: Allstate Blames High Fraud For 10.5% Auto Rate Rise 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Allstate, the largest auto insurer in New York, said yesterday that it was raising its rates an average of 10.5 percent in the state, underscoring New York's growing problem with fraudulent auto insurance claims.
 The increases, which will average 11.8 percent in the five boroughs of New York City and in Westchester, Rockland, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, suggest that auto insurance prices and fraud will be a hot issue for the State Legislature, which convened yesterday. Elsewhere in New York State, Allstate customers will pay 7.3 percent more for auto insurance. 
 The increases, which have been approved by state regulators, are immediate for new customers, and take effect Feb. 17 for older customers. 
Though the increase in New York City and the nearby counties was more than four times the average price increase for insurers across the state in 2000, the latest year for which full statistics are available, state regulators said they were not surprised.
"This is exactly what we knew was coming," said Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Insurance. "We need some real reform on fraud and abuse."
New York already has the second most expensive auto insurance in the country, with an average cost of $943 per car. But state officials worry that New York may soon surpass New Jersey as the most expensive state for auto insurance at an average of $1,043 per car. Auto insurance has become a rancorous political problem in New Jersey and Gov. George E. Pataki does not want it to become a big issue in New York.
Last year, he and Gregory Serio, the superintendent of insurance, presented a series of changes to the Legislature that were intended to reduce fraud. Many legislators said they recognized fraud as a serious problem, but they were unable to act on a bill before adjourning. Some legislators suggested a special session to deal with auto insurance fraud. But ultimately there was no special session.
State Farm Insurance, the third largest insurer in the state, increased its rates an average of 7.4 percent across the state in November. And the regulators said yesterday that they expected other insurers to raise their rates as well.
Across the country, auto insurance rates rose an average of 6 percent last year, according to Robert Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, as costs for medical treatment and auto repairs rose. The average increase in the previous year was 3 percent.
Nowhere in the country is auto insurance fraud more severe, Mr. Hartwig said. "New York has become the auto insurance fraud capital of the United States," he said. "It is worst in New York City. But Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany are manifesting the same problem."
Mr. Hartwig said that costs to insurers in New York as a result of fraud rose 28.5 percent last year compared with an average of 3.8 percent across the country. Colorado, with an 18 percent increase in claims costs, is one of a handful of other states, including Florida, that are staggering under heavy fraudulent claims.
Most of the fraud centers on medical claims. In one frequent scheme, organized groups stage auto accidents with several people in the cars. The drivers file an accident report with the police to document the crash. Then all the passengers, who usually are not hurt, begin treatment with doctors, chiropractors, radiologists and others, many of whom are often part of the fraud group. Lawyers often organize the groups and sue the insurers if they resist paying claims. 
Under New York's no-fault auto insurance system, insurers provide up to $50,000 in coverage with virtually no questions asked. At present, those involved in crashes may receive treatment for up to six months before notifying their insurer. The insurers contend that leaves a lot of room for fraud. They, along with the governor, have been campaigning to shorten the reporting period to 45 days. But they have been opposed by trial lawyers and some medical professionals.

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Amid a general surge in patent activity, I.B.M. was granted 3,411 patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office last year, the first time any company collected more than 3,000 in a single year.
 I.B.M. led the patent rankings for the ninth consecutive year, according to IFI Claims Patent Services, a research firm. And last year's patent total for I.B.M. represented an increase of nearly 20 percent over 2000, when it had 2,886 patents. 
 I.B.M. is known for pursuing patents and for reaping royalty income from them. With a work force that includes 150,000 engineers and scientists, I.B.M. makes huge investments in research and development to generate innovations that can be patented.
But I.B.M., analysts say, also takes a broad approach to seeking patents. "I.B.M. patents not only things it can manufacture and sell but also things that it knows may be useful to other companies," said Suzanne Harrison, a principal at ICMG, an intellectual property consulting firm in Palo Alto, Calif. "And I.B.M. looks at its patent portfolio much more as a business asset that it can exploit than merely a form of legal protection, as most American companies do."
One byproduct of I.B.M.'s approach is that it collects $1.7 billion a year in royalty income.
More than any other technology company, I.B.M. conducts research across a spectrum of fields -- systems design, software, semiconductors, data storage and materials science. "Our breadth of focus is broader than anyone else's, and we need to have more innovation to fuel the fires," said Nicholas Donofrio, an I.B.M. executive.
Patent activity in general has increased steadily in recent years. The number of patents granted in the United States has increased 60 percent over the last five years, and the number of patent applications has been far greater, said Brigid Quinn, a spokeswoman for the government's patent office.
The rise in patenting has been explained partly by more generous interpretations of what ideas can receive patent protection, especially in areas like software and business methods. The trend has been criticized by industry analysts and scholars as a manifestation of short-sighted business competition that serves to inhibit innovation in the economy as a whole.
Some of the penchant for patents may be silly or a result of misguided competitive zeal, according to Josh Lerner, an economist at the Harvard Business School. But Mr. Lerner also said it seemed that innovation had increased in the United States in recent years and that corporate research labs, like I.B.M.'s, had become more focused on commercially exploitable ideas.
Another explanation is that in the 1990's the rise of the personal computer model of business -- with many competing suppliers making standard components that are then assembled -- had led to more patent activity. A notebook computer, by one estimate, may contain up to 5,000 patented inventions.

HEADLINE: Leader of Former Communists Is Taking Berlin's Economy Post 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The leader of the former Communist Party will be in charge of economics for the new government of the city state of Berlin, he announced today.
 Gregor Gysi, leader of the Party of Democratic Socialism, said he wants to encourage investment in the bankrupt capital, which will be governed by a coalition of the Social Democrats, under Mayor Klaus Wowereit, and his own party, a direct descendant of the East German Communist Party that built the Berlin Wall. 
 Under the articulate and witty Mr. Gysi, the party now enters the political mainstream of reunified Germany. Given Berlin's terrible economic problems -- the old conservative government fell over a banking scandal -- the new responsibilities will be a test for Mr. Gysi and his party. 
Mr. Wowereit's efforts to create a coalition of Greens and Free Democrats fell apart, leaving him to negotiate with Mr. Gysi, whose party received the second largest number of votes in the Oct. 21 elections -- 22.6 percent -- including 48 percent of the vote in the former East Berlin. The Social Democrats won 29.7 percent.
The conservative opposition had its criticism prepared, with Edmund Stoiber, a leading candidate to run for chancellor, saying: "Without Communism there would not be economic misery in the new states. I can only say, 'Good night, Berlin.' " 
Michael Glos, the chairman of Mr. Stoiber's Christian Social Union, said: "This is like naming the arsonist chief fireman," a line often used about Slobodan Milosevic, when the Americans made him the guarantor of the peace settlement in Bosnia.
But others were less concerned. A spokesman for the Berlin Chamber of Industry and Trade, Stefan Siebner, said that given Mr. Wowereit's promise to the former Communists that they would get the post, "it's good that they have sent their most influential politician."
The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, a Social Democrat, opposed a coalition with the Communists because of their stance against the Afghanistan war, but in the end, Mr. Wowereit had no choice, given the different economic policies of the Free Democrats.
Mr. Wowereit has said that 15,000 government jobs must be cut to trim personnel costs by $890 million and help balance the budget by 2006.
Mr. Gysi lamented that it always seemed that reformist communists come to power when conservative parties have left them no money to spend.
Under the coalition agreement struck Monday, the Social Democrats have five portfolios -- interior, finance, education, planning and justice -- and the former Communists, three: economy (including labor and women's affairs), health and culture.
The government should be approved by the Berlin Parliament on Jan. 17.
A key part of the coalition negotiations was a preamble in which the former Communists took a large part of the responsibility for East Germany's past. The party distances itself from the persecution of the Social Democrats after World War II, the suppression of the June 1953 uprising of workers in East Berlin and its role in ordering up the Berlin Wall in 1961. 
The preamble states that the Communists bear "lasting guilt" for the persecution, imprisonment, banishment or death of their political opponents. But Mr. Gysi's party resisted any blanket apology to the victims of the East German regime.
The old Berlin government fell this summer, putting an end to 10 years of rule by the Christian Democrats and has been under temporary rule for nearly six months.

HEADLINE: Argentina's Woes May Strengthen Its Ties to Brazil 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Argentina's decision to devalue the peso is suddenly bringing it closer to its giant neighbor, Brazil, repairing a tattered alliance that strengthens Brazil's bargaining power in trade negotiations with the United States.
 "We expect that after this devaluation, we will be able to develop a more stable relationship with Brazil," Eduardo Amadeo, a spokesman for President Eduardo Duhalde of Argentina, said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires. 
 Not only did Mr. Duhalde send his presidential jet yesterday to pick up the new Brazilian ambassador to Argentina, but he also promised, Mr. Amadeo said, to receive the ambassador immediately "as a gesture of particular unity with our Brazilian neighbors." 
From the Brazilian side came similar expectations that the Argentine devaluation -- if it is successful -- would make possible the revival of a trading bloc, called Mercosur, that in its heyday in the mid-1990's had given the two countries a more powerful voice in negotiations with the United States and Europe. Brazil in particular now competes with the United States in the sale of steel, textiles, citrus, soybeans and machinery.
"The devaluation is a necessary first step toward revitalizing Mercosur," said Arminio Fraga, the president of Brazil's central bank. The devaluation, he added, "kept open the option of a common regional currency" someday for the Mercosur countries, which include Paraguay and Uruguay as minor partners.
To move in that direction, Argentina would have to float the peso successfully, as Brazil now does the real, and the two currencies would have to be relatively stable, as Brazil's now is. So far, Argentina's devaluation is only partial, and with currency exchange houses in Argentina closed yesterday for a third straight day, the market level of the devalued peso has not yet been tested. What's more, the Duhalde government faces a huge struggle to shift into pesos tens of billions of dollars in debt now stated in dollars.
But Mr. Fraga is hopeful, particularly given Argentina's decision to devalue rather than to adopt the American dollar as its national currency, an alternative that had been considered by Fernando de la Rua, who resigned as president last month. "Not dollarizing keeps the possibility of a common currency alive," Mr. Fraga said.
Such friendly gestures this week signal a reversal of the anger and friction that had developed between Argentina and Brazil after Brazil, in 1999, gave up pegging the real to the dollar and devalued sharply. That made production in Brazil far less expensive than in Argentina, which -- until last weekend -- kept the peso pegged to the dollar, one for one, for an entire decade. The peso is now valued at 1.4 to the dollar, but eventually will be floated, the Duhalde government says.
Whatever the future holds, Argentina's decision to devalue comes just as Brazil is casting about for what Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Program at Johns Hopkins University, describes as extra leverage in trade talks with the United States. The Bush administration is pushing for a free trade agreement that would include all of the Western Hemisphere nations.
Congress would have to ratify any trade agreement, and the House of Representatives approved a trade bill last month that, in effect, allows Washington to protect some American industries -- soybeans and citrus are two examples -- from competing Brazilian exports, an action that has generated "tremendous resentment" in Brazil, Mr. Roett says.
The Senate is expected to approve the House bill, and Bush administration officials argue that a revived Mercosur is simply not a viable alternative to a hemispherewide free trade agreement for any Latin American country.
"These countries are going to want a free trade agreement with the United States because it gives them assured access to the biggest market in the world and an economic Good Housekeeping seal of approval," Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said in an interview yesterday.
Still, recognizing Brazil's powerful position as the chief negotiator for its Mercosur neighbors, Mr. Zoellick said that the Congressional bills are not as confrontational as they might seem. They only set up a mechanism for considering issues of concern to domestic producers without actually limiting or taxing imports from Brazil, he said.
"Brazil looks at this and says, 'Aha! It makes it harder for the U.S. to negotiate sensitive items like orange juice,' " Mr. Zoellick said. "My answer is these are always difficult and the purpose of the bills is to establish additional consultative procedures that are necessary to explain and ultimately build more support for a final package."
The Argentine devaluation, injected into this mix, holds out the promise of reviving the Mercosur trade alliance, which in its heyday in the mid-1990's dismantled tariffs among the four member countries while at the same time setting up a protective wall with a tariff that limited imports from outsiders. That gave Brazil's machinery manufacturers, for example, an advantage over the United States and Europe in selling machinery to Argentine companies.
But Mercosur unraveled after Brazil devalued. As foreign companies that had set up operations in Argentina shifted to Brazil, and some Argentine companies did the same, Mr. de la Rua's ministers accused the Brazilians of undermining Mercosur. Trade barriers sprang up between the two countries and Argentina, which had shipped 30 percent of its exports to Brazil, watched those exports shrink, helping to plunge the country into recession.
"Until the year 2000, Argentina still had a favorable trade balance with Brazil," said Julio Nudler, an Argentine economist and journalist, "and then as the problems kept getting worse, Mercosur finally shut down."
Brazil, with nearly five times the population of Argentina and with a gross domestic product more than twice that of Argentina, clearly has the upper hand. Some foreign companies, like the Eaton Corporation, a manufacturer of auto and truck parts with headquarters in Cleveland, have put factories in Brazil in recent years, rather than Argentina. Eaton has three factories in Brazil, to make engine valves, electrical distributors and truck transmissions, and none in Argentina.
That strategy undermined a Mercosur goal of developing an integrated, cross-border auto industry.
"What the devaluation should do is restore competitive balance to Argentine manufacturing operations," said James P. Meil, Eaton's chief economist. "That is the theory, but in real life, the Argentine situation is in flux, both economically and politically, and you are not going to see capital moving into Argentina until things settle down."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
History Shows First 5 Days Can Put Bulls On Right Path

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
One of Wall Street's most noted indicators -- the first five trading days of January -- has sent its signal. And it says that this will be a good year for the stock market.
 When the market goes up during the first five days, "it almost always indicates that the market will go up" during the year, said John McGinley, the editor of Technical Trends, a newsletter published in Wilton, Conn. 
 The indicator was invented for the Dow Jones industrial average, but it has also worked for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Its record for the Nasdaq composite index is more spotty, but it has done a good job in years, like this one, when the Nasdaq average got off to a very good start. 
When all three indexes start the year strongly, as they did this year, the market has usually done well.
During the first five trading days of this year, through Tuesday, the Dow rose 1.3 percent, the S.& P. climbed 1.1 percent, and the volatile Nasdaq composite soared 5.4 percent. It was the third-best start ever for the Nasdaq index. All the indexes slipped yesterday.
There have been 16 years since 1972, the first full year of the Nasdaq composite, when all three indexes rose during the first five days. Of the first 15, 10 ended with all indexes up for the year and 4 others produced gains in at least one of the indexes. Only 1973 turned into a bad year for all the indexes.
For the Nasdaq average, this was the 11th year when the average rose at least 2 percent during the first five sessions. Of the first 10, eight were followed by good years, with the average gaining at least 10 percent more. The years that had declines after strong starts were 1984 and 1987.
Mr. McGinley, who noted that the five-day indicator was first proposed by Yale Hirsch, the editor of the Stock Market Almanac, said that from 1942 through last year, the first five days of new years had shown gains in the Dow in 39 years and declines in 21. Of the 39 rises, the Dow went on to show gains in 32 of the years, while falling in just 7.
The years the indicator missed the Dow were 1966, 1973, 1974, 1981, 1984, 1990 and 2000. 
A look at the failure years shows that they tended to come either around recessions or at major market turning points. The great bull market of the 1950's and 60's began to sputter out in 1966, as the Dow first approached 1,000, a level that was to prove a challenge until it was passed for good in 1982. The worst postwar recession and bear market took place in 1973 and 1974, and there were recessions that began in 1981 and 1990. The 1990's bull market topped out in early 2000.
This year begins with the economy in recession but Wall Street is confident the end of the downturn is near and a strong recovery will follow. If that forecast turns out to be wrong, then the market is likely to suffer.
There is, of course, no particular reason to think that any period as short as five days should provide a reliable market forecast. And the five-day January indicator is not as strong as it looks when one considers that the market goes up in most years. Therefore, any indicator that points to gains is likely to be right much of the time.
Still, there is a correlation. Over the last 60 years, 44 have shown gains for the Dow. That works into a 73 percent rate. But on years when the first five days were up, 82 percent of the years showed gains.
Similarly, in years when the first five days were down, 44 percent of them have turned out to be down years. That is well above the overall average of 27 percent down years.

HEADLINE: In Rough Times, the Rich Go Yachting 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Alan Fields had been thinking about buying a bigger boat. But after the terrorist attacks in September he decided it was time to get serious.
 Last Friday, over lunch in a private Wall Street dining room, he wrote a $1 million check as the final part of a down payment on the pleasure boat of his dreams: a 106-foot-long fiberglass beauty that will be built by Destiny Yachts, a young but fast-growing company here. He expects the final cost to be about $7.8 million. To handle such a huge vessel, he plans to hire a captain and crew and to spend about $300,000 a year in operating costs. 
 "You sit back and say, 'Realistically, how long am I going to live?' " said Mr. Fields, a securities broker in New York with pension funds and major corporations as his clients. "I'm 57. Everybody is vulnerable. You don't throw your money away. But you say, 'Let's enjoy it.' " 
People like Mr. Fields are lifting the spirits of the $25-billion-a-year boat business. For the last two years sales have been weak, depressed by the slumping stock market and, more recently, dampened in the weeks right after the attacks. Major boat-building companies cut back production and offered deals. Sales of the biggest, most expensive yachts, like the one Mr. Fields is buying, continued to rise, though at a slower pace than in 2000.
But the industry's outlook is improving, in part because at least some rich Ameri cans consider a new boat a potential haven in the event of another terrorist attack -- a luxurious 21st-century version of a bunker in the backyard.
Manufacturers and brokers say there has been a flurry of business in the last six weeks, and the New York National Boat Show, a bellwether for nearly a century, got off to a flying start last weekend at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.
Some companies said they sold more boats in the first two days of the show this year than they had in the whole week of last year's show. Another test for the industry will come next month, at the Miami Boat Show, a showcase for the largest yachts.
"We really won't know for three or four weeks if we're out of this, if business is returning," said Pete Woods, who leads one of the busiest branches of MarineMax Inc., a national yacht dealer at the Pier 66 Marina here, a floating showroom for new and used yachts and a winter resting place for pleasure craft from around the world.
"But the signs are that we very well could be," said Mr. Woods, who has been in the business for more than 30 years. "Right now, we're extremely encouraged."
After the September attacks, many in the industry expected the bottom to fall out of the market. Sales of smaller boats did suffer. But Jim Gilbert, the editor in chief of ShowBoats International, a bimonthly magazine devoted to yachts more than 80 feet in length, said he discovered that rather than canceling orders, the wealthiest customers were asking boatyards to speed up production. They wanted the yachts as redoubts for themselves and their families.
"There is nothing more secure in the world than your own floating island," Mr. Gilbert said. "You have your own security. You determine your own schedule."
Robert Dean, director of marketing and sales at Broward Yachts, another maker of big yachts, said that immediately after the attacks, some South Florida families climbed aboard their yachts more than 100 feet long and headed for the Bahamas. "They weren't sure what was going on," he said.
At the top end of the market, Broward Yachts, formerly known as Broward Marine, was one of the hardest hit. It was sold by its founding family three years ago, and the new owners have been struggling to find their stride. At Broward's huge construction hangar in Dania Beach, Fla., just south of here, crews are working on four multimillion-dollar vessels.
"In a perfect world," Mr. Dean said, "all our boats would be sold and we would be building only on order." But none have been.
Still, things may be looking up for Broward as well. In mid-December, a retired manufacturing executive from Michigan signed a letter of intent to buy one of the vessels -- a 106-foot-long motor yacht that is expected to be completed in 10 months. And Mr. Dean said he had spoken with half a dozen other potential buyers in the last few weeks. 
At Pier 66 on Saturday morning, a retired chief executive of a national airline and his wife boarded the 65-foot motor yacht Mr. Loui. A professional captain maneuvered it through Port Everglades, its chrome and stainless-steel fittings glittering under a winter sun. Several miles out, the executive, who agreed to talk only if he was not identified, put the 1998 Hatteras through some tight turns in moderately rough seas. He liked the feel of it. His wife was comfortable, he said, and as they headed back to the dock, they decided that the $1.78 million boat was for them.
Only a couple of months ago, the executive said, he would not have considered buying the yacht. "But now," he said, "I believe the economy has bottomed out and is on its way back."
Immediately after the September attacks, he said, he thought that big, showy purchases were inappropriate. "But we just have to move on," he said.
A few hours later, a man who has made a fortune providing services to magazine publishers, led his wife, their two small children and a nephew aboard a brand new 86-foot-long Hatteras sport fisher selling for $5.75 million. 
With a professional captain at the helm most of the time, they powered out into the Atlantic, its radar glowing green and amber.
The twin 1,800-horsepower diesel engines were a distant murmur. The galley, bigger than the kitchens of many Manhattan apartments, had a full-size refrigerator and a stove. As with the five bathrooms, or heads, its counters were cut from thick granite, and the floor was a mosaic of fine marble. 
"Jiminy, this is a nice boat," said the head of the family, who spoke on condition that his privacy be preserved. Within a few hours, the yacht was his.
Boat industry executives said the last couple of years had been the worst for business since the early 90's, when Congress briefly imposed a 10 percent luxury tax on yachts. Outboard Marine, the second-largest builder of outboard motors, filed for bankruptcy at the end of 2000, and last spring Brunswick, one of the largest makers of pleasure boats, announced that it was shutting down eight plants.
According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, boat sales were down 2 percent in 2000 and a further 6 percent last year. Orders for the biggest yachts rose 18 percent in 2001, to 507 boats, a survey by ShowBoats International found, though that was down from a 31 percent increase the previous year.
With those sales, most of the big yacht makers are feeling pretty good. "We have added contracts at a rate greater than our current ability to produce boats," said Ed Weiner, who nearly five years ago founded Destiny Yachts, the company that will build Mr. Fields's boat.
Like many buyers of big yachts, Mr. Fields said he expected to charter his new boat for part of the year to cover the annual operating costs. He figures that he can get about $50,000 to $60,000 a week for his. But he said he was not looking to make a profit and he was not fretting about the inevitable depreciation.
Aboard the 86-foot Hatteras sport fisher last weekend, the publishing executive who was falling in love with the vessel said that dollars-and-cents were a minor factor when it came to deciding whether to own a giant yacht.
"You can't make a sound economic judgment," he said, leaning back on a plush couch in bare feet and khaki slacks. "You sit down with a legal pad and try to make economic sense of it, and you just can't get there."

HEADLINE: McGreevey Picks Treasurer As Financial Picture Darkens 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Governor-elect James E. McGreevey announced his choice for state treasurer today, then welcomed the new cabinet member with some most unwelcome news: the state's tax revenues in December were a half-billion dollars less than expected, meaning that the budget shortfall for the current fiscal year could top $2.5 billion.
 Since the day he was elected, Mr. McGreevey and his transition team have sounded incessant alarms about New Jersey's impending financial problems, originally predicting a deficit of at least $1.4 billion. With Mr. McGreevey's inauguration less than a week away, and December's drop in revenues totaling more than the declines of the previous five months combined, his transition team has increased its projections for the size of the budget gap and begun using the word crisis to describe the situation. 
 New Jersey's constitution forbids the state from operating at a deficit, so Mr. McGreevey said he was considering a range of measures to close the budget gap, including the possibility of declaring a three-month tax amnesty period this spring. An amnesty period in 1996 brought $360 million in unanticipated revenues into state coffers, but it is unclear how much a similar plan would generate next year.
Speaking at a news conference to introduce John E. McCormac, his appointee for state treasurer, Mr. McGreevey said he could not rule out the possibility that state workers might face layoffs. "Literally, everything is on the table," he said. 
But Mr. McGreevey, who pledged not to raise taxes during his campaign, will stand firm on that pledge, said Anthony Coscia, who is heading the governor-elect's budget review process. 
Republicans, who relinquish control of state government this month after a decade in power, blamed the national recession and the aftershocks of the Sept. 11 terror attacks for the disappointing downturn in tax revenues. Many Republicans have complained that the incoming McGreevey administration is exaggerating the severity of the budget problems to prepare the public for a period of austerity and lower the expectations of contractors, union leaders and others who might be seeking state funds.
Tom Wilson, a spokesman for former Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, said that even though December's tax revenues were $505 million less than expected when the $22.9 billion budget was adopted last June, the state still had $1.1 billion in its reserve fund. 
"Managing the state's finances is going to require the same kind of budget discipline in the future that this administration has used since Sept. 11," he said.
But Mr. Coscia said that other unanticipated spending by the state had already depleted the reserve fund. "The surplus has been wiped out," he said. "It's gone." 
While the entire country is suffering through a recession, and states across the Northeast have been hard hit, Mr. Coscia said New Jersey was particularly vulnerable because it depended heavily on capital gains taxes for its revenue. But capital gains collections have dropped significantly, he said, because of the uneven performance of the stock market.
Mr. McCormac, who worked as the business administrator for Woodbridge Township when Mr. McGreevey was mayor there, said he would conduct a line-by-line review of the current budget beginning at 8 a.m. on Jan. 16, the day after the new governor is sworn in. 
Mr. McGreevey also announced two other cabinet appointments today: Mayor Susan Bass Levin of Cherry Hill will serve as commissioner of community affairs, and Bradley M. Campbell, former regional administrator for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, has been named the state's new commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection.

HEADLINE: Despite Uncertain Times, Parents See Private School as a Necessity 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
Ten parents showed up punctually at 8:30 a.m. yesterday at the Calhoun School on the Upper West Side for a tour of the private school where their 4-year-olds were applying.
 Julianna Ostrovsky had lost her job as an art designer for the Gap and Old Navy clothing stores as a result of the economic downturn after Sept. 11. Christopher Fisher, a massage therapist, and his wife, Cynthia Kolbowski, a counselor, had seen their businesses suffer, but like the rest of the parents, they considered it a must to send their children to a private school. 
 "Maybe the effects of the recession will be there next year," said one mother, unwilling to give her name because she had applied to 11 schools, "but most parents are still hanging in there." 
Indeed, despite the startling fluctuations in the stock markets, the slashing of year-end bonuses and the layoffs on Wall Street, affluent New Yorkers are still eager to send their children to the city's private schools, many of which charge more than $20,000 a year in tuition for a single child. 
"We are seeing a healthy flow this year," said Frederick C. Calder, executive director of the New York State Association of Independent Schools, which says half its members are in New York City. "The number of applications are similar to those of last year. People can do away with vacations, S.U.V.'s and other frills. It would take them a while to get to the point where they have to make cuts on their kids' education." 
Last year was a frantic time. Directors of admissions at schools like Brearley, Grace Church, Brooklyn Friends and Allen-Stevenson were inundated with applications, which reached record levels at most of the city's more than 70 independent schools. Parents lined up at doors, begging for spots for their children. There were simply too many applicants and too few spots. To many of the well-educated and handsomely paid parents, in the flush times of the last few years, nothing seemed to matter more than their children's admission into their first-choice school.
Times have changed. But "the phones are still ringing, people are still sending me letters and knocking on our door to ask for a spot," said Steven J. Nelson, headmaster of the Calhoun School, which has received 190 applications -- a quarter more than last year -- for 15 openings in its kindergarten.
Not that the well-off parents of New York have been immune to the effects of Sept. 11. The attack left some less able to afford the expense, but it also created an uncertain atmosphere that made the security and intimacy of private schools more attractive to parents.
"I think my child will feel safer at a private school at this time of uncertainty," said another mother touring Calhoun with Ms. Kolbowski. "My child will be more closely watched, and the teachers will know him better." Having applied to 19 schools for her son to ensure his admission to at least one, she insisted on anonymity.
She cringed even at the suggestion of sending her child to a public school. She has been following the news, and said that the education budget was being cut and that repairs would be approved only for the worst buildings. If her child went to Calhoun, she said, there would be one teacher for every six pupils.
"Many New York parents feel they don't have a viable alternative," said Mr. Calder, of the independent schools association. "If they lived in a suburb with good public schools, they might pull their children out of the private ones."
It is not unusual for applications to lag behind an economic downturn, he said. Even if parents are hurt by the recession, "they usually hope to ride it out."
The schools are also in a better financial position to help families who may lack the means to pay the full tuition. During the last decade, almost all of the city's private schools received big donations and increased their endowments.
"Most independent schools have deeper pockets for financial aid," said George Davison, headmaster of Grace Church School, where the number of applications is in line with last year's. "We are able to serve an economically diverse population."
The big changes wrought by Sept. 11 have affected the admissions process in intangible ways, said numerous admissions directors. 
"Parents are feeling a little less stress about getting their children into 'the' school," said Elizabeth Manley Murray, director of admissions at the Brearley School, where applications are at the same level as last year. "They are less anxious about the process."
Mr. Davison concurs. "People gained a little perspective that they didn't before on what's important in life," he said. "Fewer people believe that where their children go to school reflects on their own social statuses."

HEADLINE: Revisiting the Disabilities Act 

 BODY:
It is often said that bad cases make bad law. Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling narrowing the scope of the Americans With Disabilities Act shows that a well-intentioned but imprecise law can generate valid court decisions that nevertheless frustrate the spirit of the statute. There is little to fault in the unanimous decision. The problem lies in the law's language. Congress can and should find a way to eliminate the confusion it inadvertently sowed.
 The disabilities act was passed in 1990 with broad bipartisan support and much acclaim. It recognized that those with a range of physical and emotional limitations had been increasingly marginalized in American society both because of prejudice and failure to make simple modifications for them. Regarding the workplace, the idea was that if someone is qualified for a job but has a disability or develops one while working, an employer should make a reasonable accommodation. The law makes clear that bigger companies must accommodate more than smaller ones but no company should be unduly burdened. 
 The case of Ella Williams and Toyota that was reviewed by the Supreme Court fits the law's aims and requirements well. Shortly after starting work on a Toyota assembly line, Ms. Williams developed carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful repetitive stress injury, in her arms. Toyota shifted her job and she was fine for three years in her new post. Then the company added tasks that made her injury flare up anew. The two sides disagree on what happened next, but Ms. Williams ultimately stopped going to work and Toyota fired her. 
There is every reason to expect that Ella Williams should have the legal protection to keep her job. A Toyota plant has many tasks that would not aggravate her injury. Her situation was just what the law's framers had in mind -- a company should be expected to modify the conditions of someone's work within reasonable limits. Accommodating Ms. Williams would have been neither difficult nor expensive for Toyota.
Unfortunately, like previous cases on the same law, this case turned on the definition of "disability" enshrined in the law itself. The law defines a disability as an impairment that "substantially limits one or more of the major life activities." Stretching that slightly, the court ruled that for a workplace injury to qualify as a disability it must prevent or restrict someone "from performing tasks that are of central importance to most people's daily lives."
That seems reasonable enough. We don't want to classify half the nation as disabled. As Justice Antonin Scalia asked in oral argument last November, if someone can't extend her elbow, is that enough to bring her into the category of the handicapped? 
Of course not. But carpal tunnel syndrome is no trivial matter, and suffering from it should not make someone unemployable or turn her into a worker's compensation case. In a post-welfare world, the country should be pursuing policies that keep people employed. 
There are two streams of cases emerging in the federal courts on this law, and they pose a kind of Catch-22. One stream has made it increasingly difficult to declare an impairment to be a disability. But the other says that if you are not disabled, you are not protected from employment discrimination. This is not what was intended by the law's framers. 
Congress should either revisit the Americans With Disabilities Act and clarify its language or pass a new law that protects people like Ms. Williams. It should also bring the law down hard on unworthy disability lawsuits plaguing the courts and scaring employers. Most companies are trying to do the right thing by their employees. Congress should help them.

HEADLINE: A Very Different Council Ushers In New Leadership 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
On a day that City Hall took on the air of the beginning of a fall semester, the City Council formally elected its first new speaker in more than a decade, amended some of its operating rules, created an initial committee and named its minority leader.
 "The smooth democratic transition which we are witnessing today has proven the critics wrong and sends a strong message that the Council, as an institution, is stronger and more unified than ever," said Gifford Miller after being elected unanimously as speaker. Calling the Council "the people's voice," Mr. Miller praised the diversity of a body that now includes community activists, clergy members and educators. 
 The selection of Mr. Miller, 32, completes the near-wholesale change in the city's leadership brought about this year by term limits, including the mayor, more than two-thirds of the City Council, the city comptroller, the public advocate and four borough presidents.
Considered the second-most powerful position in the city, the speaker has broad powers to set the legislative agenda, as well as discretion over coveted committee chairmanships and leadership positions, each of which has traditionally carried an extra stipend, ranging from $2,500 to $29,000, above a council member's $90,000 a year salary. For his role, the former speaker, Peter F. Vallone, earned an extra $39,500.
In stark contrast to Mr. Vallone, who ran the Council for 15 years, Mr. Miller will serve for only 2, unless the term limits law is changed. Yesterday, he said it was premature to discuss whether he would work to have the law repealed, preferring to focus on the more immediate challenges facing the city like education, housing, public safety and the economy.
"The attacks and slowing economy have placed our city in a precarious situation," he told his colleagues. "We have lost thousands of jobs. We face the largest budget gaps since the crisis of the mid-1970's. And the problems confronting our city before Sept. 11 also continue to demand our attention."
Mr. Miller's selection as speaker had been all but certain since the weekend, when agreements were reached among the Democratic leaders in Queens and the Bronx, union officials and council members themselves. Now comes the tricky task of satisfying the competing desires of any number of officials, inside and out of the Council, who can all claim a role in Mr. Miller's success. In addition, there are advocates for special interests like labor, the environment and tenants who are lobbying members to lobby Mr. Miller for particular committee posts.
But yesterday, the public face of the Council was striking in its unanimity, the result of endless rounds of private meetings and negotiations about Mr. Miller's post as well as a package of rules changes proposed by a group called the Fresh Democracy Council. The amendments, passed by the newly named Committee on Rules, Privileges and Elections, were intended to make it more difficult for the speaker to bottle up bills or show favoritism to certain council members. That committee, with a Queens freshman and Miller supporter, Leroy G. Comrie, at its helm, will hash out the rest of the Council's leadership in the coming weeks.
The meeting itself, at which James S. Oddo of Staten Island was elected minority leader, at times lurched giddily along, with Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum laughing and struggling with her microphone and Councilman Bill Perkins chuckling in answering the opening roll call. But it was Charles Barron of Brooklyn, a former Black Panther, who perhaps proved the best harbinger of the more lively body that several council members promised would come.
Noting that the speaker and the mayor were white men from Manhattan, Mr. Barron, who has said he would seek legislation to line City Hall's walls with portraits of African-American and Latino historical figures, gave the new speaker a hammer and picture hooks so that he could start hanging portraits of the "brothers and sisters."

An Online Financial Pioneer Acquires Bricks and Mortar

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ 

 BODY:
E*Trade was an amiable host to the late-90's Nasdaq trading bash. With its cheap commissions and consumer-friendly stock-trading Web site, the company was one of the online pioneers that empowered millions of Americans to take on Wall Street pros. Like few others, E*Trade's advertising campaigns captured tech investors' irrational exuberance. It was only two years ago that E*Trade aired Super Bowl spots starring a dancing chimpanzee ("Well, we just wasted two million bucks" was its punchline) and an emergency-room patient who had "money coming out the wazoo."
 Stock market investors have lost some $4.5 trillion since then, in the market's first two consecutive down years since the early 1970's, so it comes as no surprise to find E*Trade a bit chastened. The most prominent pitch on its Web site these days does not tout low commissions, real-time stock quotes or the notion that it's idiotic to consult a broker. Rather, it offers a 2.5 percent annual rate on a three-month certificate of deposit. Hangovers are dreary affairs, and financial ones are no exception. 
 For a nostalgic taste of the more frenzied aspirations of the dot-com bubble, visit the E*Trade Center on Madison Avenue. Though it did not open until last April, 13 months after the Nasdaq hit an all-time high that it is unlikely to revisit any time soon, the facility is a three-story chrome-and-glass shrine to the trading fever that overcame the country in the last months of the 20th Century. 
The E*Trade Center is as radical a departure from traditional brokerage offices as the now ubiquitous mega-bookstores were from traditional booksellers not long ago, and it too has a cafe inside. It is a place to hang out, grab a snack and pick up some MSFT or CSCO. Easy chairs and laptops are strewn about for your trading pleasure. Flat-panel screens are tuned into CNBC and its stock ticker, even in the bathroom.
A new Lexus is on display near the upstairs cafe, oddly enough. It's a promotional prize, reinforcing the space's sense of whimsy, reminiscent of the sportsbooks at Las Vegas casinos, the places where bettors make their sports wagers. Pick a team and watch the action onscreen.
But with the Nasdaq still 3,000 points, or 60 percent, below its peak, it was a rather quiet sportsbook when I dropped in recently during trading hours. In the nearly deserted basement reserved for hard-core day traders, two men argued over whether JDS Uniphase would soon take off again. It brought to mind those stories of Japanese soldiers still entrenched on remote South Pacific islands long after World War II had ended. 
E*Trade has moved on, even if some of its customers have not. It has become as much a bank as a brokerage. Kiosks and salesmen on the ground floor not only provide advice about investing in stocks, they also peddle prosaic banking offerings like mortgages and C.D.'s. Stodgy companies may have once been desperate to transform themselves into dot-coms, but now the opposite is happening. 
E*Trade's very presence in the physical world, in one of Manhattan's prime retail locations no less, would have been an act of heresy for an Internet pioneer such as itself a few years back. This revolution, after all, was about making brick-and-mortar businesses obsolete. 
Now E*Trade is mimicking the strategy of Charles Schwab and others that have blended online businesses with branch offices. Not only is the company opening showcases in major cities, it is also opening outlets in Target discount stores in places like Trussville, Ala. 
This strategy of becoming more than just an online trading floor for CNBC addicts accounts for E*Trade's relative financial health, surprising for a poster child of the dot-com bubble. The company's stock price actually rose in 2001 and it will once again sponsor this year's halftime Super Bowl show. It may be one of only two or three dot-com Super Bowl advertisers, down from 22 in 2000. 
E*Trade would have been doomed had it continued relying entirely on low-cost stock trades. In its earnings report issued last October, the company indicated that the number of its customers' brokerage transactions had fallen in the quarter that ended in September to 5.3 million from 9.4 million a year earlier. Customers' investment assets had shrunk to $36.3 billion from $61.3 billion a year earlier. E*Trade reports its latest quarterly earnings next Monday. 
To the extent that E*Trade's news is positive, it is largely because it has become a lot less reliant on trading commissions. Too bad not all of its customers were as willing to diversify in time.

HEADLINE: Kelly Plans to Cut Money For Overtime Police Patrols 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
Facing a budget crisis, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday that he planned to significantly reduce the additional patrols that for two years have been financed by a $172 million overtime program in which officers worked on their days off.
 The department currently has $24 million to pay for the program from January to March. Mr. Kelly said he planned to stretch that money so that the program, known as Operation Condor, could continue into June, effectively halving the amount available for the patrols over the next six months. At its height, the program paid for an additional 1,000 officers on the street each day. 
 Operation Condor, which has been criticized for its cost and sometimes aggressive tactics, was credited by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani with maintaining record crime declines. It was instituted in early 2000 by Howard Safir, then the commissioner, and continued by his successor, Bernard B. Kerik.
But yesterday, Mr. Kelly, in a wide-ranging briefing with reporters, said he thought the department of 40,000 officers could keep crime down without the additional overtime spending for Operation Condor.
"I think the resources are adequate in the department to do the job," he said. Later, his spokesman, Michael O'Looney, said the department would try to maintain patrol strength through efficiency.
Even as he acknowledged the budgetary constraints, Mr. Kelly said there were some things that the department could not do without. Among them, he said, are increased counterterrorism training and new equipment, like protective suits and radiation detectors, which he expects will be paid for by the federal government, and an upgrade for the department's computer systems.
In focusing on the department's technology, Mr. Kelly noted that the 55,000-person agency had no systemwide e-mail. "I don't think you can find an organization in this country that size that doesn't have e-mail," he said.
Mr. Kelly said he hoped to draw on the expertise of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to improve the department's computer, communications and technology systems, areas in which solutions have long eluded department managers. Mr. Kelly said he would also try to solve some of those problems with outside contractors.
The commissioner also said he planned to hire an outside consultant to evaluate the department's response to the World Trade Center attack, to better prepare should the city suffer another terrorist attack.
"What lessons should we learn from Sept. 11?" he said. "What did we do that we don't want to do again?" He said he was seeking an objective examination to supplement department reports prepared after the attack.
That preparation and understanding will likely be invaluable in the future, Mr. Kelly said, as the city faces other challenges. 
Later this month, the city will play host to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, normally held in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Kelly said the meeting could draw radical protesters and would mean a major personnel commitment for the department.
The planned overtime reductions will hit officers, detectives and supervisors who have gone without a raise for years despite record crime declines, which the police unions say were hard won by their members.
Thomas Scotto, the president of the Detectives Endowment Association, said that most of his members understood that the city was facing a budget crisis and that overtime was often the first area to be reviewed. But he said the impact of the cuts remained to be seen. 
"Can the members keep the levels of arrests and reduction in crime at the same levels?" he asked. "That's the question." 
Last year, the department spent as much as $10 million a month on the Condor program, in which officers are assigned to work a sixth day in a week to bolster the police presence on city streets, officials said. For the next six months, the department will have only about $4 million a month to spend, so commanders will be able to assign far fewer officers to the additional patrols.
Mr. O'Looney said Commissioner Kelly had assigned Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of department, to examine how to make the most of the remaining Condor money and keep as many officers on patrol as possible.
Asked about past police administrations that spent far beyond their overtime budgets and kept returning to the City Council and City Hall to ask for additional money, Mr. Kelly pointed to the economic downturn that preceded Sept. 11.
"So they may have done that in the past, and, hey, God bless them, it was good they were able to do that," he said. "But it's just different now."

HEADLINE: Memories of Welfare Days Differ For Agency Head and Her Mother 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The city's new welfare commissioner, Verna Eggleston, learned about both work and welfare at her mother's knee. She was 9 months old when her father walked out on the family in the Bronx. Her mother, unable to pay rent and feed seven children on a housecleaner's wages, turned to public assistance. 
 In an interview yesterday, Ms. Eggleston proudly recalled how her mother, now retired, reacted to the news of her appointment by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to head the Human Resources Administration. 
 "She said, 'Oh, that's wonderful,' " Ms. Eggleston recalled. " 'I'm so glad that you're returning to the place that helped me to help you.' "
But how much and how long the family was helped by Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the federal program dismantled by the 1996 welfare overhaul, depends on whether the commissioner or her mother is telling the story. Ms. Eggleston, 45, who describes herself as an African-American Republican with conservative views, said her mother left welfare after "a short time." But her mother, Dorothy Eggleston, 76, said she received family assistance for 17 years, starting the year Verna was born.
The daughter said that the elder Ms. Eggleston's work ethic prompted her to demand training as a practical nurse and that she worked as many as four jobs at once to support the children and send them to college. 
The commissioner's mother, in a telephone interview from her home in Pineville, S.C., said that despite the city's compulsory work training programs and her housecleaning jobs, she continued to need the family aid to pay rent on the family's apartment in Clason Point Gardens, a public housing project in the Bronx. 
Not until 1973, she said, after "the government paid for me to go to nursing school," was she able to leave the rolls for good.
At heart, both accounts are about a valiant mother who did right by her children, four girls and three boys, all of whom became self-supporting. But these days, the details of such a family's life are charged with political meaning, as the city faces the first test of its welfare overhaul in a recession. 
By day's end yesterday, efforts to reconcile the two accounts culminated in a conference call arranged by the commissioner, in which she repeatedly interrupted her mother's replies with her own version of events.
"The department of public assistance did not subsidize my life to become commissioner," she said, after insisting that public aid during her childhood might have consisted mainly of surplus cheese.
Her mother quietly repeated that a check from the government covered the family's rent throughout. "I wasn't making enough to take care of my kids," she said. 
Ms. Eggleston, who most recently directed the Hetrick-Martin Institute in Manhattan, a social service agency serving gay young people, is almost unknown among veterans of the welfare overhaul debate. As an African-American Republican, she is also a bit of an enigma in the world of social services, even among some who knew her as a hands-on administrator of homeless shelters and group homes for foster children in the 1980's.
"Verna is smart as a whip, very savvy, forceful and viscerally familiar with those on the margins of society," said Poul Jensen, now president of Graham Windham, one of the city's oldest nonprofit foster care agencies, in an e-mail message. "She's fully capable of managing a behemoth like H.R.A., in my view."
Mr. Jensen, who was deputy commissioner of the city's Child Welfare Administration when Ms. Eggleston was in charge of group homes for foster children, said he did not know where Ms. Eggleston stood on various policy questions, but added, "My sense of her as a person and human service advocate prompts me to believe that she will likely move to extend and humanize legitimate efforts to decrease dependency, and when dependency is appropriate, move to secure it, humanize it and, if affordable, extend it."
Ms. Eggleston, who impressed Mr. Bloomberg after she left Hetrick-Martin to work as a paid consultant on his campaign, said her goals included continuing to reduce the welfare rolls. But she added that she did not want the successes of her administration to become the problems of the Department of Homeless Services and the foster care system. "I haven't forgotten where I came from," she said.
In her mother's account, the family was on the verge of homelessness when public assistance stepped in, housing the Egglestons in a public project within three months of her first application for help. 
But the commissioner does not recall feeling poor. She recalled that her mother hired people to help the children with their homework while she was cleaning other people's houses, which the mother verified.
"She strategically identified a set of godparents for each one of us," Ms. Eggleston said of her mother. All were middle-class black people, hers a runway model and an engineer who were deeply involved in her life. 
"Talk about a village raising a child." 
Ms. Eggleston went to the city's Performing Arts High School, but soon left, disenchanted, she said, by the limitations she experienced because of race. "The only play they would let me do was 'Raisin in the Sun,' " she said. "I wanted to do Bertolt Brecht."
She went on to Adlai Stevenson High School in the Bronx, during a period when most of the school's students were white and racial relations were tense, and later worked her way through college in the New York State system, in part with a federally sponsored job doing theater in state prisons. That work led to her career in human services.
One day, 21 years after her father's disappearance on Oct. 13, 1956, she was called by the authorities to claim his body. By then, she said, she was the only Eggleston in the telephone book in the Bronx. 
Her mother said her estranged husband was a World War II veteran who had good jobs as a store window display decorator in the 1950's. But the police told her he died homeless. Unknown to the family, she said, he had been sleeping in a Hunts Point junkyard, not far from the housing project where they lived. 
Ms. Eggleston asked that she not be stereotyped based on her childhood. "Don't put me in a box," the commissioner said. "Why can't I just be judged as an administrator?"

HEADLINE: Rise in Mortgage Applications Gains Force 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Applications for mortgage loans surged to a record last week, suggesting that the housing market showed few signs of stalling. 
 Home buyers taking advantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates close to 7 percent led to a 27.9 percent increase in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's purchase index, to a level of 375.9 in the week ended Friday. 
 If the total pace of 6.14 million new and existing homes sold from January through November was sustained in December, last year's sales will break the record 6.09 million in 1999.
"Housing is one of the saving graces of this recession," said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research in New York. 
Refinancing applications also increased. The refinancing index, which reached a record high in November, rose 32.6 percent, to 1,703.7 last week.
The increases in purchase and refinancing applications pushed the group's mortgage applications index up 29.9 percent, to 570.7 last week. It was the highest reading in a month.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Pataki's Speech: Pledges of Unity and Fiscal Responsibility 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Gov. George E. Pataki's annual address to the Legislature in Albany yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times.
 Majority Leader Bruno, Speaker Silver, and to the members of this great Legislature, I thank you for the spirit of cooperation you have helped to foster. 
 Since Sept. 11, partisanship has given way to a new spirit of unity. That doesn't have to change and it shouldn't change, because New Yorkers need us to stay united. 
People want an end to partisan politics, and they deserve it. 
I pledge to work with you to keep that unified spirit alive for as long as I am governor. And in speaking of unity, I know we are all solidly united in our unwavering resolve to meet the challenges we now face.
The human cost of Sept. 11 was devastating. Only time's healing touch, and a continued outpouring of compassion and support, can ease the profound suffering that has been inflicted upon so many New Yorkers.
Addressing the other costs -- the economic fallout, the damage to our state's finances, and the security threat to the public -- will require more than that. It will take time. It will take perseverance. It will require courage. And it will require new laws to protect us from further acts of terrorism. . . .
Today, New York's war against crime is being fought, not just on our own streets, but on an international stage. . . .
Before I outline what I intend to do, let me tell you what we're not going to do.
We're not going to sell prisons to ourselves to balance the budget. We're not going to slash education funding in the middle of the school year. We're not going to use fiscal gimmicks to conceal reality.
In short, we are not going to resort to any of the irresponsible measures that were taken in prior years, when the circumstances were not nearly as grave as they are today.
And unlike 1989, unlike 1990, 1991, '92, '93 and 1994, we will not delay tax cuts.
Tony, it was great to see you standing on that side of the aisle Assemblyman Anthony Seminerio, a Democrat from Queens . Tax cuts will go forward. They must go forward, because we know that tax cuts create jobs.
This year, next year and beyond, we will cut taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars. It's what our economy needs, and what our people deserve.
It is these policies, guided by the principles of fiscal prudence and lower taxes, that have provided us with the economic momentum and fiscal discipline necessary to withstand the events of Sept. 11. . . .
Senator Bruno, Speaker Silver, my colleagues here in the Legislature, I applaud you for proposing no increase in spending for the Assembly and the Senate operations in the fiscal year that begins April 1.
Stop grumbling. It's the right thing to do. It is that kind of responsible nonpartisanship that New Yorkers want from us. And we're going to give it to them.
Later this month, I will submit a budget that reflects the challenges we face. It's a budget that, of necessity, not only holds the line on spending, but reduces general fund spending substantially.
We've made these decisions before, and they were the right decisions. We reduced spending in 1995, and it was the first step toward ending the crisis we inherited.
Now, the new challenges before us demand that we do it again so we can lead New York out of the financial crisis we face today.

HEADLINE: Dream Car: A Dressed-Up Skateboard 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
THE car of the future, according to General Motors, will have its engine encased in the floor and need no gasoline. It will also have a body and interior that can be replaced as moods change, electronically connected components instead of mechanical parts, and a power source that can serve your home from the driveway. 
 A mockup of the car is on display here this week at the North American International Auto Show. This concept vehicle, called the Autonomy, has few moving parts other than the wheels and is part of G.M.'s continuing research into cars powered by fuel cells, a source that holds the promise of emitting only water and heat by relying on hydrogen instead of gas. 
 Most automakers, including G.M., are putting a greater emphasis on ways to make fuel cells fit into conventional cars and trucks. An experimental pickup truck shown by G.M. in August had a fuel cell that took up a bit more than a third of its bed. But adapting it to cars will be costly.
"I think, by the end of the decade, we'll see hundreds of thousands of fuel cells on the road," said Lawrence D. Burns, G.M.'s vice president for research and development. Whatever the timetable, the emphasis is shared by the Bush administration, which chose the auto show as the occasion to offer a fuel-economy plan focusing on fuel-cell development. 
Aside from its effort to squeeze fuel cells into conventional cars, trucks and buses, G.M. had a separate team of engineers and designers envision a vehicle unfettered by the constraints of the automobile, which for a century has been designed around an internal combustion engine and mechanical parts.
The result is a vehicle that comes in two parts. The first is what G.M. engineers call the skateboard, a six-inch-thick platform encasing the engine and the car's computer system. The body, including the seats and interior, will perch on the platform, with features like braking, steering and acceleration controlled digitally by electrical impulses.
At a recent demonstration, G.M. engineers showed a mockup of the skateboard, which was almost 15 feet long and shaped like a flattened carafe, with Goodyear tires and several thin, parallel heating vents curving up each side. The second part, the body, looked like a sci-fi version of a Formula One racecar. 
G.M. envisions that the skateboard will last about 20 years, with the body popped off and replaced with a version customized to the owner's tastes far more often. "This is like a blank canvas, and you can paint whatever you want on top," said Adrian Chernoff, a program architect on the project, adding that the body could be switched "in the time it takes for an oil change."
Mr. Burns said that G.M. hoped to produce a working prototype of the Autonomy by the end of the year, but with an 11-inch-thick skateboard, to fit hydrogen tanks large enough for a trip of 100 to 150 miles.
Such a vehicle would drastically alter automobile assembly, raising questions like who would make the bottom and who would make the top. 
Of course, concept cars often resemble an era's vision of the future more than the actual future. G.M.'s Firebird concepts of the 1950's paid homage to a booming airline industry, with turbine engines and tail fins that made it seem as if the cars were made from spare parts of fighter jets. Other concepts featured cool gizmos that never made it into production, like the rear-view camera mounted on the back of the 1956 vision of the Buick Centurion.
As for the fuel cell, the major automakers tout it as a silver-bullet answer to many of the problems that now cause their industry to butt heads with environmental groups. In their ideal form, fuel cells would replace gasoline with hydrogen and emit only water and heat. The cells strip electrons from hydrogen atoms and use them as an electrical current, then reform the hydrogen atoms, combining them with oxygen to form water vapor. The technology could in principle be as useful in supplying power to homes and industry as in powering vehicles.
So far, however, the fuel cell has mainly served only as an argument against regulatory pressure to make short-term improvements in fuel economy. At a Senate commerce committee hearing in December, G.M.'s vice president for product development, Thomas J. Davis, cited fuel cell research as a reason that existing fuel economy standards should not be raised. 
The standards have not significantly changed for more than a decade, and fuel economy gains have been reversed in recent years as sales of trucks have overtaken sales of cars. To address the issue, the Clinton administration emphasized development of high-mileage gasoline-fueled vehicles, a goal on which the big three automakers have been spending $1 billion a year.
"We'd rather take those dollars and move to solutions like the fuel cell faster," Mr. Burns of G.M. said in an interview. And that, in essence, is the vision the Bush administration has now embraced.

HEADLINE: Bad News Keeps Coming For Japanese Economy 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Other major economies around the globe may be seeing signs of a soft landing or an incipient recovery, but in Japan, the recession is beginning to bite hard.
 A big psychological blow came with today's announcement of a radical paring of Merrill Lynch's brokerage operations in Japan, with 20 of 28 branches to be closed and 70 percent of jobs eliminated. Just three years ago, the country was hailing Merrill's expansion here as a sign that foreign investment would help lift the country out of its doldrums. 
 Since then, the Tokyo stock market has fallen by half, and Merrill's retreat spotlights the evaporation of short-term hope for recovery. Surrounding it are less prominent signs that the world's second-largest economy is faltering badly -- job cuts, new lows for the yen and warnings of a banking meltdown by spring. 
"By the end of March, we will have a financial crisis -- that is 100 percent true," one influential ruling-party legislator, Yoichi Masuzoe, said today. "All economic fundamentals have become much worse."
Depressed prices for stocks and real estate keep eating away at the frail balance sheets of Japanese banks. In Japan's eight largest cities, land prices last year fell 5.5 to 9.7 percent, according to a survey released today by the Misawa Real Estate and Development Corporation.
In addition, Japan's depressed economy appears to be turning loans bad at least as fast as banks can write them off. Japan's 15 largest banks have said they expect to lose $17 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31. And on April 1, the government will proceed with a plan to restrict deposit insurance to accounts with less than 10 million yen ($75,364), a move the banks fear will panic depositors.
"It's quite possible that financial institutions will fail," Masaru Hayami, governor of the Bank of Japan, warned last month. "If a chain reaction of withdrawals occurs, like sea waves, it is highly likely to shake the financial system."
The government is determined to go ahead anyway, Heizo Takenaka, Japan's economic and fiscal policy minister, said Tuesday in Washington. Mr. Takenaka met with top economic officials from the Bush administration, who urged aggressive write-offs and foreclosures on troubled loans. 
Just the opposite appeared to be happening in Tokyo today. Local newspapers reported that a consortium of banks was preparing to lend up to $1 billion to Daiei, the nation's second-largest department store chain, which is already tottering under the weight of $17.5 billion in debt.
As a group, Japanese banks have a negative net worth of $1 trillion, according to a study released last week by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. Bailing them out would swell Japan's public debt, already the world's largest, by 15 percent, and threaten to crush the country's currency and bond markets, the institute said.
"Japan's deflation and debt crisis now constitute systemic risk to the global economy," the report warned, echoing a view shared by many Bush administration officials.
Making the situation even worse, layoffs and job-sharing are starting to spread among manufacturers that for years had clung to the old norm of lifetime employment.
Fujitsu said today that it was asking about 5,000 employees to take time off this year at 60 percent of regular pay. Kansai Electric Power, the nation's second-largest utility, announced 3,000 job cuts over the next three years. Kotobukiya, a major supermarket chain, said it woulddismiss 3,500 workers and close one-third of its 134 outlets.
Last month, Hitachi, Toshiba and Sanyo Electric announced that they would carry out job-sharing programs this year, affecting tens of thousands of workers.
About 70 of a group of 100 Japanese business leaders surveyed by Kyodo News said they planned to cut workers' wages in 2002, and about half said they were cutting their work forces.
With interest rates near zero and the public debt at record levels, Japanese policy planners are now using the only macroeconomic tool left in their box, a cheaper yen. The currency briefly reached 133 to the dollar today, a 39-month low in value; it has fallen 6 percent since Dec. 1.
But many economists doubt that Japan can export its way back to economic health. A recent study by Morgan Stanley estimated that a 10 percent fall in the yen's value would lift exports by just 1 percent.
In another indication that the Japanese are retreating from their stock markets, the Tokyo Stock Exchange reported today that last year, for the first time, foreigners accounted for 51.8 percent of trading by value. Separately, financial statements were released on Monday for 120 members of the upper house of Parliament who faced election last July. The average member had 60 percent of personal assets in real estate, 36 percent in bank deposits, and only 4 percent in stocks.

HEADLINE: End of the Road For HomeStyle, Despite Remake 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI and ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
Four issues after a redesign and editorial overhaul, Home Style magazine closed yesterday, the latest in a string of consumer magazines to shut.
 HomeStyle, which was published monthly by Gruner & Jahr and had a circulation of about 900,000, is another casualty of a brutal environment for the magazine industry, which has had to weather rising postal rates and paper prices, consolidating wholesalers and shrinking newsstands. 
 What makes its demise notable is that HomeStyle was part of the shelter category, which includes magazines about interior design, home furnishings and architecture and has long been considered a safe harbor during a bad economy as Americans stay home and spend what money they have inside their homes rather than outside. 
Last year, in a bid to lure more upscale advertisers, Gruner & Jahr hired Suzanne Slesin, previously the executive editor of House & Garden, as editor in chief of Home Style, the low-brow cousin to Architectural Digest, House & Garden and Elle Decor.
Ms. Slesin's magazine was reader friendly but also esoteric, with cover photos that were not traditional shelter magazine fare, like the dimly lighted figure of a man with a dog, and a woman lounging in bed, alongside articles about the revival of knotty pine and plaid's nontraditional appeal. 
"I'm sad and disappointed that in spite of our successes, we're not able to continue," Ms. Slesin said yesterday.
HomeStyle will cease publication after the March issue, on newsstands on Feb. 12.
Daniel B. Brewster Jr., the chief executive of Gruner & Jahr, said in a statement that the new magazine's ad pages and revenue "exceeded our goals by 22 percent." But the expectations must have been low. Its ad pages dropped 27 percent, to 436 pages for the issues dated January through November 2001 from 596 pages for the corresponding period in 2000, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. For the November 2001 issue alone, Ms. Slesin's second, pages were down by 44 percent, to 35 from 62 for the November 2000 issue, and revenue was down 45 percent, to $2.1 million from $3.9 million.
For the first six months of 2001, its newsstand sales averaged 70,800 copies a month, down from 97,000 in the first half of 2000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.

HEADLINE: Bush White House Starts Own High-Mileage Car Program 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
As the Bush administration replaced one government-backed program to build high-mileage cars with another today, hardly anyone rushed to eulogize the old project. Environmentalists said too much had been spent and too little accomplished, while automakers said the effort's goals had been unrealistic in the first place.
 The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, started in 1993 and championed by Vice President Al Gore, spent more than $1.5 billion in federal money. The goal was for General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler, now a unit of DaimlerChrysler, to work together with auto suppliers, government laboratories and universities on a range of technologies aimed at making cars more fuel efficient. 
 The project involved a host of government agencies -- the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy and Transportation, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA. 
Less than half of 1 percent of the money set aside for the program went to the Big Three. This year, about half of the program's $127 million budget was earmarked for various national laboratories. The Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, for instance, receives financing for fuel cell research, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville, Tenn., researches aluminum materials. Suppliers are scheduled to receive about 30 percent of the financing and universities another 15 percent. 
The program did create some useful technologies that showed up in vehicles on the road. Lightweight aluminum was used in the 2000 Lincoln LS and in some Cadillacs. The Jeep Wrangler has a thermoplastic roof that uses technology from the program. And some of the research into diesel-electric hybrid vehicles can be used in the gasoline-electric hybrids to be sold by the Big Three starting next year. 
But in the end, the program's main goal, to produce concept cars that could get 80 miles a gallon by 2004 -- and could be mass-produced -- is far from reality. United States automakers say that producing vehicles that could leap to 80 miles a gallon is not possible this decade. In fact, they even argued at a Senate hearing recently that raising fuel economy standards to 40 miles a gallon over the next half-decade would be a crippling blow to their business.
By contrast, two Japanese companies, Toyota and Honda, are already selling gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles that get better than 40 miles to the gallon, though their total fleets get far less. This year, Honda plans to start selling a hybrid version of its popular Civic. 
Current corporate average fuel economy standards, also known as CAFE, which have not been changed significantly in more than a decade, require 20.7 miles a gallon for each company's average new light truck and 27.5 miles a gallon for the average new car.
"You can build 80 m.p.g. cars, but if they cost too much, nobody is going to buy them," said William Noack, a spokesman for G.M.
Environmentalists say the project was ultimately a failure because it was not accompanied by an increase in federal fuel-economy standards.
"Al Gore said this would make CAFE obsolete," said Daniel Becker, director of global warming for the Sierra Club. 
"What did it result in? Not a single, purchasable hybrid" from the Big Three.
Environmentalists are equally skeptical of the Bush plan. The announcement today came as the Senate prepared to debate its energy bill. Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, said the project would be replaced by a program that would focus almost exclusively on one of the current project's furthest-off areas of research, the development of vehicles powered by fuel cells. 
Mr. Abraham said in an interview that he had supported the partnership when he was in Congress, "but when we came here we concluded that no one was going to produce these vehicles and no one would buy them."
Fuel cells draw power from hydrogen and ideally emit only water vapor and heat. All of the major automakers are working on fuel cell projects and say they represent the eventual end to the internal combustion engine. But most envision only a few hundred thousand such vehicles on the road by the end of the decade. Among the hurdles is outfitting service stations with hydrogen. 
"There is no requirement in either plan that the auto industry actually produce the vehicles for sale," said Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club. "If Congress is fooled into not raising CAFE standards because of this new smoke screen, the pressure will be off Detroit again." 
Secretary Abraham called his program a 21st-century approach that would eventually end the fuel economy debate, but added that it was far too early to set a timetable to require automakers actually to produce fuel cell vehicles. 
"You can't expect people to put vehicles on the road if you don't have the infrastructure to support it," he said. "This is Day 1."

U.S. to Form a Task Force For Investigation Into Enron
The Justice Department plans to form a special task force of prosecutors from across the country to conduct the criminal investigation into Enron and its eventual collapse, government officials said. The move widens the potential scope of the inquiry.
 Legal experts said that the decision to create such a task force on a white-collar case involving an individual company was virtually unprecedented, and signaled that the government had elevated this case to a level of significance usually afforded to investigations of entire industries.

HEADLINE: Upbeat and Still Challenging Cuomo, in More Ways Than One 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Starting a year when he plans to run for a third term, Gov. George E. Pataki's theme today seemed to be back to the future.
 The governor's annual address to the Legislature included an inventory of his achievements, a long list of bills he has tried before and will try again, and repeated references to the failings of his predecessor, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. It offered little that was new, and few clues as to how he plans to solve the state's looming financial crisis. 
 Instead, Governor Pataki put an upbeat cast on every topic he touched, pledging "the same confidence, the same optimism" as in brighter times -- no surprise for an incumbent seeking re-election. Even when paying tribute to the victims and heroes of Sept. 11, his speech had the ring of a campaign rally, a string of encomiums to the good will and good prospects of New Yorkers.
"We responded to evil with good," he said. "We answered terror with strength. We met adversity with resolve. We will defeat hatred with tolerance."
The Republican governor has never really stopped campaigning against Mr. Cuomo, the Democrat he unseated in 1993. With the former governor's son, Andrew M. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary, now running for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Pataki returned to that tactic repeatedly.
When he took office, he said, "Failed government policies left us with a $5 billion deficit, massive job losses, bloated government bureaucracy, an oppressive regulatory climate and the highest taxes in America."
Mr. Pataki vowed today, despite a multibillion-dollar budget deficit, that he would not postpone promised tax cuts, "unlike 1989, unlike 1990, '91, '92, '93 and '94," and that he would not repeat the fiscal low points of the Cuomo years.
"We're not going to sell prisons to ourselves," he said. "We're not going to slash education funding in the middle of the school year. We're not going to use fiscal gimmicks to conceal reality."
Andrew Cuomo, in a statement, criticized the governor for failing to address problems, like a "near-Depression upstate," and complained that Mr. Pataki had predicted a multibillion-dollar deficit in the coming budget, but "did not tell us -- not a word -- how he plans to balance it."
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, the other Democrat in the race, said, "This speech was a recital of promises, mostly promises that he's made and broken in the past."
But listeners of all political stripes called the speech strategically smart, saying that an optimistic rallying call works well for a popular incumbent appealing to a public still seeking solace after the World Trade Center attacks.
"It was very rah-rah," said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the state Democratic Party chairman. "It had some good sound bites, so I guess it makes sense for him. Though on the substance of what we are going to do, it was very thin." 
Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, a Republican from western New York, said, "In an election year, you highlight what you've accomplished -- you dwell on the positive."
That was surely more palatable for Mr. Pataki than confronting head-on what 2002 holds for him: a potentially difficult campaign, with an economy and state finances rocked by recession and terrorism.
The governor made a few references to fiscal woes, warning that the general fund budget would shrink in the coming year. But he did not call for shared sacrifice, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did in his inaugural address. As for solutions, Mr. Pataki left much of that for the release of his proposed budget this month.
The new proposals he made, like preserving a million acres of wild land and raising health care workers' salaries, will cost money that is suddenly scarce.
"He didn't lay much groundwork for sacrifice," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission. 
Rather, Governor Pataki offered a resume, dwelling more on the past than ever before in this annual ritual.
He recited his record of cutting taxes, increasing spending on education and the environment, inaugurating or expanding a raft of health care programs, and setting aside billions of dollars in reserve funds. He asked again for things the Legislature had rejected, like an initiative and referendum system, mayoral control of big-city schools, campaign finance reform, easing of the Rockefeller-era drug laws, and anti-terror laws. 
Even those failures can work to the governor's advantage. The ideas are popular, and he can always blame a recalcitrant Legislature for their defeat. 
Mr. Pataki remains no one's ideal as an orator. When punching a point, his already reedy voice drops into a sort of emphatic whisper. His anodyne aphorisms -- "there is no place for criminals in a society of heroes" -- often fall flat.
But his delivery has improved, and he no longer suffers from frequent, unflattering comparisons to his predecessor's speech-making. More important, Mr. Pataki's style is familiar and comfortable to New Yorkers.
"Obviously, it works for him," said Patricia Lynch, a former Democratic Assembly aide and now a lobbyist. "Strategically, for a guy facing a tough year, he handled it exactly right."

HEADLINE: Who Lost the Surplus? 

BYLINE:  By Bruce Bartlett; Bruce Bartlett is a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis.

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Va. 

 BODY:
On Feb. 4, the White House will send to Congress its proposed budget for 2003. There is no doubt that it will project a severe decline in surpluses from the estimates made last summer. The question of what caused this deterioration is likely to be a major topic of discussion from now until Election Day.
 Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who fired the opening gun in this debate last Friday, says, in essence, that the change is due mainly to the $1.35 trillion tax cut enacted last year. Since much of this tax cut is being phased in over several years, Mr. Daschle believes that those provisions not yet in effect should be shelved. 
 President George W. Bush, on the other hand, argues that rescinding the tax cut constitutes a de facto tax increase and says he will veto it. His budget documents will surely say that the falloff in surpluses is due almost entirely to the economic slowdown and new spending required by the events of Sept. 11.
Substantively, Mr. Bush probably has the better of this argument. After all, the tax cut didn't suddenly get bigger in the last few months. Last summer's budget estimates (the most recent) of the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office, which projected large surpluses, had incorporated the effects of the tax cut. Thus, any deterioration in the surplus must necessarily be due to other factors.
Those other factors are principally macroeconomic. Since last summer's budget review, we have learned that the economy has been in recession since March. One can fault government economists for not incorporating this fact into their budget projections, but private-sector economists did no better. Of the 54 forecasters surveyed by The Wall Street Journal in July, only two predicted a recession in 2001.
Although policy makers often talk as if the budget drives the economy, it is really the other way around. Almost all of the budget is highly sensitive to assumptions about economic growth, inflation and interest rates. Because slower growth simultaneously raises spending on social programs and reduces revenues, the surplus will fall by about $12 billion for every 1 percent of expected growth that doesn't materialize. Even after growth returns to the expected trend, the surplus will be lower every year than it was projected to have been. Over the 10 years following just a single year in which growth was 1 percent less than expected, the surplus will shrink by a cumulative $463 billion.
But this is not the end of the story. When growth is overestimated over a longer period, the impact on the budget is staggering. If growth were 1 percent lower than expected not just for one year, but for 10 straight years, the cumulative reduction in the surplus would balloon to $2.6 trillion.
What this means is that very tiny changes in economic assumptions, when projected out over a 10-year budget window, can quickly add up to real money. It also means that a sharp falloff in expected growth, even if it lasts for a brief period, can have a major impact on the budget long after growth has rebounded. For these reasons, the recession gets the lion's share of the blame for lower surpluses. The surplus did not cause the economy to prosper, as Senator Daschle says, but instead was a consequence of high growth. Higher than expected growth will cause spending to be lower and revenues higher. The way to restore surpluses is simply to restore growth.
Of course, restoring growth is easier said than done. Fortunately for politicians, the private sector does most of the heavy lifting. Indeed, forecasters now believe that the worst of the recession is past and that the economy will be growing smartly by mid-2002 regardless of whether Congress passes a stimulus bill.
So the debate about the surplus is not really about the economy, but about the proper role of government. Senator Daschle clearly has a more expansive view on this matter than does President Bush. The former would like to see surpluses restored, perhaps not only because he believes they are inherently good for the economy, but because they make it easier to enact new spending programs. For the latter, tax cuts are not just about raising growth, but also about keeping the size of government under control. The budget is simply the arena in which this continuing philosophical battle is fought.

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS; 
Best-Seller Lists Get a New Job

BYLINE:  By Martin Arnold 

 BODY:
Can best-seller lists indicate the country's political leaning? That's a tricky question. I don't recall reading much about it anywhere or hearing talk about it among book publishers.
 I suppose it's not surprising that post-Clinton books by conservatives are doing well in the marketplace, but I was startled to learn that five books appealing to political conservatives, a third of the total, will be on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction best-seller list on Jan. 20 and that one of them will be No. 1. Certainly something is happening with books of the political right, and I don't think it started very recently. 
 It may simply be that conservatives are writing books of political thought and moderates and liberals aren't. It may be that conservatives are simply more interesting when they do write and talk, and get to an audience's belly in a way that liberals and moderates don't. Or it may simply be that if you are a publisher and want to make money, the conservative writers with their broadcasting celebrity will attract the readers, so that's where you put your chips.
Whatever the reason, the No. 1 book on the list is about an issue precious almost beyond any other to conservatives, the one that roils the blood at many dinner parties: the alleged leftness of the news media, in this case, television news. (It must be conceded that many nonconservatives also look upon the press as a collection of rogues.) The book is "Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News" by Bernard Goldberg, a former CBS correspondent, and its climb to the top of the list is perhaps the most astonishing publishing event in the last 12 months.
It was published by Regnery, the country's leading publisher of conservative books and chief supplier of anti-Clinton titles, having published 10 since 1996, not all of which would be likely to pass muster at an assembly of scholars. Bill Clinton seems to be to Regnery what Mickey Mouse is to Disney. Barbara Olson's "Final Days" (Regnery), which discusses "the last, desperate abuses of power" of the Clinton White House, is No. 6. (Ms. Olson died on a hijacked airliner on Sept. 11.) Alfred S. Regnery, 59, publisher and son of the company's founder, said that "Bill Clinton sold a lot of books and was very kind to us, to our economy if not anyone else's" but that nonetheless "we do more books on issues than on people." The Goldberg book, which had been rejected by some mainstream publishers, had a first printing of 75,000 copies and now has 225,000 in print.
It was originally scheduled for publication in mid-October but was delayed after Sept. 11 because, Mr. Regnery said, there was "the feeling that the media becomes your friend after such a big event," and that chummy perception wouldn't help sell a lot of that particular book.
Regnery, which merged with the conservative Eagle Publishing Company in 1993, publishes 40 to 50 titles a year, many of them avoided by other publishers, often because of politics. "We do a lot of thoughtful books on health and finance issues, and biographies," Mr. Regnery said, adding that Benjamin Franklin was in the works, "and we know our market." Indeed he does. It's not uncommon for a Regnery author to be interviewed on 200 to 300 radio talk shows, he said. "We get writers who tell us their last publisher got them six to eight interviews."
"We do have the market more or less to ourselves, so we can promote our books again and again," he said. All this feeds a large network of conservative talk shows and, of course, Eagle's book clubs, the principal one called, quite naturally, the Conservative Book Club, with 104,000 members. Eagle also owns Human Events, an ultra-right weekly, and The Evans and Novak Political Report, a monthly newsletter.
Regnery's first best seller was by a young man named William F. Buckley Jr., and the book was "God and Man at Yale," which fell like a bomb on elite academia in 1951. It was followed shortly thereafter by Russell Kirk's "Conservative Mind" and a new edition of "Witness" by Whittaker Chambers. Where Regnery has the missionary zeal as well as the profit motive, mainstream houses publish books by conservatives (or nearly anyone) mostly for the profit, but they do publish them. For instance, No. 7 on the best-seller list will be Bill O'Reilly's "No Spin Zone" (Broadway); No. 10, "When Character Was King," reflections on Ronald Reagan by Peggy Noonan from Viking; and No. 11, Pat Buchanan's "Death of the West" (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's).
But there has been no mainstream publishing house since Erwin A. Glikes ran the Free Press, then a division of Macmillan but now owned by Simon & Schuster, that was devoted mostly to conservative books, publishing writers like Allan Bloom, George Will, Robert H. Bork and David Brock. Glikes was succeeded by Adam Bellow, son of the Nobel laureate Saul Bellow, when the Free Press became part of Simon & Schuster and Glikes resigned. Mr. Bellow maintained the conservative franchise for a while, but now there's new direction, and the Free Press publishes a mixture of voices.
Which basically leaves the lucrative conservative field to Regnery. There is, however, a small independent publishing house founded five years ago, Spence Publishing, that publishes books that, for instance, discuss weighty topics like what religious toleration means ("The Long Truce: How Toleration Made the World Safe for Power and Profit," by A. J. Conyers). Its publisher, Thomas Spence, said that among other things, "the book sees prayer in public schools as a way for the state to intrude on religion." Now that makes this year's conservatives seem almost red.
A nonfiction publishing list is a thunder gust of conflicting ideas and hopes in which single-issue books and tales of the shenanigans of politicians seldom do well. That's the conventional wisdom. But what seems true for now at least is that if they are coming from the right, the author is apt to get rich.

Secretary General Bloomberg?
 During the campaign, MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG said only four jobs could tempt him away from his communications conglomerate: president of the United States, secretary general of the United Nations, president of the World Bank and mayor of New York. 
 Having won one of those jobs, he had dinner at the Lotos Club Tuesday with KOFI ANNAN, the United Nations secretary general. "I know them both, and I knew they knew each other," said WILLIAM H. LUERS, president of the United Nations Association of the United States, who organized the dinner. 
Of the mayor, Mr. Luers said: "I think he was very open about the importance of the U.N. to the city, but it was basically ambience. There were no decisions made, no negotations undertaken." Among the others Mr. Luers invited were JOHN C. WHITEHEAD, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation; DEPUTY MAYOR PATRICIA HARRIS; and the mayor's sister, MARJORIE TIVEN.

No, but I Read the Book Jacket
There are advantages to being a best-selling author other than, say, megabuck advances: Airport security workers will accept your book-jacket photograph as identification.
"I used it on the Delta shuttle," said BRAD MELTZER, who was carrying his new page turner, "The Millionaires," when he rushed from the WNYW-TV early-morning program "Good Day New York" to La Guardia Airport. "The woman taking the tickets said, 'I saw him on TV,' " Mr. Meltzer reported.
He pointed out, nicely, that the resemblance between his face and the one in the photograph was no coincidence. "Then she said, 'I need some identification.' I said, 'Can I use this?' " Mr. Meltzer made the plane.

GEORGE PLIMPTON is having an if-it's-Tuesday-this-must-be-Belgium kind of week. He has a date at the 92nd Street Y tonight for "Zelda, Scott and Ernest." In this adaptation of letters from the 1920's and 1930's, Mr. Plimpton plays F. Scott Fitzgerald; NORMAN MAILER plays Hemingway; and Mr. Mailer's wife, NORRIS CHURCH MAILER, plays Zelda Fitzgerald.
Mr. Plimpton had to fly to Toronto on Tuesday for the cable-television series "Nero Wolfe" (he plays Wolfe's lawyer). Worried about missing his plane home, he called Mr. Mailer about potential fill-ins.
"I suggested PAUL NEWMAN," Mr. Plimpton said. "Norman thought I was serious. He said, 'I know Paul very well. He's very fastidious. I don't think I could get him to do it that quickly.' "

Replicating Cosell's Comb-Over
So there was a screening of the made-for-television movie "Monday Night Mayhem." On Tuesday night.
One scene in the TNT film about the rise of ABC's "Monday Night Football" shows Howard Cosell, played by JOHN TURTURRO, taking off his toupee and revealing a comb-over. Mr. Turturro said that to duplicate Cosell's hairline, he had to shave his head for months, but only around the edges.
"So what," he said. "It's only hair." 
And that scene in which ROONE ARLEDGE, who went on to be chairman of ABC News, joins DICK EBERSOL, now the president of NBC Sports, in a hot tub, surrounded by women? "It never happened, or not like that," Mr. Ebersol said. "The producers decided they had too many scenes set in hotel rooms. And then they decided the hot tub scene looked too empty, so they added the girls."

Marc Anthony Wins in Court
A copyright infringement suit that accused MARC ANTHONY of stealing words and music for his biggest hit -- "I Need to Know," which won a Latin Grammy Award in 2000 -- has been dismissed. The songwriter DANIEL AGREN sued Mr. Anthony and his producer, CORY ROONEY, last year, citing a 1989 song of the same name.
"Our song was unique and original and that's what we were able to establish in persuading them to drop the case," Mr. Anthony's lawyer, ORIN SNYDER of the Manhattan firm of Parcher, Hayes & Snyder, said after JUDGE DENNY CHIN of federal court in Manhattan signed an order ending the case. A lawyer for Mr. Agren, DAVID JAROSLAWICZ, did not return a call for comment.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AMNESTY; 
7 Taliban Officials Surrender to a Governor and Go Free

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Seven high-ranking officials of the vanquished Taliban government, including the justice minister who played a leading role in the Taliban's repressive laws and the destruction of the Buddha statues at Bamian, surrendered to a provincial leader and were allowed to go free on Monday, a spokesman for Afghanistan's new government said today.
 The move raises fresh questions about whether the interim government in Kabul will be able to exert control over this land of feuding fiefs and warlords. 
 Officials here said they had not been consulted on the decision by the governor of Kandahar Province to grant amnesty. They said they had been informed a day later. 
"We're in the process of finding out whether these people qualify as war criminals," said Omar Samad, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. "If that is the case, the interim administration will have to investigate."
Mr. Samad said the government was most concerned about the release of Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, the former justice minister, and Abdul Haq, the former chief of security for the western city of Herat.
As the ranking legal official of the Taliban, Mr. Turabi could be held to account for acts like the public executions of people in the Kabul sports stadium and the destruction of the giant statues last year.
Mr. Turabi, who has only one eye, was considered extreme in a regime of extremists.
Mr. Samad did not identify the other five officials who had surrendered, though he said one or two were Taliban elders, who had not taken an active role in governing the country. He said two people rumored to have turned themselves in, the former defense minister, Mullah Ubaidullah, and the former minister of mines, Mullah Saadudin, were not among those whose names had been supplied to the government.
Mr. Samad said the government was determined to bring to justice any Taliban leaders found to have committed crimes against the Afghan people or to have been accomplices of the terrorist network Al Qaeda.
To do that, though, it must confront independent-minded bosses like Gul Agha, the governor of Kandahar. After negotiations that were shrouded in secrecy, he agreed to free the Taliban officials if they handed over their weapons and vehicles and returned to their villages.
Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, is the spiritual heartland of the Taliban. That means the freed men are likely to be welcomed back into village society. It also means they could slip across the border into Pakistan.
That ability to disappear is what worries United States officials, who continue to search for Osama bin Laden, the head of Al Qaeda, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the spiritual leader of the Taliban.
Mullah Omar remains at large, despite reports that he was cornered in the Bagram district.
Mr. Samad said he was not aware of a request by the United States to gain custody of Mullah Turabi or Mr. Abdul Haq. An American military spokesman, speaking to reporters earlier today in Kandahar, did not sound overly alarmed by the reports of the release of the Taliban officials.
"We're not in the business of determining who should and should not be in custody right now," said Lt. James Jarvis of the Marine Corps.
Disputes over the surrender of Taliban leaders have erupted before, each time dramatizing the fractured nature of Afghanistan. The fall of Kunduz, in the north, was delayed while forces led by ethnic Uzbeks and Tajiks bickered over who should accept the white flag of the Taliban military commander.
Even though Afghanistan's provincial governors have nominally pledged allegiance to the new government, Mr. Samad acknowledged that keeping those power brokers in line would be extremely difficult.
"The interim administration is in control to the extent possible," he said. "We still have terrorists running around this country. We still have Taliban fighters running around the country. We still have threats to stability."
Even as the government was struggling with its unruly provinces, it sought to impose order in the capital.
The Interior Ministry ordered soldiers and paramilitary troops in Kabul to turn in their weapons or report to their barracks within 72 hours. Mr. Samad said the move was in accordance with the agreement reached in Bonn that created the temporary government.
The order drew praise from officials of the United Nations, which brokered the agreement. "If you choose to become a civilian, you have no need for your weapon," said Ahmed Fawzi, a spokesman for the United Nations here.
Disarming the soldiers, security guards, militia members and regular citizens who carry guns will pose a host of challenge. One is how to extract weapons from people who cannot imagine living without them.
Another is what to do with many of the soldiers who wish to remain in the army.
An estimated 700,000 people in Afghanistan carry guns. A spokesman for the Defense Ministry said in an interview today that Afghanistan did not need an army of more than 200,000. That means it will have to turn away many of its volunteers, disarming them in the process.
"For those people who refuse to give up their weapons, we will compel them," said the spokesman, Col. Salhe Registani. "When we start disarming them, their commanders will be less likely to challenge the government."
In an address on television -- a medium banned by his Taliban predecessors -- Hamid Karzai, the head of the interim Afghan government, laid out a brief blueprint for restoring economic and political stability.
"Let us join together and make a national army," he said, speaking in Dari, the Persian language used in northern Afghanistan. He said he would control inflation, encourage manufacturing of Afghan products, try to create jobs and foster a market economy.
Mr. Karzai also said his government would stop printing unsupported Afghani notes. Several different groups have printed Afghan currency in recent years, leading to a proliferation of bills not backed by the government.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's School Plan Gets Support in Albany 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appeared today to get a warm reception to his ideas for revamping the management of New York's public schools. 
 In his first mayoral trip to the state capital, where he came to watch Gov. George E. Pataki deliver his annual address, Mr. Bloomberg got greetings from legislators of both parties and open support from the governor for his idea of turning the Board of Education into a mayoral agency, a sentiment that appears to be gaining more support among members of the State Assembly. 
 In his inaugural address last week, Mr. Bloomberg said that "the public, through the mayor, must control the school system." Today, Mr. Pataki said: "Mayor, you are right. Real education reform means giving the mayors of our big cities that control. I will fight to give you that power this year." Mr. Pataki had also expressed support for mayoral control of city schools in past years. 
While only a few Democrats joined the state's Republicans in standing and clapping when Mr. Pataki made his remarks, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said at a news conference later that he would keep an "open mind" about Mr. Bloomberg's idea, something he declined to do when Rudolph W. Giuliani was in office.
"I've ruled nothing out," Mr. Silver said, adding that a task force that he appointed to study the issue would look at several possibilities, including turning the board over to Mr. Bloomberg. 
Assemblyman Steven Sanders, the Manhattan Democrat who heads the Assembly Education Committee, said last week that abolishing the Board of Education was "highly unlikely" as an option for the task force to consider and the Assembly to approve.
However, since then, Mr. Bloomberg and his deputy mayor for policy, Dennis M. Walcott, have met with Mr. Sanders, and he has apparently softened his stance. "I expect there will be significant reforms," to the board, Mr. Sanders said today. "The mayor has a lot of ideas and we look forward to working with him. Mayor Giuliani was not interested in compromise. I think the new mayor will not limit his conversation to narrow topics and that kind of attitude will hold him in good stead around here."
Other possibilities include expanding the board but allowing the mayor to appoint most of the members rather than the two he now appoints (the borough presidents pick the five others), a method supported by the teachers' union. Another option is to make the Board of Education financially independent, with its own taxing authority. Mr. Silver said he would like to see any changes happen before the next school year began.
There were already signs that Mr. Bloomberg would get a better audience in Albany if he made the issue a priority, as his aides have suggested he would. Today, Mr. Silver invited the mayor into his Democratic conference, something Mr. Giuliani was never asked to do, and when he entered the conference room, Mr. Bloomberg got thunderous applause. 
Some people close to the speaker surmised that he and his staff would be much more open to negotiating with Mr. Bloomberg than Mr. Giuliani, who was often disdainful of the Assembly members and attacked Mr. Silver after Sept. 11.
J. Michael Boxley, counsel to Mr. Silver, watching Mr. Bloomberg leave the speaker's office today, whispered to another staff member: "It's going to be a lot better. It really is. You'll see."
That is not to say that Mr. Bloomberg, who hopped from a meeting with Senate Republicans to a brunch with Assembly Democrats to the speech and a private meeting with the governor here today, kept the mayoral stage to himself.
Mr. Giuliani, who once again hinted today that his career in politics was not over, sat in the same row as the new mayor during the governor's speech, and Mr. Pataki praised him openly during his remarks, which led to a standing ovation for Mr. Giuliani. 
When asked how he enjoyed being in Albany once again, Mr. Giuliani said, "I felt great, I felt sort of liberated to just feel the experience and say what I wanted to say and I didn't feel the pressure of having to worry about, you know, what's Albany going to do to us this year, are they going to help us, are they going to hurt us."
Indeed it is Mr. Bloomberg who must be concerned about what Albany plans to do this year, and his needs are great. With a roughly $4 billion hole expected in next year's budget, he will be looking to Albany for financial aid, particularly on economic development projects that he will need to convince the state that its battered budget can benefit from as well.
Mr. Bloomberg praised the legislators he met with today, and said he would return to Albany frequently. "New York City is a very big part of New York State," he said. "The health of the state is something that we care about. New York City and New York State, their relationships are inseparable."
As a parting gift, State Senator Serphin R. Maltese introduced legislation that would permit Mr. Bloomberg's daughter and his sister to work in his administration as volunteers.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Take me out to the ballgame, but don't make taxpayers build the ballpark. The high cost and low benefit of sports subsidies.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
IN his last week as mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a deal to issue tax-exempt municipal bonds to subsidize half the $1.6 billion cost of building new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets on the sites of the existing stadiums. The state would also throw in $150 million to improve parking and transportation. In return, the teams would sign 35-year leases, with no escape clauses. 
 Why spend nearly $1 billion of public money to subsidize facilities for a private industry in which billionaire owners pay multimillion-dollar salaries to average players? Mr. Giuliani justified it on economic grounds, saying, "This is something that would be very, very good for the economic development of the city." 
 He later boasted, "You can't underestimate the effect on civic pride and the economy of the city." 
Yet economists who study the sports industry say the only way to underestimate the economic value of subsidizing stadium construction is to use negative numbers. Experience suggests that subsidies for stadiums yield negligible economic benefits and expand the gap between the superrich and everyone else.
New York is not unique. Ever since 1953, when Milwaukee offered the Braves a $5 million stadium to lure the team from Boston, more than $20 billion of public money (in current dollars) has been allocated for stadium construction. The government has pitched in more than two and a half times what team owners have contributed. 
Economists argue that premier sports leagues exploit their monopoly position by pitting one city against another to extract income from taxpayers, usually in the form of stadium subsidies. If team location were not restricted by league monopolies, cities like New York would have more than two baseball teams, and competitive balance would be improved. In Japan, for example, 6 of the 12 professional baseball teams are in Tokyo or neighboring cities.
The extra money generated by subsidized stadiums accrues to owners and ballplayers. Ticket prices rise because of the new amenities. A reason athletes' salaries have soared in recent years is that leagues have grown better at playing hardball with host cities. 
A good overview of the economics literature is provided by John Siegfried of Vanderbilt and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College in "The Economics of Sports Facilities and Their Communities," published in the summer 2000 issue of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. 
They argue convincingly that there is little reason to suspect that a new sports stadium will generate sufficient revenue to justify its cost. In the first place, if a team's revenue would rise enough to offset the cost of new construction, the owners would be willing to make the investments themselves; they're not. 
So for subsidies to make economic sense, enough additional economic activity must be generated to the rest of the city to offset the remaining costs. This is unlikely. Although a new stadium may entice more fans to come to the ballpark, the extra money they spend there is typically offset because they spend less elsewhere -- they attend fewer movies or concerts, play less golf or dine out less frequently. The total budget devoted to leisure activities is fairly inflexible, so the rest of the city suffers. 
To be sure, team owners have hired consultants who argue that there are large economic gains from stadium construction. But such promotional studies frequently ignore the substitution that takes place among leisure activities. By and large, academic studies that look at the actual experience of cities that build stadiums find no effect on the local economy, or a negative effect. 
Robert Baade of Lake Forest College and Allen Sanderson of the University of Chicago found that adding new stadiums had no systematic positive or negative effect on employment relative to trend levels in 10 cities from 1958 to 1993, and even in the positive cases the effects were quite small. Other work suggests that per capita income might decline in cities that subsidize sports stadiums because much of the income garnered by players and owners is spent outside the host city. Only 29 percent of professional basketball players, for example, have permanent homes near where they play, Mr. Zimbalist said.
Further corroboration of negligible economic effects of sports franchises comes from strikes. During the 1994 baseball strike, for example, "the relationship between a city's economic performance before and during the strike essentially was no different for cities that hosted teams and those that did not," according to a study by John Zipp of the University of Akron.
The money promised to the Yankees and Mets is enough to increase school spending in New York City by $1,000 a student or cover the fire department's entire budget for a year. Is the (probably trivial) economic payoff to the city from tearing down two historic stadiums to build domed ones in their place worth the cost when the money could be used to improve education and public safety? 
Even longtime fans are becoming fed up. Steve Warren, 69, a longtime fan of the New York Giants and then the Mets, said: "Devoted baseball fans like me have finally begun to realize that there is something inherently wrong with this beautiful game when owners pay obscene salaries to athletes and claim 'poverty' when it comes to improving facilities for fans, and instead seek public funds to build private stadiums. We are dunces if we continue to support them while they pull the wool over our eyes." 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has the final say on Mr. Giuliani's pledge to subsidize stadiums, has been lukewarm to the idea, but still promised to give the teams $50 million to continue planning over the next five years. "The issue is really, 'Can we afford them?' " he said recently. "I will have to take a look down the road as the economy develops."
The real issue should not be whether we can afford them, but whether the benefits of subsidizing stadiums outweigh the costs, especially compared with the high economic and social payoff from competing uses of public financing. On this question, economists offer a resounding no. 
Moreover, Mr. Siegfried notes that even if the Yankees and Mets should move out, New York is unlikely to be without baseball -- the Twins and the Expos could move in. "Let's see baseball try to block that franchise move," he said.

HEADLINE: The Governor as Confectioner 

 BODY:
New York's governor, George Pataki, managed yesterday to seem upbeat about a state financial predicament that even he had to admit is a "fiscal crisis." What would have most state leaders preaching gloom and preparing the public for sacrifice had Mr. Pataki remembering the heroes of Sept. 11, recalling the Battle of Saratoga and offering up suggestions for additional, albeit modest, spending programs. 
 The governor was kicking off his own re-election campaign as much as a new season of the State Legislature. For a budgetary villain he resuscitated the era of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has been out of office for seven years. Mr. Pataki compared today's yawning state deficit, courtesy of Osama bin Laden and the recession, to the budget gaps left by Governor Cuomo in 1995. Unfair as that is, it is certainly a signal that it's election time again for Mr. Pataki. 
 In his eighth State of the State address, Mr. Pataki returned to many of his regular themes, and the fact that some of them, like reforming the drug laws and campaign finance rules, have been on his agenda before does not make them less worthwhile. 
Other old favorites included reforming and simplifying school aid formulas, a proposal that will work only if it is accompanied by a fairer allocation of state funds among the urban, rural and suburban school systems. With Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the packed Assembly chamber, Mr. Pataki also backed more mayoral control of and responsibility for city schools, a good idea that will not make it through the Assembly unless the governor adds significant political pressure to his support.
Given the perilous condition of the state's finances, Mr. Pataki had very little to say about specific sacrifices that will be needed to balance the budget. He promised to control state spending but he also refused to rule out any delays of tax cuts that could add to his substantial deficit, costing an additional $300 million next year. Mr. Pataki's call for bipartisanship and holding the line apparently rules out any sacrifices for his own pet programs. 
Perhaps he was saving the bad news for his budget address later this month. One hint of trouble to come was the governor's announcement that he would be sending the Legislature a proposal on health care in the next few days. According to a report in The Times earlier this week, the governor is planning to use funds from an increased cigarette tax and a payment of about $1 billion to the state from Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield to boost salaries for state health workers. Blue Cross would make the payment if the state allows it to become a for-profit company, and the governor would be using this one-time payment to underwrite expenses that will recur every year. The package could also disrupt New York City's labor negotiations at a precarious financial time. While rewarding the politically powerful health care workers makes good sense for a re-election campaign, it may not be financially wise.
By the end of his speech, Mr. Pataki suggested that the Legislature could honor the nation's heros by "our unity." Judging from the applause by Republicans and the occasional groans among Democrats, New York State's Legislature will have to find another way. The 2002 election season started yesterday in Albany, and Mr. Pataki rang the opening bell.

HEADLINE: Pataki Vows to Limit Spending And to Avoid Delaying Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Basking in the patriotic spirit in New York since Sept. 11, Gov. George E. Pataki promised in his annual address today to hold the line on spending without postponing tax cuts and urged lawmakers to rise above partisanship.
 The governor, a Republican who is preparing to run for a third term this fall, used much of his hourlong address to extol the heroics of the firefighters, rescue workers and police officers who died in the attack on the World Trade Center. He also publicly applauded his one-time rival and political nemesis, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose popularity has soared since the attack. 
 Mr. Pataki then asked the Assembly members and senators to abandon the partisan bickering that has paralyzed budget talks and negotiations over major bills for the last year. "Since Sept. 11, partisanship has given way to a new spirit of unity," the governor declared. "People want an end to partisan politics, and they deserve it." Excerpts, Page B4. 
The speech included few new proposals, but did lay out some goals that, if the Legislature agrees, will help him appeal to voters he needs to woo next fall. He called again for lessening the state's harsh mandatory sentences for drug crimes, a hot issue among minority voters.
He also asked lawmakers to pass a law making it illegal to discriminate against homosexuals, a group whose support he would like. In a nod to environmentalists, he pledged to add a million new acres of parkland over the next 10 years. He also pledged to improve the delivery of care to women with cervical or breast cancer, a promise sure to help his image among women.
Mr. Pataki, mindful of the poor showing of Republican candidates in upstate communities in the last election, also said he would introduce a raft of proposals for spurring the faltering economy in places like Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester. He provided few details.
On the state budget, Mr. Pataki asserted that the terrorist attacks had crimped tax collections and predicted that "revenue losses will reach into the billions."
"We will lose more in revenue than many states collect," he said.
Yet Mr. Pataki did not lay out how he would close the gap. Sounding what is likely to become a campaign theme, the governor vowed not to go back to what he called the fiscal gimmicks Gov. Mario M. Cuomo employed in the last administration, like selling the prisons to the Dormitory Authority to raise cash for expenses. 
He also vowed that he would not repeat Mr. Cuomo's tactic of postponing tax cuts already enacted. There are about $300 million worth of tax cuts scheduled to take effect this year. "Tax cuts will go forward," he said, as the Republicans rose to give him the longest ovation of the speech and Democrats sat glumly.
"They must go forward, because we know that tax cuts create jobs," he said. "This year, next year and beyond, we will cut taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars."
The governor then congratulated the lawmakers for not proposing an increase in their own budgets this year. Some lawmakers grimaced. "Stop grumbling," the governor chided. "It's the right thing to do."
Mr. Pataki left his budget plans vague, saying only that he would hold the line on spending and would decrease spending from the general fund. That is a relatively meaningless promise, Democrats said. Governors have long manipulated what programs are paid for from the general fund and from other revenues to make it appear that they are restraining spending.
The governor said he would soon send the lawmakers a bill that would pay for salary increases for hospital workers and nurses in health care institutions across the state. The proposal would pay for the raises with a bigger tax on cigarettes and a $1 billion windfall the state should receive from the conversion of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to a for-profit insurer. The proposal also depends on Congress's agreeing to shoulder a slightly bigger share of Medicaid costs.
Some Democratic lawmakers have called the proposal a fiscal gimmick of the kind Mr. Pataki lambasted in his speech, because it would, in essence, spend a one-time windfall on salary increases. The bill would also pay for several other health programs, among them drug subsidies and walk-in clinics, through new sources of revenue, taking them out of the general fund.
"It's the way you do the books that counts," said the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
The speech was studded with other promises and requests. Mr. Pataki called on the Legislature to amend the State Constitution to allow residents to put referendums on the ballot through petitions. 
As he has in the past, the governor called for abolishing parole for all felons and he asked the Legislature to make the legal definition of drunkenness more strict. He said the state needed to pass campaign-finance reform. He pleaded with the Legislature to lift the statute of limitations for rape. He again asked the Legislature to streamline the cumbersome formulas for allotting aid to schools.
He also repeated his call for New York City schools to be placed under the mayor's control.
Despite his call for bipartisan cooperation, most or Mr. Pataki's proposals were applauded by only one side of the aisle or the other. Most Democrats were silent when he talked about ending parole. Most Republicans were quiet when he called for equal rights for homosexuals.
After the speech, the party lines were quickly drawn. H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and a Democratic candidate for governor, dismissed the address as a string of meaningless pledges. "The real issue is: are we going to see any of these promises fulfilled," he said. "What we heard is a long list of promises we have heard before."
The leader of the Republican majority in the Senate, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, said his conference would embrace the governor's call for more money to spur economic development outside New York City. Despite the state's gloomy finances, the governor said he would propose $250 million for biotechnology research and $100 million in low-interest loans for small businesses upstate.
Mr. Pataki wrote the speech himself, with some help from his chief speechwriter, John Wolfe, aides said. This being an election year, many in the audience viewed it as the beginning of Mr. Pataki's campaign. The governor tried to tie himself to the heroic deeds of Sept. 11. He waxed poetic about the dead, saying they watched the audience from heaven.
"Let us, through our unity, continue to make them proud," he said. "And let us do so full in the faith that they are still watching us, full in the faith that on that fateful morning, from the fury of violence the souls of thousands rose, up from the cloud of dust, and above freedom's harbor, they traveled through the sky toward God, and left the vivid air signed with their honor."
But when the applause ended, the business of politics began in the marble halls of the Capitol. The budget to be unveiled on Jan. 22, many said, would erase the warmth of Mr. Pataki's speech, as the battle over money in an election year begins.
"The budget will come to this as a cold shower after a steam bath," said a Democratic assemblyman, Richard L. Brodsky. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 11, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about Gov. George E. Pataki's annual address to the New York Legislature misstated the name of the state agency to which the Cuomo administration sold two prisons in the early 1990's to close a gap. It was the Urban Development Corporation, not the Dormitory Authority.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan Seeks to Restore Food Stamps for Noncitizens 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The Bush administration proposed today to restore food stamps to many legal immigrants, whose eligibility for benefits was severely restricted by the 1996 welfare law.
 The White House said that at least 363,000 people -- legal immigrants who have not become citizens -- would qualify for food stamps under the plan, to be included in the budget President Bush sends Congress in early February. The proposal would cost the federal government $2.1 billion over 10 years, the administration said. In October, 18.4 million people were receiving food stamps. 
 Mr. Bush's plan, or something like it, has an excellent chance of becoming law. The Senate is considering such changes as part of a far-reaching bill to reauthorize farm and nutrition programs. Under the proposal, the White House said, noncitizens with low incomes could qualify for food stamps after living here legally for five years. A similar test already applies to legal immigrants seeking Medicaid or cash assistance.
The welfare bill passed by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 made noncitizens ineligible for food stamps and many other types of assistance financed with federal money. Supporters of the ban, mostly Republicans, argued that federal benefits drew immigrants to the United States and then discouraged them from working.
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, expressed the intent of Congress in 1996 when he said, "Immigrants should come to the U.S. with their sleeves rolled up, ready to work, not with their hands out, ready to go on welfare."
But today, amid a recession that is hurting many immigrants, and with the government waging a war on terrorism that has targeted some immigrants, Mr. Bush is eager to show his commitment to them. He is also eager to address domestic problems -- a transition his father failed to make effectively a decade ago after the Persian Gulf war. 
Many of those who could benefit from the food stamp proposal are Hispanic. The White House has been ardently courting Hispanic voters.
In an interview today, Newt Gingrich, the House speaker in 1996, said: "I strongly support the president's initiative. In a law that has reduced welfare by more than 50 percent, this is one of the provisions that went too far. In retrospect, it was wrong. President Bush's instincts are exactly right."
Mr. Bush is selectively disclosing parts of his budget in advance -- specifically, those proposals likely to win political support -- as Mr. Clinton often did.
Antihunger groups and Hispanic groups praised the Bush plan. "This is an enormous step forward, for which the president should be congratulated," said Cecilia Munoz, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights group. "Mr. Bush did not speak out on this in the presidential campaign, and he had not done so since he assumed office."
As governor of Texas and as president, Mr. Bush has taken pride in his good relations with Hispanic Americans. Karl Rove, the president's senior political adviser, said last year that capturing a bigger share of the Hispanic vote was "our mission and our goal" and would require assiduous work by "all of us in every way."
But the Republican Party is split, and some Republicans have alienated Hispanic voters by espousing a restrictionist immigration policy.
Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican of Colorado, said he would fight the president's food stamp proposal because it would "entice people to come to the United States to be on welfare."
Mr. Tancredo, chairman of the Immigration Reform Caucus, with 55 members in the House, said: "The president has chosen to steal a page out of the Democrats' playbook. The Democrats have been enormously successful in buying votes through welfare. That's all this is, a sop to a Democrat-leaning voter bloc, an attempt to expand our political base by including the Hispanic vote."
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the government has detained more than 1,100 noncitizens for questioning and has stepped up enforcement of immigration laws. Mr. Bush insists he is waging war on terrorists, not immigrants, and his food stamp proposal can be cited to support that claim.
James D. Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center, an antihunger group, said, "It's really positive that the administration wants to extend food stamp benefits to this group of legal immigrants." He said his group had been supporting a broader restoration of food stamps, as proposed by Senators Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, and Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa. But Mr. Weill said, "Everybody is moving in the same direction, and we are delighted to see that."
The economy is worse now than in 1996, when Mr. Clinton signed the welfare bill. "Immigrants have been hit hard by the economic downturn," Ms. Munoz said, "and there's no safety net for those who arrived after 1996."
Welfare and food stamp rolls have plummeted since 1996, and members of Congress express much less concern now about being overwhelmed with the programs' cost, even though budget surpluses have evaporated.
In general, food stamps are available to people with gross incomes up to 30 percent above the poverty level. A three-person household can qualify if its gross income does not exceed $1,585 a month.
Federal officials said Mr. Bush's proposal would make it much easier for state and local employees to determine whether an immigrant was eligible for food stamps. The immigrants are generally ineligible now, but there are some exceptions based on a person's age, work history and date of entry into the United States.
About 800,000 immigrants were removed from food stamp rolls in 1996, according to the Agriculture Department, which runs the program. Two years later, benefits were restored to about 175,000 immigrants, mostly children and older people who were in the country before the legislation was signed in August 1996.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A War of Loose Ends

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
America's goals in Central Asia were easily explained as Kabul and Kandahar fell, when daily Pentagon videos showed bombs homing in on caves in Tora Bora and when there was a reasonable prospect that Osama bin Laden, Mullah Muhammad Omar and their top aides would soon fall into American hands.
 But that was last month. And while President Bush was taking a New Year's break on his ranch, and then returned here to focus on the economy and education, his war against terrorism entered a murkier, messier moment. While the president insists that his goals are unchanged -- a broad war against all terrorists with a global reach -- events have forced a more diffuse, complex strategy. 
 Today, officials raised alarms about Iranian meddling in the lawless western reaches of Afghanistan and an American transport plane crashed, for still-unexplained reasons, in Pakistan. American troops were engaged in a search of the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan for hundreds of Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders still at large, and what just weeks ago looked like a ruthlessly effective war from the air today looks more like police work in a bad neighborhood.
The new complexities are evident from the way Mr. Bush and his top aides speak about their challenges these days -- and what they have suddenly chosen not to talk about.
"We're in a dangerous phase," the president volunteered on Saturday during a swing through the West Coast. He was speaking of the cave-to-cave searches in Afghanistan and the death on Friday of Sgt. First Class Nathan R. Chapman, of the Army Special Forces, killed in a firefight that now appears to have been an ambush. But he could just as easily have been talking about everything else that has cropped up while he was cutting new trails across his 1,600-acre ranch.
Once Mr. Bush talked about the hunt for Mr. bin Laden and Mullah Omar regularly, without prompting. Now he rarely does, beyond a cursory repetition, in every speech, that sooner or later, somewhere, the United States will bring "the evil ones" to justice.
His aides insist that there was no decision made to depersonalize Mr. Bush's language, even though they acknowledge that when he uttered the words "dead or alive" about Mr. bin Laden, even Laura Bush warned him that he was sounding a little overzealous. But as one senior administration official close to Mr. Bush said last week, "There's not a lot be gained by talking about them," especially when they appear to have escaped.
So at the Pentagon this week, officials announced that they are no longer going to provide regular updates on the manhunt.
Moreover mopping up in Afghanistan is only one of several worries confronting the administration. The prospect of war between India and Pakistan now consumes more of the attention of Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Senior administration officials, are still engaged in an internal debate over whether to open a second front -- and, if so, where. If the time is not ripe to take on Saddam Hussein, should the United States set its sights on Somalia and Southeast Asia? 
But even as those debates continue, Mr. bin Laden remains unaccounted for. The search of the burned-out caves in Tora Bora produced evidence that Mr. bin Laden, an ineffective fighter, was perhaps a more successful fugitive. (He had recently been in residence.) But that only raised new suspicions about whether the surrogate ground force the United States had used for the campaign in the caves had, through incompetence or corruption, let him slip away.
Mr. Bush's aides focus instead on what has gone right in Afghanistan. The new government is taking power more smoothly than many anticipated, they note. British peacekeepers have arrived, women are lining up to get into Kabul's shattered university and the cleanup of mines and Al Qaeda hideouts continues. Two senior Al Qaeda fighters were seized earlier this week, and intelligence agents are sorting through a trove of computers, old notebooks and maps seized from Al Qaeda safe houses. Hundreds of prisoners, assessing their sudden change of fortune, have begun to talk -- except those who are suicidal and bent on taking their captors with them.
Mr. Bush uses these events to argue that Washington pundits who declare the war has bogged down are as wrong today as they were in early October, before the fall of the Taliban.
"We're making steady progress -- and I use the word 'steady' because sometimes it seems like there is a certain impatience in the airwaves," Mr. Bush said during a talk on Saturday to a cheering crowd of students and their parents at Parkrose High School on the outskirts of Portland, Ore.
He suggested that the public understands the difficulties ahead, perhaps better than the experts and commentators. "I don't believe that there's an impatience amongst the American people," he said. Tomorrow, Mr. Bush will appear at the Pentagon to sign a bill providing a large increase in military spending, in part in the expectation that the mission in Afghanistan will be long and costly.
Still, the White House seems not to have many ready answers about its own next moves.
At his daily briefing today, Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, largely deflected questions about how long the growing ranks of prisoners in Afghanistan will be detained, whether they are truly "prisoners of war," or what kind of discussions are under way about how to try the midlevel members of Al Qaeda now in custody. He made it clear that Mr. Bush is less interested in the legal niceties than the practical necessity of letting peace take hold.
"If the alternative is to let them roam Afghanistan free again to commit more crimes and to engage in war, that's clearly not an option," he said.
Officials caution that the campaign in Afghanistan, which has experienced periods of intense activity followed by periods of halting progress, is likely to continue in this way. The end of the war on terrorism, they say, is nowhere in sight.
Yet while it continues, there is at least one urgent new front to address. Inside in the offices of the National Security Council, Afghanistan seems far less a priority than assuring that India and Pakistan do not trip into war -- or that Pakistan's radical Islamic minority does not seize the moment to confront President Pervez Musharaff, Mr. Bush's new ally. The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell would travel to India and Pakistan next week.
"Afghanistan is now a cleanup operation, and cleanup operations are by their nature less focused than active combat," argued one of Mr. Bush's senior advisers last weekend. "But the bigger risk right now isn't that Afghanistan is going to implode -- that's actually going better than we expected -- it's that the rest of the neighborhood will go up in flames."

HEADLINE: Ex-Labor Secretary Outlines Race to Lead Massachusetts 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Bursting late into a crowded field, Robert B. Reich, the former secretary of labor, announced today that he would be a Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts.
 Mr. Reich, a professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University who speaks and writes broadly on those subjects, said he would make the state's sagging economy a priority. 
 In his announcement at a Back Bay hotel, Mr. Reich called Acting Gov. Jane M. Swift, a Republican who is seeking re-election, "something of an embarrassment." 
But before Mr. Reich (pronounced rysch) can campaign against Ms. Swift, he will have to compete for the Democratic nomination against five other candidates. That could be quite difficult under the party's nominating rules. To qualify for the primary election, a candidate must get 15 percent of the vote at the state Democratic convention, on June 1. 
The other candidates -- State Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien; former State Senator Warren Tolman; Steve Grossman, a businessman; Secretary of State William Francis Galvin; and Thomas F. Birmingham, the State Senate president -- have had significant head starts in campaigning and fund-raising.
"I don't have any illusions how difficult it is for me to even get on the ballot in Massachusetts," Mr. Reich said today.
But he said he entered the race because he believed he had "something extra" to offer.
Mr. Reich, 56, made it clear he intended to use his experience as secretary of labor during the first four years of the Clinton administration as a drawing card. 
"I was a member of an administration that presided over the longest period of expansion and economic growth in American history," he said. 
People close to Mr. Clinton said they could not imagine that the former president would support Mr. Reich's campaign. After Mr. Reich left the administration, he was not bashful about criticizing the president. A former Clinton White House official put it this way, "It will be interesting to see how former Secretary Reich will explain a number of very negative comments in the last several years about President Clinton to Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts."
Mr. Reich said he talked with Mr. Clinton and had not been discouraged from running. Mr. Grossman, who was chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party and then the national party, has said he has Mr. Clinton's support.
Mr. Reich is one of four Clinton cabinet officials running for governor in their states. The others are Andrew M. Cuomo, the former housing secretary, in New York; Janet Reno, the former attorney general, in Florida; and Bill Richardson, the former energy secretary, in New Mexico. 
Mr. Reich said he planned to lay out specific plans for improving the economy in speeches in the coming weeks. In previous interviews, he has not ruled out the possibility of seeking an increase in the state capital gains tax, something none of his Democratic opponents have touched. 
Today, he said, he would "do everything in my power not to raise taxes, but I am not going to make any read-my-lips promises or say over my dead body. That would be irresponsible."
In his speeches, Mr. Reich often jokes about his short stature. In his closing punch line today, he said, "I am not a big man. But it is not the size of the dog in the fight. It is the size of the fight in the dog."

HEADLINE: AT THE MOVIES; 
Kung-fu Brave Vs. Gallic Beast

BYLINE:  By Dave Kehr

 BODY:
Born in Hawaii and raised in Germany, the martial-arts champion Mark Dacascos plays an American Indian in the French film "Brotherhood of the Wolf."
 That's one working definition of globalization, but Mr. Dacascos, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife and year-old son, is a modest man who sees nothing very strange in his resume. 
 "My mother and father are both kung-fu teachers," Mr. Dacascos said, "and most of my free time was spent at their kung-fu school, either training or doing my homework in one of the back rooms. When I was 9, we moved to Hamburg, Germany, and I lived there until I was 18. However, when I was 17, I did spend 6 months in Taiwan." 
"My mother is half-Irish and half-Japanese, and my father is Spanish-Chinese-Filipino," he added, by way of explaining his global dimensions. "When I was going to school in Hawaii almost 30 years ago, I looked very different from everyone else. I was really a fish out of water. I wanted to be like all the other kids, but there was no way I could. I was searching for an identity, and I think I found it at my dad's martial-arts school, where I took on more of my Chinese heritage."
"Brotherhood of the Wolf," which opens today (review, page 30), is a period adventure film, set during the reign of Louis XV when a mysterious beast was terrorizing southern France. It was a huge hit in France last year, and opens stateside today, in the hope of joining "The Closet," "Amelie" and "The Crimson Rivers" in what has become an unexpected surge of French films finding mainstream acceptance in the United States.
Mr. Dacascos plays Mani, an Iroquois warrior brought back from the New World by Gregoire de Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan), a naturalist assigned by the king to track down the rampaging beast. The resourceful Mani befriends the wolves of the forest, who lead him to the beast's lair.
"I'm not Native American," Mr. Dacascos said. "However, I feel the belief systems of the Native Americans are very similar to the people from Hawaii, in that we really respect nature. Just having those senses definitely helped me. And I worked with a Mohawk cultural teacher, Alex Rice, who tried to explain the values of her people to me.
"Of course, we wanted to make Mani a person of flesh and blood, too -- not just this noble sage guy walking around with a straight face," Mr. Dacascos said. "I wanted to find a sense of humor and give him some flaws. He's very highly evolved, but in spite of that, he can still get drunk and go to a brothel and have a good time."

Pasadena Scribbler
"I didn't grow up in Orange County, but all of my family lives there," said Mike White, the screenwriter of the engaging teenage comedy "Orange County," which opens nationally today (review, page 32). "I grew up in Pasadena, which is just splitting hairs. I was a young scribbler, and for some reason I always wanted to be a writer, but I grew up in a world where that didn't seem like an option. I had idealized fantasies of higher education, the idea that somewhere outside my homeland there'd be a place that would take me where I wanted to go."
The main character in "Orange County," Shaun Brumder (played by Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks), is a scribbler, too, and he has placed his hopes on going to Stanford, where his favorite novelist (Kevin Kline) is on the faculty. But when an incompetent high school counselor sends someone else's transcripts to the university, Shaun finds himself rejected. With the help of his girlfriend (Schuyler Fisk, daughter of Sissy Spacek) and his stoner brother (Jack Black), he sets out to correct this gross injustice, only to create further problems along the way.
The film was produced by the theatrical division of MTV, and for Mr. White, "the fun of the movie was making an MTV movie that in some lighthearted way subverted the MTV childhood that I had."
Mr. White's scribblings went on to include several scripts for the popular television series "Dawson's Creek" and the independent film "Chuck and Buck," in which Mr. White played one of the title characters, a sweetly eccentric young man who has been harboring a secret crush on his best friend from grade school for 20 years. He also plays a small but telling role in "Orange County," as an English teacher with an uncertain understanding of Shakespeare. "The acting thing is just kind of a whim," Mr. White said. "It's not really my focus; it's just fun. What's frustrating is when you write stuff and then you hand it off, and you're not a part of the production side of it. Acting has been a way of being part of the production of the movie, even if I'm not directing it."
Directing is definitely on the horizon for Mr. White, who last year had a television series of his own devising, "Pasadena," on the air. "It was the first time I had creative control, and now I'm feeling like it would be cool to direct," he said. "There comes a time when you're tired of being a backseat driver, and you're ready to succeed or fail on your own terms."

Japan Noir
The winter film series at the Japan Society (333 East 47th Street, Manhattan) is called "Dark Visions: Japanese Film Noir and Neo-Noir." Though it concludes with a couple of well-known films by Akira Kurosawa -- the 1948 "Drunken Angel" (March 19) and the 1963 "High and Low" (March 22) -- most of the movies in the series won't be familiar to western audiences: they include work by less celebrated masters like Yoshitaro Nomura ("The Chase," Jan. 25), Kiyoshi Kurosawa ("The Guard From Underground," Feb. 1) and Sogo Ishii ("Labyrinth of Dreams," Feb. 8).
For Daisuke Miyao, a film historian and doctoral candidate at New York University who will introduce the series with a lecture next Friday at 6:30 p.m., the significant difference between American and Japanese film noir is one of time frame: at their height in the late 1940's and early 50's, the Hollywood noirs expressed the despair and disillusionment of a generation returning from war, while the Japanese noirs were a phenomenon of the late 50's through the 60's, when, Mr. Miyao said, "people were losing faith in the new economic and political systems, and looking for other values."
For Mr. Miyao, one quintessential Japanese film noir is the movie that will be shown after his lecture, at 7:30: Seijun Suzuki's "Branded to Kill" (1967). "Its use of a complicated narrative and complicated points of view, its use of the femme fatale figure and its very nihilistic, cynical, thematic motifs make it a classic of the golden period," he said.

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

* ARTS ON THE HIGH WIRE, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 485-1534. Between the Sept. 11 attacks and the recession, contributions to nonprofit arts organizations slumped seriously in 2001. Artists working in the World Trade Center area also suffered damage to studios, artworks and spirits. This benefit concert will raise immediate money for the New York Arts Recovery Fund along with recognizing that the arts need support. The lineup, featuring musicians with downtown sensibilities, includes the songwriters Joe Jackson and Suzanne Vega, the performance artist Laurie Anderson, the clarinetist and composer Don Byron, the turntablist quartet the X-ecutioners and the composer and improviser John Zorn, along with dancers (Elizabeth Streb), cartoonists (Jules Feiffer, Ben Katchor, Art Speigelman), authors (Paul Auster, Roy Blount Jr.), the clown Bill Irwin and, yes, a tightrope walker: none other than Philippe Petit, who once walked a wire strung between the tops of the World Trade Center towers. Tonight at 8; tickets are $15 to $25 (Jon Pareles).

ANDY BISKIN, DREW GRESS, DAVE BALLOU, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9318. Mr. Biskin, the clarinetist -- a builder of melodically coherent, ear-pleasing jazz miniatures -- is an idea person. You can hear in his music the particular assignment he was giving himself. In the past he has worked with a New Orleans-style frontline, and with the songs of Stephen Foster, among other things; now he's trying out a trio with clarinet, bass and trumpet. The lack of a drummer leads to openness; it can be a fertile valley to explore. Tomorrow night at 9; cover charge is $10 and there is a $6 minimum. (Ben Ratliff).

GEORGE COLEMAN OCTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. Here is the great Memphis tenor saxophonist, a perennially underrated musician and a serious harmonic improviser, in a rare grouping, getting away from his usual quartet. Included in the band are some of the musicians who have become regulars at this uptown club, like the trumpeter Jim Rotondi and the bassist John Webber, and others like Gary Smulyan, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band's baritone saxophonist. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $18 (Ratliff).

EKOOSTIK HOOKAH, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The lyrics to Ekoostik Hookah's songs often long for refuges where the good times roll, and the music takes the jam-band route to get there, putting pushy blues guitar and shifty meters into the Grateful Dead format. After 10 years on the circuit, the band has a dedicated following. Tomorrow night at 9:30, with an opening set by Brothers Past; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow (Pareles).

* GIGI, KARSH KALE, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778. Gigi comes from Ethiopia, where funk, African melodies and Arabic inflections added up to music full of unexpected angles and modal curves. The longing in her songs is communicated without translation by her plaintive but determined voice. In the United States, the producer Bill Laswell hooked up her music with jazz and electronics on her impressive debut album, "Gigi" (Palm Pictures); for these shows, she will have acoustic backup. Tonight at 9; admission is $15. Tomorrow night at 6:30 she shares a bill with Karsh Kale, a tabla player and disc jockey whose far-reaching band fuses Indian traditions and electronica; admission is $20 (Pareles).

* JIM HALL TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. There's probably no more self-effacing player at Jim Hall's level in jazz; he plays as if he could ditch it all tomorrow and never think about it again. His own compositions are sweet, oddball, sectional, played against lithe, swinging accompaniment. (This weekend it's Scott Colley on bass and Terry Clarke on drums.) Even at their most unconventional, Mr. Hall's tunes sometimes run the risk of sounding dinky, using light blues and country phrases in original, circuitous song forms that aren't their natural element. But he is true to himself. He is not razzing popular music or pulling anybody's leg, and his trail of accomplishments speak for themselves: his late-50's stint in Jimmy Giuffre's trio, his playing with Sonny Rollins ("The Bridge") and Art Farmer ("Live at the Half Note") and a recent, late-blooming explosion as a composer and arranger. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).

HOOBASTANK, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The eternal adolescent identity crisis takes shape in Hoobastank's tuneful, vigorously strummed songs, which sound something like the Dave Matthews Band playing tributes to Tool and Rage Against the Machine. Tonight at 9. Tickets, $10; the performance is sold out, but returns may be available (Pareles).

INTERPOL, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Miss the 1980's heyday of Depeche Mode and New Order? Interpol sets out to revive the moody propulsion of vintage mope-rock. Tomorrow night at 11:30, with the Astrojet at 9:30 and Sea Ray at 10:30; admission is $10 (Pareles).

IRISH MUSIC GALA, Blarney Star, 43 Murray Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 732-2873. The traditional Irish music series at the Blarney Star resumes with an all-star lineup that's also a preview of its coming season: Brian Conway on fiddle, Jerry O'Sullivan on uilleann pipes, Dermot Grogan on flute, John Dillon on guitar and no fewer than four button accordionists: James Keane, Patty Furlong, Joey Mullen and Tom Dunne. Tonight at 9; admission is $12 (Pareles).

D. D. JACKSON, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778. This Canadian jazz pianist is concerned with the evolution of jazz, and he's getting there through hybrid forms, having added dashes of a classical sensibility, of Latin music, of electric fusion and other things. He has a new record, "Sigame," on the Justin Time label, for which he has been prolific. Tonight at 7; cover charge is $20 (Ratliff).

* BAABA MAAL, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778. Every so often, the Senegalese singer and songwriter Baaba Maal takes a break from leading his explosive band to play acoustic guitar. With his mentor and longtime duet partner Mansour Seck on vocals and Kaouding Cissoko on acoustic guitar, this is a chance to hear Mr. Maal's fusion of griot music and Western pop in its most intimate form. Tomorrow through Monday night at 9:30; admission is $30 (Pareles).

LES McCANN, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. A Southern pianist who made his name in the 1960's with some ingeniously contemporary-sounding music -- particularly the "Swiss Movement" album with Eddie Harris, which yielded the song "Compared to What" -- Les McCann is a gray eminence of jazz-funk. Tonight through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge at the tables is $30 and a $5 minimum; at the bar, $20 and a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).

ROGER McGUINN, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 502-3471. One of folk-rock's founding fathers as the leader of the Byrds, Roger McGuinn plugged in an electric 12-string guitar for songs by Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger, and the Top 40 was never the same; then he turned to country-rock. He's bound to riffle through his back pages onstage; expect "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "Chestnut Mare." Tonight at 8; admission is $30 (Pareles).

RENE McLEAN, Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766. Son of the alto saxophonist Jackie McLean, this tenor saxophonist has made some distinguished music himself, especially an album made in South Africa in the early 90's. He is not often seen in New York. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $10 (Ratliff).

BRAD MEHLDAU AND DIANNE REEVES, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. A double bill, in which Mr. Mehldau's trio and Ms. Reeves's own group will play independent short sets. It's an interesting pairing of an inward-looking and harmony-rich pianist and a forthright, straight-out virtuosic singer whose talent still hasn't quite been captured on record but who always gives rewarding performances. Sunday night at 8 and 10; cover charge is $30 with a $10 minimum. (Ratliff).

MISSION OF BURMA, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The blunt noise of punk and glimmers of the complexity of progressive rock were merged in Mission of Burma, a Boston band that lasted from 1979 to 1983 and influenced the likes of R.E.M., which has played the band's "Academy Fight Song"; Blur; and Moby, who remade "That's When I Reach for My Revolver." It played so loud that its guitarist, Roger Miller, has suffered from severe tinnitis ever since, but its founding trio has briefly reunited for two shows in New York and two in Boston. Tomorrow's show at 9 p.m. is sold out; Sunday night at 9 tickets are $25 in advance and $30 on day of show (Pareles).

MOLDY PEACHES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Adam Green and Kimya Dawson, who lead the Moldy Peaches, can be crude, earnest, funny, folky and punky. They volley lines back and forth or sometimes sing two lyrics at once, and although they have song titles like "Who's Got the Crack," easy laughs aren't all they offer: "We like to contradict ourselves, that's our act," Mr. Green raps. The Realistics and Scrappy Hamilton are opening acts. Tomorrow night at 9; admission is $10 (Pareles).

MARIO PAVONE QUARTET, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Mr. Pavone's band plays simple tunes, built of vamps and strong melodies, with energy and taste. In the last decade he has branched out quite a bit, playing with a lot of different bands, and this weekend's band tends toward the raucous side. It includes the saxophonist Tony Malaby, the trumpeter Steven Bernstein (both of whom can roar) and the drummer Michael Sarin. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10; admission is $12, with a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).

JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, below Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. This French pianist is a splashy stunner at the piano keyboard, sharing a line that runs from Errol Garner to Don Pullen, and he loves running Monk (as well as his own melodies) through mazelike chord substitutions. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; cover charge is $12 (Ratliff).

* MONICA SALMASO WITH CYRO BAPTISTA, Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street, at Lexington Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 772-4448 or (212) 545-7536. Monica Salmaso, a singer from Brazil making her New York City debut with these concerts, carries on all the best aspects of Brazilian pop: the melodies, the genuinely poetic Portuguese lyrics, the understatement that makes sophisticated music seductive. The ever-inventive percussionist Cyro Baptista sits in. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30, $15 for students, $26 for members (Pareles).

SINGERS OVER MANHATTAN: ANDY BEY AND BARBARA CARROLL, Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse, 10th floor, Rose Building, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. A singer with great range and sensitivity -- his enormous voice centers on a bass-baritone but shoots into falsetto range -- Mr. Bey has been having a slow but steady career revival in the last five years. Barbara Carroll has a Carlyle Hotel audience (she appears there every year) and a past in New York bebop. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $45; both shows are sold out, but returns may be available (Ratliff).

SMOKEY AND MIHO, LOUIE AUSTEN, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Miho Hatori sings and writes songs for the funk-rap-lounge band Cibo Matto; Smokey Hormel has played guitar with Tom Waits and Beck. Leading a band, they promise to delve into -- what else? -- Brazilian music. Tonight at Northsix, they share the bill with Louie Austen, who has been crooning love songs in hotel bars for two decades, has lately hooked up with some synthesizer-loving techno producers and is about to release his first album. Tonight at 9, with the jazz drummer Ben Perowsky and his band opening; admission is $10. Tomorrow, Smokey and Miho play the 8 p.m. set at Tonic, followed by Vinicius Cantuaria at 10 and midnight. Mr. Cantuaria is steeped in the bossa nova: its gently brushed guitar chords, its quietly elaborate melodies, its shades of sensuality and melancholy. He knows it well enough to stretch the form without losing its essence. Admission at Tonic is $10 for Smokey and Miho, $12 for Mr. Cantuaria, or $16 for both (Pareles).

* KOKO TAYLOR, SON SEALS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Koko Taylor's big, raspy voice blasts through her blues tunes like a sandstorm. She's fond of tunes full of male braggadocio, like "Wang Dang Doodle," and she's as tough as anyone who has ever sung them. This double bill pairs her with a bluesman as untamed as she is: Son Seals, who plays Chicago blues with the classic alchemy of despair, ferocity and joy. His voice growls while his guitar solos taunt and sear, ratcheting up the tension within his plaints and accusations. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35; 10 minimum. (Pareles).

VICE, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052.. Corey Glover, whose recent shows with the reunited Living Colour have reminded fans that he's an exemplary hard-rock belter, leads his own band, Vice. Tonight at 8, with Vial and Wild Nine as opening acts; admission is $10 (Pareles).

BUSTER WILLIAMS, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. A liquid-toned, agile bassist and a heavyweight from the middle-aged generation of players who were coming up amid the fusion years, Mr. Williams has kept strong small bands for years; this one includes the saxophonist Javon Jackson, the pianist Eric Reed and the drummer Lenny White. Tonight through Sunday night at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tomorrow; cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow and $15 on Sunday, and there is a $10 minimum all nights (Ratliff).

* WORLD MUSIC SHOWCASE, Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000. With the Association of Performing Arts Presenters meeting in New York City, this bill gives music from five continents a public audition. Fantcha sings mornas, the lilting, wistful, piquantly mournful songs from the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Senegal. Monica Salmaso sings Brazilian pop. Spaccanapoli turns Italian tarantellas and pro-labor sentiments into rousing rock songs. Lo'Jo, led by a gravel-voiced French singer, sounds like an itinerant cabaret band that has wandered a long way from the boulevards, hearing griot tunes and tangos and Tom Waits. Les Yeux Noirs, another French group, plays gypsy and klezmer tunes. The Israeli jazz bassist Avishai Cohen leads his International Vamp Band, which leans toward Latin rhythms; Silk Road plays Chinese folk music, and the steel drummer Andy Narell plays easygoing Caribbean-tinged jazz. Sunday at 6 p.m.; admission is $15 (Pareles).

KEVIN YOST, Centro-Fly, 45 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-7770. Kevin Yost, a drummer turned disc jockey, plays sets of house music that mix his own tracks with others he loves, full of buoyant keyboard chords, utopian vocals and more than a trace of jazz. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $20 (Pareles).

HEADLINE: Bracing for Soft Sales, Carmakers Stake Out High Ground 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
WITH economic gloom casting shadows like winter snow clouds over the North American International Auto Show, the luxury market appears to be giving off a glimmer of light. 
 Even as auto companies are bracing for softer sales, after the torrid pace of the last three years, they are rolling out high-ticket vehicles in all sizes and configurations. 
 Almost every manufacturer in the $30,000 and up market, from domestic stalwarts like Cadillac and Lincoln, to Japanese challengers like Lexus and Infiniti, to European makers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, has something new on display here, either as models set for production or as concept vehicles, which are designs that often reach the market with some modifications for the sake of practicality. 
The interest in luxury is easy to explain. The high-end market is one of the few profitable sectors left as competition cuts into profit margins on mass-market cars and on mainstream trucks and sport utilities. Luxury sales continue to grow with segments still left to explore. 
During media previews of the auto show, which opens tomorrow, Denny Clements, the general manager of Lexus, a division of Toyota, said he expected industry sales of luxury trucks would rise 45 percent, to 440,000 a year, by the end of next year. Just a few feet away stood the GX 470, Lexus's third sport utility vehicle. It will go on sale in about a year at roughly $45,000, priced between the hulking LX 470 and the midsize RX 300. 
Lexus sales reached a record 222,000 last year, of which about 30 percent, or about 66,600 vehicles, were trucks. Industrywide, trucks, including sport utilities, pickups and minivans, outsold cars for the first time, accounting for 51 percent of vehicle sales in America. 
Mr. Clements cited demographics to back up his optimism. "Someone is turning 50 every eight seconds," he said, and buyers from ages 45 to 62 dominate the luxury market. He also pointed to what he calls the "democratization of affluence." By 2005, he said, 11 percent of households will have incomes of more than $100,000 a year.
Moreover, Mr. Clements said, attitudes have changed since Sept. 11. "There is not quite the stigma of, 'Who are you to buy this car?' " he said. 
"People are falling in love with cars again," he said, "and they are saying, 'I deserve to have this car now.' "
Executives at BMW, which sold a record 213,000 vehicles in the United States last year, behind Lexus and ahead of Mercedes-Benz, sense the same change of attitude. 
"If this is what life is about, I want to enjoy it more," Thomas Purves, chief executive of BMW's operations in the Americas, said of the attitudes of consumers.
BMW has several new vehicles on sale or in the works. On display here is a new version of the company's 7-Series sedan, which will sell for at least $70,000. The car has been criticized by some BMW purists for its curvy rear styling and its electronic operating menus, which are controlled by a joystick. 
"I just don't know what they were thinking," said Jeremy P. Anwyl, chief executive of Edmunds.com, a Web site that provides information to car buyers. 
Mr. Purves said he thought the car would sell well when it goes on sale in a couple months. "Americans are much more open to new things," he said. "This car really grows on you."
Still to come from BMW is a compact sport utility, the X3, plus new 1-Series and 6-Series cars. 
Mr. Purves said the four new lines should help the company reach its goal of selling 300,000 vehicles a year in America.
While BMW is predicting stronger American sales for 2002, Mr. Purves said he thought it was dangerous for manufacturers to consider the luxury market immune from an economic slowdown. BMW was among the automakers whose sales were hurt in the industry's last big recession, from 1990 to 1992. Mr. Purves said he expected the first six months would be "quite tough" because of the slow economy and because potential buyers might have already been swept into the market by special financing offers last fall.
The automakers based in Detroit have their own flood of new luxury vehicles, as Cadillac and Lincoln try to establish new images and new looks. 
Lincoln is showing a redesigned Navigator sport utility, as well as a conceptual design for a Continental that recalls the clean, understated Lincolns of the 1960's. 
Cadillac displayed the production version of its two-seat XLR roadster a slightly revised version of a previous concept car called the Evoq which is about a year away from reaching the market. 
Cadillac has even taken a swipe at Ferrari, displaying a low, sharp-edged concept for a high-performance, V-12 sports car. Called the Cien, the car shows how Cadillac's faceted "art and science" design could be applied to models in the six-figure range, about twice as much as the most expensive Cadillacs currently offered.
Smaller European companies are also eager to join the market. Volvo rolled out its XC90, a sport wagon with S.U.V. features, and the Land Rover unit of the Ford Motor Company displayed a new Range Rover, which is more refined and plush than its predecessors. 
Maserati, which is owned by Ferrari, is returning to the American market after 10 years. At the show, it displayed a coupe as a companion for the convertible that goes on sale this year. The Maseratis will be priced from $77,000 to $87,000.
A pair of concept wagons also attracted attention. The Audi Avantissimo sport wagon, first shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show last fall, is a design study for a large, spacious wagon based on the A8 sedan. Mercedes showed a sleeker but somewhat similar wagon it calls the GST, for Grand Sports Tourer, a departure from the company's existing lineup of clearly defined sedans, roadsters and sport utilities.
Mercedes led the American luxury market in 1999 but has fallen to third place. S. Paul Halata, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz U.S.A., said the company had several products on the way, beginning with a new version of the SL luxury roadster, on display here, which would go on sale in the spring.
Next fall, there will be a new midsize E-Class sedan, which will keep its distinct round head lamps. Next year, Mercedes will introduce an ultra-luxury sedan, the Maybach, which will join an increasingly crowded field of cars selling from $100,000 to $500,000.
Mr. Halata said he was not concerned that a softer economy would hurt his company's plans. 
"We've been very fortunate in the past not to have felt the impact" of recessions, he said. Besides, he said, Mercedes's century-old heritage is a selling tool that newer brands, presumably including the 13-year-old Lexus, can only wish for. 
"A lot of manufacturers would pay for our heritage," he said. 
Mr. Anwyl of Edmunds.com said that he was impressed by efforts to attract luxury buyers, but he cautioned that competition would be fierce. 
"It all comes down to quality," he said. "This is an unforgiving market and it should be."

Though shot in digital video and accompanied by a sprightly techno score, "E-Dreams," Wonsuk Chin's documentary about the rise and fall of Kozmo.com has the artifactual feel of an old newsreel. The movie is a window into an era that feels curiously remote. Listening to the buoyant young C.E.O.'s and market analysts talk about their I.P.O.'s and market caps, you may feel a vague stirring of nostalgia, accompanied by mild disbelief. Did people really talk that way back then? Did they really believe that a business devoted to delivering videocassettes and pints of Ben and Jerry's to lazy urbanites could merit hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital?
 Back then, of course, was around two years ago, in the giddy days of the dot-com boom. Residents of New York and a handful of other cities may remember Kozmo delivery folk with their orange bags zipping through intersections. Compulsive CNBC watchers will recognize Joseph Park, the affable, energetic 20-something who, along with his buddy Yong Kang, left jobs in investment banking to pursue what they, without irony or embarrassment, call their "vision." Mr. Park was one of the Internet boom's media darlings, and in "E-Dreams" he spends a lot of time at photo shoots and in talk-show green rooms, and even more on his cellphone with journalists. 
 If you have seen "Startup.com," Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim's chronicle of the short life of govworks.com, "E-Dreams" will feel familiar. In "Startup," the company's reversals of fortune were mirrored in the deteriorating friendship of its founders, Kaleil Tuzman and Tom Herman, and Mr. Chin's film, lacking the dimension of personal drama, is thinner and more distant from its subjects. Though the director incorporates some nice street-level shots of Kozmo messengers in motion, and some glimpses of the chaos in the company's warehouses, the movie is a little claustrophobic -- a marathon of conference calls, frenzied pointing and clicking, and office pep talks.
Happily for Mr. Chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match. In 1998, Kozmo arrived in New York with a few employees, many of whom slept in the company's basement offices and showered at nearby health clubs. By early 1999, Kozmo had raised $28 million in financing and by Christmas of that year it had secured an additional $120 million.
With nearly 4,000 employees (everyone, in Mr. Park's view, an imminent millionaire), a $150 million "strategic" deal with Starbucks (to allow consumers to buy a latte and return a video in one location) and a wildly disproportionate sense of its prospects (Mr. Park dreams of being as big as Amazon, Federal Express or IBM), Kozmo prepares for that late-90's rite of passage, the initial public offering (I.P.O.).
In February of 2000, we see Mr. Park brandishing a cigar at an Oscar party and predicting an even bigger blowout once Kozmo goes public. (At another point he somewhat abashedly calculates that, if the stock trades at $20 a share, he would be worth around $150 million.)
The I.P.O. never took place, and the party ended with the Nasdaq crash of April 14, 2000 -- at which point "E-Dreams" discloses that Kozmo had been losing roughly 10 times its revenue. Suddenly, the picayune matter of profitability became a big deal, and Kozmo's brilliant business model, which had thought of just about everything else, began to unravel.
By July, Mr. Park had been ousted by the company's board, and we are left wondering which is more astonishing: a 27-year-old C.E.O. of a multimillion-dollar company or a 28-year-old former C.E.O. He is too young to be tragic, too lucky to be heroic; his story is like a Dreiser novel redone as an Archie comic, or a pilot for the WB network.
Once upon a time, Mr. Park and his partner were objects of envy and admiration -- rock stars, in his own immodest formulation. Then, as their stock options turned out to be play money, they were regarded with smug schadenfreude. "E-Dreams," which opens today at the Quad, invites a more objective and sympathetic point of view.
Mr. Park comes across as amiable and energetic, and in a scene with his parents -- immigrants from South Korea who run a dry-cleaning business in Philadelphia -- we understand that he is harnessing the new economy in pursuit of a very old dream. His pluck is accompanied by folly amounting almost to hubris, but this is the kind of sin that capitalism ultimately forgives.

HEADLINE: Vodafone Shares Cooling With Slower Growth in America 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The Vodafone Group, a wireless favorite among investors, has lost a bit of its luster of late.
 Today, its shares fell nearly 4 percent, adding to a 12 percent slide this week, as analysts expressed concerns about disappointing growth of subscribers in the United States and the uncertain introduction of new wireless services in Europe. 
 Vodafone shares have now given back nearly all the gains accrued in a rally that began last fall. The shares closed today in London down 3.7 percent, at 164.5 pence. On the New York Stock Exchange, its American depository receipts -- each representing 10 shares of the British company -- closed at $23.65, down 10 cents. 
Shares of other European telecommunications companies also fell today.
The intention of a large Vodafone shareholder to sell its stake contributed to the rapid deterioration of the share price this week, analysts said. Banco Santander Central Hispano, which owns 1.1 billion Vodafone shares, is looking to sell the stock to raise money to cover losses related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso.
Banco Santander, Spain's largest bank, has estimated that it stands to lose nearly $3 billion almost immediately from the devaluation.
Executives from Banco Santander were not immediately available. A spokesman for Vodafone declined to comment.
Other worries weighed on Vodafone shares today, analysts said, including a disappointing report from Verizon Wireless, a cellphone operator in the United States. Vodafone owns 45 percent of the venture; Verizon Communications owns the rest. Verizon Wireless said it added 750,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2001, or nearly 200,000 fewer than some analysts had expected.
In addition, some retailers have reported disappointing sales of mobile phone handsets during the important Christmas selling period. 
And NTT DoCoMo, the large Japanese phone company, said this week that it would fall short of previously set targets for subscribers to its new wireless service that offers customers a continuous connection to the Internet.
"Vodafone is the leader, and it is one of the first stocks people go to if they want to take money out of the sector," said Richard Lewis of New Star Asset Management, which owns some Vodafone shares.
The subscriber numbers reported by Verizon Wireless were especially disappointing against expectations that people in the United States would begin using mobile phones more frequently after the events of Sept. 11. 
"Some had factored in the events of Sept. 11 and expected people to buy mobile phones for security reasons," said John Tysoe, an analyst with WestLB Panmure in London. "That did not happen to the extent that people had expected."
The United States presents another challenge for Vodafone in that it is one of the few markets in which the company does not have a controlling stake.

HEADLINE: New Le Monde for a New France 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
If newspapers are a measure of the people who read them, the changes in format and content announced today by the daily Le Monde may signal how the nation where it holds an established place is evolving.
 Seven years ago, on the brink of insolvency, Le Monde remade itself, subtly but firmly, by separating editorial content more clearly from news and by giving more emphasis to the economy. 
 Taking those changes one step further, the editors said today that they intended to brighten the paper's staid look with more photographs. More important, with the euro replacing the franc, the editors said they would step up their coverage of European institutions, finance and the stock market. 
Increased financial coverage, said Edwy Plenel, Le Monde's editor, will be "in the image of what exists in the Anglo-Saxon world," adding: "That is a competition that exists."
Jean-Marie Colombani, Le Monde's director, called the changes part of a strategy "to adapt permanently to change." After the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, he said, "our planet is in movement, and it is more difficult to describe and to interpret." 
Mr. Plenel said that when the ad market revives, the paper also plans increased coverage of sports and cultural events and a new weekend magazine. Mr. Colombani said the changes involved no "monstrous investment" but would cost $5 million to $7 million.
The announcement came several months after Mr. Colombani unveiled plans for another sweeping change at Le Monde, a stock market listing. The paper is now controlled by its journalists under a complex ownership system.
Directly listing newspapers on the stock exchange is barred by French law, so Le Monde will instead create a holding company for itself and float 20 percent of it, hoping to raise about $89 million. Mr. Colombani said he hoped to complete the offering this year.
Le Monde is not facing a crisis now, as it was in the mid-1990's, when circulation fell to about 330,000 from 450,000 in 1980. Flagging ad linage in a sluggish French economy led to several years of losses. By 2000, though, daily paid circulation climbed back to 395,000, Mr. Colombani said, and the surge in appetite for news after the terror attacks added 10,000. Mr. Colombani wants to retain them and add 10,000 more.
The paper's finances also improved. In 2000, the latest year for which figures are available, Le Monde earned $23 million on revenue of $338 million. But the present slowdown in the French economy is eating into ad revenue, especially for employment ads.
Mr. Colombani said Le Monde's strategy was to resist the temptation to cut back on investment and quality now. "We are trying to be countercyclical," he said, "to better profit from the recovery, when the recovery inevitably comes."
European newspapers have been having a rough time. Ireland's paper of record, The Irish Times, said recently that losses for 2001 would reach $2.3 million and rise to $20 million this year. In Germany, the Springer Group, which publishes the conservative dailies Bild and Die Welt, expects to report losses for 2001, after flat earnings in recent years. In Italy, the powerful leftist daily, L'Unita, crushed by debt, was forced to suspend publication in 2000, though it has since reappeared.
Part of Mr. Colombani's strategy is expansion into related activities. In recent months, Le Monde has acquired a weekly magazine, Courier International, and a 20 percent stake in Switzerland's leading French-language daily, Le Temps of Geneva. Its online edition, www.lemonde.fr, registers 200,000 to 240,000 hits a day; it loses money now, but it hopes a new policy of introducing "paying zones" later this year will help it break even by 2004, he said.
Once regarded as the paper of older white men, Le Monde now says that a third of its readership is under 35 and that 42 percent are women. Building readership, according to Le Monde's strategy, depends on quality, even at the expense of the paper's traditional leftist leanings. Mr. Plenel said readers should "form opinions after reading our articles that may differ from what we print on our editorial pages."

HEADLINE: Culture in New York 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "City Faces Challenge to Close Widest Budget Gap Since 70's" (front page, Jan. 4), you touch on every aspect of the looming crisis. It is unclear, however, why the city's libraries, cultural institutions and parks are singled out for cuts. 
 Arts and culture are necessary components of the revival and survival of New York as a world-class city, and additionally, the economic viability of the city's arts and culture is tied inexorably to the economic well-being of the city, the state and the nation.
Arts policy should be part of the city's economic development plan, as the Center for an Urban Future clearly stated in its recent report.

HEADLINE: Our Wretched States 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Many Americans are surprised at the speed with which assurances that immense federal surpluses were here to stay gave way to the reality of deficits. Some of us, however, aren't surprised; we're simply following a trail blazed in places like Richmond and Austin. In the 1990's most states had Republican governors; and they applied the same strategy -- using what-me-worry forecasts and bogus accounting to justify tax cuts for the affluent -- that the Bush administration applied at a national level in 2001. In both cases the consequences were predictable. 
 The difference is that state governments are generally prohibited by their constitutions from borrowing to cover deficits. Eventually the federal government, too, must live within its means -- but spin and denial can delay the reckoning. State chickens come home to roost a lot faster. In other words, the state of the states is the shape of national things to come. 
 How bad is the state fiscal crisis? The National Governors Association recently reported that its members faced a combined shortfall -- that is, a gap between projected revenue and projected spending -- of at least $40 billion, and quite possibly $50 billion. The latter number would be almost 10 percent of states' budgets, a very large number indeed.
If 10 percent doesn't sound that big to you, remember that much state spending, like much federal spending, cannot be cut -- especially on short notice. A budget shortfall of 6.5 percent in the early 1990's led to severe cuts in services and forced 44 states to raise taxes; this one looks considerably worse.
How did states get themselves in this fix? The biggest proximate cause of the budget crunch is the end of the great 1990's boom; second place goes to surging medical costs. Expenses for homeland security add a final insult.
But stuff happens; why didn't states prepare for a rainy day? Although they can't borrow in bad times, state governments can accumulate reserves in good times. Instead, however, many governors acted as if the boom would never end. 
They increased spending -- though not all that much; spending by state and local governments was about the same share of G.D.P. at the end of the 1990's as it was at the beginning. 
More important, they cut taxes. Now it's true that state governments raised taxes in the early 1990's -- but as new work by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, they didn't cut the same taxes they had previously raised. Increases in regressive taxes -- that is, taxes like the sales tax, which bear most heavily on lower- and moderate-income families -- by and large were never reversed. Instead, states cut taxes that bear most heavily on upper-income families. The end result was a redistribution of the tax burden away from the haves toward the have-nots. A family earning, say, $30,000 per year pays considerably more in state taxes than a family with the same constant-dollar income did in 1990, while a family earning $600,000 per year pays considerably less. 
The way for these selective tax cuts was cleared not just with forecasts that made no allowance for contingencies, but with creative accounting worthy of Enron. For example, in 1999 the governor of Texas -- yes, him -- justified new corporate tax breaks with a budget that not only understated Medicaid costs by $550 million but hid regular payments for nursing care and other services by moving them from the last month of fiscal 2001 to the first month of 2002. Just last year, with the fiscal picture already darkening, Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia (who resigned as head of the Republican National Committee after his party lost the Virginia and New Jersey state houses) evaded a "trigger" rule that was supposed to postpone tax cuts in the event of a revenue shortfall; he booked an estimate of the entire value of future payments from tobacco companies as current revenue. 
Now the states must deal with the effects of past chicanery even as they face recession, soaring health care costs and the fiscal impact of terrorism. The result will be layoffs of teachers and policemen, medical care denied to the poor, delayed repairs to roads and bridges, and -- eventually, when it can no longer be avoided -- tax increases. And why do I think I know whose taxes will go up?
It's not a pretty picture, but you should get accustomed to it. As the states go, so goes America.

PERSON: Moe Foner 

HEADLINE: Moe Foner, Labor Official and Movement's Unofficial Cultural Impresario, Dies at 86 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Moe Foner, who played a major role in building New York City's largest union of health care workers and later was the labor movement's unofficial cultural impresario, staging art shows, plays and concerts, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86. 
 Mr. Foner was the longtime executive secretary of 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's Health and Human Service Union. 
 As the right-hand man to the union's president, Mr. Foner was an important strategist in 1199's landmark victories four decades ago, when it called two long strikes that won union recognition and higher wages for thousands of low-paid hospital workers. 
Those strikes made New York City's hospital workers the first employees in private, nonprofit hospitals in the nation to unionize. They also paved the way for state and federal legislation that guaranteed private hospital workers the right to unionize.
Mr. Foner played a behind-the-scenes role in the strikes, enlisting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1199's cause. Dr. King, who described 1199 as his "favorite union," called the fight to raise wages for the $30-a-week workers a civil rights struggle.
Mr. Foner was the founder of Bread and Roses, a cultural program that 1199 created to add a dimension to workers' lives beyond making hospital beds and earning a paycheck. 
At Bread and Roses, Mr. Foner put together a musical about the lives of hospital workers, had Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger sing to workers' children and installed the only art gallery at a union headquarters. He enlisted well-known artists including Ralph Fasanella, Sue Coe, Jacob Lawrence and Milton Glaser to contribute to exhibitions, some of which toured France, Italy and Sweden.
"I operated under the theory that a good union doesn't have to be dull," Mr. Foner said in an interview in 2000. Sometimes called the Sol Hurok of labor, Mr. Foner was widely viewed as the national leader in bringing cultural life to union members. 
He arranged for Shari Lewis, then just 13, to put on a ventriloquism performance for union members, and in 1954, he hired Ossie Davis, then a postal worker, to put on annual shows about civil rights, often with the help of rising stars like Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee. 
"Moe in a sense was a one-man cultural wave," Mr. Davis said. "He had a vision."
Mr. Foner was one of four prominent brothers who constituted one of the nation's most famous families on the left. His brothers Jack and Philip were leading historians and his brother Henry was president of the furriers' union. 
In 1942, Mr. Foner, then a clerk at City College, and his brother Philip, who taught there, were fired as the result of an investigation by the State Legislature's Rabb-Coudert Committee, which sought to purge Communists from government. His brother Jack, who also taught there, resigned.
A boarder who once lived in the Foner household acted as an informant to the committee. 
In 1980, a state legislative committee apologized to the Foners and 78 others who were dismissed, stating that it was wrong to punish them for their beliefs.
As a young man, Mr. Foner joined the Communist Party, having sympathized with the left's fight against Franco during the Spanish Civil War. He said he left the party in the 1950's as he learned about the horrors under Stalin.
"We looked to the Soviet Union as the beacon of hope," he said in 1991. "But I began to see the problems a long, long time ago."
Mr. Foner continued to dedicate his life to helping the service-sector proletariat, bringing a zesty cultural feast to union members, while also working as strategist, lobbyist and slogan writer to improve wages and benefits for New York's hospital workers.
"The conditions in the hospitals were terrible, the workers were mainly black and Latin, and nobody had ever tried to organize them before," he said in 1991. 
A close associate of Leon Davis, 1199's dour founder and president, Mr. Foner was the union's affable public relations expert, always quick with banter and a joke. Recognizing the importance of getting the union's message across, he was forever buttonholing legislators and editorial writers.
Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, a division of the Service Employees International Union, said Mr. Foner was an important 1199 leader who improved the lives of thousands of union members. "He helped build coalitions with intellectuals, political leaders, civil rights leaders and artists," Mr. Rivera said.
Morris Foner, known from his boyhood as Moe, was born on Aug. 3, 1915, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the son of Abraham and Mary Foner. His father was a seltzer man who lugged large bottles up to tenement apartments, and his mother was a housewife. He went to Eastern District High School and Brooklyn College, graduating in 1936.
After working briefly for an apparel workers' union, he took a job at the City College registrar's office, from which he was fired for his leftist beliefs. Afterward, he and his three brothers sought to make ends meet by forming a jazz band, Suspended Swing, which often played in the Catskills.
"They used to say the Foner brothers had the highest intellectual quotient and the lowest musical quotient," said Mr. Foner, who played saxophone.
Drafted during World War II, he was assigned to the quartermaster's corps at Fort Jay on Governors Island.
In December 1941, he married Anne Berman, who survives him, along with their daughters, Nancy Foner and Peggy Foner, both of Manhattan; a granddaughter; and his brother Henry.
In 1945, he became education director of Department Store Local 1250, which represented workers at Stern's and at many other stores that have since closed, including Namm's, Oppenheim's, Hearn's and Norton's. He taught economics classes and ran the union's cultural activities, overseeing creation of a musical about department store workers, called "Thursdays 'Til Nine."
In 1951, he became the social and cultural director of District 65 of the Distributive Workers. Most Saturday nights he arranged acts for the union's nightclub, enlisting, among others, Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte, Jack Gilford and the comedian Sam Levinson, then a high school teacher. 
When District 65 sought to force out Communists, Mr. Foner joined 1199, which was headed by Leon Davis, someone he knew from their Jewish center in Queens. "It was one of those leftist shuls that emphasized Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass," he said. 
Mr. Foner became 1199's educational and cultural director and editor of its newspaper. At the time, 1199 was a modest, quiet 5,000-member union, made up mostly of white pharmacists.
The union and Mr. Foner's life changed dramatically when 1199 set out in 1958 to organize bedpan emptiers, dietary aides and laundry room workers in New York City's hospitals.
In 1959, a 46-day strike against Mount Sinai, Montefiore and five other large hospitals gained tentative union recognition for the workers.
"It was a sad thing to see this bedraggled army stay out there," Mr. Foner said.
Responsible for rallying public support, he lined up backing from civil rights leaders like Dr. King, Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph and many elected officials and editorial writers.
In 1962, in a 56-day walkout against Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn, Mr. Foner played a crucial role in negotiating with the office of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. He helped persuade Mr. Rockefeller, who was concerned that the strike was worsening racial tensions, to introduce legislation guaranteeing workers at nonprofit hospitals the right to unionize.
As a result of these legislative changes and 1199's vigorous organizing, the union's membership has soared to more than 210,000.
As the union grew, Mr. Foner concentrated increasingly on cultural activities, although in the late 1960's, he became a key leader in rallying union opposition against the Vietnam War. For that, President Richard M. Nixon placed him on his enemies list.
In 1972, 1199 became the first union to install a permanent art gallery in his headquarters, which are on West 43rd Street. In 1978, Mr. Foner formally established Bread and Roses, helped by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, which was seeking to finance a model union cultural program.
In 1982, after Leon Davis died, Mr. Foner was forced out as 1199's executive secretary in a power struggle, but he continued running Bread and Roses.
Bread and Roses had singers and theater troupes perform in hospitals during workers' lunch hours. Mr. Foner oversaw creation of a musical, "Take Care," about the travails of hospital workers. The musical toured New York's hospitals and was seen by 35,000 workers. Joseph Papp, founder of the New York City Shakespeare Festival, once called Mr. Foner "the Joseph Papp of the labor movement."
Most recently, Mr. Foner conceived a popular series of posters, called "Women of Hope," that depict famous African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American and American Indian women, including Maya Angelou and Dolores Huerta, the co-founder of the United Farm Workers. These posters are now displayed in thousands of schools, libraries, union halls and cultural centers.
Working with Columbia University, Mr. Foner prepared a long oral history that Cornell University Press is scheduled to publish in July under the title "Not for Bread Alone."
The name Bread and Roses came from the slogan in the 1912 textile strike in Lawrence, Mass., where the workers wanted bread and roses, too. "It said in three words what this was all about," Mr. Foner said.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the health care union leader Moe Foner on Jan. 11 misstated the name of the New York State Legislature committee that investigated him and his brother in 1942 during a drive against Communists in government. It was the Rapp-Coudert Committee, not Rabb-Coudert.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Fall, Spurring Optimism 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The Labor Department reported today that the number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped last week to a level that led economists to suggest that the worst of the recession might be over.
 "A recovery is on the way," remarked Stephen Gallagher, chief economist in New York at Societe Generale. 
 State unemployment offices received 395,000 first-time applications, down 56,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said. Initial claims rose to 535,000 two weeks after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Analysts had expected initial claims last week of 425,000. 
The number of people drawing benefits fell to a three-month low of 3.53 million in the final week of 2001.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that a three-month decline in oil costs drove down the import price index for December and contributed to a record decrease in 2001 from 2000. Prices fell 0.9 percent last month and 8.9 percent from the period a year earlier. That reflected the slump in air travel and a further decline in the industrial economy in the wake of the attacks.
The drop in energy prices is "giving money back to households that they can spend on other goods, and that is a positive sign for the economy," Mr. Gallagher said.
Wholesale inventories fell 1.1 percent in November, the sixth consecutive decline and twice the pace analysts had expected, the Commerce Department reported today. Distributors pared supplies of automobiles, computers and clothing.
While lower inventories decrease official growth estimates, the levels suggest that factories will have to increase production to meet future demand.
Adjusting jobless claims figures for seasonal fluctuations can be difficult late in the holiday season, and changes in California law may have had an effect. Still, there were other signs of improvement in the labor market. The 3.53 million workers who continued to collect benefits in the week ended Dec. 29 was the lowest number since 3.50 million in the final week of September. The insured unemployment rate dropped to 2.7 percent, also a three-month low, from 2.9 percent. Those figures were lower than the weekly numbers.
The four-week moving average of jobless claims, a less volatile indicator, fell to 410,500. It has been shifting downward after reaching a peak of 505,800 in mid-October.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
The Irradiation of Mail Can Also Zap the Contents

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Attempts by the United States Postal Service to make mail safer by zapping it with radiation have hit a snag: the process tends to destroy computer chips and to damage other delicate items including food, pharmaceuticals, clothing, contact lenses -- and even the paper mail itself.
 "The irradiation process, as I understand it, generates heat, and that's the killer," said Bob Anderson, a spokesman for the Postal Service, in response to questions about the problem. 
 That, of course, was the original idea: killing anthrax spores like the ones that were mailed to Congressional offices and to news media companies. In response, the Postal Service began to put mail to federal recipients and to some media companies through sterilizing machines. 
The Postal Service is currently trucking mail to be sanitized to temporary processing centers in Ohio and New Jersey, and has bought eight irradiation machines from the Titan Corporation of La Jolla, Calif., for $5 million each. The machinery exposes the mail to potent beams of electrons -- a technology that, on a less intense level, can be used to sanitize food.
But something powerful enough to destroy hardy anthrax spores plays havoc with less hardy objects. Staff members in federal offices in Washington say that paper mail deteriorates under the treatment and that photographs are ruined: the mail, some of which has been delayed for months because of the anthrax worries, is "much like letters that were set aside and buried under a pile in someone's garage for three years," a Congressional aide said. Some of the mail in New Jersey has caught fire.
This week the CompactFlash Association, which represents makers of memory cards used in digital cameras, personal computers and portable music players, warned that the beams "will not only cause loss of data stored on the cards, but the cards will no longer be operable."
A spokesman for the association, Bill Frank, said other chips are also affected. "We've done some tests and this destroys the stuff," he said.
Bill Calder, a spokesman for the chip maker Intel, confirmed that many kinds of chips were at risk. "They're not wrong to say semiconductors could potentially be damaged," he said.
That is not much of a problem right now, said Mr. Anderson of the Postal Service, because the scope of the federal mail-sanitizing program is currently limited to federal offices and some media companies. "It's really a nonissue, because Aunt Millie is not going to get her mail irradiated," he said, adding that the attacks were focused and so "our response is targeted" as well.
Mr. Anderson said the Postal Service had called together a working group from affected industries -- including shippers of high-technology goods, drugs, clothing and food -- to test products and try to establish procedures for identifying mail that can be damaged by the beams, and to help those companies avoid the process.
"We don't want to fry the mail," Mr. Anderson said. "That doesn't serve our customers." He said that the goal of the Postal Service was to deliver the mail "as safely and as economically as possible."
A spokesman for Titan, Wil Williams, said the company had made the destructive potential of its technology clear to the Postal Service. The mass mailing and catalog companies, he said, already use presorting procedures that generally keep their mail from going through the sterilizing system. 
Paper tested by his company was not damaged, Mr. Williams said, but he added that the intense effort to sanitize so much mail could lead to varying results. "Every new process that we're doing that comes along, you have to take the nicks out of it and make it efficient," he said.
Ultimately, the problems with mail-sanitizing technology may be diminishing in importance because of another mail technology, said David Carle, a spokesman for Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. "Senator Leahy and his staff," he said, "noticed that a threshold was crossed in April of last year, when for the first time e-mail surpassed postal mail in volume. That process has been accelerated since the anthrax problem."

HEADLINE: Studies Will Take Sept. 11's Measure In Health Effects 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Public health researchers in New York, struggling to determine the real dimensions of the health threat at the World Trade Center site, are beginning an ambitious series of long-term studies to identify and then track a wide range of people who lived through the nightmare of dust, smoke and stress when the towers fell. 
 Two Manhattan hospitals, for instance, are collecting blood samples from pregnant women who say they were in the vicinity of the trade center on the morning of Sept. 11 or in the days afterward. Mount Sinai School of Medicine will send out 3,000 letters to obstetricians in the region as early as next week, also seeking pregnant women who were near ground zero for a related study that will look at the possible effects of maternal anxiety as well as toxic substances in the air. 
 Beginning next Monday, physicians and investigators from Queens College will start searching for nonunion day laborers, many of them now dispersed into the work force, who helped clean up dust-saturated buildings around the trade center in the weeks just after the attacks. The New York Academy of Medicine is beginning an even more ambitious task: building a registry of every person -- from the firefighters to members of the New York City Transit tunnel crews -- who worked, even for a day, at ground zero. 
The researchers say that while these studies are, in certain respects, the sort of work that invariably follows major disasters and accidents, they also say that the variety of the inquiries reflects a disturbing but ever-growing realization among health experts: four months after the attacks, very little can be said with scientific certainty about the health risks that recovery workers or bystanders faced in the disaster and the cleanup. 
That uncertainty, which some health and environmental experts now say was perhaps not adequately reflected by public officials in the days and weeks after the attacks, underscores how unique the World Trade Center disaster was as a public health emergency.
The blast of dust and smoke -- and the toxic substances, fibers and ash that blew through New York in the days afterward -- is without precedent in medical literature, which means that there are no studies to fall back on for guidance on whether to be alarmed or reassured.
The air-monitoring system that was set up after the attacks -- indeed, the whole science of air monitoring -- is based chiefly on long-term exposures associated with ordinary air pollution or workplace hazards. This means that the effects of short, intense bursts of pollution -- the sort experienced by many thousands of people on Sept. 11 -- are far less known. 
"There are gaps in our knowledge base," said Dr. Frederica P. Perera, a professor of public health at Columbia, who is leading one of the prenatal projects. 
Professor Perera said that based on the evidence already reported, she does not expect to find widespread health consequences in her prenatal study. The air-quality measurements for things like asbestos, PCB's and dioxins, taken in the neighborhoods around the World Trade Center, have consistently shown little cause for worry about long-term health.
But as a scientist, she cannot offer any definitive reassurances when an anxious resident or downtown office worker calls. "Because of the uncertainty, and the paucity of the data, it's important to lay to rest the anxieties," she said. "And we'd like to be able to provide reassurance based on data."
Some $10.5 million was made available by the federal government alone this week to finance medical and health studies and worker environmental training related to Sept. 11.
Studies like these are intensely complicated, a difficulty compounded in New York by the demographics of an area where residents, tourists and office workers -- many of them commuters -- are mixed together. No one has any idea how many pregnant women, for example, were downtown on Sept. 11. The Columbia study is seeking 300 of them -- some more exposed to the ash and dust, some less -- while Mount Sinai is hoping for another 300, with some overlap likely between the two.
Cleanup workers, many of them immigrants who do not belong to labor unions, have gone on to other jobs and may be impossible to find. One cleanup company that had 1,800 workers two weeks after the attacks now has 50, according to Dr. Steven Markowitz, director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems, an environmental and occupational health research institute at Queens College, which is leading the search for those workers.
Dr. Markowitz said his mobile examination vehicle, to be parked near City Hall, will have a physician, a breathing-test technician and an interviewer, all of them fluent in Spanish, the language spoken by most of the cleanup crews. He said that part of his motivation in starting the study is the issue of economic disadvantage.
"These guys are about the least likely group to get any medical attention," he said. "They either don't have access to health care, or will go to a neighborhood doctor who doesn't have a clue about toxins." 
Even defining what "exposed" means has required rigorous new methodology. The Mount Sinai study, for example, has identified three zones around ground zero, each of which -- based on existing air monitoring -- will figure in the analysis.
Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia are working on pinpointing where the smoke plume went in the days immediately after the attack. In this way, a zone of exposure in, say, Brooklyn Heights, which was downwind just after the attacks, might be better compared to one in TriBeCa in Manhattan.
Other approaches are more fine-tuned. The Mount Sinai study is focusing on women who were in Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11 itself, and within that group is only really seeking women who were south of Chambers Street, a few blocks from the trade center. The Columbia study, by contrast, is seeking women who were downtown on the day of the attacks or in the days afterward, but it draws a line three miles around ground zero, beyond which a woman is considered "unexposed."
Some of the researchers say that the accumulated work, when it is complete, will also provide a demographic, sociological bonus: the first full human portrait of New York on the morning it was transformed -- who was where, what they saw and felt, what they breathed.
For at least the prenatal studies, there is the loud ticking of the biological clock. The women being sought must have been pregnant on Sept. 11, which leaves only five months more or so for them to be found.
"This is not going to be easy," said Gertrud S. Berkowitz, a professor in the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

Ad Pages Decline At Steepest Rate

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
Advertising pages in magazines last year fell by the largest percentage since 1977, the year comparable records were first kept, according to an annual count by the Publishers Information Bureau in New York.
 For 2001, ad pages totaled 237,613, down 11.7 percent from 269,016 in 2000. 
The previous largest decline for ad pages was a 10.9 percent decrease in 1991, the last recession year before 2001, compared with 1990. 
 The drop in 2001 was fed by a percentage decline in December that was the largest for any month of the year. Ad pages for December totaled 19,030, down 19.4 percent from 23,620 in December 2000.
The magazines that experienced significant decreases in ad pages, according to the bureau, included Rx Remedy, down 73.8 percent; Red Herring, down 64.5 percent; and Fast Company, down 53.6 percent. The magazine that carried the most ad pages in 2001 was Fortune, at 4,012; by comparison, the magazine that carried the most ad pages in 2000, The Industry Standard, which is defunct, carried 7,440 ad pages.

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Gov. Gray Davis released a budget proposal that would cut $2.7 billion from the state's budget of roughly $100 billion this year, then would rely on borrowing from future tobacco settlement money and other financial shifts to see the state through tough times. 
The $100 billion budget does not call for a tax increase but includes deep cuts to some programs while sparing others like education, health care and public safety. Revenues have steadily declined because the Sept. 11 attacks worsened an already sagging economy.

HEADLINE: The Greater Danger 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: PANMUNJOM, North Korea 

 BODY:
If you think Iraq is scary, come here to the bleak and snowy border between the two Koreas and look north.
 True, North Korea may have the skinniest and coldest soldiers in the world, but it is not only the wackiest country around (a few years ago, it appointed its dead dictator as its perpetual president) but also potentially the most threatening. North Korea has the globe's third-largest army, 5,000 tons of sarin nerve gas and (the spooks believe) a secret reserve of the smallpox virus. 
 Its "dear leader," Kim Jong Il, planned and oversaw kidnappings of foreigners and a 1987 airplane bombing that killed 115 people. North Korea finances its budget partly by peddling drugs, selling weapons to terrorists in places like the Philippines, and counterfeiting American $100 bills. The nightmare scenario would be North Korea raising cash by selling a vial of smallpox to Al Qaeda. 
That is why perhaps the most interesting question today in foreign policy is not what we do about Iraq, but what we do about North Korea. 
There is a gulf between present American policy toward North Korea (to the extent we have one) and the policy favored by most people who know something about the Koreas, who mostly believe that we should try harder to woo it out of its isolation.
I confess that I got this North Korea dateline only by stepping 10 feet into the country at the DMZ village of Panmunjom. I reported from North Korea once many years ago and was promptly banned for life (they never said whose life, though, so there's still hope). In any case, in conversations in Seoul and in the United States, there is some distress among Korea hands at America's missed opportunity with North Korea.
For decades our policy toward the North has been similar to our policy toward Cuba -- with equally unhappy results: propping up a nationalistic dictator by giving him a foreign scapegoat for his own failed economic policies. Just as North Korea takes only micro-steps toward economic reform, so we take micro-steps toward engagement. There is a failure of imagination on both sides.
These days there are even some voices inside the Bush administration urging that as a second stage of the antiterror campaign it lean harder on North Korea. The hawks are absolutely right that North Korea is a threat, but wrong in assuming that the solution is more pressure. The United States tried confrontation in 1994, in a dispute over North Korea's nuclear program, and came much closer than is generally realized to a war that, according to one Pentagon estimate, could have killed one million people, including 80,000 to 100,000 Americans. 
To muddy the picture, the Bush administration's hard-liners need the threat of North Korean missiles to sell their beloved missile shield. So they have less incentive to engage North Korea and seek a negotiated end to its missile program. 
In dealing with North Korea, we can learn something from the South Korean president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Kim Dae Jung. President Kim has a tough and clear-eyed view of Communists (who almost killed him during the Korean War), but he has also pioneered a "sunshine policy" offering incentives to coax the "dear leader" into more responsible behavior.
Yet President Bush, apparently without meaning to, crippled President Kim last year. During Mr. Kim's visit to the White House, Mr. Bush came across as publicly skeptical of engagement in a way that was humiliating for Mr. Kim and cut his legs off politically. Ever since then, the sunshine policy has been largely dead and Mr. Kim has been a lame duck, even though Mr. Bush has since endorsed it and praised Mr. Kim to the heavens. 
North Korea would be a useful second stage for America's antiterrorism campaign, if our approach was not confrontation but a sunshine policy of our own. The timing may be right, for North Korea -- while still menacing -- is showing signs that it may be outgrowing terrorism (the last incident was 1987) and trying to open up very gradually. Last year it normalized relations with 12 countries, mostly in Europe. Cellphones and the Internet are arriving soon in Pyongyang. It is a wretched country at a potential turning point, just as China was at the time of the Nixon visit in 1972.
It's again time for a Republican president to tackle a threatening Communist power by agreeing to do business with it.

HEADLINE: Teachers' Union to Move Downtown, a Shift Mayor Says 'Can't Hurt' Contract 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
The president of the union representing New York City teachers said yesterday that the union would spend up to $75 million to move into two buildings near ground zero because it was desperate for more space and wanted to bolster the suffering downtown economy.
 But the question was in the air: is Randi Weingarten, the union president, also trying to curry favor with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg at a time when her members are desperate for a new contract and pay raise? Mr. Bloomberg, who attended Ms. Weingarten's news conference announcing the move, lightly suggested that it indeed might accelerate a deal. 
 "It's closer to City Hall," he said of the union's new headquarters, at 50 and 52 Broadway, near Exchange Place. "I don't know if that makes it easier to negotiate a contract, but it can't hurt."
Mr. Bloomberg stood beaming beside Ms. Weingarten as she announced the union's plans to leave its longtime headquarters on Park Avenue South and move into the downtown buildings starting early next year. He lavished praise on Ms. Weingarten and the union, the United Federation of Teachers, for moving to Lower Manhattan at a time when the neighborhood needs an economic shot in the arm.
"I think the whole city owes the U.F.T. and their members a thank you," Mr. Bloomberg said. "It is to the U.F.T.'s credit that they are willing to do this."
Ms. Weingarten, who frequently and bitterly accused Rudolph W. Giuliani of disrespecting teachers when he was mayor, said, "Our current mayor has inspired a tremendous amount of confidence that he will be able to lead this city ably, intelligently and in a caring manner."
Ms. Weingarten said the move was necessary because the current headquarters had become too cramped and outmoded in recent years as the union's membership sharply increased. In the last decade, the number of city teachers has grown to 80,000, from 65,000. About 8,000 were hired last fall to fill vacancies created by attrition and retirements.
She said the union would lease 52 Broadway and buy 50 Broadway, for a combined cost of $65 million to $75 million in the first year. She predicted that the sale of the union's longtime headquarters at 260 Park Avenue South and its two other buildings, at 48 and 49 East 21st Street, would cover the cost of the new buildings.
She said that in particular, the union needed more space for the training sessions and continuing education classes it offers its members daily. The classes are popular because they provide teachers with credits that make them eligible for pay increases. Ms. Weingarten said the new space would include at least 14 classrooms, compared with 12 smaller ones at the old headquarters, and a 1,000-seat auditorium.
"We've had to shut people out of classes this year because we just didn't have the space," she said.
The union plans to begin moving into its new space early next year, Ms. Weingarten said. It will occupy all 19 floors of 52 Broadway, but it will rent out most of the 37 floors of 50 Broadway to tenants, some of whom already have long-term leases there. She said it was possible that the union would make a profit. 
Ms. Weingarten said that the union began looking for space in Lower Manhattan last year, but that its initial plan, to lease 25 Broadway, fell through. The cost of downtown real estate has dropped since the World Trade Center attack, but she would not say whether the union got the two buildings at a reduced price. 
She said the city was not involved in the negotiations, but added that the union expected to receive "whatever incentive package" is given to those who move downtown after the attack.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Party Battles Looming Over Costly Old Issue: Health Care Coverage

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
As Congress and the Bush administration return to the domestic agenda, almost no issue will be harder, more expensive or more divisive to deal with than health care. But in an election year marked by a recession and rising health care costs, the issue will be very hard to ignore, political strategists and policy analysts say.
 Federal officials confirmed this week that health care costs are climbing faster than they have in years, creating new strains on employers, individuals and government programs that cover the elderly and the poor. 
 The elderly are under particular pressure from the rising cost of prescription drugs, which are not covered by Medicare. The number of uninsured, just under 40 million a year ago, could begin to climb, some health analysts predict, as people lose jobs in the economic downturn and as the cost of coverage rises for employers and workers. 
Governors in both parties, their budgets already squeezed by these trends, are pleading with the federal government to raise its contribution to the Medicaid program for the poor, which is jointly financed.
All of this sets the stage for the health care debate, which will be joined when President Bush releases his budget next month. His allies say the budget will demonstrate his commitment to the needs of older Americans and the uninsured, which they add will be part of his return to "compassionate conservatism" after an agenda driven by war. 
His critics assert he has already shortchanged these domestic needs with his huge tax cut.
Some health analysts wonder where the president will find the money for major expansions in health benefits, given their immense costs, the return of the budget deficit, at least in the short term, and the array of other demands related to national security.
"They're going to want to address these issues because it's right and because of political reasons," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. "But the problem is coming up with the money to do something meaningful. The two big problems -- prescription drugs and the uninsured -- are big ticket items, and the surplus is gone."
This is not, as yet, a health care crisis on the scale of the early 1990's, in the last Bush presidency, many experts say. Nor does it loom that large in the public's mind.
"Back at the end of the 80's and the early part of the 90's, health care costs were rising at near double-digit rates, the number of uninsured was rising, the economy was weakening, and then it didn't really snap out of the recession with much vigor," said Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and an authority on health economics. "In the current situation, we are experiencing an increase in health care costs, but it hasn't gone on that long."
Still, the proportion of people who believe that "radical change" is needed in the health care system has risen, said the Republican pollster Bill McInturff. Moreover, the anxiety of many middle-class voters over the security of their health insurance -- the critical ingredient for the uninsured to become a front-burner issue -- could jump if the economic downturn persists.
For Mr. Bush, these issues must seem very familiar, having watched his father's struggles when the nation suddenly focused on domestic problems -- particularly the economy and health care -- in the fall of 1991. Unable to show the leadership at home that he had shown abroad, the senior Mr. Bush saw his towering approval ratings from the Persian Gulf war quickly crumple. 
"His father was not very good at making that transition," said a House Republican strategist. "Bush has to do better, and that means credibility on health care and education."
Not surprisingly, administration officials insist that Mr. Bush will embrace, in his budget, a series of credible health care proposals not unlike what he offered last year -- tax credits to help the uninsured buy coverage, particularly people recently laid off, and a new prescription drug proposal for the elderly, tied to an overhaul of Medicare. 
"You'll find us pushing forward pretty aggressively," said Thomas A. Scully, who administers Medicare and Medicaid, although he added that no final budget decisions have been made.
Mark McClellan, a senior White House health care adviser and member of the Council of Economic Advisers, said: "The president's definitely been interested in rising costs. His direction to us has been, if anything, to redouble our efforts to find approaches to keeping coverage affordable." 
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, on "Meet the Press" on Sunday, took pains to highlight the administration's commitment to using tax credits to help the unemployed buy insurance.
That is certainly the hope among many Congressional Republicans, who often face a gender gap with voters who are women, a group that is particularly interested in health care. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of Long Island, said that he thought that Mr. Bush "wants to find a way to let the public know that Republicans do support health care, we do want to provide assistance, and we're not just going to go grudgingly along at the last minute with minimal amounts."
Still, as one administration official put it, "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the box we're in financially." A serious prescription drug benefit would cost hundreds of billions, many analysts say, noting that Democratic senators struggled and failed last year to produce an attractive package with $300 billion over 10 years. Democrats have already begun to warn that Mr. Bush will rely on cheaper, incremental approaches -- like his idea for a drug discount card -- to avoid spending the money a real drug benefit would cost.
All of this means that the health care numbers in Mr. Bush's budget will carry great political weight -- and become a powerful symbol in the debate over whether the Republicans went too far with their tax cuts.
William Novelli, the new executive director of AARP, said his organization planned a major "voter education" campaign this year grading each proposal for prescription drugs, beginning with Mr. Bush's. "What we're asking for is at least as much money as Congress proposed last year -- $300 billion," Mr. Novelli said. Mr. Bush proposed $153 billion over 10 years for prescription drug benefits and Medicare restructuring last year, which was widely denounced as insufficient.
The political anxiety among Congressional Republicans is especially high on the drug issue, given the power of older voters in a midterm election because of their higher turnout rate. "All off-year elections in the past 25 years have been about three things -- presidential approval ratings, the status of the economy and issues of concern to seniors," Mr. McInturff said.
Moreover, Democrats see prescription drugs and other health issues as an important part of the "economic indictment" against the Republicans, an example of what the country is struggling to afford because of the Republicans' tax cuts. "Repealing the alternative minimum tax isn't going to help families pay their health care bills," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "The Republicans have an economic plan that's irrelevant to the reality millions of Americans face."
Robert Blendon, an expert at Harvard on public opinion and health, predicts that the health care issue will loom large in this election year, but will be far more narrowly focused than it was in the 1992 election -- for example, prescription drug coverage and help for the laid-off uninsured -- not a wholesale restructuring of the health care system to create universal coverage. Part of the reason, Mr. Blendon said, was a lingering hangover from the last attempt to overhaul the system -- the Clinton health care plan.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Dole Crisscrossing N. Carolina In Senate Bid 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ROBBINSVILLE, N.C., Jan. 9 

 BODY:
It is a long way from the grandeur of presidential politics to the grand opening of the Microtel Inn and Suites in Robbinsville, N.C., population 747. But that is where Elizabeth Dole, now a candidate for the United States Senate in North Carolina, found herself this week. 
 It was the 40th stop on her planned tour of North Carolina's 100 counties, a pilgrimage intended to help Mrs. Dole reacquaint herself with the people and concerns of a state where she has not lived for four decades. There was no speaking role for Mrs. Dole at the motel in this snowy Appalachian hollow. But she was repeatedly recognized by town leaders and she made use of her trademark Southern charm. 
 At most such events around the state, Mrs. Dole, 65, has been received like the celebrity she is, attracting outsized crowds in tiny towns, like the 50 folks who filled nearly every seat in the back room during a luncheon at Phillips Restaurant here. It helps that Mrs. Dole, who leads in all early polls, has established herself as the solid front-runner in the race to succeed Senator Jesse Helms, who is retiring next year after five terms.
Mrs. Dole, former presidential candidate, two-time cabinet secretary and president of the American Red Cross, had planned to kick off her campaign in her hometown, Salisbury, on Sept. 11, but the events of that morning caused her to cancel. Instead, she began campaigning quietly in the late fall, focusing primarily on fund-raising and organizing. In November, her leading Republican opponent, the former Charlotte mayor Richard Vinroot, dropped out of the race, saying he was too realistic to try to overcome Mrs. Dole's fund-raising advantage.
She has the Republican field virtually to herself and can spend the first half of this year stockpiling money for the general election and overcoming concerns about her residency. Her remaining Republican opponents are three doctors -- Venkat Challa of Winston-Salem, Ada Fisher of Salisbury and Jim Parker of Lumberton -- and a lawyer, Jim Snyder of Lexington. None are expected to pose much of a challenge, though Mr. Snyder has the personal financial means to mount an aggressive campaign and has already broadcast advertising.
Among Democrats, Erskine B. Bowles, a former Clinton chief of staff, is raising money for his race against Elaine F. Marshall, the secretary of state, and Daniel T. Blue Jr., a state representative.
Mrs. Dole said in an interview that the war on terrorism was still driving the agenda in the race and that defense preparedness and rising unemployment had emerged as the primary issues. 
"You still need to be sensitive to the tone in this country," she said. "Most people are still very much focused on the war against terrorism, and you don't see other issues getting traction right now."
Mrs. Dole's 25-minute stump speech, characteristically delivered while strolling the room, is largely cotton candy. She joked about riding a motorcycle with Jay Leno, paid tribute to the military, expressed hope that Sept. 11 terrorist attacks would generate "a spiritual renewal in America" and emphasized the importance of local control over education.
"I'm glad to see that there will be an education bill that the president will sign soon," she said, apparently not realizing that he had done so on Tuesday. 
Mr. Snyder has attacked Mrs. Dole on perceived shifts in her position on gun control, a critical issue to conservatives. While campaigning for president in 1999, Mrs. Dole opposed laws allowing people to carry concealed weapons and supported legislation to ban assault weapons.
Now facing a more conservative electorate, she wrote to the North Carolina Rifle and Pistol Association pledging to "oppose restrictions on the ownership of firearms that penalize the law-abiding citizen." In the interview, she described herself as "a strong supporter of the Second Amendment," and said the assault weapons ban appeared to have had little effect on crime and should not be extended or expanded until studied further.
She also said she would have "no trouble supporting" North Carolina's concealed weapons law, which requires passing a gun safety test before being allowed to carry a concealed weapon and restricts where guns can be carried.
Mr. Snyder said Mrs. Dole's shifts on gun control raised questions about whether she was a suitable successor to Mr. Helms, one of the Senate's conservative stalwarts. 
The same, he said, is true of her past stands on abortion, which she opposes in most instances but has called a divisive and largely irrelevant topic of debate.
"The folks out there are concerned about the trust issue," Mr. Snyder said. "The Second Amendment and abortion are sacrosanct issues to conservatives, and they just don't waver on those."
But Steve Odom, a Republican who is sheriff here in Graham County, said he was satisfied with Mrs. Dole's positioning.
"I don't know that the Republican Party could ever find someone to replace Jesse Helms," Mr. Odom said, "but Elizabeth is conservative enough for me."
To help address the issue of her residency, Mrs. Dole has taken title to the two-story Tudor-style house in Salisbury where she grew up and where her 100-year-old mother still lives. Her campaign paid to send 26,000 Christmas cards from Mrs. Dole and her husband, former Senator Bob Dole, that depict the house and offer greetings "from our home to yours." The couple's primary residence is the Watergate complex in Washington. 
In her appearance here, Mrs. Dole received an assist from Chester W. Crisp, the Graham County Republican chairman, who introduced her at the restaurant.
"Of course, they tried to pack her off as another Hillary," Mr. Crisp said, referring to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who won her Senate seat in New York without having lived there previously. "But she's not. She's a native North Carolinian, so she's our own flesh and blood."

Channeling Ghosts of Presidents Past, Rutherford B. Hayes Included

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

 BODY:
President Bush passed a milestone of sorts recently when he disclosed that over the holidays he had been reading "Theodore Rex," the new best-selling biography of Theodore Roosevelt by Edmund Morris. Mr. Bush was evidently given the book by his political adviser, Karl Rove, who is something of a history buff, especially of the emergence of the modern Republican Party at the turn of the last century.
 Mr. Rove has brought several historians to the White House to meet with presidential aides and, on occasion, with Mr. Bush. The idea, Mr. Rove told Richard Berke of The Times, is to help the president and his staff step back and learn how others have dealt with similar situations. 
 In reaching out to historians, Mr. Bush is writing another chapter in the sometimes awkward annals of presidents and intellectuals. Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt's "brain trust," presidents seem to have enjoyed being tutored by professors and experts, although there have been some famous fiascoes in the process.
President Jimmy Carter went off on a retreat to Camp David at the height of the economic and energy crises of 1978 to hear advice from a parade of political leaders and thinkers. Christopher Lasch, author of "The Culture of Narcissism," helped persuade the president that he was facing not just an energy crisis but a crisis of the spirit left over from Vietnam and Watergate. 
The result was a famous presidential speech known for its discussion of a national "malaise." Mr. Carter never actually used that word, but to many observers the speech seemed to symbolize Mr. Carter's skills at analyzing a problem rather than solving it.
In 1965, as the Vietnam War was heating up, President Lyndon Johnson's house intellectual, the historian Eric Goldman, organized a White House arts festival for writers and artists. One aim was to try to repair the damage being done as campuses across the country plunged into protests and teach-ins over the war.
At first Johnson was supportive, but then the poet Robert Lowell issued a tortured statement saying he could not attend for reasons of conscience. Soon others like the artists Larry Rivers and Mark Rothko and the writer John Hersey either declined to appear or demanded to read statements protesting the war. Many leading intellectuals began issuing statements declaring that although they had not been invited, they would not attend if they had been.
When the festival got under way, the president made only a perfunctory appearance with his guests. "Some of them insult me by staying away and some of them insult me by coming," he bellowed. "Don't they know I'm the only president they've got and a war is on?" Mr. Goldman soon resigned from his White House post and returned to Princeton a disillusioned man.
Mr. Bush may not have such troubles. The list of historians compiled by Mr. Rove tends to have a conservative bent. Edmund Morris, for instance, paints a portrait of Roosevelt that many critics note has left out or slighted that president's most progressive and liberal programs.
"What Morris approves of is Roosevelt's conservative and wealthy friends," said John Morton Blum, a professor emeritus of history at Yale, where he taught a course taken by Mr. Bush in the 1960's. "He minimizes Roosevelt's instincts for reform."
For instance, Professor Blum said, the Morris biography gives scant attention to the establishment of pure food and drug laws, railroad regulation and Roosevelt's advocacy of the inheritance tax and income tax. On an issue that has been at the center of the Bush agenda, Roosevelt's statement that the very rich have a "peculiar obligation" to pay taxes at higher rates than others is not even in the book.
Most modern presidents sooner or later become fascinated with Theodore Roosevelt, in part because he created the modern presidency. He was a favorite of such disparate presidents as Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon. But Nixon was less a hero-worshiper than a diligent student. His "house intellectual," former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then a domestic policy adviser, recalled: "One day I got a note from him asking for a list of ten books he should read. So I made up a list. I hadn't read some of them myself, but he read them all."
The man Nixon wound up focusing on, Mr. Moynihan said, was not T.R. but the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. After reading "Disraeli," by Robert Blake, Nixon declared, "It is Tory men with liberal principles who have changed history." The book may have turned out to be one of the more influential works ever read by a modern president. Americans tend to forget that on the environment, welfare and many other domestic policies, Nixon expanded the role of government.
A few recent presidents have dared to wander off the well-trod path from Washington to Lincoln to the two Roosevelts. The defeat of Bill Bradley deprived us of a chance to put a James Polk fan in the White House. But Ronald Reagan was a well-known admirer of Calvin Coolidge, and President Clinton's interests ran all the way down to Rutherford B. Hayes and Ulysses S. Grant, who Mr. Clinton felt was underrated.
Bill Clinton was a great student of the presidency, and he loved talking to historians. Mr. Clinton's fondness for them was reciprocated. Two prominent writers of history, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Sean Wilentz, organized a petition of 400 historians opposing the 1998 impeachment.
President John F. Kennedy also had a "brain trust" at the White House of academics like Mr. Schlesinger and McGeorge Bundy, but there is some doubt whether he spent as much time with the books as he did with the writers. "Kennedy took books away with him, but I don't think he read anything," said Mr. Moynihan.

HEADLINE: As Historian's Fame Grows, So Do Questions on Methods 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
For most of his career, the historian Stephen E. Ambrose was best known for his exhaustive multivolume biographies of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon. He was respected in his field but seldom read by the general public until 1994, when he published "D-Day," a sentimental tale about rank-and-file soldiers.
 "D-Day" became a best seller and changed Mr. Ambrose's life. To manage his soaring income, Mr. Ambrose incorporated into what is now called Ambrose & Ambrose Inc., based in Helena, Mont. He began to keep his five grown children busy as research assistants and published best sellers roughly every two years. With his family's help, he became the most prolific, the most commercially successful and the most academically accomplished of a new group of blockbuster historians. 
 Lately, however, some historians have begun to wonder about the toll of his prodigious pace. On Saturday, he acknowledged that his current best seller, "The Wild Blue," inappropriately borrowed the words and phrases of three passages from a book by the historian Thomas Childers, "The Wings of Morning." A closer examination of "The Wild Blue" by The New York Times indicates that in at least five other places Mr. Ambrose borrowed words, phrases and passages from other historians' books. Mr. Ambrose again acknowledged his errors and promised to correct them in later editions. 
But even while conceding mistakes, Mr. Ambrose also defended his overall methods. He noted that in each case he included a footnote to the works he used, and he sometimes praised the books in his text.
"I tell stories," Mr. Ambrose said. "I don't discuss my documents. I discuss the story. It almost gets to the point where, how much is the reader going to take? I am not writing a Ph.D. dissertation."
"I wish I had put the quotation marks in, but I didn't," Mr. Ambrose said. "I am not out there stealing other people's writings. If I am writing up a passage and it is a story I went to tell and this story fits and a part of it is from other people's writing, I just type it up that way and put it in a footnote. I just want to know where the hell it came from."
In general, professional historians consider it a failing to rely so closely on a single work by another historian for whole passages in any event, even when attributed. More important, Mr. Ambrose should have marked direct quotations in the text, or at the very least noted the closeness of his paraphrase in his footnotes, historians say. College students caught employing the same practices would be in trouble.
Mr. Ambrose initially defied his critics to find other borrowed sentences without quotation marks in his 30 books, before he was shown the passages from two readily available previous works that he used in "The Wild Blue." He acknowledged using sentences verbatim and in at least five cases closely echoed the language and structure of longer passages from both the Army's official seven-volume study, "The Army Air Forces in World War II" by Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate (University of Chicago, 1949), and "The Rise of American Air Power" by Michael S. Sherry (Yale University Press, 1987).
Although Mr. Ambrose, 66, said that his integrity had never wavered, he acknowledged that his methods changed over time, as he turned to more popular subjects and relied more on his children.
When Mr. Ambrose earned his doctorate at the University of Wisconsin in 1960, he said, his ambition was to emulate traditional historians. His first book, "Halleck: Lincoln's Chief of Staff," was dense with footnotes and scholarly minutiae and read by almost no one. But one of its admirers was Eisenhower, who in 1964 tapped Ambrose, then 28, to write his biography.
Mr. Ambrose deliberately overcame his own admiration for Eisenhower to write a nuanced two-volume biography including Eisenhower's failures. His three-volume biography of Nixon underscored the former president's virtues.
"With Nixon and Eisenhower I was just wedded to the documents," Mr. Ambrose said. "It was a total marriage."
Mr. Ambrose's scholarship helped him win tenure at the University of New Orleans and in 1983 to secure funding for its Eisenhower Center, where he worked with a team of researchers to collect the recollections of more than 2,000 veterans. 
Mr. Ambrose's interest had turned to stories of triumphant heroes with few moral or historical ambiguities, like those profiled in "Band of Brothers," published in 1993.
After the success of "D-Day" a year later, his editors at Simon & Schuster began to look forward more eagerly to each next book.
"We welcome the fact that he is prolific," said David Rosenthal, publisher of Simon & Schuster, "He works at a schedule that he sets, and we encourage the amount of his output because there is a readership that wants it."
For his part, though, Mr. Ambrose said he never felt pushed. His editor, Alice Mayhew, had even advised him to slow down, telling him, "I don't want people to think of you as somebody just pumping out cookies," as he recalled last week. 
Mr. Ambrose said computers, and especially spell-checking programs, had helped him increase his pace. He said he relied on chronological storytelling to build readers' suspense, which helped him organize his books.
His advances for each new book swelled to more than $1 million apiece, and his income, including film rights, grew to over $3 million a year, according to The Wall Street Journal.
To keep up the pace, he also increasingly enlisted his son and agent, Hugh Ambrose, 35, as a collaborator, with additional research from his four other children.
"My son Hugh is my partner," Mr. Ambrose said last week. "He is just a wonderful researcher. I don't know where he finds these guys" -- veterans and sources -- "then he gets on the phone with them for three or four hours, and that stuff is gold to me." Mr. Ambrose said his son's name would appear on the cover of his next book.
But Mr. Ambrose said he used no other research assistants, and took sole responsibility for any instances of copying. "Hugh gave me the Childers's books and said, read this, and I did," he said. 
In light of the recent revelation, Mr. Rosenthal defended Mr. Ambrose, saying his errors did not amount to plagiarism.
"There is no effort to deceive," he said. "I think again that the material has been appropriately footnoted, and if there have been omissions it appears to be in the methods of citing as opposed to the citation itself. If there have been sins of omission, we will act to rectify them."
Professional historians, however, said damage had already been done to Mr. Ambrose's reputation. Others have unearthed more limited but similar examples from his biography of Nixon and his book "Crazy Horse and Custer." Dr. Sherry, a history professor at Northwestern University, was shocked to learn of Mr. Ambrose's use of his work.
"That is a lot of sloppiness, or plagiarism, or some combination of the two," Dr. Sherry said. "Any of us professional historians can occasionally slip into uncomfortably close paraphrase, but very few of us do it as much as he seems to have been doing it in this book. This would be, for me as a teacher, unacceptable in a student, much less in a professional historian. It's sad because he is historian whose work I have often used and admired."
Other historians said the errors were symptomatic of a style of writing popular history that prizes immediacy and fast-paced storytelling over critically interpreting the past. "You can't get a more striking example of lack of critical distance from your sources than simply typing it into your own word processing program," said Patricia Nelson Limerick, a professor of history at the University of Colorado.
Most, however, simply chalked the errors up to the ambitious pace of Mr. Ambrose's late career as a blockbuster author. Eric Foner, a history professor at Columbia University, said, "Nobody can write as many books as he has -- many of them were well-written books -- without the sloppiness that comes with speed and the constant pressure to produce. It is the unfortunate downside of doing too much too fast."
Undaunted, Mr. Ambrose said he and his son are hard at work on his next book. This time, "I am sure going to put quotes around anything that comes out of a secondary work, always," he said.

HEADLINE: Mayor Fills Posts Serving The Poorest 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came into sharper focus yesterday as he announced his choice to lead the city's public hospital system and appointed commissioners to manage the city agencies that care for the homeless, train people for jobs and support cultural institutions.
 Mr. Bloomberg warned that no departments would be exempt from the coming budget cuts, as he named the heads of agencies that care for some of the poorest New Yorkers, like the Department of Homeless Services, the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which treats many uninsured patients, and the Department of Employment, which offers job training to the unemployed. 
 "We don't have the money," he said. "So it's not really a negotiation of whether or not we're going to have to cut back. Everybody understands that we have to cut back. It's a question of me setting priorities." 
There will be many competing needs. 
The Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs 11 hospitals and 85 community clinics and serves one in six New Yorkers, is poised to end the current year with a deficit after five years in the black.
For its next president, Mr. Bloomberg recommended Dr. Benjamin K. Chu, senior associate dean at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The choice of Dr. Chu will need the approval of the corporation's board of directors. Mr. Bloomberg reappointed Richard T. Roberts, a former housing commissioner under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, as chairman of the board yesterday.
Mayor Bloomberg appointed Ester R. Fuchs, a professor of political science at Barnard College and the director of the Center for Urban Research and Policy at Columbia University, as a special adviser for governance and strategic planning. Ms. Fuchs will take a leave from the university to work at City Hall.
Mr. Bloomberg said that city agencies would be under pressure to deliver more with less money.
Linda Gibbs, a deputy commissioner at the Administration for Children's Services, is his choice to lead the city's Department of Homeless Services as the number of homeless people on the city's streets is rising. Mr. Bloomberg chose Kate D. Levin, an assistant professor of English and theater at City College of the City University of New York, to lead the Department of Cultural Affairs, which must try to support cultural institutions that have been struggling to attract audiences and donations since the attack on the World Trade Center.
He also selected Betty B. Wu, a manager at his private company, Bloomberg L.P., to lead the Department of Employment, which is charged with offering job training for the poor and the unemployed at a time when the city is losing jobs rapidly -- 94,700 in October and November.
Salaries for the positions have not yet been made final, said Jennifer Falk, a mayoral spokeswoman.
Mr. Bloomberg, who has put cold water, for now, on former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's hopes to use city money to build new stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets, said that it would also be premature to talk about building a new stadium near the Javits Convention Center on the West Side for the Jets or for a future bid for the Olympics. "It's a question of what you can afford and when you can afford it," he said.
At the same news conference at which he announced the appointments, Mr. Bloomberg revealed that for the second time this week he had found himself talking to a veteran of the conflict over the 1991 riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. On Tuesday, the day after a federal appeals court ordered a new trial for two men convicted of civil rights violations in the fatal stabbing of a Hasidic student, Yankel Rosenbaum, during the riots, Mr. Bloomberg called the victim's brother, Norman, to express his sympathy.
Yesterday, after the emergence of details about a $400,000 settlement between the city and the family of Gavin Cato, 7, whose death in a traffic accident had set off the days of rioting, Mr. Bloomberg called the boy's father, Carmel Cato.
"These are very painful times for them to relive that situation, the terrible tragedy that happened," Mr. Bloomberg said of the conversations, "and our hearts have to go out to them."

HEADLINE: City Girds for Protests at Economic Summit Meeting 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
In the fall, the organizers of an annual summit meeting for the world's economic, political and academic leaders decided to move the conference from its usual site in Switzerland to New York City as a show of solidarity in the aftermath of the terror attacks. Security, the organizers were told by city and police officials of the Giuliani administration, would be little problem for a force accustomed to dealing with large-scale demonstrations.
 City and police officials of the Bloomberg administration have not backed off that pledge. But they acknowledge that the demonstrations expected during the World Economic Forum, to be held at the Waldorf-Astoria from Jan. 31 to Feb. 4, could be unlike any seen before in the city. 
 While demonstrations that have drawn thousands have indeed been little problem for the police in the past, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani told the conference organizers in the fall, the police this time could face protests that are more sophisticated -- and more violent -- than in recent years.
If the chaos that accompanied last year's summit meeting in the quiet, snowcapped mountains of Davos, Switzerland, or the violence that swirled at World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle and Genoa, Italy, and at regional World Economic Forum meetings in Salzburg, Austria, and Melbourne, Australia, are any barometer, city officials will have to be prepared to respond to radicalism of every stripe.
In those places, and at similar events, demonstrators protested an array of issues, from a globalized economy to the impact of businesses' practices on living standards. Some protesters, often drawn from distant places, have clashed with law enforcement officers, in some cases using diversions to allow them to cause disruptions elsewhere, a former city police official said. In some cases, property was damaged, tear gas was sprayed and people were injured or killed.
Even if protests at the New York conference are less chaotic, the demonstrations are likely to test the new administration's ability to keep order. "Based on past economic global economic forums, we know there is a potential for demonstrations," the new police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said yesterday through his chief spokesman, Michael P. O'Looney. "We feel that we are better prepared than any other city to deal with any contingencies."
Many people noted the irony of moving the conference, and the attendant protests, to New York as a show of support for a city that suffered such destruction and heartache. Clearly, Mr. O'Looney said, "in the wake of Sept. 11, New Yorkers are in no mood for any kind of serious disorder."
Mr. Kelly, who is making counterterrorism a priority, has already spoken of the need to deploy many officers for the conference. 
While the commissioner would not offer specifics on how the forum would be policed, other law enforcement officials said the Police Department's response would have to include almost military-style tactics. All of the department's tools and the lessons learned about security since Sept. 11 will have to be put to use, officials said.
"Clearly, the protesters nowadays are much more sophisticated than they were 25 or 30 years ago," said John F. Timoney, the former Philadelphia police commissioner who, in the summer of 2000, dealt with protesters there during the Republican National Convention.
"They do a lot more planning ahead of time and they use a variety of tactics, including using some legitimate protesters as cover," said Mr. Timoney, who was once the first deputy police commissioner in New York. "They did it in Seattle, and they did it to us in Philly. They don't view property damage against corporations as a crime."
As part of his planning for the event, Commissioner Kelly met yesterday with several federal law enforcement officials, including representatives of the State Department and the Secret Service, and with James K. Kallstrom, a former assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who advises the state on terrorism. Part of any comprehensive plan will be to control the flow of traffic and to create a huge frozen zone around the Waldorf-Astoria, which will involve closing portions of Park Avenue and nearby side streets, one official said.
Not coincidentally, the theme of the forum is "Leadership in Fragile Times: A Vision for a Shared Future." Topics like security and assessing vulnerability will be discussed by the attendees, among them 1,000 world business leaders; 250 political leaders, including about 20 heads of state; and 250 academic experts, media representatives, religious leaders, Nobel Prize winners, artists, writers and scientists.
The conference organizers decided in late October to shift the meeting to Manhattan from Switzerland after an agreement with Mr. Giuliani and with Gov. George E. Pataki, said Charles D. McLean, a World Economic Forum spokesman.
The shift was undertaken primarily to show solidarity with New York in the aftermath of the terror attacks, but also to provide an economic boost to the city, whose hotels and restaurants have suffered from a falloff of tourism. The conference was announced the day after the election of Mr. Bloomberg, who supported the decision. His financial information company, Bloomberg L.P., is a member of the World Economic Forum, Mr. McLean said.
Yesterday, Beka Economopoulos, who has been involved in globalization issues and who joined the protests in Seattle and Philadelphia, criticized the decision to hold the conference in a city where, she said, money to finance it could be better spent on aid to victims of terrorism or on recovery and cleanup.
No one can say exactly how many demonstrators will converge on the city. Protesters said they would plan only peaceful demonstrations. Eric Laursen, a member of Another World Is Possible, an umbrella organization for many antiglobalization groups, put the number in the tens of thousands. 
Lori M. Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, the globalization division of the consumer and environmental group founded by Ralph Nader in 1971, said: "There are a lot of people who are passionately upset about the damage status quo globalization is doing to their lives and our world. And we are doing our best to make sure that this message is heard through peaceful and nonviolent protest."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PENSIONS; 
Bush Promises a Look at Employee Risks, but Experts Say Solutions Won't Be Easy

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Reacting to the destruction of the retirement savings of thousands of employees of the Enron Corporation, President Bush said yesterday that the administration would start looking at ways "to make sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings as a result of a bankruptcy."
 But without changes in law and corporate behavior, the White House may have a hard time reaching that goal. 
 Many Enron employees lost their retirement savings because the savings were tied up almost exclusively in company securities. Over half the funds in Enron's 401(k) plans for employees were invested in Enron's own shares. 
That situation is by no means unique, said J. Mark Iwry, a former benefits tax counsel at the Treasury Department. Survey data suggest that more than 30 percent of assets are invested in company stock at those companies that allow their stock to be included in their 401(k) plans. And in companies like Enron, where management has some influence over how employee savings are invested, slightly over half the assets on average are in company stock.
Why, given the seemingly obvious benefits of diversification, would workers still end up putting so many nest eggs in the same basket?
By law, companies must offer several options for 401(k) plans. But unlike traditional pension plans, which cannot put more than 10 percent of their assets in any one company, the rules governing 401(k) plans do not set limits. And many companies give their employees big incentives to buy shares with their 401(k) contributions. Companies often match employee contributions only with stock and impose limits on how soon the shares can be sold.
Secretary of the Treasury Paul H. O'Neill said yesterday that he would consider ways to give American workers, more than 40 million of whom have money in 401(k) plans, more freedom to make investment decisions.
But Brigitte Madrian, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, said holders of 401(k) plans generally show little initiative. Most people stick with the default 401(k) plan set up by their company, even if that plan invests solely in the company's shares. And employees are unlikely to keep close tabs on their retirement savings, despite the possibility of a sudden collapse like Enron's. "Most people aren't in the habit of tracking their 401(k) investments on a daily basis," she said.
The reasons employees buy their own companies' shares may go beyond company rules. People may simply be more confident in their employers than in the rest of the market. James Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy at the American Benefits Council, said that even though Enron employees had opportunities at certain times to diversify their savings, many still chose to invest heavily in the company's stock because of their loyalty to Enron and its past success.
Sometimes, colleagues' confidence is enough. "Some employees felt social pressures to put even their own money into company stock," Ms. Madrian said. Those workers, she said, suffered the most when Enron's value crumbled.
Legislation has intensified such trends, according to Mr. Iwry. He cited tax deductions on dividend payments for shares bought through employee stock ownership plans. Such plans can also offer shares at a discount.
Mr. Iwry warned that measures taken to encourage diversification by employees might discourage companies from making matching contributions. A bill has already been introduced in the House that would limit the portion of a 401(k) plan that may be held in a company's own shares to 10 percent.
"Legislative changes and regulatory changes can improve things," said Eric Lofgren, director of the benefits group at Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm, "but they have to be really careful. It is possible for them to do more harm than good."
Mr. Lofgren said education could encourage diversification. "The risk of lack of diversification," he said, "is certainly something you want to communicate to anyone who has the option of going into one stock."
Mr. Delaplane said he also preferred educational steps by companies over legislation. He said some of the damage from Enron's collapse might have been avoided if its employees had received personal financial advice from independent consultants.
But such advice might not have taken account of the fact that Enron, for what it says were administrative reasons, did not allow employees to sell their stock in the 401(k) plan for a critical period when the stock price was falling. Top executives, by contrast, did not face the same restrictions on the shares they owned outside the 401(k) plan and those they had acquired through stock options.
Though 401(k) plans may receive the bulk of the attention in the Enron case, at least one authority on retirement saving hopes that Mr. Bush will consider the issue more broadly. "The biggest need is to try to expand the coverage of the pension system," said James Poterba, an M.I.T. economics professor. "That typically means trying to find ways to get smaller firms and lower-wage firms to adopt more systematic retirement arrangements."
Mr. Bush also promised to focus attention more broadly on disclosure of financial information.
And Edmund L. Jenkins, chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, said: "It is important that we have transparency of information for investors. It's a natural reaction to a situation such as Enron's for questions to be asked in this area."
But "until we know what happened," Mr. Jenkins added, "it's hard to know what to address."

Enron Chairman Contacted Top Officials About Collapse
The White House disclosed that Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of Enron and one of President Bush's biggest political contributors, called two Cabinet officers last fall, and one of them said Mr. Lay had sought government help with its dire financial condition.
 Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from all matters involving Enron because of campaign contributions he received from it. And later in the day, the entire United States attorney's office in Houston recused itself from the investigation. Page A1. 

The Enron saga presents all the elements of earlier Washington scandals, including carefully phrased denials and accusations of improper influence. A1.

Kmart to Miss Profit Estimates
Squeezed by a poor holiday performance, Kmart said that it was seeking additional financing and reviewing its business plans for the next two fiscal years. In addition, it said its earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31 would fall short of estimates. The company said its December sales, monitored in stores that had been open at least a year, fell 1 percent. Shares of Kmart fell 60 cents, to $4.20. C3.

California Files Suit Against PG&E
The attorney general of California filed a civil suit against PG&E, accusing the company of improperly siphoning billions of dollars in assets from its utility subsidiary. A19.

Argentina Tightens Bank Limits
The Argentine government imposed tighter restrictions on banks, effectively freezing all savings accounts above $3,000 for at least a year. World Business, Section W.

Radiation Damages Some Mail
Attempts by the United States Postal Service to make mail safer by zapping it with radiation have hit a snag. The process tends to destroy computer chips and damage other delicate objects, like food and pharmaceuticals. C2.

Stocks End Session Little Changed
The main stock indexes were mixed in sluggish trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 26.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,067.86. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.41 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,156.55, while the Nasdaq composite index increased 2.35 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,047.24. C6.

Unemployment Claims Decrease
The Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped last week to a level that led economists to suggest that the worst of the recession might be over. State unemployment offices received 395,000 first-time applications, down 56,000 from the previous week. The number of people drawing unemployment benefits fell to a three-month low of 3.53 million in the final week of 2001. C11.

N.A.S.D. Loses Round in Bond Case
Securities regulators have lost the latest round in a legal battle with Morgan Stanley over tactics that its brokers and managers used to sell three bond funds in the early 1990's. But the regulators are not giving up the fight. C2.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW; 
ENRON CONTACTED 2 CABINET OFFICERS BEFORE COLLAPSING

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The White House disclosed today that Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation and one of President Bush's biggest political contributors, telephoned two cabinet officers last fall, and one of them said Mr. Lay had sought government help with its dire financial condition. 
 Both said they declined to offer government aid. 
 In a day of rapid-fire developments, Attorney General John Ashcroft excused himself from all matters involving Enron because of campaign contributions he received from it.
In addition, Enron's auditors said they had destroyed numerous company documents and electronic communications. Page C1. 
The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it had created a nationwide task force to conduct a criminal investigation into the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to Mr. Bush and many top administration officials.
Today, the entire United States Attorney's office in Houston recused itself from the investigation, saying many of its approximately 100 lawyers, including the chief prosecutor, Michael T. Shelby, had family or other relationships with people affected by Enron's filing on Dec. 2 for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law.
The White House moved quickly to contain the damage. The White House spokesman said Mr. Bush was made aware of the phone calls to the cabinet members only this morning during an Oval Office meeting. 
"What you have here is a case where a contributor called up and asked for something but did not get it," said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary.
Yet the two cabinet secretaries who received calls from Mr. Lay described somewhat different conversations. Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans said that Mr. Lay had indicated he would welcome any government help with its bond ratings, while Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said the Enron chairman requested no assistance at all.
Enron officials disputed the White House version of events this evening and said Mr. Lay was not asking for assistance from the Bush administration in calling Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans, Mr. Bush's presidential campaign chairman and chief fund-raiser. Enron officials also said Mr. Lay had called Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to alert him to the company's problems.
Mr. Lay was simply informing the government about the possible bankruptcy filing of the nation's seventh largest company, Enron officials said, as has been the practice of executives of other large companies whose collapse could affect worldwide financial markets.
"He did not ask for anything," said Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman. 
Enron's troubles and its numerous links to the Bush administration threatened to consume the president's time and attention even as he enjoys high approval ratings for his conduct of the war on terrorism. 
As morning newspapers announced the expanding Justice Department investigation today, Mr. Bush summoned reporters to the Oval Office to declare that he had instructed his economic advisers to develop a plan to protect workers' pensions from similar corporate failures. Thousands of Enron employees lost their life savings and much of their retirement accounts when the company's stock became virtually worthless last November.
Enron's auditor, the giant accounting firm Arthur Andersen, then said that it had destroyed a "significant" volume of documents related to Enron. The firm said it was still gathering information about the episode before deciding if it would discipline the employees involved.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating both Enron's collapse and Andersen's conduct, said its inquiry would be expanded to include the destruction of documents, in addition to looking into whether it had created off-the-books private partnerships that disguised the true financial condition of the company.
Almost simultaneously, Attorney General Ashcroft said he was recusing himself from oversight of the criminal investigation of the company's collapse because of his relationship with Enron. Common Cause reported today that a canvass of federal election records showed that Mr. Ashcroft had received a total of $54,499 from the company and Mr. Lay for his 2000 Senate campaign.
Enron, which pioneered deregulation of the nation's power business and grew to be one of the world's largest energy companies before its sudden fall, has long nurtured close ties to Mr. Bush. But in the Oval Office today, the president went to some length to distance himself from Mr. Lay, who he said had been a supporter of Governor Ann Richards of Texas when Mr. Bush defeated her in 1994. 
"And she named him the head of the Governor's Business Council," Mr. Bush said. "And I decided to leave him in place, just for the sake of continuity. And that's when I first got to know Ken and worked with Ken."
Mr. Bush said that he had never discussed the financial problems of Enron with Mr. Lay and that he had last seen him in the spring, at a fund-raising event in Houston. Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Bush had not talked to Mr. Lay since the spring.
It was Mr. Fleischer who first told reporters this morning, almost as an afterthought at a sparsely attended early news briefing, that Mr. Lay had called both Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans last fall to alert them about the company's financial straits.
Officials at the Treasury and Commerce Departments said Mr. Lay had spoken to Mr. O'Neill about Enron's condition on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8 and had spoken to Mr. Evans on Oct. 29. Although Mr. Lay had maintained until late October an optimistic public face about Enron's future, on Oct. 16 the company reported a third-quarter net loss of $618 million. On the same day, Moody's Investors Service announced that Enron's long-term debt obligations were on review.
The dates of the calls and the announcements of the bad financial news about the company are significant. If Mr. Lay had made the calls earlier in October, before the state of the company was widely known, the Bush administration would have been aware of the true condition of Enron while Mr. Lay was promoting a different story on Wall Street.
In an interview on CNBC tonight, Mr. O'Neill said Mr. Lay had not asked for a government bailout or other intervention to save the company.
"He called me to advise me that Enron's problems were mounting and to offer access for our technical people to talk with his technical people about the contracts that they had that were causing them problems," Mr. O'Neill said. "I subsequently asked the undersecretary of the Treasury to speak with the Enron people, which he did, so that we could satisfy ourselves that the Enron affairs were not going to have a negative impact on U.S. capital markets."
Asked whether Mr. Lay asked for government assistance, Mr. O'Neill said "Absolutely not." 
On the same CNBC program, Mr. Evans said Mr. Lay had told him that Moody's Investors Service was likely downgrade its rating of the company's debt. 
Mr. Lay then said that if there was anything Mr. Evans could do to help the company deal with Moody's "we would welcome that." But, Mr. Evans added, Mr. Lay did not ask him specifically to intervene with Moody's.
"I listened to him and listened to their condition and listened to the issues he wanted to raise," Mr. Evans said. "Subsequent to that I talked to Secretary O'Neill and told him I had the call. It was a pretty easy decision to make. I don't think there was anything for us to do. Secretary O'Neill agreed with me there was not so we didn't do anything."
A Commerce Department official said today that in Mr. Lay's call with Mr. Evans, "there was no information discussed that wasn't already in the public domain."
Mr. Fleischer said that Mr. Bush was first told this morning in the Oval Office by Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans that Mr. Lay had made the calls to them and that they had not been willing to intervene to help. The president then told Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans, according to Mr. Fleischer's account, "You did the right thing."
Mr. Fleischer said the president expressed no surprise, regret or annoyance that he had not been informed of the calls from Mr. Lay until more than two months after they occurred.
"Bankruptcies happen in our economy," Mr. Fleischer said. "And it's not uncommon for people who are in the community, business community or in the labor community, to talk to a cabinet secretary to tell them about the financial status of their business and it ends there."
Democrats on Capitol Hill moved immediately to question the White House statements. "It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is his party's senior member on the House Government Reform Committee.
Mr. Fleischer said that he hoped that any Congressional inquiry would be even-handed and that if it became "a one-party witch hunt, I think the Congress is going again to remind the country on why people soured and tired of those types of partisan investigations."
Mr. Lay and Enron executives have given more than $550,000 to Mr. Bush's various campaigns, and Mr. Lay also gave $100,000 to Mr. Bush's inaugural committee. 
But Mr. Lay does not appear to have been a frequent recent visitor to the White House, based on publicly available records. He visited the White House only twice during the first five months of Mr. Bush's presidency, according to Secret Service access control records obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act. The first visit occurred on Feb. 22, 2001, the day Enron officials met with the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force.
The second visit, the records show, was on April 17, the day Mr. Lay and other Enron officials met with Mr. Cheney for about a half-hour. Enron officials freely discussed the meeting last year with reporters, providing a copy of the memorandum on electricity issues the company presented to Mr. Cheney.
One month later, Mr. Cheney's energy policy task force issued its final report. In the section on deregulation of the electricity markets, the report's recommendations resembled much of what Enron had advocated. They also tracked with policies advocated by Mr. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign.
Mr. Cheney, in an interview last year, denied that Enron had improperly influenced the task force's deliberations, saying the task force would "make decisions based on what we think makes sound public policy," not what "Enron thinks."

HEADLINE: What Is America's Place In the World Now? 

BYLINE:  By ALEXANDER STILLE 

 BODY:
Here's a test:
What lessons should America's policymakers take from the complex whirl of events that followed Sept. 11?
 A) The need to fight terrorism requires working with other nations. 
 B) The quick victory in Afghanistan shows that only go-it-alone action gets results.
C) Potential threats in the world's troubled regions call for the United States to become a new kind of imperialist power.
D) The targeting of America proves the dangers of playing the world's policeman.
E) Terrorism is best met with hard, military power.
F) Terrorism is best fought through the "soft power" of economic growth and cultural values like democracy and human rights.
If the choices seem confusing or mutually exclusive, so do the opinions of the experts. Ask the most prominent strategic thinkers around, and they will all agree that pretty much every cherished notion about America's role in the world must be revised -- except, of course, their own.
Clearly, the world has changed. Developments in technology have given small groups of people the kind of destructive power once available only to national governments. Distant problems that could previously be ignored have suddenly popped up in America's backyard. "National security always meant protection against external threats," said John Gaddis, a professor of history at Yale University. "The idea that national security is national, or homeland security, is a revolution in strategic thinking." 
But just where does this revolution lead? 
For some strategic thinkers, it leads to what might be considered an antique and antidemocratic proposal: empire. "A new imperial moment has arrived," the British journalist Sebastian Mallaby writes in a forthcoming article in Foreign Affairs. "The chaos out there in the world is too threatening to ignore, and the existing tools for dealing with chaos have been tried and found wanting."
The logic for a new kind of imperialism, Mr. Mallaby argues is this: the decolonalization of the 1940's and 1950's left a power vacuum in much of the world. The principal mechanisms the world has devised to deal with them -- foreign aid, nongovernmental institutions, the World Bank, the United Nations -- have not succeededin dealing with the most troublesome and difficult cases. "The problem isn't going away," Mr. Mallaby said in a telephone interview. "World population is going to go from six to eight billion. All that growth is going to happen in poor countries. You are going to get more state failures. They do threaten our interests: drugs in Columbia and Afghanistan, the diamond trade in Sierra Leone, with the criminal elements that come from clandestine trade. After Sept. 11, these are not things we can simply ignore." 
While Mr. Mallaby and other neo-imperialists do not foresee a return to the British Raj, they do see a world in which readiness to send troops to distant parts of the world to maintain or re-establish order becomes increasingly common. In some sense, they argue, this has already begun to happen, in Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan. "In Sierra Leone, the local population welcomed the arrival of British troops," he said, as did people in Afghanistan. 
This idea isn't simply a product of recent events. Two years ago, Mr. Gaddis came to similar conclusions in an article in The Atlantic, as did the British historian Niall Ferguson in his recent book, "The Cash Nexus." "Whatever else you can say about empire, it had the advantage of maintaining order and suppressing anarchy," Mr. Gaddis said. "We may need some kind of structure -- we wouldn't call it empire, call it spheres of influence, to deal with these problems."
But other thinkers argue that extending American power is precisely the problem. "We need to come to grips with an ironic possibility: that the very preponderance of American power may now make us not more secure but less secure," Benjamin Schwarz and Christopher Layne wrote not long ago in of The Atlantic. Recent foreign policy -- based on the idea of maintaining the United States as the most powerful nation and de facto policeman of the globe -- is, they wrote, precisely what has made it the target of terrorist attack. 
Therefore, the United States should adopt a minimalist foreign policy, they wrote, using diplomacy and proxies whenever possible, getting involved abroad only as a last resort: "The less America does, and the less others expect it to do, the more other states will do to help themselves."
But to Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, the minimalists are unrealistic. "One of the principal lessons of Sept. 11 is that failed states are not just a humanitarian problem, they are a national security problem," he said. States that have virtually collapsed, he went on, like Sierra Leone, Liberia, Rwanda, Afghanistan and Somalia, are breeding grounds of instability, mass migration and murder as well as terrorism. 
The neo-imperialists also have it wrong, Mr. Walt said. "In the era of great European overseas empires, there was nothing that the people who were subjects could do," he explained. "The people who didn't like the British Empire couldn't come to London and blow up Westminster Abbey. The capacity of the people affected by our actions to inflict pain is much greater. In order to do that, you have to be willing to put your own forces on the ground. You can't just bomb from 15,000 feet. There are going to be limits to this."
Mr. Walt believes the answer is not more imperial control, but more international cooperation. His colleague at the Kennedy School at Harvard, Joseph Nye, said, "The fact that information technology decentralizes power and puts it in the hands of individuals scattered around the world means you are going to need a lot of people who will cooperate with you." Mr. Nye just published a book whose title suggests its main point: "The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Superpower Can't Go It Alone."
Of course, even enthusiastic multilateralists now concede that international entities like the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and nongovernmental health and environmental organizations have all been relegated to the sidelines in recent months. 
"All the most important agreements were made on a state-by-state basis," said Christopher Hill, a lecturer in international affairs at Yale, pointing to assistance offered the United States after Sept. 11 by Britain, Italy, Germany, Russia, Pakistan and other nations. "Pick any problem out there -- AIDS, the environment or terrorism," he added, "if the state isn't effective in its jurisdiction, then the problem isn't going to get solved." 
Such thinking runs counter to what has been the fashion in academic circles. Since the end of the cold war, many people have argued that the nation-state is an outmoded concept inadequate to the borderless world of electronic information and international commerce. "In the 1990's, the forces of globalization and fragmentation were hitting states pretty hard," Mr. Gaddis said, and the emergence of an international terrorist network like Al Qaeda seemed like a textbook example of a powerful stateless entity. "Sept. 11 was an attack on the notion of the state itself."
But the response to the attacks, Mr. Gaddis said, actually reaffirms the value of state power. "It suggests that reports of the death of states have been exaggerated," he said. "The whole reason we have states is protection against anarchy -- 9-11 shows that states are rather good things to have around."
Indeed, for scholars like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, Sept. 11 shows that old-fashioned power politics still operates in this new world. 
Countries must singlemindedly pursue their interests, Mr. Mearsheimer said, no matter what anybody else thinks. And that's just what the Bush administration is doing, he said. 
"We told all those states that were not allied with us, 'You are either with us or against us and if you are against us you will pay a price,' " he said. "That's unilateralism."
Power is the currency of the international system, Mr. Mearsheimer argues, and the United States should use it when it sees fit. To Mr. Nye, that definition of power is too narrow. American influence in the world, he argued, rests as much on culture -- democracy, human rights, feminism, movies, consumerism -- as on military hardware. After all, he said, what the terrorists "really object to is American ideas, American culture." 
Ultimately, the differences between the multilateralists the unilateralists, the neo-imperialists, the minimalists and all the others "ists" may not be as sharp as many make out. People like Mr. Gaddis and Mr. Hill who emphasize traditional power politics and vital interests both acknowledge that democracy in the third world has emerged as a major diplomatic issue. "It's increasingly clear that the failure of the Arab states to improve the lives of their citizens has created a great fund of discontent and the solution is ultimately democratization," Mr. Gaddis said. "Realism and idealism have come together." Meanwhile, those who favor cooperation, like Mr. Walt, say they do so out of self-interest: "I remain a multilateralist on very selfish grounds," Mr. Walt said. "It's a way for the U.S. to make its extraordinary power acceptable to others. "
If theoretical boundaries are blurring, it may be because policies have done the same. The Clinton administration was multilateralist, stressing the use of "soft power" but using military force in Bosnia and Kosovo in a way that struck European allies as unilateral.
The Bush administration has done its own brand of mix-and-match. After showing isolationist instincts -- withdrawing from an active role in the Israel-Palestinian negotiations and dismissing the idea of nation-building -- it has been sampling from the theoretical buffet.
Washington acted unilaterally in Afghanistan but worked hard to create international consensus around its objective. It made decisive use of military power, but sent troops in to do some nation-building and has spoken of the importance of democracy and women's rights in the Islamic world. It has even done something the minimalists would applaud: getting a local proxy, the Northern Alliance, to do the bulk of the fighting. 
So when it comes to taking the test, don't worry. 
The answer is all of the above.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Decline for a Third Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Wholesale prices in the United States declined in December for a third consecutive month, making last year's drop in wholesale costs the biggest since 1986, government figures showed.
 The Producer Price Index fell 0.7 percent last month, more than expected, reflecting declines in costs for cars, energy and food. Excluding food and energy, the core index unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent last month, the Labor Department said. 
 In November, the overall index fell 0.6 percent but rose 0.2 percent excluding food and energy. The index measures prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers.
"While this is of great concern to producers whose profit margins are being crushed," subdued inflation will probably persuade Fed officials "to keep interest rates low until the economic recovery is well established," said Steven Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen Inc. in Walnut Creek, Calif. The Fed reduced the overnight bank rate 11 times last year, bringing the rate to 1.75 percent, close to a 40-year low.
For 2001, the price index fell 1.8 percent after rising 3.6 percent in 2000. The core index rose 0.7 percent last year, its smallest rise since 1997, after a 1.3 percent increase in 2000. Analysts had expected a 0.1 percent drop in the overall index in December and a 0.1 percent rise in the core rate of wholesale prices.
Last year's drop in the index was the largest since a 2.3 percent fall in 1986. The 2000 increase was the largest since a 5.7 percent rise in 1990.
Declining prices reflect an economy in its first recession in a decade. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared in November that the recession started in March and deepened after the terrorist attacks in September.
Prices for energy plunged 4.0 percent in December after falling 3.8 percent in November. Gasoline prices decreased 8.2 percent last month after falling 10.3 percent in November. Prices for electricity, residential natural gas and heating oil also declined.
The average price paid for unleaded gasoline by station operators was 52 cents a gallon in mid-December, the lowest since January 2000, Energy Department figures show.
Intermediate goods prices dropped 0.9 percent in December after falling 0.5 percent in November. Prices for crude goods, which are used at the earliest stage of production, declined 9.5 percent after rising 7.3 percent in November.
Car prices declined 0.7 percent after rising 0.9 percent in November. Prices for capital equipment fell 0.1 percent in December after rising 0.1 percent the month before. Prices for consumer goods excluding food and energy fell 0.1 percent.
Food prices dropped 0.1 percent after declining 0.8 percent, reflecting decreases in the costs of eggs, pork, dairy products and fish.
Yesterday, Anthony Santomero, president of the Philadelphia Fed, dismissed suggestions that the country was on the brink of deflation, or broad-based declines in prices.
"There is little reason to worry about such a downward spiral," Mr. Santomero said in a speech to the National Economists Club in Washington. While the rise in the Consumer Price Index was below 2 percent in 2001, he said his bank's survey of forecasters indicated that inflation would be about 2.5 percent long term.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Japan's Premier Tours Asia to Promote Trade Bloc

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
His economy in distress, his banks teetering and his currency sinking, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan has embarked on a whirlwind tour of Southeast Asia to promote a vision of regional economic cooperation and trade liberalization -- only to find that his country is now seen as more hindrance than help.
 A decade ago, when Tokyo talked, Southeast Asia listened. But as Japan's economy has stumbled, its influence as Southeast Asia's largest investor and lender has withered. Today, the global electronics market and the threat of China's rapid rise as a rival for trade and investment matter much more. 
 Mr. Koizumi is scheduled to wrap up his tour here on Monday with a speech sketching the outlines of a broad East Asian economic and trade bloc that would stretch from Japan to Australia and New Zealand. Japanese officials said that Mr. Koizumi had planned to offer the proposal in September, but the terror attacks in the United States obliged him to shelve the trip and the speech. Then, in November, Premier Zhu Rongji of China stole some of his thunder with an agreement to establish a free-trade area with Southeast Asia within 10 years. 
Now, what the countries in the region are most concerned about is not Japan's vision of the future but its attempts to contain its troubles of today by letting the yen fall in value, potentially threatening its neighbors' economic health. 
"It's a highly politicized issue," said Pieter van der Schaft, an economist at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong. "In the past, Japan has held back on pursuing a weak yen policy because it would have been accused of pursuing beggar-thy-neighbor policies."
No longer, evidently. The yen has fallen 10 percent against the dollar in just two months, reflecting the country's poor short-term economic prospects, and officials in Tokyo have not tried to stop it. A cheaper yen means a relative loss of competitiveness for Japan's neighbors.
Reaction in Asian markets has been relatively muted so far. But during his stop Thursday in Malaysia, Mr. Koizumi found himself fielding questions about the yen from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who has been one of Japan's greatest admirers in the region. Mr. Mahathir also appeared to throw cold water on Mr. Koizumi's pan-Asian vision.
Mr. Koizumi was more warmly received by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines on Wednesday and by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand today. And he will have a substantive achievement to point to on Monday, when he is scheduled to sign a free trade agreement with Singapore, Japan's first such pact with any nation.
Singapore's leaders have called repeatedly for greater regional economic linkages, but they have backed away from the kind of "economic socialism" represented by Japan's developmental model of the past. If Mr. Koizumi's new plan more resembles the careful deregulation approach being pursued in Singapore, it may also go down well here.
Economists said the yen would probably go on making Mr. Koizumi's message of cooperation ring somewhat hollow, however. Mr. van der Schaft said the yen could slide by one-third, to 200 to the dollar, before stabilizing, making Japanese exports much more attractive and possibly buying Mr. Koizumi time to push through his politically difficult austerity and deregulation program.
Southeast Asian economies depend even more heavily on exports than Japan's does, and the Japanese are vital customers. Many regional policy makers fear that a falling yen will worsen a slump in their own nations' competitiveness abroad and widen the region's trade deficit with Japan. Worse, they fear that their own currencies will be forced lower. 
Mr. Mahathir warned today that the yen's fall might force Malaysia to end its policy of pegging the Malaysian ringgit at 3.8 to the dollar. Mr. Mahathir established the peg during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990's, and he has said the peg, along with capital controls that have since been lifted, is what spared Malaysia from the volatility and turmoil that sent Thailand and Indonesia into the arms of the International Monetary Fund.
Past shifts in the yen's strength have been pivotal for Southeast Asia. The Plaza Accord of 1985, which sent the Japanese yen surging, touched off a wave of Japanese investment in the region, as Japanese exporters moved production overseas to lower costs. In 1995, the Group of 7 industrialized nations agreed to push the yen down against the dollar, leading to a steady decline in Japanese lending and investment to Southeast Asia that some economists say helped ignite the Asian financial crisis in 1997. 
Today, though, many economists say Southeast Asia has less to fear from a decline in the yen than it stands to gain if the Japanese economy -- nearly eight times the size of all of Southeast Asia's taken together -- were to recover and start growing again. Japan the customer looms larger than Japan the competitor.
"Compared to 10 or 20 years ago, they are probably able to stand on their feet more easily," said Rebecca H. Patterson, global currency strategist at J. P. Morgan in New York. "You don't have the same financial dependencies you did in the early 90's."

HEADLINE: The Modern Relocates Its Film Stills Amid Protests 

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
Next month, over protests from members of New York's film community, the Museum of Modern Art will move its collection of four million still photographs from films -- a rare record of cinema history -- to its film storage and preservation center in Hamlin, Pa., for an indefinite period.
 Mary Corliss, an assistant curator who had worked with the stills archive for 34 years, and her co-worker Terry Geesken were laid off as a result of the relocation, which according to the museum's administrators is part of the Modern's elaborate plans to shut down its Manhattan operations during its $650 million expansion and redesign. The museum will close its doors on West 53rd Street on May 21, and on June 29 will open temporary exhibition space in Long Island City, Queens. Its popular film program will continue at a Manhattan location that has not been decided. 
 The museum's expanded home in Manhattan, designed by the Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi, is expected to open in 2005, but whether the archive of still pictures will be returned then is still undecided.
"We are going to look very seriously whether or not it makes more sense to keep all the film-related material together or not," said Glenn D. Lowry, the museum's director, in a telephone interview from Zurich, where he was traveling on business.
The archive will be going to the Modern's Celeste Bartos Film Preservation Center near Scranton, Pa., an $11.2 million complex that opened in 1996 and now houses more than 90 percent of the museum's prodigious film collection.
But film historians, critics and festival publicists who have relied on the Modern for certain rare categories of photographs argue that the archive is of little worth if it is kept far from the public that uses them.
"What good does it do in Pennsylvania?" asked John Anderson, the chief film critic at Newsday, who as chairman of the New York Film Critics Circle, wrote a letter of protest last month to the museum. "It makes it inaccessible. This is a New York City institution. What good is preserving something in aspic?"
Reached yesterday, Ms. Corliss said: "When there was a huge outcry, their solution was to shut it down altogether and lay us off. So it is a public collection which now the public can't get to."
Bruce Goldstein, director of repertory programming at the Film Forum, said: "We will really miss it. It is one of the greatest collections, and to have it away from here, and not have access to it, will be a hardship."
The Modern's collection of movie photographs was begun in the 1930's, when it also began to amass a world-famous collection of films, coaxing copies from major studios and early filmmakers. Its stills archive is particularly strong in early silent movies and little-known foreign films, several experts said. 
"When you deal with rare films, where else can you go to get these things?" asked Mr. Goldstein, who is responsible for the Film Forum's old-movie repertory. "If everything else failed, you knew that MOMA had it."
Mr. Lowry confirmed that in the short term, the still photographs would not be available to the public. "We have so much on our plate," he said. "We are looking at a whole range of issues; we have to look at what makes most practical sense."
The archive's final location is still being discussed. "My own feeling is that it makes a great deal of sense to have all our film material together, but we have several years to figure that out," Mr. Lowry said.
Although the move to Pennsylvania had been known for several months, the termination notices for Ms. Corliss and Ms. Geesken were delivered only on Wednesday. Ms. Corliss said she had opted for a right to be recalled should her job be restored.
Mr. Anderson, among others, questioned whether the decision to lay off Ms. Corliss was tied to her outspoken support of the staff members' union, Local 2110 of the United Automobile Workers, when it went on strike against the Modern in 2000. 
Mr. Lowry insisted that the decision had no connection to the strike. 
Four employees in the museum store were also laid off recently, as the Modern heads into what is expected to be a difficult transition, made more tense by a worsening economic climate. Mr. Lowry said more layoffs were expected in coming months, as the museum temporarily contracts its exhibitions space and curtails its popular film program. The total number of layoffs, from both management and staff, will be 30 to 35 out of a total work force of 570, he said.

HEADLINE: Plan to Close Ford Plant Means Upheaval for Many 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Craig's Deli, with its coffee island and sizzling grill, could be seen as a canary in the economic mine shaft of this central New Jersey town of 100,000. It's not dead, but it's in trouble.
 In the last month, as the Ford Motor Company plant in Edison has cut its workers' schedules from 50- to 40-hour weeks, daily receipts at the deli have dropped about $200, a sizable chunk of the restaurant's revenues. Much of the 84 pounds of pork roll normally served every week at the deli has been left in the freezer. 
 Today, Ford officials announced that the 53-year-old plant would be phased out and closed down by 2004. That left Craig's owner, Craig Mailler, looking wistfully across the road at the plant, long a bulwark of his business and a fixture in his life growing up in Edison.
"That plant is about 40 percent of my business," he said. "I guess I'll have to diversify."
In a region where manufacturing jobs have been gradually giving way to service-sector ones, the factory, which makes Ford Ranger pickups, has played a big role in keeping many collars a gritty and solidly middle-income blue. With 1,600 assembly line and production jobs, it has been one of the area's "manufacturing anchors" said Joseph Seneca, chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisers and a vice president at Rutgers University.
"While the manufacturing profile of the state has been going down in the last two decades, the Ford plant at Edison has remained an icon of the auto industry in the state," he said. He noted that manufacturing made up 28 percent of New Jersey's jobs in 1976, but less than 13 percent today.
The shifts are registering as sudden upheavals in the lives of people like Joe Sehein, 37, who has worked at the plant for 10 years, building Ford Ranger pickups just as his father built Mustangs and Falcons in the 1960's and 1970's and just as his grandfather built Mercuries in the 1940's and 1950's.
"My dad did his 40 years here and can retire," said Mr. Sehein, who started on the assembly line before becoming a truck repairman. "But he is upset because his kids will be suffering. This is a major thing."
Such change in the automobile industry is modulated somewhat by union contracts that provide for early retirement, severance benefits, payment of up to 95 percent of base pay for up to two years after layoffs and opportunities for those with enough seniority to fill job openings in other Ford plants around the country.
Feelings about the closing vary depending on seniority: older workers seem resigned and ready to accept full retirement, or early retirement, while younger workers are more nervous, uncertain about their chances of qualifying for transfers. As many as 20,000 jobs will be lost in a companywide restructuring.
Jo Cheryl Huguenin, a nine-year veteran of the plant, recalled her experience with "downsizing" at New Jersey Bell Telephone in the 1980's and First Fidelity Bank after that.
"In these times you can't let yourself get all bent out of shape over layoffs," she said during a break-time trip to Craig's. "Nowadays this just comes with the territory. Me, I'll spend more time with my 7-year-old son and just hang in there."
Bob LaPoint, the president of Local 980 of the United Automobile Workers, saw hope in the company's plan to wait until 2004 to close the plant. It was a sad day, he said, but he was not prepared to give up hope that between now and the final date, Ford, through the introduction of new product lines and retooling, might yet find a need to keep the plant open.
"It's never over until its over," said Mr. LaPoint.
Still, he acknowledged that layoffs would start in March after a month in which the plant's two shifts will be cut to half time, working alternate weeks.
Also holding out hope for a reprieve was George Spadoro, the mayor of Edison, who said that he and Governor-elect James McGreevey were prepared to offer Ford tax breaks and arrange low interest state loans so it could retool the plant.
The mayor said he saw the area and the plant as victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and the national downturn, but insisted that the effects of those events would not last long.
Mr. Seneca, the economist who heads the state's advisory group, however, said incentives and tax breaks might prove irrelevant because product competitiveness, loss of market share, quality control and the overall economy seemed to be at the heart of Ford's need to restructure.
"States and localities sort of have to respond in this way," he said, "but it is swimming against the tide of economic factors and could prove marginal."

HEADLINE: GROUND ZERO: THE PROPOSALS; 
Everyone Weighs In With Rebuilding Ideas

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Almost immediately after Sept. 11, a rising chorus of voices began to offer suggestions about how to rebuild Lower Manhattan and what should be done to address the issues of transportation, office space, businesses, residents and a memorial to the victims of the attacks.
 Four months later, several groups have published their visions or concrete proposals for redesigning and rebuilding sections of Lower Manhattan, from Ground Zero outward to the East and Hudson Rivers. 
 What is emerging, however, is less chorus than cacophony -- or, from another perspective, voices rising in rich intellectual ferment. And the sound is likely to become even richer and more varied as ad hoc groups with different interests issue position papers and studies about their views for the World Trade Center site and the lower part of Manhattan as a whole. 
The multitude of voices is almost certain to increase in the coming weeks, as the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation, the commission officially charged with the rebuilding, appoints its own advisory committees to evaluate and report on the views of various constituencies.
Groups representing the families of victims have expectations about a memorial, for example, while residents of Lower Manhattan want changes made in traffic patterns. Business owners want the utility companies to finish their work quickly, once again placing the power lines and other utilities that are now clogging downtown sidewalks below ground, while urban planners want to delay the burial of those power lines until issues of pedestrian circulation are discussed. Beyond that, there is the question of who will pay.
"It would be great to be able to say that hundreds of groups have been involved in these efforts and all have a very similar result," said Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 and a member of the board of the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation.
But given the groups' diversity (among those involved so far are the Society for Environmental Graphic Design, the Bond Market Association and several groups representing the families of victims), opposing views are more likely to surface.
Therefore, Ms. Wils said, the resolutions coming out of the ad hoc groups will probably serve as a jumping-off point for the redevelopment corporation, which is expected to begin formulating plans when a "listening period" ends in March.
Ideas, of course, rarely wait for committees, and plenty of proposals, from the conceptual to the concrete, are already or will soon be available for public viewing. Some participants in the process have already begun to warn that what emerges in those early discussions could have a tremendous effect on what will happen.
"As we learned with community gardens, sometimes what is meant to be interim use becomes permanent use," said Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, at a forum Thursday night sponsored by the Institute for Urban Design.
Larry A. Silverstein, who held the lease on the two towers, has said he would like to rebuild commercial office space, and some of the representatives of the victims -- as well as former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- have said they want the entire site to be a memorial. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and John C. Whitehead, head of the redevelopment commission, said they supported mixed use for the 16-acre site: office space, a memorial to the victims and perhaps retail space.
Some of the earliest visions of what should occur in Lower Manhattan appear in a 52-page report put together by a coalition of architecture, planning and design groups called New York, New Visions.
The report, a working draft of which is available at the group's Web site -- nynv.aiga.org -- features everything from generalizations about the process of conceiving a memorial to specific plans for new traffic routes throughout Lower Manhattan. It will be revised after coalition members assess it.
A more conceptual vision of what might become of the World Trade Center site will open to the public on Thursday at the Max Protetch Gallery, at 511 West 22nd Street in Manhattan. Two nights ago, Mr. Protetch, who solicited the 50 ideas and renderings from architects and artists, offered a preview of some of the designs at a forum sponsored by the Institute for Urban Design.
In the coming weeks, at least three conferences and roundtables will address what should become of the World Trade Center site. On Feb. 7, the Civic Alliance, a coalition of civic groups, environmental advocates, designers, academic centers and policy experts, will conduct a "conversation with the city" at Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport. The meeting will include an Electronic Town Hall format to survey citizens' ideas and recommendations.
Two private conferences will tackle some of the same issues. 
On Jan. 18, the Bond Market Association, a trade group of Wall Street firms, will sponsor a forum on rebuilding priorities and options for financing them.
On Feb. 8, the City University of New York and Rutgers University will be co-sponsors of a conference in which professors, real estate executives, politicians and others discuss six aspects of rebuilding: the economy, security, the region, infrastructure, building and governance.
Other assessments of the rebuilding effort are being undertaken by an alliance of downtown residents, small businesses and designers called Rebuild Downtown, Our Town. And the Municipal Art Society is sponsoring what it calls a visioning project, which is intended to stimulate further discussion about visions for rebuilding downtown Manhattan.
And of course, there is the memorial, the project that is first on virtually everyone's list for consideration. Most parties agree that the design of a memorial will drive all other decisions about what to do with the trade center site. And for all of the interest of design gurus and real estate executives, the groups wielding the most influential voices so far in the discussions about the rebuilding process appear to be the families of victims of the disaster.

PERSON: John W. Reynolds 

HEADLINE: John W. Reynolds, 80, Judge In Milwaukee School Integration 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
John W. Reynolds, the senior federal district judge in Wisconsin who oversaw the racial integration of the Milwaukee public schools in the 1970's, died on Sunday in a hospital in Milwaukee. He was 80 and lived in suburban Mequon.
 The cause was complications from heart disease, the court said. 
 Judge Reynolds, a Democrat who came from a politically active family, was Wisconsin's attorney general from 1958 to 1962 and served a term as governor from 1963 to 1965. He was defeated for re-election by Warren P. Knowles, a Republican.
By then, he had made his reputation by establishing the state's first women's commission and arts council, as well as championing a more open legislative process, academic freedom, redistricting changes and improvements at state mental hospitals. Though a strong advocate of civil rights, he was less successful in enacting open-housing legislation.
President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Mr. Reynolds to the federal bench in 1965, and he was chief judge of the Federal District Court in Milwaukee from 1971 to 1986. In 1976, he drew national attention by ordering the city's Board of Education to establish a racial balance in its schools. The case ended when the board agreed to an out-of-court settlement in 1979, resulting in widespread busing for pupils. 
Judge Reynolds's ruling was a benchmark in efforts to give children from minorities an equal education.
John -- the W. is just an initial -- Reynolds was born in Green Bay, Wis. 
His father, also John, was state attorney general from 1927 to 1933.
John Reynolds graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in economics in 1942. After service in World War II, he completed law school at Wisconsin in 1949.
Since stepping down as chief judge in Milwaukee, he sat on the court with senior status.
Surviving are his wife of 30 years, Jane Conway Reynolds; their three sons, Thomas and Jacob, of Milwaukee, and John W. III, of Brooklyn, and a daughter, Frances, of Madison, Wis.; two daughters and a son from an earlier marriage, Kate R. Lindquist of Thorp, Wis., Molly A. Reynolds of Cedarburg, Wis., and James B. of Menomonee Falls, Wis.; a sister, Florence Mullarkey of Milwaukee; and nine grandchildren. His first wife, Patricia Brody Reynolds, died in 1967.

HEADLINE: Hospital Agreement Provides State-Financed Raises 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Counting heavily on a much-criticized infusion of aid from Albany, an association representing 67 New York City hospitals and nursing homes agreed yesterday to grant a raise of slightly more than 13 percent over 42 months to 55,000 health care workers.
 The settlement is unusual because it provides far-reaching job security provisions for the workers, despite the deficits and upheaval troubling many of New York's hospitals. 
 When negotiations began in May, hospital officials said their deficits would make it hard to grant anything but a minimal raise to workers in 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's Health and Human Service Union.
But hospital executives and union officials said the sizable wage increase announced yesterday, averaging about 3.8 percent a year, was made possible by new state aid, estimated at more than $300 million over three years. Lawmakers in Albany said yesterday that Gov. George E. Pataki was pushing the State Legislature to approve the aid Monday as part of a larger health care package. Hospital and union officials said they were confident that the Legislature would approve the new aid. 
Some lawmakers criticized the infusion of state aid, saying that it relied on fiscal gimmickry, and that the state could not afford the aid when it faced a deficit of more than $6 billion.
The settlement, agreed to by the League of Voluntary Hospitals, covers many of New York's private nonprofit hospitals, including Mount Sinai, Montefiore, New York Presbyterian, St. Vincent's Manhattan and Beth Israel.
"Without some additional health care financing from the state, it would have been very hard to do this," said Bruce McIver, the league's president. 
Under the agreement, workers hired before Feb. 1, 1996 -- about three-fourths of the 55,000 -- cannot be laid off unless hospitals close or are in financial crisis. Newer workers who are laid off are to receive more job training, priority in hiring by the hospitals and financial assistance beyond unemployment insurance.
The workers covered by the contract earn $32,000 a year on average and include X-ray and laboratory technicians and laundry, housekeeping and food workers.
To help finance the wage increases, the Pataki administration plans to use revenue from a proposed increase in the cigarette tax and funds from a one-time $1 billion payment the state expects to receive from the conversion of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield from a nonprofit insurer to a for-profit institution. Lawmakers said that about $700 million from the governor's $4.6 billion health package would finance wage increases statewide over three years, and that about half of that $700 million would help finance the 1199 settlement announced yesterday.
Mr. Pataki's maneuvering to finance 1199's wage increase is expected to boost his re-election chances by going far to neutralize 1199, a 210,000-member union that normally favors Democrats, and that is widely viewed as having the most potent political operation of any union in the state. 
Dennis Rivera, 1199's president, declined to say whom the union would endorse for governor. Nonetheless, he praised Mr. Pataki as well as the Senate and Assembly leaders for helping health care workers and expanding health coverage for low-wage New Yorkers.
Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat, said 1199's members were paid little and deserved a raise, but he criticized Mr. Pataki's technique for financing such a raise.
"This is very disappointing because he's using a one-shot commitment to pay for ongoing obligations," Mr. Grannis said. "The governor in his State of the State address said, 'We're not going to resort to fiscal gimmicks,' and almost in the same breath he has his little gnomes drafting a bill to do precisely that."
Mr. Rivera said he expected the agreement to set a pattern for 90,000 other unionized workers employed at 200 nursing homes and more than two dozen hospitals in the southern part of the state.
"This is a very modest settlement," Mr. Rivera said. 
The 1199 workers are scheduled to vote on the agreement over the next two weeks. The old contract expired on Nov. 1, but the union and hospitals agreed to extend it because they did not want a confrontation so soon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
The tentative agreement calls for a 3 percent increase on May 1, a 2 percent increase on Nov. 1, and 4 percent increases on June 1, 2003, and June 1, 2004. The contract, which expires on May 1, 2005, also calls for an immediate lump sum payment of $750 per worker.
"We've done a contract that limits the damage that collective bargaining had the potential to do to the financial health of New York City's health care institutions," Mr. McIver said.
In the past, to persuade the Republican-controlled State Senate to back increased health spending, 1199 has promised some favors for Republicans.
In a surprise move that 1199's leaders insisted was unrelated to the aid package, the union announced its endorsement yesterday of John A. Ravitz, a Republican assemblyman who is running to succeed Roy Goodman, a longtime state senator from Manhattan's East Side who is stepping down.
Officials of 1199 praised Mr. Ravitz, the ranking Republican on the Assembly Health Committee, saying he was a progressive who voted repeatedly during his 11 years in office to expand health programs for low-wage New Yorkers.
The agreement increases the hospitals' contributions to a child care plan and health care plan, and 1199 workers will still not have to pay premiums or co-payments toward their basic health or dental plans. 
In the agreement, the 67 hospitals and nursing homes promised not to fight efforts to unionize about 5,000 nonmanagement employees.

HEADLINE: Junk Funds Have Best Week Since 1998 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Junk bond mutual funds took in nearly $1.21 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the most in any week since November 1998.
 Fund flows, tracked by AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., are considered a good gauge of sentiment for junk or high-yield bonds, whose yields reflect their credit risks. 
 "Investors anticipate a better market," Robert Adler, AMG's president, said. 
The inflow, accounting for 1.8 percent of the $69.4 billion of junk funds that AMG tracks, can, and often does, foreshadow a rally for the bonds, which usually fare well in January. The junk bond funds netted more than $3 billion in last year's first five weeks, and junk bonds returned about 6 percent that January. 
"You're seeing the same kind of liquidity rally we saw a year ago," Kingman Penniman, president of KDP Investment Advisors, a high-yield research firm based in Montpelier, Vt., said. "A lot of people sat on the sidelines after Sept. 11. Investors are now looking out six to nine months and have more confidence that the economy is improving." 
Mr. Adler said the flow of money, coming on the heels of $10 billion in 2001, was evenly spread, with seven funds taking in cash for every two that lost it.

HEADLINE: 2nd Bond-Rating Firm Issues a Warning About State's Credit 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's today became the second major bond-rating firm to raise warning flags on New Jersey's credit, saying that the state's current bond rating, which is very high, may be lowered unless the state manages to fill a yawning budget deficit.
 The firm put the state's public debt on "credit watch with negative implications," a status that reflects concern about the projected $2 billion budget gap. 
 On Dec. 10, Moody's Investor Services took a similar step, changing its outlook for the state's bond rating to "negative" from "stable." Neither step amounts to a downgrading of the state's bonds; rather, they each tell investors that a lower rating may be looming. 
Despite the action last month, Moody's still called New Jersey's rating as Aa1, nearly its highest. Standard & Poor's, using its own system, maintained the state's high double-A plus rating today. A lower rating pushes up the interest charges a borrower must pay.
The firms said they were concerned by the sharp drop in state tax revenues as the recession took hold, and the absence, so far, of steps to bring spending into line.
Both firms are certain to wait to revise their actual ratings until Governor-elect James B. McGreevey takes office next Tuesday and puts his own budget together. Mr. McGreevey has put the impending structural deficit -- the difference between what the state expects to take in and the amount it is committed to spend under current plans -- at more than $2 billion, 10 percent of the total budget.
The outgoing acting governor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, maintains that he has left the state's finances in good order.
"We recognize that New Jersey has significant problems," said Robert Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's. "But we also know that there is a transition going on, and in a certain sense there is a an outgoing administration saying, 'We didn't leave a mess,' and an incoming administration saying, 'We inherited a mess,' and we are here to guide people who want to know how serious it is."
On Wednesday, the state treasurer's office reported that December revenues were $505 million below the budget forecast, for example. Of the major tax categories, only state sales taxes have increased from the year before, reflecting strong new auto sales and a better than expected Christmas season.
"While many states across the nation face similar issues, New Jersey's projected revenue shortfalls are among the highest and present a significant problem to the state," the Standard & Poor's statement read.
It added, "If the state wishes to restore fiscal balance, some difficult decisions must be made."
Mr. McGreevey, a Democrat, has said he would solve the budget deficit without raising taxes. But without the budget-writing pen in his hand, he has been able to do little but exhort the departing Republican governor and Republican-controlled Legislature to restrain any enthusiasm for an end-of-session spending spree.
Moody's made its December announcement before a large sale of bonds by the state's Transportation Trust Fund, saying it did not want investors to be blindsided after the sale by a lowered rating, Mr. Kurtter said.
New Jersey's Moody's rating is far higher than New York State's. "New York State is rated A2, which is quite a few notches down," Mr. Kurtter said. "Embedded in that lower rating is the use of one-shots and other nonrecurring revenues for budget-balancing and structural problems that are not being addressed.

HEADLINE: Wilderness Above, a Mine Below and a Furor 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: NOXON, Mont., Jan. 10 

 BODY:
On the banks of Rock Creek here in the Cabinet Mountains of northwestern Montana, the only sound breaking the silence is the flow of the icy water. But that could change.
 Last month federal and state regulators granted a permit for a giant silver and copper mine that would burrow a length of three miles under a federal wilderness area, 900 feet below the snowy ridges and the lodgepole pine. The result would be one of the largest underground mines in North America and make this the first time the government had permitted large-scale mining beneath a wilderness area. 
 The regulators, citing an 1872 federal mining law, say the company involved is acting on a properly filed claim allowing it to mine on public land. 
"A lot of people have been contacting me and saying, 'Just vote no,' " said Jan P. Sensibaugh, director of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. But "the agency can't just decide that we can't go forward with the project just because the public doesn't want it." 
Ms. Sensibaugh's department and the United States Forest Service, the two agencies that granted the permit, have both said in response to opposition that in order to forge ahead, the company will have to abide by strict environmental regulations. Nevertheless, environmental groups vow to mount a strenuous legal challenge, saying the project imperils waterways and an isolated population of grizzly bears.
The project has also angered officials in northern Idaho, which increasingly depends on tourists drawn to its clear rivers. Treated waste water from the mine would drain into the trout-filled Clark Fork River and across the Idaho border into Lake Pend Oreille. 
At the core of the fight is a question that has never been tested on so large a scale since Congress authorized creation of national wilderness areas 38 years ago: Should mines be allowed to extend underneath federally designated wilderness zones, which by statute are to be "untrammeled by man"? 
The company that wants to build the mine, the Sterling Mining Company, based in Spokane, Wash., says the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness Area would be untrammeled on the surface. The opening to the mine would be not in the wilderness area itself but on adjacent federal land. Hikers, campers and fishermen in the wilderness zone, the companysays, would be unaware of the activity hundreds of feet below, except perhaps for occasional explosions needed to open shafts and reach deposits that Sterling believes total 935 million pounds of copper and 115 million ounces of silver.
Opponents, though, say that the project would be far more intrusive and that it offers a vivid argument for revising the 1872 mining act.
Intended to encourage Western development, the law grants mining companies nearly automatic rights to mine on federal land for a few dollars an acre. Critics of the law, including Clinton administration officials who tried to overhaul it, argue that it has long outlived its intent and amounts to a lucrative giveaway to corporate interests. 
"It's an absurdity, it's a crazy law," Cesar Hernandez, a field representative with the Montana Wilderness Association, said during a walk by snowshoe in the Cabinet Mountains area the other day. "If the Sistine Chapel was in this country, you could exercise a right to mine under it." 
The proposed mine has plenty of supporters in western Montana, especially here in tiny, economically depressed Noxon, the closest town, which drew brief notice after the Oklahoma City bombing as a militia hotbed.
With logging and mining in decline, the town has tried, though without much success, to transform itself into a tourist destination, adopting the slogan "You can spell Noxon backwards, forwards or sideways, and it's still Noxon." 
Drinking coffee at the Noxon Cafe, Nick Schmidt, a 73-year-old retired pipeline mechanic, said the town could use a boost from the project, which officials say would employ about 350 people in addition to providing property taxes for a struggling school district. Asked what Noxon's primary industry was, Mr. Schmidt replied: "Nothing, anymore. That's why we need something like this." 
But the mine has fierce opponents, too, both in Montana and in neighboring Idaho, who say it will cause serious environmental problems. The mine would discharge up to three million gallons of waste water a day into the Clark Fork River. Over its 30-year lifetime, it would also be expected to throw off 100 million tons of crushed rock, or tailings, which would have to be buried in fields near here. 
While both those activities would take place adjacent to the wilderness area per se, environmentalists say they can also foresee air pollution within the zone and damage to its watershed. The suits they are planning mean that mining operations are at least a couple of years off.
Or another kind of law might stop the project: the law of economics. Sterling already owns a smaller mine, known as the Troy Mine, in a neighboring county. Operations were suspended there in 1993 because of low silver and copper prices.
The Troy Mine is a ghost town these days, in the words of Bruce Clark, its manager, one of only five full-time employees who maintain the big crushers and other mothballed equipment that the company hopes to restart once metals prices recover sufficiently. The same hopes prevail for the Rock Creek Mine, which has bigger deposits and so would be more economical to operate.
Mr. Clark, a jovial man with a large mustache who has worked at the Troy Mine since 1980, said he was frustrated by public perceptions. Environmental regulations and improvements in technology, he said, mean that treatment of the Rock Creek Mine's waste water would bring it well within clean-water standards. 
"We can do it right -- we can absolutely do it right," Mr. Clark said during a tour of the Troy Mine that wound past a sign saying it had been built by "Montana miners and the free enterprise system." 
"A lot of people, you're not going to convince them that a mine is a good thing," Mr. Clark said ruefully. "You might as well be beating your head against that wall," he said, pointing to a massive face of copper-laced rock. 
But environmentalists say mining companies have always claimed to have the technology to prevent damage, and have often been proved wrong. The Clark Fork River, which winds through rocky canyons and grassy meadows here, has been affected by mines before. Cadmium, arsenic and other toxic elements from more than a century of mining have polluted it and other rivers in the area, including the Blackfoot, which empties into the Clark Fork and was immortalized in Norman Maclean's "A River Runs Through It."
The Clark Fork has been the object of a longstanding cleanup campaign, one that the Rock Creek Mine's opponents, including the Clark Fork Coalition and the Rock Creek Alliance, say makes the idea of introducing new mining waste to the area profoundly objectionable. 
The opponents plan to wage a legal battle over the scope and intent of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which authorized the wilderness areas. Among the issues is whether that statute trumps the 1872 act, which decreed that mining be considered the best use of public lands.
No roads, construction or motor vehicles are ordinarily permitted in wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act allowed existing mining "patents" -- claims to the minerals in a given location -- to be exercised in a few wilderness areas. But most of those existing patents involved very small-scale operations.
The claims at Rock Creek, on the other hand, were filed afterward, and the courts will probably be asked to determine whether so large an operation is permitted within the meaning of the Wilderness Act. 
"The Bush administration and the State of Montana are acting as if there is an absolute right to construct this mine," said Roger Flynn, director and managing attorney for the Colorado-based Western Mining Action Project, which is representing a coalition of conservation groups planning to challenge approval of the mine. "That's simply not the case at all under federal law." 
But Frank Duval, Sterling's president, said the company's patent gave it the right to take the silver and copper that lie buried beneath the wilderness area. 
"The opponents say we'll kill all the bears and poison the fish," Mr. Duval said. "That's just ridiculous. This thing has been studied and studied and studied, and the fact is the mine can operate and follow all the proper guidelines."

HEADLINE: Mr. T., Mr. G And Mr. H. 

BYLINE:  By Bill Keller; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Whenever a truly dreadful person dies or retires and the chorus of polite, speak-no-ill-of-the-departed accolades begins, I think of the nasty bee-sting E. E. Cummings bestowed on the editor and poet Louis Untermeyer. Untermeyer's influential 1919 anthology, "Modern American Poetry," omitted some of the great poetic innovators of the time, but included three poems by Untermeyer himself and one by his wife. Cummings gutted him in four lines.
mr u will not be missed
who as an anthologist
sold the many on the few 
not excluding mr u
 The epigram was mean-spirited (later Untermeyer editions included the overlooked poets, and plenty of Cummings), but it was a memorable kick against the collective deference that accumulates around powerful people. 
 In that dyspeptic spirit I'd like to begin the new year by bidding farewell to three men whose departure will raise the median decency of the United States Senate. In their remaining, lame-duck months, Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond and Phil Gramm will enjoy the ritual tributes of colleagues and the sanitized adieus of home-state editorialists. Let's be frank. They will leave behind an institution they have helped appreciably to debase.
Senators Helms, Gramm and Thurmond have in common the fact that they harnessed their collective century of seniority to the Taliban wing of the American right. Point to an act of cultural division, bullying unilateralism or anti-government populism committed in the Senate during their decades there and you will usually find these three men among the sponsors. But there are others in the Senate who have voted for egregious causes, right and left, and still others who have never stood for much of anything. What sets these three apart is that each has made his own special contribution to the cynicism of our public life.
It is tempting to excuse them, in their twilight, for at least having made the place more colorful. Mr. Helms affected a theatrically courtly demeanor, sirring and ma'aming witnesses he regarded as infidels. (His manners were selective; it was the courtly Mr. Helms who once remarked that if President Clinton visited North Carolina he'd "better have a bodyguard.") Mr. Gramm pokes witty fun at his own orneriness. "People say I don't have a heart," he once joked. "I do. I keep it in a quart jar on my desk." As David Plotz wrote in Slate, Senator Gramm is a mean, bitter pessimist, but "he has benefited from one of the strangest prejudices of politics: that meanness is a synonym for integrity." Mr. Thurmond benefits from another prejudice, our instinctive American admiration for those who correct themselves. He abandoned his ardent segregationist views when the demographics of his state made that expedient, and even hired actual black people to work on his Senate staff, a fact sometimes reported with such awe that you'd think he'd marched with Dr. King in Selma.
I wish I could summon up tributes to these men, if only for the contrarian pleasure of defying the liberal tradition of these pages. But alas, it has to be said that each of them has impoverished our precious political culture.
Mr. Thurmond's contribution is that he helped make Congress ridiculous. I can't think of a more cringe-making spectacle in public life than watching Mr. Thurmond, age 99, being shoveled into his seat at some committee he is only dimly aware of attending, and listening as he struggles to read a text prepared for him by an aide, losing his place at the end of each line. The Senate has never been a youth center, but Mr. Thurmond has deteriorated like Dorian Gray's picture while his constituents acquiesced and his colleagues averted their eyes. His embarrassing political shtick includes a self-conscious virility, manifested in his ability to produce children into his 70's and in his famously cute habit of leering at female interns, groping female senators and acclaiming the beauty of female witnesses before his various committees. Senator Thurmond did not invent the role of Washington lecher, but he helped cultivate the men's-club chauvinism in which Bob Packwood and Bill Clinton and Gary Condit operated.
Please understand, Mr. Thurmond's sin is not that he grew old; it is that growing old was the sum of his career. The message of his nearly half-century in the Senate is that success is to be measured not by tangible accomplishments -- Mr. Thurmond has none, unless you count getting post offices and schools named for himself, and wangling an appointment for his 29-year-old son and namesake as the top federal attorney for South Carolina -- but by political longevity. What Mr. Thurmond represents is the transformation of senators into self-perpetuating instruments of incumbency. For years, "Senator Thurmond" has been a shell inhabited by party leaders, campaign donors and staff who operate behind his Oz-like seniority, the way Communist Party apparatchiks ruled in the name of the sickly Leonid Brezhnev. I don't believe in term limits, on the principle that voters are entitled to make their own mistakes, but Mr. Thurmond makes me less certain of my conviction.
Mr. Gramm should be remembered for perfecting one of the more duplicitous roles in politics -- the anti-government welfare queen. He has run his every campaign as a scourge of government spending and a champion of the beleaguered little taxpayer. At the same time he has built a great money sluice from Washington to his home state and pandered to the energy, banking and insurance lobbies that underwrite his political ambitions. His politics could be called hypocrisy, but only in a language that places a huge premium on understatement.
Contrast Mr. Gramm with Representative Dick Armey, another Texan with a mean streak, a Ph.D. in economics and a professed distaste for government spending. Mr. Armey, who is also retiring after this Congress, had the intellectual integrity to fight federal farm subsidies and to engineer the closing of unneeded military bases, including one serving his home district. Not so Mr. Gramm, who once boasted, "I'm carrying so much pork, I'm beginning to get trichinosis."
One of Senator Gramm's most generous benefactors was Enron, which lavished money on his campaigns and paid his wife handsomely as a corporate director. Senator Gramm, in turn, had a hand in legislation that exempted Enron's explosive energy derivatives business from government regulation and oversight. How big a hand, and whether that legislation enabled the secret funny business that led to the company's collapse, may emerge in one of the many investigations under way. Enron's business was built on the premise that just about anything could be turned into a commodity and bought and sold. The beleaguered little taxpayers who lost their jobs and pensions in the Enron fiasco will be interested to know whether that included their senator. 
Mr. Helms leaves behind at least a double legacy. He helped perfect fear-mongering as a form of fund-raising, using his own and allied political action committees to raise many millions by appealing to the crudest bigotries of voters. The technique is now pervasive across the political spectrum, but Mr. Helms helped pioneer those alarming boldface solicitations that warn: "Your tax dollars are being used to pay for grade school classes that teach our children that CANNIBALISM, WIFE-SWAPPING and the MURDER of infants and the elderly are acceptable behavior." (Yes, that's an actual letter that went out over his signature.)
Mr. Helms has also diminished American stature abroad by using senatorial obstruction and intimidation to undermine our diplomatic service and pre-empt our foreign policy. As the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the past 15 years, and as the mentor of a right-wing mafia within the Republican Party, he has been an author of much of what makes the world resentful of America: our stingy foreign aid, our lordly attitude toward any multilateral organization, our disdain for treaties, our support of despotic regimes from apartheid-era South Africa to the juntas of Latin America.
Mr. Helms will not be missed;
Unrelenting jingoist,
He sold us bullies of their realms,
Not excluding Mr. Helms.

HEADLINE: FORD PLANS TO CUT 35,000 EMPLOYEES AND SHUT 5 PLANTS 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. Jan. 11

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company announced its most sweeping cutbacks in two decades today, terminating 35,000 workers, closing five plants and dropping four models.
 No longer will the company make Lincoln Continentals or Ford Escorts, as it cuts North American capacity by nearly a million cars and trucks a year. 
 William Clay Ford Jr., who took over as chief executive 10 weeks ago, said the company had underestimated its competitors and the effects of the recession. Ford, which owns Hertz and started several Internet ventures, also had reached too far beyond the business of making cars and trucks, he said. "We strayed from what got us to the top of the mountain, and it cost us greatly," he said. 
Ford will close 5 of its 44 North American plants by the middle of the decade, including plants in Edison, N.J.; Cleveland; Ontario; Michigan; and Hazelwood, Mo., near St. Louis. The Edison plant, 53 years old, will close by 2004, costing 1,600 jobs. Page B1. 
Two more plants, in Avon Lake, Ohio, and in Mexico, with no new products scheduled, are vulnerable, and 20 more plants face cutbacks. 
The company said it would step up job cuts begun early last year that, when finished by the middle of the decade, would reduce its worldwide staff of about 350,000 by 10 percent, including 21,500 workers in North America.
In cutting North American production capacity to 4.8 million vehicles annually from 5.7 million, Ford also will retire the Mercury Cougar and the Mercury Villager.
Analysts were divided over whether the cutbacks would be enough to restore Ford's competitiveness. In North America, the cuts are smaller than the reduction of 26,000 workers that Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, announced last year. They are also smaller, over all, than the huge cutbacks by General Motors in the early 1990's that led to the closing of more than 20 plants. 
Ford's North American reductions include 15,000 hourly workers, 5,000 salaried workers and 1,500 contract workers. Having terminated about 8,000 of these jobs last year, Ford now plans to cut about 13,500 more.
Mr. Ford's tone in explaining the cutbacks was humble. "For most of the last decade, Ford Motor Company was on a roll," he said. "The great success that we enjoyed may have caused us to underestimate the growing strength of our competitors. Our success may have also caused us to underestimate the effect of the economic downturn."
Analysts had mixed reviews. Stephen Girsky of Morgan Stanley called the plan credible while Brett Hoselton of McDonald Investments said the cuts had not gone far enough beyond those made recently by G.M. and Chrysler.
Ford intends to become so much more efficient that it can offer more new models while saving $9 billion annually. But analysts noted that Chrysler said this week that it would also increase the number of new models it develops while cutting billions from development costs. 
Mark Oline, the managing director who oversees auto industry credit ratings for Fitch, said that labor agreements would delay Ford's savings. Ford, he said, "is hamstrung from the costs they can take out because of union contracts." 
"The real open question is what will happen under the new union contract." 
Ford will take a $4.1 billion after-tax charge in the fourth quarter to pay for the cutbacks, which will put its projected 2001 loss at $5.4 billion, its first annual loss since 1992. Under the plan, the company aims to break even this year and earn about $2 a share by about 2005. 
Fitch and other ratings agencies all reacted negatively. Standard & Poor's, which downgraded Ford and Ford Credit two notches last year, put Ford on a negative credit watch, raising the possibility of a further downgrade. Moody's Investors Service said it would re-evaluate Ford to see if further downgrades were warranted. Fitch downgraded Ford today. Such downgrades drive up Ford's borrowing costs.
Ford said it would raise additional funds through a $3 billion offering of bonds that are convertible into stock under certain terms. The company also plans to trim its dividend to 40 cents from 60 cents. The dividend had been $1.20 a year ago. 
The plan's financial projections assume that Ford, excluding its premium brands like Jaguar, Volvo and Land Rover, will be able to hold its market share steady for the next five years. Given the increasing incursions of Asian automakers in the profitable market for light trucks, analysts say it will be hard for Ford to reverse its market share decline. 
"Stable Ford share is, I think, somewhat unrealistic," said Saul Rubin, an analyst at UBS Warburg. "I think we're going to have to go through a further phase of restructuring." 
Labor officials have not yet agreed to the plan, and the current contract with the United Automobile Workers, which prevents Ford from closing plants, defers much of the cost-cutting. The current contract expires in September of next year. Labor officials will have to be courted aggressively, especially because one of Ford's biggest problems is the declining quality of the cars and trucks coming from its plants.
As Mr. Ford and his new management team presented the plan to analysts today, they offered it as a rejection of the strategies of Ford's previous chief executive, Jacques A. Nasser, even if his name was unspoken. 
Mr. Ford pitched the plan as a "back to basics" approach in which the company would focus again on building reliable cars and trucks. Nicholas V. Scheele, Ford's chief operating officer, said the company aimed to receive $1 billion this year by shedding peripheral businesses acquired during Mr. Nasser's expansive tenure.
Kwik-Fit, a British chain of auto repair shops, could be sold, the company said, and it plans to continue to retreat from Mr. Nasser's online ventures. Hertz is another subsidiary that analysts say is on the block. 
Martin Inglis, Ford's chief financial officer, said the company's troubled financing unit, Ford Credit, would tighten up its credit standards and pull back from loans to customers buying cars from other companies. The moves are aimed at reducing the need for Ford to keep pumping capital into Ford Credit as its loans have ballooned. Ford said it would provide $700 million for Ford Credit today.
Ultimately, Ford's turnaround must be driven by developing cars and trucks that people want and will buy, Mr. Ford said. 
At 44, he is the first Ford family member to run the company since his uncle, Henry Ford II, stepped down in 1979. Today he said he would forgo his salary and bonus this year, and take only stock options as compensation. 
Mr. Ford said this act was a symbol of his confidence in his turnaround plan and his company. 
"If we do get it right, I'll get paid very well on these stock options," he said. "If we don't, I won't get paid. That's a risk I'm willing to take."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
More Loans Between Owners Bring More Denials of Conflicts of Interest

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Bank loans continued to plague Major League Baseball and its contraction plan yesterday, but the commissioner and the owners continued to deny any impropriety. The upshot of the outbreak of loan disclosures may very well be that the owners will change the rule that has created controversy.
 The latest transactions that have come to light are a series of loans made by a financial firm owned by Carl Pohlad, owner of the Minnesota Twins, to a business owned by Jerry McMorris, managing partner of the Colorado Rockies, and a series of loans made to the St. Louis Cardinals by a bank whose largest shareholder is Carl Lindner, managing partner of the Cincinnati Reds. 
 The newest disclosures create questions because of Major League Rule 20 (c), which, under the heading "Conflicting Interests," says that no one from one team may lend money, directly or indirectly, to a member of another team without the loan being disclosed to and approved by the commissioner and the other owners.
"This is a loan we certainly knew about," Commissioner Bud Selig said about the McMorris loan by telephone from Milwaukee. "It was a loan between individuals. None of the Rockies' assets are at all involved." Selig spoke before the loans to the Cardinals surfaced.
Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief lawyer, said he did not see a problem with the McMorris loan either. "It has nothing to do with baseball operations," he said, also speaking without knowledge of the Cardinals' loans.
Selig borrowed $3 million for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1995, when he was president of the team, from a financial company owned by Pohlad.
The commissioner and the other owners might have known about all or some of these loans, but no votes were taken on them. Critics of the practice have not questioned the legitimacy of the loans but the fact that the owners did not vote on them even if they knew about them.
The owners have obviously ignored 20 (c). No one has acknowledged ever having voted on a relevant loan. Several owners have suggested in recent days that it has become increasingly difficult for teams or owners to borrow sizable sums of money from an institution that does not have another owner as an owner.
"The more centralization, the fewer places you can go," one said.
McMorris said, "We may have some rules that need to be refreshed." 
The loan Selig secured from Pohlad instantly created cries of conflict of interest because it has been no secret that the Twins are one of the teams targeted for contraction, and Pohlad would stand to receive more for his team from baseball than he would if he were to sell it.
Selig has labeled the conflict charge as preposterous because, he said, contraction was not his idea initially and it comes more than six years after the loan. But the McMorris loan, which was first reported yesterday in The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, added fuel to the conflict firestorm because McMorris is considered the father of contraction. Selig has said that McMorris was the first owner to propose the idea in 1999.
"He told me I was crazy," McMorris said yesterday by telephone from Denver. "I said, 'If you have a business that's not going well, you can't keep pouring money into it.' I brought it up in the blue-ribbon committee, and Paul Volcker said it's a valid economic theory." Volcker was Alan Greenspan's predecessor as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
McMorris, who owns 11 percent of the Rockies, acknowledged having taken the loans from Pohlad's Builders Mortgage Company for Timnath Farms, his agriculture and land business, one of many businesses besides the Rockies that he owns. 
"It was on the private business side," McMorris said, refusing to divulge the amounts of the loans. "It was arm's length. With an abundance of caution, I cleared it with the commissioner's office. The Colorado Rockies aren't doing any business with Mr. Pohlad. It didn't have anything to do with contraction and it didn't have anything to do with the Minnesota Twins. Mr Pohlad is in that business. He's a banker."
Telephone efforts to reach the principals in the loans to the Cardinals were unsuccessful. Documents on file with the Missouri secretary of state show that Lindner's Provident Bank of Cincinnati made unspecified loans to the Cardinals from 1996 into last year. Lindner, who had been a limited partner in the Reds' ownership, became the chief executive Oct. 1, 1999.
The loans continued to attract attention from Congress yesterday. Representative Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, called for a congressional investigation of baseball's business practices.
In a letter to the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, McCollum said, "Despite M.L.B.'s assurances to play fair with our national pastime, it is clear that the shady and self-serving practices of some owners have clearly run afoul of the expectations of fans and, now, Congress."
John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee, called for Selig to step down as commissioner earlier in the week, then altered his position by saying he would be satisfied if Selig dropped contraction for the coming season.
Conyers said yesterday that he planned to meet with one of Selig's lawyers, presumably DuPuy, next week. Conyers also said he wanted the committee to have a second day of hearings. 
"I had no intentions of calling another one, but Selig was not forthcoming," he said. "He's a great witness. He's very verbose, articulate. He knows a lot, maybe not as much as he thinks he knows, but he's a great witness. He's got lots of answers for everybody, not always to the questions you ask him."

HEADLINE: With Suicide, an Admiral Keeps Command Until the End 

BYLINE:  By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Throughout the fall and winter, Chester Nimitz's daughters kept asking him if he was certain that he was ready to carry out his plan and end his life.
 "I said, 'Are you really going ahead with this?' " said the youngest of his three daughters, Sarah Smith, recalling a family discussion on Christmas Day at her parents' retirement community outside Boston. " 'Why do you have to do it now?' " 
 Her sister Betsy Van Dorn asked her father if he was depressed. "I said, 'You know there are medications like Prozac that can help you with your mood,' " she said. "He said, 'Nah, I'm not depressed.' " 
Chester W. Nimitz Jr., the son of the World War II Pacific fleet admiral, was 86. His wife, Joan, was 89.
His intelligence, decisiveness, confidence and organizational and planning skills had enabled him to rise through the Navy ranks and ultimately to become an admiral, as his father was. He was used to being in charge, aboard the submarines he commanded during World War II, at the technology company where he became chief executive or leading family boating excursions during summers on Cape Cod.
"Nothing was left to chance," said Ms. Smith, 53, who lives in Milton, a Boston suburb. "He made sure everything worked the way he wanted."
The admiral had made it clear to his family for more than a decade that when the time came, he and Joan intended to take charge of their own deaths. "They didn't want to think in any way that their final days would be controlled by some whippersnapper internist at the hospital," said Mr. Nimitz's sister Nancy Nimitz, 82, a retired economist who lives in Topanga, Calif.
As recently as three years ago, her brother was still golfing, gardening with his wife, reading four books at one time, listening to opera, socializing and generally living life so fully that he decided to have quintuple-bypass surgery. 
But in the past year, the couple's growing medical infirmities had begun to control their lives. The admiral, who during World War II had sunk a Japanese destroyer by aiming three torpedoes at its bow as it charged his submarine, was becoming less and less in charge.
He got top medical care, his daughters said, but still he continued to fail. He suffered from congestive heart failure. He had lost 30 pounds because of chronic gastrointestinal problems. He had constant back pain. He kept falling. He was losing his vision. No longer able to drive, he was losing his independence.
Mrs. Nimitz, who had been trained as a dentist in her native England and had spent years raising her daughters alone while her husband was at sea, suffered from osteoporosis so severe that her bones were breaking. She had a painful condition in her feet called neuropathy. She had gone blind, and could no longer enjoy one of her last remaining pleasures, reading.
"She was fed up, and she said it all the time," Ms. Van Dorn said. "When I made her a doctor's appointment for Jan. 13, she said sotto voce, 'I'm not going to be there.' "
Ms. Smith said: "Perhaps some people find strength in spiritual misery. Not them." 
Her father worried that his heart would give out within months, his daughters said, and that his wife would not be able to commit suicide on her own. Ms. Smith said her mother had worried aloud that without her husband's help, she would not be able to take the pills to end her life.
"He said, 'That's the one last thing I have to do for your mother,' " said Ms. Van Dorn, who is 55 and lives in Boston.
And so on Jan. 2, her parents canceled their nighttime nurse and committed suicide with what their daughters said was an overdose of sleeping pills.
In a note commanding that they not be resuscitated, the admiral wrote: "Our decision was made over a considerable period of time and was not carried out in acute desperation. Nor is it the expression of a mental illness. We have consciously, rationally, deliberately, and of our own free will taken measures to end our lives today because of the physical limitations on our quality of life placed upon us by age, failing vision, osteoporosis, back pain and painful orthopedic problems."
Experts on aging suggest that the Nimitz case is unusual. Most suicides among the elderly are driven by factors like disease, depression, social isolation and poverty, said Thomas R. Cole, a Houston gerontologist and medical humanist. With the proper help, he said, such suicides can be avoided.
Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, a professor at Yale and the author of "How We Die," said "In something like five out of six cases, if a physician is able to sit down and ask people why they really want to die, they can solve their problems with modern medicine or psychological help."
The admiral, though, had planned his last act down to the smallest detail. He had waited until after the New Year so that he could write tax-exempt checks to his children, their husbands and grandchildren dated Jan. 2, Ms. Smith said. He had left meticulous records in a file labeled "When CWN Dies."
During a family get-together on New Year's Day at her parents' apartment, Ms. Smith said, there was no explicit mention of what was to happen, and no formal goodbyes.
"We hugged them and gave them kisses," Ms. Smith said. "Betsy said something like, 'You've been wonderful parents.' They didn't want emotion. They were of a generation that didn't obsess and discuss issues."
Ms. Smith and Ms. Van Dorn had visited their parents several times a week. A third daughter, Frances, 60, who lives in Virginia, was in frequent contact. Their parents never asked their help in ending their lives, Ms. Van Dorn said. And the daughters knew better than to try to dissuade them. "They did what they wanted to do," Ms. Van Dorn said. 
The daughters are understanding and even admiring of the decision. "I think it was very unselfish of my parents to do what they did," Ms. Van Dorn said.
Mrs. Nimitz had discussed her plans to take control of her own death years ago with her sister, Barbara Beard. "I said, 'I wish I could get the pills,' " Mrs. Beard, who is 82 and lives in England, said in a telephone interview.
The Nimitzes did not believe in any afterlife or God, and embraced no religion. But one of Mr. Nimitz's three surviving sisters, Mary Aquinas, 70, is a Catholic nun with a Dominican order in California. Sister Mary said that she could not condone her brother's decision to end his life, but that she still felt sympathetic.
"If you cannot see any value to suffering for yourself or others," she said, 'then maybe it does make sense to end your life.'

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INVESTIGATION; 
Man Charged With Lying About Radio Device in Room

BYLINE:  By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
An Egyptian student who was staying in a hotel room with a view of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 was charged yesterday with lying to federal investigators about an aviation radio that was found in the room's safe.
 The student, Abdallah Higazy, 30, was arrested on Dec. 17 after he returned to the Millenium Hilton Hotel to collect his belongings, investigators said. The hotel, across the street from the trade center site, has been closed since the attack. 
 After a brief hearing, Mr. Higazy was ordered held without bail by United States Magistrate Judge Frank Maas of Manhattan. In denying bail, Judge Maas said that the government appears to have a "very strong case" against Mr. Higazy, and that he has "a substantial incentive to flee a community he doesn't have substantial ties with." 
Mr. Higazy, the son of a former Egyptian diplomat in Washington, was educated largely in the United States, according to his court-appointed lawyer, Robert S. Dunn. At least 20 people have come forward to testify on Mr. Higazy's behalf since his arrest, Mr. Dunn said. His parents now live in Egypt, and a brother lives in Ithaca, N.Y., he said.
Mr. Dunn said his client never lied to federal agents and does not know how the aviation radio -- which can be used for air-to-air and air-to-ground communications -- got into the safe in his hotel room.
Mr. Higazy arrived in the United States on Aug. 27 with a student visa arranged through the Institute for International Education, in conjunction with the United States Agency for International Development, Mr. Dunn said. The institute had arranged for Mr. Higazy to stay at the Millenium for a month while he looked for housing and began his studies at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, Mr. Dunn said.
The hotel was evacuated shortly after the planes hit the twin towers, and has remained closed. Security officers began removing personal property from the rooms, and in early October, an officer entered Room 5101, the corner room with the view of the World Trade Center where Mr. Higazy had been staying, according to documents filed in court by prosecutors.
In the locked security safe, the officer found an air-band transceiver on top of a number of other items, including Mr. Higazy's passport and an Arabic book, the documents said. The transceiver was described as a hand-held radio marketed for use by pilots.
Mr. Higazy was arrested on Dec. 17 when he returned to the hotel. F.B.I. agents showed him the transceiver, according to the court filings, and he said it was not his. He also said that he had never seen it before, he could not even guess what it was, and it could not have been found in his room, according to the filing.
Agents arrested him as a material witness and took him to the F.B.I. office in Lower Manhattan, where he told agents that he had repaired radios for the Egyptian Air Corps that were used by pilots to communicate with people on the ground, the court documents said.
Mr. Higazy, who has been in custody since Dec. 17, said little in court yesterday, except to answer the judge with a clear "Yes, Sir," when asked whether he had accurately filled out a form claiming that he had no money to pay a lawyer.
In arguing for bail, Mr. Dunn said that his client had "a long, stable relationship with the United States" and many friends in the country and no criminal background. The government's case is circumstantial, Mr. Dunn said, and suggested that things were so chaotic at the Millenium Hotel after Sept. 11 that someone else could have entered Mr. Higazy's room and placed the radio device in the safe.
Dan Himmelfarb, an assistant United States attorney, argued that Mr. Higazy lied about the radio in three separate interviews with federal agents and attempted to obstruct an investigation of "the most serious crime in the nation's history."
An aviation radio on the 51st floor of a building across that street from the World Trade Center, Mr. Himmelfarb said, "is potentially a quite significant part of that investigation."
A spokesman for Polytechnic University confirmed that Mr. Higazy had enrolled at the school in a master's degree program in computer engineering. The Institute for International Education did not return telephone calls about Mr. Higazy. According to its Web site, it administers over 250 programs for the State Department, the agency for International Development, private companies and aid organizations.
Mr. Higazy is to appear in Manhattan federal court for a preliminary hearing on Jan. 28.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE POLITICS; 
Parties Weigh Political Price Of Enron's Fall

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Concern that the escalating Enron inquiry could ensnare the White House has rattled some Republicans in Congress, who said they were not yet willing to defend the administration while so many facts were still unknown but who warned Democrats against trying to use the case for partisan advantage.
 In interviews, many Republicans said they were hopeful that the investigations would conclude that administration officials had done nothing wrong. But they were approaching the matter warily because so many questions remained unanswered. 
 "The danger here is if somebody acted in a capacity for the administration and the administration cut them a special favor," said Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. "Then you have an issue. So far, there's no evidence of that. But we have a responsibility to take a look." 
Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, said that while he would be surprised if there was a finding of wrongdoing by the White House: "I don't think this goes away. We have to go to where this leads us. It doesn't matter if it's a cabinet secretary or a line worker in the White House."
Mr. Foley added, "When the front page described a presidential link, it's not helpful."
Already, the publicity over Enron has unnerved Republican politicians as Mr. Bush tries to keep the public rallied behind the war and his plans for the economy, and his party is gearing up for midterm elections. With the prospect of Congressional hearings, the distraction is likely to continue for some time.
"This is counterproductive to us keeping focused on what we need to keep focused on," said Mike McDaniel, chairman of the Republican Party in Indiana. "We still have men and women out there putting their lives on the line. But the Democrats are ramping it up to make it an issue in the campaign."
Indeed, Democrats are savoring what some describe as the biggest opening they have had to portray Mr. Bush and his party as pawns of special interests. Several party leaders said their strategy was to not appear crassly political by attacking the White House. Instead, they intend to sit back quietly, expressing sympathy for workers and investors hurt by Enron's collapse as Republicans face a cascade of questions.
"The strategy is going to be to let the investigation take its course and not to dial it up politically," said one Democratic Party official. "If your enemy is shooting themselves in the foot, you let them."
Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic Party chairman, followed just that course in an interview, saying, "This issue does not need any fuel from Terry McAuliffe. It has enough on its own. So I'm going to stay right out of it."
The Democrats also could be restrained by the disclosure today that Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and now a top executive at Citigroup, had called a senior Treasury official to ask whether he would consider asking a bond-rating firm to hold off on downgrading Enron's debt, a move that could cost Citigroup millions of dollars. The Treasury official, Peter Fisher, a Democrat, said he would not intercede.
Another reason Democrats said they were treading carefully is that Enron was also a generous donor to Democrats, including Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan. In fact, Republicans plan to portray the Enron collapse as a bipartisan disaster.
"It's a little difficult for the Democrats to point their fingers," said former Representative Bill Paxon, a New York Republican who is close to the White House.
Tad Devine, a top strategist for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential campaign, conceded: "Our party has to be careful in the way we pursue it. The Republicans demonstrated in the 90's that if you are overzealous in political persecution, you'll pay a price."
But Mr. Devine asserted that Enron's donations to Democrats would not deter his party from making it a campaign issue. "Sure, Democrats received money from Enron," Mr. Devine said. "But the locus of support Bush had, with Enron being out of his home state, could make this a very big problem for him."
The White House is clearly on the defensive. Today, for perhaps the first time in her tenure as Vice President Dick Cheney's counselor, Mary Matalin was in full political tilt. She and other Republicans invoked Clinton scandals -- including his affair with a White House intern -- as they defended their own president.
Appearing this morning on the Don Imus radio program, Ms. Matalin said critics "act like there's some billing records or some cattle scam or some fired travel aides or some blue dress."
The president himself has also been on the defensive, putting some distance between himself and Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of Enron, by saying that Mr. Lay had supported Ann Richards, the former Democratic governor of Texas, over him in the 1994 campaign.
Besides trying to stoke questions about the Democrats, the White House approach is to make the point that the president has nothing to hide.
"If anybody else wants to focus on politics, that's their prerogative," said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary. "But the president's focus is on getting to the bottom of this fully" by supporting a thorough criminal investigation and policy review.
Asked if the Enron affair and the resulting investigations could dog the president throughout the year, Mr. Fleischer said: "This dog won't hunt. That's a reference to the politics of it."
Yet the unfolding Enron case has already set off a frenzy of finger-pointing among Republicans, some of whom have raised questions about the role of Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, and Donald L. Evans, the Commerce secretary.
One senior adviser to the White House said: "The administration wanted this to be the week of the president's bipartisan education bill and continued success in the war in Afghanistan and beginning of a pivot to the State of the Union. I don't think the Sunday shows are going to spend a lot of time talking about the education bill. Do you? It's all Enron all the time now."
Another adviser to the White House said that while the accusations from some Democrats were overheated, he feared that "nothing is going to keep people from frothing about this, and it gets the president off message and makes him reactive."
Some Democrats who worked in the Clinton administration and endured years of scandals were privately celebrating the latest turn for Mr. Bush.
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said the Enron case could be beneficial as his party's candidates make the case this fall that Republicans are a party of special interests and big business.
"This is a story about a powerful and well-connected corporation hurting average people and it goes to the heart of how voters see the differences between Republicans and Democrats," Mr. Garin said. He conducted a nationwide poll last week, he said, which found that "already over 60 percent of the electorate know about the Enron situation."
An element of the Democrats' strategy is to depict the Democrats as the only party willing to pass laws to protect workers at companies like Enron.
Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, a Democrat, framed it as an economic matter. "It's a potentially big issue," she said. "Everyone who has watched what's happened to the employees of Enron who have lost all their retirement savings while management cashed out is very concerned."
Tom Cole, a former chief of staff for the Republican Party, put forth his concern: "The real question is, was there something given to Enron that was inappropriate? I don't have the answer to that."
But, Mr. Cole added, "If Whitewater didn't help us, I don't think Enron's going to help them. The politics of scandal have not been successful in tipping the partisan balance of power in Washington during the Clinton administration And particularly in the wake of Sept. 11, this stuff seems pretty trivial."

But Enron also contributed heavily to the campaigns of many Democrats, including, from left, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan. As a result, some Republicans said they would portray the company's influence as bipartisan. (Susana Raab for The New York Times); (Associated Press); (Associated Press)(pg.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
With Losing Week, This Year's Gains Are Largely Gone

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, completing their first losing week in three, after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said there were "significant risks" that an economic recovery would fail to take hold.
 Tyco International Ltd., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Citigroup Inc. helped lead the decline as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index erased its year-to-date gain. 
 "Stocks were on a tenuous footing to begin with," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank. "This new guarded view of the economy may push investors toward bonds" and out of stocks. 
 The S.& P. 500 fell 10.95 points, or 1 percent, to 1,145.60. The Nasdaq composite index lost 24.78 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,022.46. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 80.33 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,987.53.
 For the week, the S.& P. 500 dropped 2.3 percent and the Dow fell 2.7 percent, also wiping out its gain for the year. Year-to-date, the S.& P. 500 has lost 0.2 percent and the Dow 0.3 percent.
 The Nasdaq shed 1.8 percent this week, paring its gain for 2002 to 3.7 percent.
 Stocks, which bounced between gains and losses much of the day, dropped after Mr. Greenspan said in a speech to the Bay Area Council Conference in San Francisco that "it is still premature to conclude that the forces restraining economic activity here and abroad have abated enough to allow a steady recovery to take hold."
 Treasuries surged as the comments increased speculation the Fed might cut interest rates a 12th time in 13 months. The 10-year Treasury note rose 26/32, to a price of 101 1/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.86 percent from 4.97 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32, to 100 3/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.37 percent from 5.41 percent on Thursday.
Companies that have benefited most from the Nasdaq's 44 percent rally since September dropped, including Cisco Systems and the Nvidia Corporation.
 "We are worried that all this money flowed into the group," said Adam Friedman, a manager of the $700 million Armada Large Cap Value fund. "Valuations were getting high, and we have made quite a bit of money in them. We still like tech, but it's more prudent to take chips off the table."
 About 70 percent of 50 technology stocks studied are too expensive given their earnings prospects, an analyst for Merrill Lynch, Steve Milunovich, wrote in a report.
 Microsoft would have to increase profit 94 percent to justify its price, Mr. Milunovich said. Analysts expect 16 percent growth. Comverse Technology and Maxim Integrated Products would have to increase earnings 57 percent and 98 percent, he calculated. Wall Street's consensus calls for their profit to decline 11 percent and 36 percent, respectively.
 Cisco, the largest maker of networking equipment, fell 79 cents, to $20.21. The stock had soared 73 percent since Sept. 21. Business Week quoted a Harvard Business School professor in its Jan. 21 issue as saying the company's accounting practices obscure how much Cisco actually made in the 1990's.
 Nvidia, the maker of computer graphics chips, lost $2.92, to $63.07. It has rallied 145 percent since mid-September and was the top-performing stock in the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq 100 last year.
 Tyco, a diversified manufacturing company that is the biggest maker of electronic controls, dropped $2.72, to $52.20; Wal-Mart, lost $1.20 to $55.80; and Citigroup, the financial services company, fell 78 cents, to $49.07.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sounds Note Of Caution On Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday that the economy was not yet out of danger, injecting a powerful voice of caution into a growing consensus on Wall Street that a recovery is imminent or already under way.
 Mr. Greenspan's comments suggested that the Fed could cut its main short-term interest rate once again early this year and that rates might remain low for longer than many investors had expected. Stocks fell and bond prices rose after his remarks. 
 "I would emphasize that we continue to face significant risks in the near term," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech to a civic group in San Francisco. Corporate profits and investment remain weak, unemployment could continue rising for some time, and household spending will be slowed by a number of factors, he said.
"It is still premature," he said, "to conclude that the forces restraining economic activity here and abroad have abated enough to allow a steady recovery to take hold."
But Mr. Greenspan also noted that the nation's economic condition had improved somewhat in recent months, as the pace of job losses dropped off and companies made considerable progress in working off bloated inventories of goods and supplies. He also emphasized his confidence that technological advances had fundamentally improved the economy's productivity, allowing growth over the longer term to be faster than it was in the past. 
"There are sound reasons for concluding that the long-run picture remains bright, and even recent signals about the current course of the economy have turned from unremittingly negative through the late fall of last year to a far more mixed set of signals," Mr. Greenspan said.
Over all, Mr. Greenspan provided a relatively downbeat assessment of the economy's immediate prospects. In doing so, he appeared to signal his intention to support at least one more rate cut to cap off a yearlong campaign of aggressive monetary easing. Since last January, the Fed has lowered its benchmark federal funds target rate -- which directly affects many small-business, credit card and automobile loans -- by 4.75 percentage points, to 1.75 percent.
The Fed next meets at the end of this month and then again in March. After the speech, investors switched course and began betting in the futures market that another quarter-point rate cut was now more likely than not.
But Mr. Greenspan, and the handful of other Fed officials who spoke publicly this week, may have a second motive, too: trying to talk down long-term bond rates. 
Those rates, which guide interest rates on mortgages and many other business and consumer loans, have shot up in recent months on the assumption that the economy would rebound strongly this year and the Fed would soon begin jacking up the short-term rates it controls.
"It seems as if they decided the market needed new guidance," said David Orr, the chief economist at Wachovia Securities. "They're trying to walk the fine line between saying, 'the recession has probably ended' and 'the recovery is probably not going to be as strong as the consensus thinks.' "
For more than a month, many Fed officials have said that they expect this year's recovery to be more modest than most investors and Wall Street economists do, and the spate of recent speeches generally reinforced that message.
"The real question is whether the consumer will stay the course long enough to revive business investment," Cathy Minehan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said during a speech yesterday in East Hartford, Conn. "And here one can reasonably have doubts."
Ms. Minehan said she was skeptical that household spending would rise as much as it normally did in the wake of a recession, given how much money consumers have spent in recent months on homes, cars and other big-ticket items. The rise in mortgage rates last year caused refinancings to decline recently.
Without a jump in consumer spending, Mr. Greenspan said, companies would not begin to rebuild the inventories they have reduced in the last year and would refrain from investing heavily in new equipment.
If the Fed officials were in fact trying to push down long-term rates, they succeeded, at least initially. After Mr. Greenspan's speech, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds dropped to 4.86 percent from 4.97 percent. 
But Mr. Greenspan's cautionary remarks also seemed to give investors reason to worry that corporate profits were not on the verge of a recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.33 points to close at 9,987.53, falling below 10,000 for the first time since Dec. 20.
Investors and economists have become increasingly confident that the recession that began last March is nearly over, a view reflected in a 24.6 percent rise in the Dow average from its recent low on Sept. 21 to its latest peak on Jan. 4. This week, Goldman, Sachs, which had one of the more pessimistic forecasts on Wall Street, reversed its view, predicting the economy would grow at an annual rate of 2 percent this quarter rather than shrinking at a 1 percent rate.
Despite his cautious short-term outlook, Mr. Greenspan continued to express optimism about the economy's long-term prospects. He again said that new technology had given companies better information about their businesses and had made the economy more efficient. This in turn has allowed the country to produce more with less and to grow more quickly than it once did without generating inflation.
"The implicit message," Mr. Orr of Wachovia Securities said, "is that in 2002, despite a recovery, we won't see upwards inflation pressure that would require sharp tightening by the Fed."
Many economists remain uncertain of how large and how permanent the improvement in productivity will prove to be. Last year, the government significantly reduced earlier estimates of productivity growth in the late 1990's, giving weight to the skeptical argument that much of the improvement was a result of a financial bubble and, ultimately, unsustainable.
But Mr. Greenspan, if anything, seems to have become more certain that his view is correct.
"Until last year, the hypothesis of an accelerated productivity trend had not been tested in the contracting phase of a business cycle," he said yesterday. "Recent developments have provided that test, and the early returns certainly look favorable to the hypothesis."
Despite the recession, productivity growth has been higher in recent months that it was for much of the 1980's and early 1990's.
Mr. Greenspan also said the economy should get a boost this year from increased government spending and the tax cuts that will kick in as part of the tax legislation President Bush signed last year. But he also seemed to warn the administration and Congress not to overdo it with additional spending or new tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Russian Court Orders Dissolution of Independent TV Network 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
For much of last year, Russia's popular independent NTV television network wasted away in an endless legal battle, victim of what was variously called a Kremlin crusade to snuff out a free press, a corporate blood feud and an utterly impenetrable intrigue. 
 As if Russians needed proof, a Moscow court made it clear today that the TV-6 television network, the scrawny heir to NTV's legacy and some of its most famous journalists, was riding a gurney down the same path. 
 The Moscow Higher Arbitration Court ordered the network's owners to start immediately liquidating the company, overturning a two-week-old court ruling that had annulled an earlier liquidation order in this latest, seemingly endless legal war. 
Today's ruling was a major defeat for Boris Berezovsky, the financier and onetime Kremlin insider who controls the network from self-imposed exile in London. Mr. Berezovsky, a vociferous critic of President Vladimir V. Putin, has long been under federal investigation for his dealings during the wild early days of Russian capitalism. 
TV-6 lawyers and managers assailed the decision, which not only was unexpected and swift, but was based on a law that had expired with the new year. They said they would appeal the ruling to Russia's Constitutional Court, the nation's supreme legal authority, and perhaps to the European Court on Human Rights. 
While TV-6 officially has six months to complete its liquidation -- and therefore to carry on its legal fight -- many experts, and the journalists themselves, said the network's fate was preordained, and bleak. Civil liberties groups expressed fear that the decision signaled an erosion of the news media's freedom in a nation where two of the three major television networks are state-run, and the third is owned by a state-controlled monopoly. 
"These strange seesaw decisions are similar to a controlled nuclear chain reaction, whereby the eventual outcome is absolutely clear," Aleksei Simonov, a human rights advocate and president of the Foundation for the Protection of Glasnost, told a Moscow radio station today. "The only thing that matters is when." 
The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said the United States took "a very dim view" of today's court ruling. "It adds to the already strong appearance of political pressure in the judicial process against Russia's independent media," he said. "We continue to believe that the development and protection of an independent media are essential for Russia's political and economic development, and that freedom of the press and promotion of the rule of law are best served by allowing TV-6 to remain on the air." 
Mr. Berezovsky, interviewed from London today on the Moscow radio station Echo Moscow, called the ruling part of a concerted Kremlin attempt to take control of the national media. "The authorities are fighting for their survival, for their existence, and those who disagree with the authorities are fighting against them," he said. 
Mr. Berezovsky broadly suggested that the struggles over both TV-6 and NTV were part of a state-directed plot to control the flow of information, and to suppress independent reporting on crimes committed by Russia's special services. 
As he has before, Mr. Berezovsky threatened to release what he said was a cache of documents proving that government agents plotted and carried out the 1999 bombings of apartment houses in Moscow and Volgodonsk, killing more than 300 people. 
The bombings, which have been attributed to terrorists from the separatist province of Chechnya, rallied public support for a war against guerrillas there that continues to this day. 
But Mr. Berezovsky has yet to offer any evidence to back such claims. Other experts say that even if the battle over TV-6 is politically tinged, the fight may center less on press freedom than on whether corporate forces with insider connections can seize control of the channel's potentially lucrative broadcast license. 
The Kremlin declined to comment on the court decision. 
The travails of TV-6 uncannily resemble those of NTV, which until last summer was controlled by another sharp Kremlin critic, Vladimir Gusinsky, who is also under criminal investigation and also lives in self-imposed exile, in Spain. 
Both networks were attacked under the same obscure law, now expired, that essentially permits shareholders to demand dissolution of companies that do not turn a profit based on a complex formula pegged to their stock value. Legal experts say the law has not been applied in any other case of note. 
Mr. Gusinsky's nemesis was Gazprom, the vast state-controlled natural gas company that had financedmuch of his news media empire and eventually took it over. Mr. Berezovsky's is Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, a political force in its own right and a minority shareholder in TV-6. 
While Mr. Gusinsky's empire was mired in debt, however, the managers of TV-6 contend that the company has begun churning out a profit since some of Mr. Gusinsky's managers and journalists fled to the channel after losing control of NTV.
The network's lawyer, Geralina Lyubarskaya, said in an interview today that the courts have refused to consider the network's current balance sheet, relying instead on the company's finances at the time the court battle began. 
The latest ruling is all the more curious, she said, because the law was changed on Jan. 1 as part of a larger overhaul of the financial code. Because the previous liquidation order had been annulled on Dec. 29, two days before the new year, the entire case became moot when the old law lapsed, she argued.
Today's ruling was handed down in an unscheduled session of the Higher Arbitration Court one day after the court's deputy chairman protested the Dec. 29 decision. Ms. Lyubarsakaya said that such reviews usually required months to process. 
"From a professional standpoint, as a lawyer, I am someone who cannot work without respect for the judicial system," she said. "But I have lost this respect, and for me, it is a professional drama."

HEADLINE: Eisenhower in Kabul 

BYLINE:  By Douglas Brinkley; Douglas Brinkley is director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies and professor of history at the University of New Orleans.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
There is speculation now about whether President Bush will visit Afghanistan once the American bombing campaign ceases and the new government is established in Kabul. If he does go, he will not be the first American president to make the journey. On Dec. 9, 1959, Dwight D. Eisenhower, while on a goodwill mission to Central Asia and the Middle East, made a pilgrimage to Kabul. There, he met with the eager, 45-year-old Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah -- the same king many now would like to see return from exile to reclaim the throne in Kabul. 
 Eisenhower had long been eager to visit that strange and forbidding land. "It was a boyhood dream of his to see the Khyber Pass and size up how tough their soldiers were," Gen. Andrew Goodpaster, who served as Eisenhower's assistant on that trip, recently recalled. On the morning of Dec. 9, Eisenhower, who had been in Karachi to discuss Pakistan's troublesome relationship with India with President Mohammad Ayub Khan, flew from Pakistan to Bagram Airport, 38 miles from Kabul. The flight, as reported by Russell Baker in The Times, was harrowing: as the president's jet swooped across the snow-capped peaks dividing Pakistan from Afghanistan and prepared to land, "six Soviet MIG-17's flown by Afghan pilots streaked out to escort it in." This was no accident: Soviet aid had been pouring into the country since 1955, when Nikita Khrushchev had visited. The Kremlin was eager to give Ike a little reminder that it was in charge in this supposedly neutral nation. This was just the beginning of one of the most curious days of Eisenhower's presidency. 
 Winter had set in on this landlocked nation of 12 million and the temperature was near freezing, yet tens of thousands of villagers lined the route from the airport to Kabul. Zahir Shah, looking like a boyish stand-in for Charles de Gaulle, escorted him down the route (now paved by the Soviets) that had been traveled by Alexander the Great, the Persians and Genghis Khan. Many of the tribesmen cheering at the roadside had been waiting for hours, warming themselves over small bonfires. "Faces were weather-beaten, often hidden by full beards and turbans, more than faintly similar to biblical pictures of the time of Abraham," Eisenhower later wrote in his memoir, "Waging Peace." "Few, if any, women were present." 
Once at Chilstoon Palace, Eisenhower and the king talked for five hours, with Eisenhower raising concerns over the Afghan monarchy accepting so much Soviet aid and the king asking for more than the $145 million in economic assistance that the United States had already promised him for building roads, a new airport in Kandahar and dams, and for training teachers.
Besides making a plea for more money, the king also hoped that Eisenhower could intervene with two difficult problems: improving Afghanistan's relationship with Pakistan and helping to solve a prickly water dispute between Afghanistan and Iran. According to the declassified report on the Eisenhower-Zahir Shah meeting, the president told the king that "nothing was easy these days" and that he was "not a mediator" but would "do what he could." 
General Goodpaster remembers talking to Ike as the president's plane finally left Afghan soil. The president liked Zahir Shah but his mind was not on cold war politics or economic aid. (The joint communique issued by the two leaders said little of substance, mainly noting that the trip "had strengthened the already warm and friendly relations between the two countries.") Instead, Eisenhower was most interested in the chanting tribesmen he had seen and the desolate majesty of the Hindu Kush. As General Goodpaster recalls, Ike considered the Afghans "the most determined lot he had ever encountered."

HEADLINE: German Right Backs Bavarian to Run Against Schroder 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
The populist and experienced governor of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber, will lead the conservative opposition parties in their effort to defeat Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's Social Democrats in elections in September.
 Mr. Stoiber's rival, Angela Merkel, the leader of the larger Christian Democratic Union, bowed to the inevitable today and announced that she was withdrawing from the race. 
 Her own party's leaders urged her privately to concede, arguing that Mr. Stoiber, 60, had a better chance to unseat Mr. Schroder and that further infighting would only damage the opposition's chances and her own prospects. 
Mr. Stoiber, fiercely conservative, is considered an excellent economic manager of the country's most prosperous state at a time when Germany is sinking into recession and the number of unemployed is close to four million.
The stagnant economy makes Mr. Schroder, a shrewd politician and an excellent television campaigner, vulnerable, but the campaign is expected to be bruising.
Ms. Merkel, 47, the first woman and first easterner to lead a major party, was gracious in defeat. She met Mr. Stoiber, the leader of the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, for breakfast, then spent much of the day telling confidants that she would pull back.
"I have always said the chancellor candidate of the conservatives should be the person who has the greatest chance of victory," she said at a nationally televised news conference in Magdeburg, in eastern Germany, during a meeting of her Christian Democrats.
"Together with Edmund Stoiber," she said, "I will do my part so that these chances of victory are not just a possibility but also a reality, and I shall do this with passion and deep conviction."
Ms. Merkel appeals strongly to moderates, women and voters in the east, constituencies with whom Mr. Stoiber is relatively weak. But she was never able to put her stamp on her own party, which is still suffering from a slush fund scandal that broke two years ago and tainted the reputation of her mentor, the former chancellor, Helmut Kohl.
Mr. Stoiber will have to fight not only Mr. Schroder, but the received political wisdom here. Bavarians are regarded with envy and suspicion as successful provincials, rather like Texans in America. And there has been a traditional cultural divide between the mostly Protestant north and Catholic south, which includes Bavaria.
The only Bavarian leader to run for the chancellorship until now, Franz-Josef Strauss, lost to Helmut Schmidt in 1980 and was considered a kind of sacrifice to an inevitable victory by a coalition of the Social Democrats and Free Democrats.
But this time Mr. Schroder is allied with the Greens, who have been losing popularity and may not even win the 5 percent of the vote required to get into Parliament.
Recent opinion surveys have shown Mr. Schroder losing ground, with the Social Democrats and the conservatives each polling 39 percent, according to the Electoral Research Group for ZDF television.
"The conservatives' standing has improved considerably," said Dieter Roth, of the polling firm. Mr. Schroder's party had held a four-point lead for the last six months or so.
Head-to-head, Mr. Schroder, 57, is more popular than Mr. Stoiber. But while an American style of personal campaigning is becoming more widespread, voters still cast their ballots for parties, not people.
Now that the conservatives have chosen their standard-bearer, the race will get more serious. This evening Mr. Stoiber issued a statement in Munich attacking Mr. Schroder for failing to produce the kind of economic reforms required to end the current slump, especially in the formerly Communist eastern states, where unemployment is high.
"Because we can only have prosperity, social and internal security together in Germany, I will do all I can to make sure that the new states are no longer uncoupled but can catch up," Mr. Stoiber said.
He plans to focus on widespread perceptions of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration as well. Mr. Stoiber has also emphasized a tougher stance on internal security since it was discovered that the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States were planned by Arabs living in Hamburg.
The sudden rise of a law-and-order party in Hamburg state elections earlier this autumn shocked German politicians. The leader of the party, a local judge named Ronald Schill, threatened to run nationwide unless Mr. Stoiber was the conservative candidate, an important argument used quietly against Ms. Merkel.
The conservatives are bound to attack Mr. Schroder for allowing his party in Berlin to go into coalition with the Party of Democratic Socialism, the direct descendant of the East German Communist Party, which built the Berlin Wall.
Mr. Schroder's efforts to move his own party to the center, where most elections are won, has allowed some room on his left that the former Communists are trying to fill behind their witty leader, Gregor Gysi. But Mr. Schroder is likely to paint Mr. Stoiber as a kind of provincial preacher, inexperienced internationally and with dangerous ideas.
Mr. Stoiber, who was Mr. Strauss's campaign manager in 1980, has toughness and political skill. He is known in the popular press as "the blond hatchet" or "the Bavarian pit bull," and is considered more a stiff Prussian than a fun-loving Bavarian.
He studied law before joining the Bavarian Ministry of Development and Environment in 1971 and has worked in the government ever since.
Mr. Stoiber "is like a crocodile that appears to lie listless in the mud and then, when his prey is within reach, strikes like lightning and without mercy," wrote the liberal Bavarian daily Suddeutsche Zeitung. "In questions of power, Stoiber has an infallible sense for the right timing and a brutality with which he always catches unaware even friends within the party."
Mr. Stoiber's best endorsement will be the economic performance of Bavaria, where unemployment is at 5 percent, half the national average, and where a prosperous lifestyle is matched with a crime rate that is second-lowest in the country.
Bavaria was a poor agricultural state at the end of World War II, but the Christian Social Union has built a business-friendly state with some of the best schools in Germany and has used billions in privatization proceeds to finance new businesses and "clusters" for new industries.

With the Justice Department and Congress ratcheting up investigations into the Enron Corporation, President Bush is seeking to play down his relationship with Enron's embattled chairman, Kenneth L. Lay. But their ties are broad and deep and go back many years, and the relationship has been beneficial to both.
 In the Oval Office yesterday, Mr. Bush said that Mr. Lay "was a supporter of Ann Richards in my run in 1994" for governor of Texas and that he first got to know Mr. Lay after that race. 
 But Mr. Lay appears to have been a bigger supporter of Mr. Bush in that race, as he and his wife, Linda, contributed $37,500 to the Bush gubernatorial campaign -- three times the amount, according to a database maintained by The Dallas Morning News, that they donated to Ms. Richards. Mr. Lay has also told interviewers that prior to that election he had become "very close" to Mr. Bush. 
Since the two men met over a decade ago, Mr. Lay and his company have been the most generous campaign donors in Mr. Bush's political career. At the same time, Mr. Bush was a strong advocate of many of the issues most important to Enron, like deregulating electricity markets and curbing large civil jury awards.
In all, Enron and Mr. Lay have given more than $550,000 to Mr. Bush's various campaigns. And for the Bush-Cheney inaugural, Enron, Mr. Lay, and the former Enron chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, each donated $100,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Last year, Mr. Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney, who was heading a task force on energy policy. The task force's recommendations conformed with much of what the company had sought in its meeting with Mr. Cheney -- but they were also positions embraced by others in industry and government.
With the collapse of Enron amid an accounting scandal, Democrats are seeking to make Mr. Bush's friendship with Mr. Lay into a political liability. The White House, in turn, in seeking to distance the administration from both Mr. Lay and Enron, has said that officials spurned Mr. Lay's personal entreaties for assistance as Enron faltered late last year.
Backers of Mr. Bush note there has never been a showing that Mr. Bush altered any policy solely to satisfy Mr. Lay. And at times, Mr. Bush has taken positions adverse to Enron, like backing away from curbing carbon dioxide emissions, an idea backed by Enron, which sought to generate new business through trading emissions credits. 
On Thursday, after the disclosure that the Justice Department had created a task force to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron, Mr. Bush told reporters he "first got to know" Mr. Lay after being elected governor in 1994. In that race, Enron, Mr. Lay and other Enron executives were significant contributors to Mr. Bush, donating a total of $146,500 to Mr. Bush, according to Texans for Public Justice, a group that tracks campaign contributions. 
At the time, Mr. Lay was already serving on an advisory body, the Governor's Business Council, that was created by Ms. Richards. Mr. Bush said on Thursday that after he defeated Ms. Richards he kept Mr. Lay on the advisory panel. "I decided to leave him in place, just for the sake of continuity." 
Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, said yesterday, "President Bush's explanation of his relationship to Enron is at best a half truth. He was in bed with Enron before he ever held a political office."
Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman, challenged that characterization last night. "The White House has clearly noted that Mr. Lay has been a supporter," Mr. McClellan said. "But Mr. Lay was a supporter of Ann Richards during the 1994 race, and public campaign records clearly reflect his support." 
In an interview last year with The New York Times and the PBS show "Frontline," Mr. Lay characterized his relationship with the Bush family as "very close," adding that the race between Mr. Bush and Ms. Richards placed him in "a little difficult situation."
"I'd worked very closely with Ann Richards also, the four years she was governor," he said in the interview. "But I was very close to George W. and had a lot of respect for him, had watched him over the years, particularly with reference to dealing with his father when his father was in the White House and some of the things he did to work for his father, and so did support him."
By the late 1980's, Mr. Lay, an economist by training, had become a major force in Houston business and social circles as chief executive of Enron, then primarily a natural gas pipeline operator. He also became a significant fund-raiser for Mr. Bush's father and was working to bring the Bush presidential library to Houston. 
In that time, Mr. Lay has said, he got to know the younger Mr. Bush. "That's when I probably spent a little more quality time with George W.," he told The Morning News. Later, Mr. Lay was picked to head the host committee for the 1992 Republican convention in Houston.
But while both Mr. Lay and Enron have historically given far more money to Republicans, they have sought links with prominent Democrats, too. One was President Bill Clinton, who has golfed with Mr. Lay. Another was Ms. Richards, who appointed Mr. Lay to her business advisory panel. 
"We knew at the time that he had a close relationship with Bush," said John Fainter, who served as Ms. Richards's chief of staff in 1993 and 1994. Mr. Lay was a good pick for the panel, he said, because of his involvement in the Houston civic and business community. 
But Mr. Fainter, who runs the electric utility industry's lobbying group in Texas, added: "To say he inherited Ken Lay from Ann Richards, I don't agree with that. As active as he was in his father's presidential campaign, he would have known him."
Ms. Richards did not return a telephone call yesterday, but in a written statement she confirmed that Mr. Lay donated to her 1994 campaign and said that he did "a very good job" while serving as chairman of the Governor's Business Council. 
As governor, Mr. Bush was an advocate of the issue most important to Mr. Lay and Enron, deregulating the utility business. Mr. Bush also appointed Patrick H. Wood III to be chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, an appointment that Mr. Lay had recommended. Mr. Wood is now chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, where he oversaw and supported the imposition last year of electricity price restraints in California opposed by Enron and other unregulated power companies.
Mr. Lay and Mr. Bush appeared to develop a warm relationship during Mr. Bush's tenure as governor. In April 1997, on Mr. Lay's 55th birthday, Mr. Bush sent him a joking note: "One of the sad things about old friends is that they seem to be getting older -- just like you! 55 years old. Wow! That is really old." 
Mr. Bush also has done favors for Mr. Lay, such as later that year when, at Mr. Lay's request, he called Tom Ridge, then the governor of Pennsylvania and now the director of Homeland Security, to vouch for Enron, which was trying to break in to that state's electricity markets. 
But to one Enron official, Mr. Lay swaggered less after Mr. Bush's presidential victory than some other senior Enron executives who liked to brag about the company's ties to the new administration.
"Ken Lay didn't advertise his connections," the official said, "but some of the Enron officials around him did because they didn't have those connections."

HEADLINE: Salaries of Bloomberg's Aides Won't Be Hurt by Budget Cuts 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said that cuts to the city's budget would begin with his office, but apparently he was not referring to salaries for his top aides. Although the mayor will only be earning a dollar a year for his public service, his top advisers will receive the same salary that Rudolph W. Giuliani's advisers did at the end of their term.
 Last August, Mr. Giuliani gave big raises to his deputy mayors -- roughly 8 percent -- making their salaries $168,700 a year. Mr. Bloomberg has passed on that salary to four of his five deputy mayors. Daniel Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development, will also work for $1 a year. 
 During his eight years in office, Mr. Giuliani raised the salaries of his closest aides and various commissioners, often as much as 50 percent. 
Commissioners are paid in a three-tier system, and many in the highest group, which currently pays $162,800, were paid $112,000 in 1994, the year that Mr. Giuliani took office. The consumer price index rose about 16 percent over that time period. 
Mr. Bloomberg's commissioners' salaries will reflect the pay scale under Mr. Giuliani. Some, like fire commissioner, the head of the Human Resources Administration and the health commissioner, will receive the $162,800 annual paycheck, as will Michael A. Cardozo, his corporation counsel.
Others, like the head of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, will be paid $152,500 a year. Some fall into the third category, with salaries of $143,999; they include the head of the Department of Aging and the commissioner for cultural affairs. 
Many of those salaries reflect large raises given by Mayor Giuliani during his term, often as large as 45 percent. 
One compensation expert said that while people who are promoted internally usually have to earn the raises given to their predecessor, outside hires commonly get the same salary or better. 
Rhoda Edelman, a managing director of Pearl Meyer & Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm, said that in the private sector, people hired from the outside are usually paid more than the person they are succeeding. 
Ms. Edelman added that the 8 percent raise awarded the deputy mayors last summer was a fairly high merit raise for a mayor to have given at the end of an administration. "Most merit increases are closer to 4 percent to 5 percent," she said. Mr. Giuliani also raised his own salary 50 percent during his term, from $130,000 to $195,000.
Other mayoral aides are also being paid at the salaries of their counterparts at the end of the Giuliani administration. Peter J. Madonia, Mr. Bloomberg's chief of staff; Vincent A. La Padula, senior adviser; Edward Skyler, press secretary; and William T. Cunningham, director of communications, will each be paid $162,800 a year. 
Mr. Bloomberg said that he knew he would have to compete with the private sector, including his own company, to get some of the people he wanted for his administration. At the same time, on the day he was inaugurated, he vowed to cut 20 percent of his own staff and asked the rest of the city to join him in making financial sacrifices.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Will Call For a Delay In Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Senator Edward M. Kennedy is expected to call next week for a delay in the next round of personal income tax cuts enacted in 2001 as part of President Bush's $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax reduction, Congressional aides said.
 Mr. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, would be the most prominent member of his party so far to call for a delay in Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which Democrats say benefit mostly upper-income taxpayers. Although Democrats have increasingly blamed the tax cuts for the faltering economy, most have been reluctant to call for their rollback or delay, fearful that the president and other Republicans will paint them as the party of higher taxes. 
 The White House has almost dared the Democrats to call for a rollback of the tax cuts. Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said many times this week that as far as Mr. Bush was concerned, any call for a rollback or delay in future tax cuts would be a tax increase. He said today that Mr. Kennedy would be doing "the wrong thing for the country by advocating that we raise taxes on the American people."
Although Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, has said that the tax cut has caused the "most dramatic fiscal deterioration in our nation's history," he has been silent on whether it should be delayed or rescinded. Polls show that many voters blame the Sept. 11 attacks, not Mr. Bush's policies, for the faltering economy. Mr. Daschle is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2004.
The aides said Mr. Kennedy wanted to use the money from any delay in the tax cut for domestic programs, like prescription drug benefits for the elderly and investments in education and health care.
Mr. Kennedy is expected to call for the delay in a speech on Wednesday at the National Press Club.

 BODY:
Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

LILLIAN CACERES
Touch of an Angel
 It's very easy for Lillian Caceres's family to envision her as an angel in heaven. She was very warm and friendly, the kind of sister who would sit at the bedside of someone who was ill or lend a patient ear to someone's problems, said her younger sister Aurea de la Cruz. For 22 years Ms. Caceres, 48, made a point of incorporating her belief in Christ into her daily life, and shared her faith with family and friends, sometimes giving Bibles as gifts.
 And then there's the video.
 On Sept. 10, Ms. Caceres appeared in a play at Gateway Cathedral, a nondenominational church in Staten Island where she taught Sunday school and sang in the choir. In the play, ''Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames,'' Ms. Caceres was one of the angels who greet people in heaven after they have died in such calamities as a car crash, a plane crash or a building collapse. ''It was profound,'' said Ms. de la Cruz, ''because the theme of that whole play is you have to be ready for Christ.''
 On Sept. 11, Ms. Caceres, a technology administrator, was at her desk at Marsh & McLennan at 8 a.m. It was her 11-year-old daughter's first week back at school; Ms. Caceres had asked for the early shift so she could meet her daughter at 4 o'clock.

AARON HORWITZ
Finding Good in a Bad Day
Once, Aaron Horwitz had what most people would consider a supremely lousy day. A friend asked him how he would rate it, from 1 to 10, with 1 the worst.
 ''Eight,'' he replied.
 You could get a contact high from Mr. Horwitz, 24, a bond broker at Cantor Fitzgerald with the almost laughable responsibility of entertaining clients and making them feel like the most important people in the world.
 As if anyone had to pay him. For he was not just a showman, who did the Michael Jackson moonwalk on bar tops and who, at a museum, drew his own masterpiece on a mist-coated window next to a Rembrandt.
 He seized souls, not letting go until he made them merry. He met a guy in a toy store and, moments later, the two were having a hula hoop contest. He insisted a concierge stop weeping over a bad breakup, then called her at 2:30 a.m. to make sure. He sweet-talked hostesses at four-star restaurants into producing tables for eight (and their phone numbers for dates) and persuaded a street masseur to let Mr. Horwitz give him a massage.
 ''You could talk to a brick wall,'' his father told him. Yes, allowed the son, but he preferred chatting with a mirror. He often did so, then fell over, laughing.

BRIAN NUEZ
Coming Into His Own
He was one of those kids who turned his mother, JoAnne Lovett, into a regular apologizer at the principal's office. He's almost a genius, they would say, but would you please send him somewhere else? He's taking care of everyone's business but his own.
 Smart, mischievous and scattered, Brian Nuez took a while to find his footing. He was canny and cool-headed, more logical than emotional. ''Play the cards you were dealt,'' he would remark. He had a comment for everything.
 But in his early 20's, he began settling into himself. He lived in Staten Island and put himself through college. After graduation, he joined eSpeed, a division of Cantor Fitzgerald, as a statistical analyst, work that left him proud and exhausted. At 29, Mr. Nuez was still solid with his mother and two brothers, and had grown into a tall, funny, dependable man with a girlfriend, Donna Corbett, whom he would kiss on the forehead and promise never to leave.
 He was still a prankster, still blunt, still outspoken, but on occasion his heart would tiptoe onto his sleeve. At his brother Eric's wedding, Brian stood to give the best man's toast. And stood. And stood. Overcome with love, he was finally tongue-tied.

MICHAEL A. DIAZ-PIEDRA III
Playing Soldier
He called his basement the war room and filled it with an array of military uniforms from around the world. He kept about 30 on mannequins; there were another 100 on racks, but they didn't just sit there. Michael A. Diaz-Piedra III loved to wear them, whether at an elaborate Halloween masquerade party or birthday parties for his son Michael, now 6.
 ''The uniforms called attention to him, and he liked that,'' said his wife, Kelly. The plumes and swords also gave Mr. Diaz-Piedra an opening to talk about the historic periods that so fascinated him. 
 In fact, he was crazy about all kinds of vintage things, Mrs. Diaz-Piedra said, including old cars. This gave him a kind of Old World romanticism that fit his background as son of a wealthy Cuban plantation owner exiled after the Castro revolution. ''Once for my birthday, Mike rented a vintage Jaguar and picked me up at work,'' Mrs. Diaz-Piedra said. ''He hired some violinists to play while we had dinner. Then he asked me to marry him.'' 
 Although he came to the United States from Cuba when he was 8, Mr. Diaz-Piedra maintained strong ties with the food and culture of his homeland. ''Mike was not a ravenous, anti-Castro Cuban,'' said his brother, George, but he said he had prepared a claim to recover the family's property in Cuba when Castro's regime ended. 
 Mr. Diaz-Piedra, 49, was a vice president with the Bank of New York in charge of disaster recovery planning. But he was happiest when the planning he did was for a mock battle of the soldiers in his collection. ''Some people may have thought of Mike as eccentric,'' Mrs. Diaz-Piedra said. ''But he was just a big kid at heart.''

LISA FROST
In Memory of Lisa
On September 11, 2001, Rancho Santa Margarita resident Lisa Frost was a passenger on the ill-fated United Airlines Flight 175.
 When Boston University went to California to recruit Lisa Frost she fell in love with the school. By the time Miss Frost was in her junior year at B.U. she was traveling the West Coast talking about the university and doing the recruiting herself. She graduated summa cum laude in May, with two degrees, one in communications and one in hospitality administration, which everyone thought was absolutely fitting for a woman with her embracing character.
 She was awarded the Boston University Scarlet Key for extraordinary achievement in student activities and organizations. 
 ''Everybody that comes in contact with her is just so inspired and so motivated,'' said her father, Tom Frost. On the B.U. Web site there are more than 80 messages sent in by people who knew Miss Frost and many who didn't but were touched by the story of how she died while taking a flight to begin her career at home in California.
 Lisa's family and friends will miss her sweet smile. . . .
 Peggy Burnett of Cerritos, Calif., never met Miss Frost but she knitted her family a red, white and blue afghan. ''My heart just went out to them,'' Ms. Burnett said.
 Mr. Frost recently planted a 13-foot scrub oak near his home in Rancho Santa Margarita in honor of his 22-year-old daughter. He placed a granite plaque there with an inscription he wrote detailing her life, her death and all the lives she touched. 
 This tree is planted in her memory and is dedicated to parents who have children that are with God in heaven.

ROBERT ANDREW SPENCER
A Breath of Salt Air
After the four-hour drive to Bethany Beach, Del., Christine Spencer was eager to unpack the car. But her husband, Robert Andrew Spencer, never let her. ''Not until we feel the sand on our feet,'' he would say, and then he would lead the way, galloping down the beach and plunging headfirst into the salt spray.
 Mr. Spencer, known to everyone as either Andy or Spence, had grown up with the smell of salt air and was determined to pass along his love of the shore to his children. ''He was sort of like the Pied Piper,'' said his brother, Michael. He would lead Addison, 5, and Kathryn, 3, into the water at full speed. Then he might drape a strand of seaweed over his ears to keep them laughing. ''The guy had a lot of positive energy,'' said John Greeley, a friend. ''He was one of those people who just don't sit down.''
 Mr. Spencer, 35, left his Middletown, N.J., home at 5 a.m. to get to his job as a foreign exchange broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. He usually returned home a little after 6 p.m., in time to put the girls to bed. A third child, Robert Philip, was born on Aug. 16.
 In what she called a celebration of life, Mrs. Spencer decided to have the baby's baptism and her husband's memorial service on the same day.

KENNETH WALDIE
The Oldest Teammate
Carol Waldie thought of her husband as her fifth child. ''Just what I needed,'' she said. Kenneth Waldie wanted to do everything the kids did, especially their sporting activities. 
 For instance, his daughter, Meredith, 17, plays on the varsity basketball team, wearing No. 44. Mr. Waldie was at games so often that the coaches referred to him as No. 44 1/2. After he died, the coaches had his number put on shirts and presented them to Mrs. Waldie.
 Since he admired Joe Paterno and his brother had gone to Penn State, Mr. Waldie was fanatical about the Penn State football team, and sometimes took his son J. T., 14, to games. He kept himself as fit as a professional athlete. He jogged and worked out every day, and at work, he always skipped lunch so he could go on long walks with colleagues. On frigid days, he would be the only one out there. Mrs. Waldie said that at 46 he looked the same as he did at 20.
 Mr. Waldie, who lived in Methuen, Mass., had two other children: Andrew, 24, and Jeff, 21. A senior quality control engineer at Raytheon, he was headed to California on a business trip.
 Around work, his colleagues referred to him as ''911,'' because of his generosity whenever someone needed help. His favorite number happened to be 11, and he was on Flight 11 when it crashed on the 11th.

ROB HIGLEY
The Three Boys
When he was just 4 years old, Rob Higley moved to Ridgefield, Conn., and soon made friends with three other little boys: Carl and Erik Abrahamson and Dan Kish. When he was 8, Rob's family moved away. But he kept his friends.
 In fact, he built his life around them, said his wife, Vycki Higley. He decided to go to the University of Connecticut because Carl Abrahamson was going there too, and they could room together. Through his old friends, he met his wife and her parents, who also lived in Ridgefield.
 ''The boys,'' as Mrs. Higley calls them, went mountain biking together and took their families camping every summer.
 Though his jobs in the insurance business took them all over the country during their seven-year marriage, the Higleys always dreamed of moving back to Connecticut, ''close enough so he could be around these guys all the time,'' Mrs. Higley said. Last spring, their dream came true when Mr. Higley got a job at Aon in the World Trade Center. He started work there on June 11.
 Mr. Higley was 29 when he died. His three dear friends are godfathers to his daughters, Amanda, 4 1/2, and Robyn Elizabeth, who was born on Nov. 3.

CONSTANTINE ECONOMOS
2 Weeks, Then 23 Years
On a memorial Web page for Constantine Economos one message posted by a former colleague summed up all the others: ''When he walked in the room, everything got funnier and better.''
 A partner at Sandler O'Neill & Partners, Mr. Economos, 41, known as Gus, was on the parish council at his church, left work early to coach the football team at Xavier High School in Manhattan and planned excursions for his children, Constantine and Katherine.
 He met his wife, Audrey, in high school in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn -- across the street from where the family now lives. At first, she would only date him for two weeks, saying she was too young to date longer; at the end of two weeks, he asked, ''Can I have two more?''
 As it turned out, the couple shared 23 years -- not enough, but as she said in her husband's eulogy: ''Gus didn't live a short life, he lived a condensed life. He lived life to the fullest, and I believe he has left us with large shoes to fill.''

MARC ZEPLIN
He Shoots! He Scores!
When Marc Zeplin was 4, his father took him to his first Rangers game. There, he found his calling. 
 Throughout his childhood, his mother would come upon him in the living room, playing an entire hockey game by himself while calling the play-by-play. He would hit the puck and run to the other side of the room to protect the goal. Meanwhile, he would announce his moves at the top of his lungs. Afterward, at the dinner table, he would recap the game in his imitation of Howard Cosell's grating baritone. 
 When he went to the University of Michigan, he broadcast the games on the school radio station. His dream, said Leona Zeplin, his mother, was to be a professional sportscaster. But he was enough of a realist to know how slim his chances were.
 Instead, he became a trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, entertaining clients with his sports chatter. And he looked forward to sharing years of Rangers games and sports talk with his two sons. With Ryan, the eldest, turning 3, Mr. Zeplin had already made plans to take him to his first Rangers game.

GERARD T. NEVINS
Fireman and Farmer
Gerard T. Nevins lived a life of sweet contradictions. His primary job was fighting fires. But when he was not pulling people from burning buildings, he was tending to his small farm in the backyard of his house in Campbell Hall, N.Y.
 ''It was a way he could totally disconnect from all the madness of Manhattan,'' his brother Stephen Nevins said. ''He would just make his way through the community every day as if he was just a farmer.''
 In his neighborhood, people recognized Firefighter Nevins, 46, as the man who raised pigs, goats and chickens and sold fresh eggs. He was also known as a doting father to Daniel, 7, and Andrew, 5.
 Among the men at Rescue 1 in Midtown Manhattan, Firefighter Nevins was a keeper of traditional values. He was an 18-year veteran of the department who vehemently opposed ordering take-out food because he thought that cooking together helped to cement the brothers' bond.
 To his wife, Marie, Firefighter Nevins was simply a devoted husband, whom she fell in love with at first sight in 1979. ''It was just one of those things where he looked at me, and I melted and that was it,'' she said. ''It was that way for the next 20 years.''

RACHEL TAMARES
'She Spoke Her Mind'
''Whatever.'' 
 Anyone who worked at Aon Financial Services Group with Rachel Tamares will tell you that that was her favorite response when anyone disagreed with her. 
 But ''whatever'' did not mean that Ms. Tamares did not care. Quite the opposite. She was known as a fastidious worker, an administrative associate who kept a tidy desk. Rather, said Julia Akinwunmi, a co-worker for 12 years, ''whatever'' reflected Ms. Tamares's positive attitude toward work, toward friends, and toward most aspects of her life. ''The thing about Rachel is that she spoke her mind,'' Ms. Akinwunmi said. ''She'd say 'Why do you have that on? You know that color is not good for you.' And people appreciated that. If they didn't, and disagreed, Rachel's response would be 'whatever.' '' 
 Ms. Tamares, 30, married John Bruno when she was 16. She was such a traditional and devoted mother to their two boys, Jason, 11, and Robert, 6, that her friends sometimes called her grandma. On weekends, she took the children on excursions to Sesame Place or Dorney Park in Pennsylvania. Sometimes she invited her sister, Jenny, 15, and their mother, Maria Paulino, to come along. 
 In June, after her mother and sister had to leave their house, Ms. Tamares invited them to come live in her already crowded two-bedroom apartment in the Bronx until they could find a new place to live.

NEIL M. DOLLARD
Connected by Telephone
His family's memories of Neil M. Dollard frequently involve a telephone. There were the calls Mr. Dollard made to his mother, Helen, from his kitchen (''How do you debeard a mussel?'') and to his sister Megan (''I'm working with purple basil. Have you ever made purple pesto?'') and the endless conversations on the special line that connected him to his brother Peter's office; they spoke ''maybe 45 times a day'' by Peter Dollard's count. 
 After high school, Neil Dollard, who was 28, headed straight from Staten Island to Cantor Fitzgerald, signing on as a ''bluecoat'' who emptied wastebaskets, and working his way up to bond broker. He embraced the lifestyle, building a wardrobe of natty suits and taking on the vocabulary of Wall Street: ''waving in'' bottles of wine at dinner, for example, to indulge clients. He bought a condominium in Hoboken, N.J., and had a happy relationship with his girlfriend, Kristin Ledzion. They planned to join other family members vacationing in Chiavari, on the coast of Italy, in the middle of September. 
 He called them there on Sept. 10. They were returning from town around midnight, and heard the phone ringing. Someone sprinted up the stairs to answer it. ''He spoke to all of us, and he told me how much he was looking forward to the trip,'' his brother said. ''He said that when he got there, we were going to wave everything in.''

PATRICK M. ARANYOS
'Mr. Smiley' Grows Up
As a child, Patrick M. Aranyos, a bond broker with Euro Brokers at 2 World Trade Center, was known as Mr. Smiley. As an adult, his life revolved around an enormous cast of companions.
 He would ask them ''How are you doing?'' and expect an answer. ''There was a tilt of the head and a look in the eye,'' said John Minardo, who met him at Boston College, ''that said he really wanted to know.'' 
 They flocked to his Halloween parties, where he dressed as a flamenco dancer one year. They knew he loved football; he insisted on participating, even as a skinny 16-year-old dwarfed by bulkier players. ''He was like a knife, he was so thin,'' said his mother, Winnie, remembering the lineup at his school in North Palm Beach, Fla. ''But he persevered.''
 In New York, they came by the dozens to go out with him at night or rolled into town from Europe, knowing they would always have a place to stay -- at Patrick's. ''You know how so many people in New York are so work-driven?'' said his girlfriend, Alex Kearney. ''He wasn't like that.''
 ''He would give his right arm for anybody,'' said Ted Franchetti, one of his roommates.

Office Market Is Expected to Be Sluggish in 2002

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
JOLTED by a sagging economy, job losses and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, New Jersey's office market closed 2001 with vacancies piling up and leasing activity sluggish. And while many real estate executives say they think the worst may be over, the outlook is that the market will remain slack through this year.
 "The year 2002 will be a tough one with a lot of uncertainty" and some pain, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. 
 The challenges include trimming the state's bloated vacancy rate. It was 18 percent at the end of 2001, up from 16 percent in the third quarter and from 10 percent a year ago, according to GVA Williams, the brokerage and real estate services firm. 
Last fall, before the attacks, leasing activity had already been falling off, said Jeffrey Schotz, executive managing officer at the Parsippany office of GVA. That unfavorable trend, he added, "was exacerbated by the events of Sept. 11, which threw confidence in the market into chaos." 
All industries were affected, even the state's resilient pharmaceutical companies, which "slowed their appetite for space," said Christopher Kinum, senior managing director and branch manager of New Jersey at Cushman & Wakefield, another real estate services firm, based in East Rutherford. Of the 10 northern and central New Jersey counties that his company tracks, Morris and Somerset counties had the highest vacancy rates, with 19.6 percent and 21.8 percent respectively.
Job losses have cut across all industries, Dean Hughes added. He said estimates are that New Jersey lost 20,000 jobs in 2001 after adding an average of 87,000 jobs a year for each of the previous three years. 
What is striking about the empty space is that much of it is available for sublet. As fast as corporations handed pink slips to employees, they have shed surplus offices in response to mergers and consolidations or in expectation of luring tenants dislocated from downtown Manhattan.
Almost one-third of the 35 million square feet now available is sublet space, roughly double the usual proportion, according to the brokerage Newmark JGT. Over the last six years, an average of 15.3 percent of all available space was sublet space.
The biggest contributors of sublet space so far have been AT&T and Lucent, which Newmark estimates have put a total of 2.5 million square feet of space on the market. That figure does not include the 1.35 million square feet of offices at AT&T's Basking Ridge headquarters, which is for sale. 
But telecommunications companies are not alone. Among the largest blocks of sublet space available is 340,000 square feet that Aventis, the pharmaceutical company, vacated at Morris Corporate Center IV in Parsippany, an area with 1.2 million square feet of such space, or one half of all available space. Aventis moved to a building in Bridgewater, where it has its headquarters, and the Parsippany space has lingered on the market empty for the last year. 
In the weeks after the World Trade Center disaster, some 25 displaced Manhattan companies, including American Express and Lehman Brothers, absorbed 3.6 million square feet of space in New Jersey, according to GVA Williams. While that activity caused a temporary rise in leasing in the fall, mainly along the Hudson River waterfront, it was far less than some had expected in light of the fact that about 25 million square feet in lower Manhattan was destroyed or temporarily unusable. 
In the first half of 2001, the brokerage said, 3.8 million more square feet of space was occupied than was put on the market; in the second half 3.5 million more square feet was put back than was absorbed.
Moves from Manhattan, though fewer, continue. Among the latest is a decision by Garban Intercapital North America, which had been in the World Trade Center, to lease 222,451 square feet at a 980,000-square-foot tower that the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation is building at its Harborside Financial Center along Jersey City's waterfront.
Tenants are also returning to Manhattan. American Express has announced plans to reoccupy its downtown headquarters and give back at least some New Jersey space.
Dr. Hughes said there were still many displaced companies that had held off making a decision until better times arrive. His projection for the long term is that many Manhattan companies will decide to spread out to several locations to increase security and this will be a positive for New Jersey. 
First, the market must recover. Dr. Hughes said some signs -- like increased consumer confidence -- point to improvement in the national economy. But even if the recession ends by the third quarter, "it could be a while before its impact starts to trickle to the office market." 
Still, deals are being made. VoiceStream recently leased a 105,000-square-foot building in Parsippany from the landlord, Gale & Wentworth, a developer and real estate services firm in Florham Park. The deal enabled VoiceStream to expand and consolidate scattered offices.
"Even in turbulent times, select companies need new homes," said Mark Yeager, Gale & Wentworth's president. "You just have to dig a little deeper to find them." 
Though some excess space will be absorbed in the coming months, "it will not be enough to change the outlook that the market for 2002 will be flat," said Paul E. Giannone, a principal of Newmark JGT.
Still, the hefty dose of sublet space, which traditionally rents for 20 percent less than direct space, "will put tenants in a better position to negotiate with landlords," said Douglas T. Haynes, a principal of Cresa Partners/New Jersey, a corporate services firm in Morristown that represents tenants.
"Tenants are in the catbird seat," added Thomas V. Giannone, who is a senior vice president at the Edison office of the Julien J. Studley brokerage, which also represents tenants, and who is not related to Mr. Giannone of Newmark JGT. "The next 12 to 18 months is a window of opportunity that tenants have not seen in 10 years." 
For tenants giving back space, "subletting is the art of stopping the bleeding," said John C. Giordano of the Staubach Company in Murray Hill, which is marketing the space in Parsippany for Aventis. 
SO far, average asking rents for all classes of direct space have remained stable at $21 a square foot, according to GVA Williams. But some landlords are being squeezed by the one-two punch of the recession and lower-priced sublet space and are offering such incentives as one to two months of no rent and a more generous work allowance for tenants to improve their space. Many executives expect the sweeteners will continue and eventually include lower rents.
At One Tower Center in East Brunswick, the owner, Boston Properties, has dropped asking rents by $2 a square foot, to $32, to draw tenants to the building's 150,000 square feet of vacant space, said Paul Giannone of Newmark JGT, the leasing agent, in Woodbridge. The 405,000-square-foot tower is off Exit 9 of the New Jersey Turnpike.
Mr. Yeager of Gale & Wentworth added that some tenants, like VoiceStream, will always prefer to deal directly with landlords instead of subletting. That is what his company is betting on to fill the 130,000-square-foot building it recently completed in Bernards Township, near Interstate 78 in the softening Somerset County market. It is the second of six buildings planned at the 170-acre development, known as Mountainview Corporate Center. 
The year is also expected to be a thin one in terms of construction as many developers put plans for new buildings on hold until tenants are signed. Mitchell E. Hersh, chief executive at Mack-Cali, said at Harborside, where the company can build 5 million more square feet, work would start on a new building only after tenants take 50 percent of the space and there are indications that leasing activity is gaining momentum.
Limited new construction for the last three years and developers' caution have the market in better shape now than it was in the last recession, Mr. Kinum of Cushman & Wakefield said, adding, "We read the tea leaves more quickly this time." But even if a recovery begins later this year, some real estate executives say, the market will still be tepid compared with the robust years of 1999 and 2000. The market, Mr. Haynes of Cresa Partners said, "will come back, but not roaring back."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
A Train to a Plane to a Bus to a Subway

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
PHOTOS, drawings and computer-generated images of some of the world's most exciting urban design projects are on display along a twisting corridor at the Art Institute here. For one project in the Belgian city of Liege, the architect Santiago Calatrava has designed a huge glass building with soaring canopies and a roof supported by monumental arched ribs. Scheduled to be completed in 2006, it has a great central hall, as well as offices, a shopping center, an 800-space parking garage and subway connections. One of the towering glass walls will offer visitors a panoramic view of a nearby mountainside.
 Although the building is part civic center and part shopping mall, its main purpose is something else altogether: to serve as a train station. High-speed rail service is now reaching smaller European cities as well as big ones, and existing stations are no longer able to handle the throngs of passengers or the ultramodern trains. Across Europe and in East Asia, a boom in the construction of train stations is changing the vernacular of their design and producing new ideas about the role they can play in urban planning. 
 Designs for 20 stations, some completed, others under construction and a few barely off the drawing board, are on display in the Art Institute exhibition, "Modern Trains and Splendid Stations," which runs through July 28. They show how the challenge of reinventing train stations has gripped the imaginations of some of the world's leading architects. 
The new stations are light, airy and colorful. Many are built as a series of connected spaces, large by necessity but not as overwhelming as the Gothic and Beaux-Arts stations of past eras. Almost all are conceived as centerpieces in larger urban development projects. Most integrate parking garages, bus depots, subway stations and connections to nearby airports. Some, like one in Frankfurt that opened last year and another, designed by Helmut Jahn, that is to open in Cologne in 2003, are actually part of airport complexes. 
In Lille, France, the train station is the center of Euralille, a new business district that reflects the desire of both the French government and the European Union to strengthen neglected regions. The station, part of an urban master plan by the architect Rem Koolhaas, is built on several levels, with slender tubular arches supporting its roof. Since it was completed in 1994, three office towers and a convention hall have been built nearby.
Some new stations have been built for special events and have then become part of long-term development plans. Oriente Station in Lisbon, for example, was a gateway to Expo '98. Built in a decaying industrial area, it has glass-and-steel canopies that resemble palm groves in a desert oasis. As planned, houses and apartment buildings are springing up in the surrounding area, and 25,000 people are expected to move there by 2010. 
Many Asian political leaders, like their European counterparts, have concluded that demographic, environmental and economic pressures make the development of modern rail networks vital to their countries' future, and are anchoring them with dazzling new stations. The Hung Hom station in Hong Kong, which was designed by Norman Foster and opened in 1998, can accommodate the arrival and departure of 500 trains a day, some of them double-deckers. Known for its wave-form roof, the station was built to accelerate Hong Kong's integration into China. 
In Hong Kong as well, the British architect Terry Farrell has built a new station in West Kowloon that is the main stop on the 19-mile route connecting the city center to a new airport. Also serving as an interchange for three rail lines, it has a large bus station and offers airline check-in services. This so-called transportation supercity is the core of a sprawling development that is to include more than one million square feet of office space, hotels and apartments. 
Of course, railway stations require trains, and their new designs are almost as radical as the stations'. The Chicago exhibition includes pictures of nine that show the range of these innovations. In Germany, passengers can now ride front cars that allow them to see ahead -- new technology, eliminating the engineer, allows an operator to be separated from passengers by nothing more than a glass screen. In much of Europe, tilting train technology propels trains up to 150 miles an hour. Some trains are consciously built for the masses, like those in Sweden, where a commitment to social equality dictates no first-class sections. Others are aimed at an elite clientele, like one in Switzerland that provides luxury service to wealthy skiers. 
The Chicago show is small, with the corridor it occupies designed to evoke the sensation of train travel. For an American, it also evokes something else: the realization that this country has not participated in the railway revolution.
During the heyday of railroads in the United States, the country's most celebrated architects devoted themselves to designing grand train stations. Some still exist, including several, like Grand Central Terminal in New York, that barely escaped demolition. The finest are urban palaces with vast, cathedral-like spaces conveying a solid grandeur. Yet these survivors, beautiful as they are, tell more about the past than about the future; they seem like throwbacks to another era.
The stations in the Chicago show are just the opposite, boldly innovative rather than reverential, and use glass and steel rather than heavy stone. They are designed to be vital parts of 21st-century life.
This contrast in architectural style reflects America's forceful dissent from the European and Asian consensus about the future of rail travel. The spread of air travel in postwar America was accompanied by the construction of interstate highways and the simultaneous rise of powerful automobile, highway and airline lobbies. 
Rail travel came to be viewed as an inefficient relic that was defended only by nostalgic romantics and Luddite environmentalists. In the minds of some Washington politicians, railroads still conjure up images of the smoke-belching locomotive, the creaky wooden passenger car and the maverick engineer. 
The Chicago exhibition demonstrates that these images are as outdated as those of the biplane and the Model-T. In much of the world, political leaders have concluded that for trips of less than 350 miles, train travel is the soundest choice, both economically and environmentally. There is broad agreement across the political spectrum that taxpayers should pay to build railways just as they pay to build highways. Yet in the United States, railroads receive little support. Congress recently gave the airline industry a $15 billion bailout, even as it threatened to cut Amtrak subsidies. But despite this lack of financing and Amtrak's chronic service problems, ridership has increased since the Sept. 11 terror attacks. 
The most modern American train, the punctuality-challenged Acela Express, which runs between Boston and Washington, shares antiquated track with conventional passenger and freight trains. This anachronistic system is almost unknown in Europe. As for station designs, only 4 of the 20 in the Chicago show are American. 
One is the new Pennsylvania Station in New York that is to be built on Eighth Avenue in the iconic James A. Farley General Post Office designed by McKim, Mead & White. The new station, by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, makes use of the old neo-classical building but also adds modern touches, most notably a huge crescent-shaped skylight that will rise nearly 150 feet over the main entrance on 33rd Street. The three other American stations in the show, one in St. Louis and two in California, are more directly influenced by European and Asian trends, with glass walls, undulating canopies and natural ventilation.
The California projects, in San Francisco and Solana Beach, reflect the desire of some mayors and governors to plan for greatly expanded rail passenger service in the future. Highways in California are being choked by ever increasing numbers of trucks and cars, and Gov. Gray Davis has unveiled a plan to spend $4 billion on rail improvements by 2005. 
The curator of the Chicago exhibition, Martha Thorne, writes in a catalog essay that Europe and East Asia are heralding "a rebirth of the architecture of train stations" that is also transforming broader ideas of urban design. But the United States, she asserts, "still sorely lags behind."

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
For a Maestro, A Long Goodbye

BYLINE:  By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: ZURICH 

 BODY:
WITH a seemingly endless wave of appointments of prospective music directors at major American orchestras finally completed, can a wave of long goodbyes be far away? Several incumbent maestros are in fact already taking lingering leave of their orchestras. The New York Philharmonic is deep into a season largely devoted to honoring Kurt Masur. Seiji Ozawa, in transition from the Boston Symphony to the Vienna State Opera, was glimpsed on international television conducting the New Year concerts of the Vienna Philharmonic.
 The Cleveland Orchestra completed its search long ago, announcing in 1999 that Franz Welser-Most would succeed Christoph von Dohnanyi as music director. The time is at hand, more or less, and Mr. Dohnanyi, after a happy marriage of almost two decades with the orchestra, leads it in a gala tribute concert pairing Richard Strauss's "Metamorphosen" with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on Saturday at Severance Hall. Then, in three concerts from Jan. 24 to Jan. 26, he makes his final Carnegie Hall appearances as the orchestra's music director. 
 Mr. Dohnanyi, 72, will conclude his illustrious tenure in June with a tour of Europe, where the orchestra has been ecstatically received over the last decade. But not every bow on the package will be so neatly knotted. The performance of Wagner's "Siegfried" that ends the orchestra's regular season, in May at Severance, leaves unfinished a saga within the Dohnanyi story, but more of that later. 
The Carnegie programs are typical of Mr. Dohnanyi's bracing approach to repertory, mingling classics with more contemporary fare: Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 5, 7 and 9 with works by Sibelius, Lutoslawski, Wolfgang Rihm, Harrison Birtwistle and Gyorgy Kurtag. A 10-CD set of Dohnanyi performances just released by the orchestra offers a similar mix, juxtaposing Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler with composers ranging from Schoenberg to Lutoslawski, Schnittke and John Adams.
Encountered recently in Zurich, where he was crossing paths with Mr. Welser-Most at the Zurich Opera, Mr. Dohnanyi appeared in lights both familiar and unfamiliar from experiences with him in Cleveland. It was odd, for example, at an early rehearsal of Strauss's "Schweigsame Frau," to sense a certain fatalism in his attempts to draw plush playing from an orchestra of considerably less polish than he is used to.
On the other hand, it was altogether characteristic that the broad philosophical bent in his personality dominated conversation over lunch at his hotel on the Zurichsee. Indeed, Mr. Dohnanyi dwelt more on world events than on comings and goings in the music world, even his own.
"All this talk of getting back to normal," he said of the September terrorist attacks. "What's normal is now. What was not normal was before. This is the reality of our world. It's the same experience all over, but here in Europe the experience of being vulnerable has existed for hundreds of years. People have somehow become used to living with it."
Mr. Dohnanyi comes by his lofty political pronouncements rightly. As he grew up in Nazi Germany, his family was active in the resistance. His mother, Christine Bonhoeffer, was imprisoned. His father, Hans von Dohnanyi, a prominent jurist who helped Jews escape execution and played a central role in a plot to kill Hitler, was tortured and hanged shortly before the Russians took Berlin in 1945. Three of the maestro's uncles, including the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was also his godfather, were similarly executed.
"This is not just a question of fighting terrorism," Mr. Dohnanyi said of the present situation. "This is a milestone in history, like Hitler and Napoleon. What we're finding is that there can't be economic globalization without human and spiritual globalization. We have to look for the causes of things. If you assume that human beings are not bad in themselves, then something must have gone totally wrong."
From the East, a certain envy, or worse, is inevitable, Mr. Dohnanyi suggests. "They see television," he said. "They see ad nauseam what's happening in the Western world. You have to develop cures. You treat the symptoms, obviously, and then you try to find and deal with the causes."
Like many others, he finds the narrowness of the American world view frustrating. Still, he has discovered much to admire in the American character, at least at its origins. "My brother had a joke," he said of Klaus von Dohnanyi, a former influential mayor of Hamburg. "What's a European? A European is someone who didn't dare to cross the ocean."
Conversation does eventually gravitate toward music.
"You can judge music from the first half of the last century," he said. "After that, there might be much more great music out there than we now realize. That's why we should do a lot to find out what's there. You cannot do only great music.
"And we have to interpret old music in our century's way. If we use the music of Mozart and Beethoven, we must use it in the way of the 21st century. I'm not interested in the Brahms of the 19th century. I'm interested in the Brahms of the 21st century. Brahms interpretation without knowing Schoenberg does not interest me. In the opening of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, you have somehow to shock as Beethoven did in his time."
As for the Cleveland Orchestra, 20 years is enough, Mr. Dohnanyi repeats, mantralike, in interviews (including his two seasons as music director-designate, from 1982 to 1984, as well as his actual tenure, from 1984 to the present). "It was 20 years of being in a wonderful situation," he said. "But what I loved I saw dying." He referred not only to the deaths of Daniel Majeske and Bernhard Goldschmidt, principal violinists and cornerstones of the ensemble, but also to two other cornerstones retired, John Mack, a principal oboist, and David Zauder, a trumpeter and personnel manager.
Thomas W. Morris, the orchestra's executive director, with long experience of his own, sounded similar notes. "All relationships change," he said. "Christoph's achievement with this orchestra has been absolutely staggering. It has been 20 glorious years, but 20 years is a long time in this business."
The word "chemistry" is often applied to the relationship between conductor and players; "good chemistry" has become synonymous with this particular combination. The character and personality of the Cleveland Orchestra -- meticulous, hard-working, doggedly loyal and proud -- was shaped by the autocratic George Szell from 1946 to his death in 1970. The discipline, by then built in, was mostly sustained through the uneven tenure of Lorin Maazel, from 1972 to 1982.
Mr. Dohnanyi -- a stickler, with one (uh, two) of the finest ears in the business, but not an intimidator -- found much to hone and refine in the orchestra's already elegant sound. He also enhanced its versatility, richness and warmth. Heat, even, though nothing approaching raw emotionalism or passionate abandon.
"With Dohnanyi, things have to be perfect before they can be good," Alexander Pereira, the intendant of the Zurich Opera, once said tellingly. Only when he has achieved the utmost in precision and transparency will Mr. Dohnanyi begin to loosen his grip and let a performance take on its own spontaneity, life and momentum. At that point, a performance acquires a quality he praises in jazz: "It is precise only as far as necessary."
As a result, repetition of repertory in Cleveland typically breeds not routine, let alone contempt, but excitement. "I like to perform works that are far, far ahead of me," Mr. Dohnanyi said. "As in science, the results are never much good the first time, but you proceed. To be on the right way is already a good feeling."
Varese's quirky and sprawling "Ameriques," for one example, got better and more unbridled in each of three outings from the late 80's to the early 90's. Way back when the laser beam was new, a physics professor explained that if its principle could be applied to the sound of an orchestra -- if, that is, the sound waves could be produced in phase with one another -- the sound would be positively overwhelming. It took Mr. Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra in "Ameriques" to drive that lesson home. This orchestra, it seemed, was coming ever closer to playing in phase than any orchestra ever has. Yet for all that easy power, the sonority never becomes crude, blasting or out of control.
All these qualities should benefit Mahler, and they do to a degree, though Mr. Dohnanyi's temperament still seems a bit cool in this music (as in the Second Symphony in the new CD set). But they clearly benefit other areas of repertory and come together with particular force and eloquence in certain strains of modernism.
Mr. Dohnanyi is an acknowledged master of composers of the Second Viennese School: Schoenberg, Berg and Webern. But where this combination of conductor and orchestra produces the most heat is in craggy, energized works like, yes, "Ameriques" (recorded but evidently lost somewhere in Decca's vaults), Lutoslawski's Concerto for Orchestra (also recorded and probably hidden on a shelf behind "Ameriques") and Janacek's Sinfonietta (thankfully, available in the CD set).
Mr. Dohnanyi will continue as principal conductor of the Philharmonia of London, a position he has held since 1997. He will also remain much in demand as a guest conductor with top orchestras and opera companies around the world.
As for Mr. Welser-Most, a 41-year-old Austrian, he variously refers to the Cleveland Orchestra as a Rolls-Royce, "an incredibly fine-tuned instrument" and a "wonderful playground" for a conductor. "The best music is just about good enough for the Cleveland Orchestra," he said in his quaintly constructed and liltingly accented English.
Thrown perhaps prematurely into the treacherous waters of the London orchestral scene, Mr. Welser-Most had a rude baptism as music director of the London Philharmonic from 1990 to 1996.
"In London, whatever new piece gets played is what's politically best," he said, merely hinting at his problems there. "Now I know that playing new music is just like playing old music. Every piece we play is old. Whether two weeks old or 200 years old doesn't matter. I have to believe in it, and that's all there is. If I believe very strongly, then I can convince people."
But he also admits, "I was such an idiot 10 years ago." In any case, he left licking his wounds and moved on to the Zurich Opera, where he had become music director in 1995.
Here, now, within a few days he conducted Mozart's "Zauberflote," Verdi's "Macbeth" and Wagner's "Siegfried." That new production of "Siegfried" will form part of a complete Wagner "Ring" cycle, directed by Robert Wilson, in June, just as Mr. Dohnanyi is finishing "Siegfried" in Cleveland.
The Dohnanyi "Siegfried" was also to have been part of a complete cycle, semistaged and recorded by Decca. Traversing this quasi-symphonic tour de force with the Cleveland Orchestra was always Mr. Dohnanyi's dream. "Die Walkure" and "Das Rheingold" were duly performed and recorded in 1992 and 1993. But "Siegfried" was delayed by the search for a tenor adequate to the famously taxing title role.
Meanwhile, the classical-record industry melted down, recording contracts were canceled wholesale, and prospects of finishing the "Ring" receded to less than zero. Now the orchestra is recouping the situation at least in part. In May, Stig Andersen will sing Siegfried, and the orchestra will make an archival recording with no guarantee of a public release (though it would seem a logical follow-up to the current Dohnanyi set).
All of which will leave "Gotterdammerung" still undone. A possibility is held out both by Mr. Dohnanyi and by Mr. Morris, the executive director, that it, too, will be programmed and recorded when Mr. Dohnanyi returns to Cleveland as conductor emeritus. That may take a few years, however, for Mr. Dohnanyi has chosen not to return for two seasons, giving Mr. Welser-Most time to settle in with no more invidious comparisons than necessary.
Be that as it may, the younger maestro might do well to seek out some of Mr. Dohnanyi's accumulated wisdom and perspective. "We have to realize what's most important to life," Mr. Dohnanyi said, closing the conversational circle of music and politics. "Who remembers who the foreign minister of Prussia was when Beethoven was writing his music?"

HEADLINE: Opera House to Resound With Renovations 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE DiGRAZIA 

 BODY:
IT was a cold night, two weeks before Christmas in 1945, when a very nervous Nancy Fisher took center stage at the Sterling Opera House in Derby for the Naugatuck Valley Glee Club's annual winter concert.
 Wearing a white, off-the-shoulder ball gown, Nancy, a senior at Ansonia High School, performed a solo medley of Scottish tunes in front of a packed house. 
 "It was quite an experience for me," said Nancy, whose last name is now Seccombe. "I remember it vividly 56 years later. The place was full to capacity." 
Mrs. Seccombe, who sang with the all-male glee club by special invitation of one of its members, her English teacher, said she still has the playbill with her name written alongside the words "A Scottish Fantasy."
If Derby officials and local arts supporters have their way, concerts and other live entertainment will again be on the boards at the 112-year-old theater, which was closed soon after Mrs. Seccombe's performance 56 years ago.
While the first floor of the Elizabeth Street opera house -- a generic name for a theater in those days -- was used as Derby's City Hall and police station until 1965, the upper theater was used only once for a violin concert in 1966.
The shuttered theater is now a highly visible eyesore adjacent to a state courthouse and across from the city's green.
"It's been sitting there, waiting for something to happen," said Nick Povinelli, vice president of the Sterling Opera House Foundation. "People have always loved this little theater and have wanted to do something about it."
Something is finally being done. Mayor Marc Garofalo said the city had received $1.4 million in local, state and federal funds, $300,000 of which is being used to create a conceptual plan for the building's refurbishment, blueprints for marketability and fund-raising studies, and preliminary exterior renovations, such as window replacement and stabilization of the exterior.
The city recently received another $100,000 in federal Department of Housing and Urban Development funds, which Rick Dunne, Derby's director of development, called a downpayment for another $1 million from the federal government in the fall. "Once we have $2 million, we'll be able to complete enough of the restoration to be able to open the building for community-theater use," Mr. Dunne said. "It would require more for the national touring theater companies." 
Ultimately, city officials and group members envision an 800-seat Broadway-type theater, similar to the successful Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam that will capture not only local audiences but also the numerous bus tours traveling on nearby Fairfield County highways to and from the casino resorts in eastern Connecticut.
The eventual price tag: $7 million for the infrastructure and $3 million for equipment, all of which is set to be raised through private foundations.
"This project has been like falling in love with a lady who's fallen on hard times and is trying to be revived," said Harvey Bletchman, a retired businessman who is the artistic director of Save Our Sterling, a private group of area residents committed to restoring the opera house to its original state. "Restoring the Sterling is very much a grass-roots effort. Good begets good."
Mr. Bletchman, who lives in neighboring Orange, said he stopped for a cup of coffee five years ago at Junni Moon's-Vonete's, a 1940's-style restaurant across the street from the Sterling Opera House, and was "captivated by the idea" of a group of people trying to restore the theater.
"J. R. had a petition asking anyone who wanted to volunteer to sign up," Mr. Bletchman said of J. R. DuGatto, who owned the restaurant. "It caught my fancy."
Mr. DuGatto said he could not believe his good fortune that day.
"I snagged him," said Mr. DuGatto, who also serves on the committee. "He's a bright guy who's very creative and loves the arts."
Indeed, those propelling the restoration of the Connecticut's first building to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places share not only a love of the arts, but cultural and political agendas as well.
One agenda involves the revival of a once-majestic vaudeville palace that boasted a lineup of entertainers that includes John Philip Sousa, Harry Houdini, Amelia Earhart, Lionel Barrymore and Red Skelton. Another incorporates the hope that a new performing arts center and City Hall will be a much-needed stimulus for economic growth in the struggling downtown area.
Michael P. Price, the Connecticut Commission on the Arts chairman, who is also executive director of the Goodspeed Opera House, said that East Haddam, where the Goodspeed is situated, has benefited enormously since the theater was renovated and reopened in 1963.
"It's had a $30-million-a-year economic impact," Mr. Price said. "It's created 300 jobs and 125,000 people a year come into the community."
Mr. Price said that in addition to the Goodspeed, an opera house has been restored in Thomaston, and in Deep River one is under renovation.
"It's called rediscovering your history and your treasures," he said. "It's part of our nation's awakening to the great architecture of the past."
Supporters of the Sterling Opera House could not agree more.
"We could do a much better job of promoting our city," said Markanthony Izzo, a Derby native who is an actor, the second vice president of Save Our Sterling and the keeper of the group's ever-growing publicity scrapbook.
Mr. Izzo said the house where Commodore Hull -- the commander of the U.S.S. Constitution in the War of 1812 -- lived in Derby was torn down years ago.
"I don't want to see that happen with the Sterling," he said. "It is the old cliche that you do not know what you have till it's gone. We've already lost a generation that doesn't know the history of the Sterling."
In fact, the opera house was scheduled for demolition in the 1970's, but was saved by the efforts of the late Vivian Kellems, a Connecticut industrialist and patron of the arts. 
The Sterling Opera House's history -- most of it oral and gleaned from old newspaper clips -- is a mixture of cultural and political legends as well. It was built in 1889 to serve as both a theater and civic center for the Lower Naugatuck Valley towns of Ansonia, Derby, Shelton and Seymour. 
Mr. Dunne, Derby's development director, said the opera house was responsible for what is now Ansonia splitting off from Derby.
"One faction wanted the opera house built near one border and the other said no," Dunne said. 
In its heyday, Houdini performed a daring escape; Earhart addressed the local Women's Club in 1936; the former heavyweight champion John L. Sullivan played Simon Legree in a production of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and the silent-film maker D. W. Griffith was so pleased at the reception of his 1915 movie, "Birth of a Nation," in Derby that he used the theater to try out several other films.
A walk through the dark, musty theater offers hints to its past. The ornate curlicues of its brass railings are intact, as are the gilded backings of the orchestra seats, which lay piled along one side of the theater.
There were no box seats, but two "piano boxes" are still situated on either side of the stage to accommodate the two pianos donated by the Sterling Piano Factory, once Derby's largest manufacturing employer and the theater's namesake. Charles Sterling, the owner, died two years before the opera house opened.
On the walls of the dressing rooms under the stage are remnants of posters advertising the shows. On some of the faded and torn posters are the words: "Haverly's Minstrels, May 1889": "Two Little Vagrants, A Powerful Melodrama, April 10, 1900"; and "The Queens of Ballet, A Novel Terpsichordean Feature. A Happy Celebration of Song, Ballet and Harmonious Costume Coloring." On this poster appears a drawing of men in ballet costumes. 
The trap door in the floor of the stage still works. Standing in the center of the stage offers a breath-taking view of the orchestra, mezzanine and balcony, home to the "cheap seats" -- broad wooden benches that stretch from one end to the other.
"We've been told by experts that the acoustics in this place surpass those at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City," Mr. Dunne said.
Gary Harger of Orange, who has appeared in Broadway and opera productions and has sung pro bono at the opera house to raise money for its restoration, can attest to Mr. Dunne's praise of the theater's sound quality. At one such event, Mr. Harger sang "Antoinette Birby," a song written by Cole Porter about a "maiden who lived way out in Derby." Mr. Porter attended Yale University in nearby New Haven.
"At a gathering for the theater early this fall, I chose to sing 'Music of the Night' from 'Phantom of the Opera' because it feels like there is a ghostly presence in the theater," Mr. Harger said.
"From the couple of times that I've stood up on the stage and sung, no matter what pitch or tone or volume level, my voice seems to sail out from stage area over the entire audience. I've sung in the bigger opera companies in San Francisco and at Avery Fisher Hall and Carnegie Hall and although this is smaller it's along the same lines."
Mrs. Seccombe, who lives in Ansonia, said she attended one of the recent fund-raising events held by Save Our Sterling at the opera house.
"The theater was pretty gutted, but I couldn't believe when I saw that the balcony rose as high as it did," she said. "When I was standing on stage and singing as a young girl, I don't remember seeing that.
"People had to climb all those stairs; that's where my parents sat during my performance. I hope I'm still around to see it when it reopens."

HEADLINE: OPINION; 
An Invitation to Join 'Team Nassau'

BYLINE:  By THOMAS R. SUOZZI; Thomas R. Suozzi is county executive of Nassau County.

 BODY:
JUDGE EUGENE NICKERSON'S death on the day of my inauguration has prompted me to reflect on his legacy and to seek instruction from it. Eugene H. Nickerson assumed the office of county executive shortly before I was born in 1962. He was the first Democratic county executive in Nassau's history and took office near the peak of the incredible growth of the county, which went from 550,000 residents in 1950 to 1.1 million residents in 1960. 
 He had a big vision for America's first suburban county, full of optimism, money in the bank, a passion for government and a compassion for people. Judge Nickerson grew the government in response to the county's growth; he preserved open space and more than doubled the park acreage; he implemented new social services, built a new hospital and upgraded the jail and the Department of Public Works. 
 Now, four decades later, I am confronted with an enormous deficit, crumbling infrastructure and a general depression throughout the county workforce. To confront these problems brought on by decades of machine politics and poor management, I will be guided by the idealism and courage of Judge Nickerson.
While my plans for the county must be different because of the passage of time, fiscal realities, unplanned growth and irresponsible government, I also share his vision of the "best county in the country." We will solve the county's fiscal crisis and encourage economic growth.
The key to our success, in addition to procedure, process and technology worthy of our 21st century $2 billion dollar enterprise, will be to inspire county workers to understand that no job is unimportant or routine and that workers will be rewarded based upon their performance, not their political connections.
Since taking office I have begun touring various county buildings, seeing first-hand the damage that comes with the indifference of putting politics before people. Many if not all of these facilities are suffering from disrepair: cracked walls, broken windows, offices without computers, broken toilets. These buildings stand as a testament to machine politics and its crippling effects on the important work of government. To accomplish our goals and solve these problems we will need a team -- Team Nassau. Will you join us?
I suggest that President Bush's call to "go about your business" includes the business of county and local government. It includes rebuilding our hometowns, solving the problems we face here in Nassau and fulfilling our potential to remake ourselves as the best county in the country. Your participation in solving the county's problems will be your opportunity to celebrate our democracy and the freedom we enjoy.
We will solve the county's fiscal woes, and we will deliver a government that is worthy of our people.
Let me end as I began, thinking about Judge Nickerson's legacy as an inspiration for my mission as county executive. He dreamed big dreams of a great county and built great things. My task may be different, but my dream is the same. We will do more with less. Our employees will be rewarded based on their performance. Our citizens, our customers, will be well served. Most of all I will aspire to be as Gene Nickerson -- a man of integrity, compassion, vision, great accomplishment and an endearing temperament.

HEADLINE: Bonjour, Teacher. Guten Tag, Too. 

BYLINE:  By ADAM BOWLES 

 BODY:
WHEN the International School at Dundee opened in Greenwich more than a year ago, the founders of the magnet school insisted that foreign language be treated equally with other, more traditional elementary subjects, such as math and English. 
 Now, the district wants to extend a similar language program to all its elementary schools, insuring that all its approximately 4,400 students learn a language other than English. 
 "Research suggests that children who learn a second language early on are apt to become multilingual, become more proficient in their native language and score better in their achievement tests," said Douglas Fainelli, the principal of Dundee. "We feel very strongly that this is not enrichment, this is important learning that all children should have."
Since at least 1993, there has been a steady but significant increase in foreign -- now more commonly called world -- language programs across the state, particularly in elementary schools. 
And, it appears the Sept. 11 attacks will lead to an even greater surge in these programs as educators insist on closing the gap between what students learn and what they know about other cultures and languages. 
A regional vocational high school in Bridgeport is teaching Mandarin Chinese for the first time this year. A state association of business executives has started a pilot program this year in which members visit Connecticut students to promote interest in learning other languages. And at least a handful of schools, including Canterbury, have recently reinstated world language programs that were cut from their budgets several years ago.
Mary Ann Hansen, a world language consultant at the Connecticut Department of Education, said she has been getting about five calls a week from school districts who are interested in starting a world language program. Typically, she gets only two such calls a month. 
Ms. Hansen said the terrorist attacks revealed a high level of ignorance among students toward Arabs and the rest of the world.
"It made people think seriously about how we've missed the opportunity to train our children in languages," Ms. Hansen said. "It showed us we're too isolated. We don't understand the cultures of the world. Education is a nonmilitary response to Sept. 11."
Christine Brown, director of foreign languages at Glastonbury Public Schools, said there are parallels between when the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957 and the events of Sept. 11.
"We didn't know about Sputnik because we didn't have experts in the country to speak Russian to monitor their scientific progress," Ms. Brown said. "We still don't understand how people think and you can't get that through English. Many people didn't understand the linguistic complexities and the 50 different languages spoken near the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is not a new message, but the difference is people may be listening because of the events that have occurred in the last two months."
Soon after Sputnik, the National Defense Education Act was enacted and Glastonbury received a $1 million federal grant to create new learning methodologies using the latest technology, namely the tape recorder. 
Now, as president-elect of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, Ms. Brown is among the nation's leaders who are calling for more language programs to keep up with the rest of the world. But even before the attacks there were significant enrollment increases in world language classes in Connecticut. 
From 1993 to 2001, high school enrollment in this subject increased 21 percent to 84,104 students. During that same time, the number of schools that provided world language to students before grade 8 jumped to 271, up from 98, and the number of districts with such a program nearly doubled from 75 to 143. There are 169 school districts in Connecticut.
But the largest percentage increase took place among younger students. In 2001, there were 31 districts and 60 schools that taught world language before fourth grade, compared with just six districts and 14 schools in 1993.
Nationally, about one in five elementary schools reported teaching foreign languages in 1987, according to a survey by the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington. In 1997, about one in three elementary schools reported teaching foreign languages.
Nancy Rhodes, one of the authors of the study, said while the increase in foreign language elementary programs is positive, it still is not adequate.
"We only have 32 percent of elementary schools offering foreign language programs," she said. "When you look at the whole scheme of things there needs to be much more."
Ms. Rhodes added that while many high school students may be bilingual, most foreign students are multilingual, with some learning up to four languages.
Still, technological upgrades have enabled schools here to link with students in other countries, particularly through e-mail pen pal programs and video conferences. Also, recent research showed that the younger a child is exposed to a different language, the easier it is to learn it and the easier it becomes to master complex languages in college.
State curriculum guidelines in 1998 urged schools to incorporate the proficiency of another language and knowledge of other cultures into the core of their curriculums.
The Connecticut Department of Education has added cultural ignorance to its list of top concerns that already include achievement gaps and teacher shortages, a priority noted in the back-to-school speech of Theodore S. Sergi, the education commissioner. 
"Do we believe that American 10-year-olds know as much about China as their Chinese counterparts know about America? No, and in this respect, we may be far behind much of the rest of the world," he said. 
"Have we sufficiently studied other countries, languages, cultures, their history and arts, their governments and economics, their geography and resources, and their strengths and needs? No. and we are missing a great opportunity for learning," he added.
Enrollment is increasing despite the state not requiring it for high school graduation. Some districts offer optional courses on the subject; others make it mandatory. 
Spanish, with an enrollment in the year 2000 of more than 54,700 students, is easily the most common world language taught in Connecticut schools. French (16,419), Latin (5,517), Italian (2,932) and German (1,296) rounded out the top five. 
There were more than 320,000 Hispanics living in Connecticut, according to the 2000 census, or a 50 percent increase from 1990.
"We have a larger number of Hispanic people in this country," Ms. Rhodes said. "Within the U.S., it is a useful language."
But schools also teach less traditional languages such as Russian and Portuguese. A few schools even teach Chinese.
John Curtis, principal/supervisor of the Bridgeport Regional Vocational Aquaculture School, said the high school introduced classes in Mandarin Chinese for the first time this year. The aquaculture school, which focuses on marine science and marine technology, has a student exchange and distance learning program with counterparts in China, where there is a strong fisheries industry. Ten students are enrolled in the optional program. Mr. Curtis said fluency in the language will give his students an edge in their careers.
"China is a major supplier of aquacultural products throughout the world," he said. "Kids are responding to this very favorably. They are conversant already." 
The biggest obstacle to further enrollment expansion is the lack of certified world language teachers, not finances, Ms. Hansen said. She estimated that there is a demand for about 60 teachers statewide, which would allow about 6,000 more students to learn another language. Another 60 teachers have only temporary permits and are not fully qualified. 
"The shortages are increasing," Ms. Hansen said. "Some districts are not considering starting programs because there are no teachers."
State partnerships with education government ministries in Italy and Spain have provided more teachers to Connecticut and has helped eased the shortage. The partnership with Spain, for instance, has allowed 55 education students in Spain to teach in schools here, including three teachers in Montville. 
Also, recent changes to the state's Alternate Route to Certification summer program means 60 additional teachers, not just 30, will be made available to schools every year to teach a world language.
The state has asked colleges to provide more world language teaching programs and has encouraged elementary school teachers, whose native tongue is other than English, to become certified world language teachers.
Richard Kusland of New Haven and a member of the International Executives Resource Group, started a pilot program this year in which business leaders from his association visit Connecticut schools to talk about the importance of understanding other cultures and learning other languages.
"There is a disconnect between the business world and education as it relates to international relations," said Mr. Kusland, who speaks Mandarin Chinese, Japanese and French. "International relations, not just language, are extremely important if we are going to be able to function in a world that we are a part of and not to be isolationists. With only one language you only think about the world in a certain way."
Canterbury recently reinstated a world language program. Budget cuts several years ago forced the school to drop Spanish. Now it is taught in grades 5-8. The older students take Spanish four times a week; the younger ones take it once a week.
"They absolutely love it," the principal, Kathleen Boyhan-Mauf, said. "The community itself recognizes the importance of the students understanding diverse cultures. I've had several parents excited about it."
Donna Way is one of them. She said she was expecting good things for her son Kyle, a sixth-grader, now that he is taking Spanish classes and believed it is especially important because of the increase in Spanish-speaking residents in the state. She regretted that her oldest child was never taught a world language in elementary or middle school. 
"I think it's going to be a great advantage for Kyle," she said. "It will help him to mix in with other kids and will help him in the job force." 
Ms. Brown in Glastonbury said parents move to her district just so their children can enroll in its foreign language program, which includes Spanish, French, Russian, and Latin beginning in ninth grade.
Recently, a parent from Virginia called for more information about these classes. Ms. Brown added that several graduates have gone on to begin careers in Russia and land key jobs in the defense and humanitarian sectors because of their knowledge of the Russian language and culture.
Fields Memorial School in Bozrah is one of the more than 100 elementary schools that still do not have a world language program. David Easterly, the superintendent, said that every year during budget talks people advocate for such a program.
But it would cost the district more than $40,000 to pay for a first-year teacher's salary, benefits and curriculum materials. So far, the school board hasn't approved money for the program.
The debate will pick up again during the new budget season, and when it does, Mr. Easterly said, it would be painful to have to decide against a world language program simply because of financial limits.
"From my perspective it is extremely important that students learn more about the languages and cultures of other nations," he said. "Hopefully, we will see our way clear on this."

HEADLINE: A Walk Along the Water Is Not a Simple Matter 

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: POINT PLEASANT BEACH 

 BODY:
GIOVANNI DA VERRAZANO didn't need the public trust doctrine when he became the first European to visit the Jersey Shore in 1524.
 But in the half-millennium since then -- particularly over the past decade -- development of private enclaves along New Jersey's beaches and riverbanks has repeatedly forced advocates of free access to the waterfront to invoke the 1,500-year-old public trust doctrine to force property owners to open their shores. 
 Even now, as chill winds keep beaches and walkways empty of all but the heartiest romantics, fisherman and a smattering of bundled up young mothers with strollers, there are negotiations playing out that will help determine who can use New Jersey's hallowed shores and golden coasts, and even whether they have to stand waist-deep in the water to do that.
For Bill Neyenhouse -- the Hudson River waterfront coordinator for the State Department of Environmental Protection and the man leading New Jersey's effort to line the 18.5 miles of Hudson River and New York Bay shoreline with a walkway from the Bayonne to the George Washington Bridge -- March 20, 2001, was a day he is not likely to forget. 
It was on that blustery morning that Mr. Neyenhouse went to the river armed with a court order he had obtained after the state's victory in a lawsuit against Shelter Bay -- an exclusive enclave of celebrities and other privacy seekers with breathtaking views of Manhattan -- to physically remove a section of chain link fence.
It was a full decade earlier, in 1991, that Shelter Bay had first been ordered by the department to remove the fence. 
"That was a particular case where I'd been involved from the beginning," recalled Mr. Neyenhouse, who had spent his summers as a youth at the Jersey Shore. "So it was a good feeling not only to be there, but to take wrench in hand and unbolt the sections of fence."
Without the public trust doctrine, which has its roots in ancient Rome, much of the Western world's coastline might be entirely off limits to the public. Indeed, the public trust doctrine is the fundamental legal principle implicit in state laws guaranteeing access to beaches and riverfronts, even if they are privately owned.
According to the modern oracle of waterfont wisdom and law -- the Web site of the federal Environmental Protection Agency -- the Roman Emperor Justinian asked his legal scholars in A.D. 530 to put all of the laws of the empire in writing. The result was the Institutes of Justinian, which included the provision that "by the law of nature these things are common to all mankind; the air, running water, the sea and consequently the shores of the sea." Thus was public trust was born. 
Rome, of course, fell. But like the pounding of the surf, the public trust doctrine has reverberated through the ages. It was absorbed into the legal systems of many European nations, including England, which passed it on to the American colonies.
Today, nearly every state, including New Jersey, has incorporated the doctrine into its laws.
In one of the most prominent ongoing cases, residents of Point Pleasant Beach could further define what public access means when it comes to private property above and below the water line. At its core, the case pits the privacy interests of property owners against the public's access to the waterfront.
Farther north, on the west bank of the Hudson, state regulations that went into effect in 1988 requiring developers to build and maintain public walkways along the 18.5-mile stretch between Bayonne and Fort Lee have angered some waterfront property owners, including those at Shelter Bay.
For a year before Mr. Neyenhouse of the state environmental agency removed the gate, Shelter Bay had actually been unlocking it to allow public access to the walkway during the same hours Veterans Park was open, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. said Ray Gonzalez, president of the RPM Group, the company that manages Shelter Bay.
But Mr. Neyenhouse said the gate and guardhouse that Shelter Bay had installed effectively deterred the public, though Mr. Gonzalez said that for a year before the gate was removed and since then, there had been no incidents reported involving intrusion on residents' privacy or safety.
"It wasn't like we put up a neon sign that said, 'Come, we're open,' " Mr. Gonzalez said. "That walkway was always open to the public. What the state objected to was the appearance of the closure."
In Jersey City, a newly formed tenants organization at the mushrooming Newport development are pressing city officials and the developer, the Lefrak Organization, to build a waterfront park on an abandoned pier. But the LeFrak family, a major contributor to the Guggenheim Museum, wants to build a cultural center there.
Just as the cases involving Point Pleasant Beach, Newport and Shelter Bay fall under the same legal principal, the public trust doctrine, they have come to a head for essentially the same reason: burgeoning growth. As the state's economy boomed in the 1990's, developers scrambled to make the most of the increased demand for beachfront homes and riverfront condominiums, sometimes at the expense of public access.
In New Jersey, the public trust doctrine is implicit in the Waterfront Development Act, a statute dating from 1916, which is now concerned mainly with regulating the Hudson River and New York Harbor waterfronts. A federal law, the Coastal Area Facilities Review Act, better known by the acronym Cafra, regulates coastlines, which in the Garden State means the shores of the Raritan Bay, the Atlantic coast and the Delaware Bay. 
There is also the federal Coastal Zone Management Act, which requires states to assess the status of coastal issues -- including public access -- every three years. In August, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Office of Coastal Planning issued its most recent status report, which is required for federal financing of state projects. The report cites the public trust doctrine as the main tool in gaining or protecting public access.
Moreover, the report said, "The demand for access would increase proportionately as the coastal population increased. A review of the 2000 census confirms that. The population of New Jersey rose to 8,414,350 from 7,730,188 in 1990, an increase of 8.9 percent. In addition, the more urban areas along the Hudson, the Delaware and the Raritan, the demand for public access is likely to increase as water quality continues to improve and as the areas are redeveloped."
The report continues: "The public trust doctrine, which was enunciated by the New Jersey Supreme Court in several decisions, requires that tidal water bodies be accessible to the public for navigation, fishing and recreation. The court also recognized the 'increasing demand for our state's beaches and the dynamic nature of the public trust doctrine' and found that the public must have access to and use of privately owned dry sand areas as reasonably necessary to use the tidal water bodies."
The extent of the public's access -- or lack of it -- to the waterfront is difficult to gauge, the report found. While the state routinely demands that the public have access to the waterfront before it grants any developer permission to build, over time those points of access become obscured because signs are replaced or even removed -- sometimes deliberately.
But according to the latest report, the state environmental agency "lacks current accurate information regarding the location and extent of public access areas and lacks long-term monitoring of conditions at these locations."
To try to remedy the situation, the state will begin to compile an inventory of waterfront public access sites beginning in October.
The public's access to dry sand is especially relevant in Point Pleasant Beach, where negotiations are now taking place among property owners, borough and state officials and advocates of public access to determine just how public some privately owned beachfront should be.
Advocates for both private property and public access agree that the point where property owners have the right to exclude the public is mean high tide, or high water mark. Essentially, this is the spot farthest inland reached by the water at high tide. In theory, this dividing line between public and exclusive use gives anyone the right to walk, sit, fish or engage in any other proper use on sand that is, at most, dampened by the lapping of the waves. 
The problem is that the mean high tide mark tends to shift because of tidal changes as well as the narrowing of beaches because of erosion. As a result, the legal mean high water mark can be different from nature's. In Point Pleasant Beach in recent years, this has meant the legal mean high tide mark is somewhere waste deep in the ocean, a situation that advocates for beach access say is absurd. 
Ann Alexander, executive director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Rutgers University, who is representing an organization called Citizens' for the Right to Access Beaches, or CRAB, in the negotiations, believes the court's reference to dry sand provides a basis to assert the public's right to use the beach above the mean high-tide mark. The state has proposed a distance of 10 feet above.
The controversy in Point Pleasant Beach swelled after members of the citizens' group complained to the state that they were being denied access to beaches that at one time had been privately owned, but by companies that permitted access to the beach for a fee.
The problem, the organization said, was that the borough rezoned the property several years ago to allow single-family homes to be built, and that the homeowners were not willing to provide access to the public -- even for a fee.
Since then, the organization says, borough police have routinely told non-homeowners to leave the beach.
Bill Hiering Jr., the borough attorney, said that after a hotel proposal for the site fell through, leaving the site's previous owner bankrupt, single-family homes were the only way to develop the property.
"I think the borough was just trying to see something viable there," Mr. Hiering said of the zoning change.
Last May, the state wrote letters to the borough and to homeowners asserting they were violating terms of waterfront development permits. One problem, lawyers said, was that the terms of public access were never precisely defined.
On a recent Saturday, a dozen members of thye citizens' group gathered on the sandy shoulder of Ocean Avenue in Point Pleasant Beach between the Paradise Beach and Bay Point Dunes subdivisions. Large, newly constructed homes are wedged together on narrow lots, straddling a similarly narrow, slightly winding development road, Beacon Lane, named after the beach it parallels.
One specific provision of the waterfront permit issued by the state to the two subdivisions was that access to the ocean would be through a 10-foot-wide sandy ally between houses. At the Ocean Avenue entrance to the ally, barely visible to traffic, is a small sign reading, "Beach Access, Open to the Public," illustrated by a stick figure marching into a set of minimalist waves as gulls fly overhead.
"I've been enjoying this stretch of beach since the 1960's, surfing, swimming, fishing," said Ralph Cipolla, 49, a member of the citizens' group and longtime shore resident. "I've surfed up and down the East Coast, the West Coast, the Caribbean, Hawaii, and it's the only place I've been pulled out of the water by a security guard and told the ocean is private property."
"The surfers call this sewer beach," said Ed Sirchio, the organization's president. 
Raymond D. Bogan, a lawyer who represents the Bay Point Dunes Homeowners Association in the negotiations, said the public has the right to walk down to below the mean high-water mark within the 10-foot access corridor, then head into the waves or turn right or left and move up and down the beach. 
"My position is, they certainly have the right to stroll, to fish, do whatever they want beyond the watermark," Mr. Bogan said. "On the other hand, do they have the right to utilize the upland property? My position is that no, they don't. They have the right to get over that property."
But Ms. Alexander cited a 1984 New Jersey Supreme decision that involved a suit by non-residents against a homeowners association that had limited the sale of beach badges to Bay Head residents only. Ms. Alexander said the court found that the public should indeed be able to remain on dry sand above the mean high-water mark.
Referring to Mr. Bogan's position, she said, "I think to the extent that he's saying the public has no right to any of the dry sand area, he's simply wrong."
John Ely, president of the Paradise Beach Association, another group involved in the talks, said he had no problem with the notion of the public enjoying the ocean near his house. But as a practical matter, Mr. Ely said, visitors leave garbage strewn on the sand and even demand to use the rest rooms of homeowners.
If the state wants the public to have access to this beach, Mr. Ely believes, it should condemn it and compensate him, and then hire lifeguards and litter patrols. Otherwise, he said, the state has no right to impose that responsibility on homeowners.
"We own this property," said Mr. Ely, 61, a contractor who lives in New Brunswick. "This is America. Who can tell you people can go on your property?"
While citizen activists are often critical of state agencies -- often accusing them of being in league with industrial polluters or other commercial interests -- waterfront access seems to be one area in which official efforts are roundly praised by activists.
In August 1999, when the dispute over Shelter Bay was raging, the state also prevailed in a related suit filed in federal court against the Department of Environmental Protection by the New Jersey Builders Association and its national affiliate. The builders argued that the walkway requirement amounted to an unconstitutional taking of private property. But in what Ms. Alexander and others termed a landmark decision, Judge Garrett E. Brown of United States District Court in Newark rejected the builders' arguments. 
Citing the public trust doctrine, Judge Brown found that 15.4 miles of the 18.5-mile waterfront walkway was fill that had once been underwater, and therefore reserved for the public's use. For the 3.1 miles of waterfront that had historically been dry land, Judge Brown found that the walkway rules were well within the state's authority to regulate land use.
Patrick O'Keefe, chief executive of the New Jersey Builders Association, said he was discouraged by the recent court decisions and feared that property rights were being eroded like so much New Jersey beachfront.
"I think the direction of the law places a cloud over the ownership of all the shorefront property in New Jersey," Mr. OKeefe said.
Mr. O'Keefe warned that carrying the public trust doctrine to its extreme, particularly as applied by Judge Brown, the principle could be invoked to strip property owners of their rights on barrier islands from Bay Head to Beach Haven.
A common complaint among property rights advocates in the waterfront access debate is that the state has been unwilling to put its money where its mouth is. While the state is eager to force owners to provide the public with access to their waterfront property, it has been reluctant to publicly finance waterfront access projects, including purchasing waterfront property from private owners.
The result of that reluctance, Mr. O'Keefe and others said, was that property owners were unfairly penalized for living along the beach, and the walkway has evolved in a peacemeal fashion -- still incomplete after 13 years -- as the state waits for the waterfront to be privately developed. 
But the state has developed its own stretches of walkway. Perhaps the most notable example is the one at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, with its stunning views of New York Bay, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. 
In Hoboken -- where the classic "On the Waterfront" was filmed -- walkways and waterfront parks opposite Manhattan are on property owned by private developers, the state, the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It is a model of public planning enthusiastically endorsed by the crowds that flock to the waterfront there, and envied by residents of nearby communities.
But there are also stretches of waterfront that even the most optimistic advocates concede may not be accessible to the public in the foreseeable future. These are typically occupied by businesses -- a Hess oil depot in Edgewater, for example -- that have continuously operated since before 1988, and therefore are exempt from the walkway requirement. Fortunately, Mr. Neyenhouse pointed out, these remaining, inaccessible stretches will be subject to walkway rules if they are converted to new uses.
One location about to add a new stretch of walkway is the Newport complex in Jersey City. Some residents of the 600-acre development saw the request for additional office space on the site's last remaining 31 acres as an opportunity to persuade the developer to turn a six-ace peninsula into a waterfront park.
In the end, the residents and city officials who intervened on their behalf failed to win the park concession from the developer, the LeFrak organization. But they did exact something else: a 2005 deadline for completion of Newport's stretch of the walkway. 
"I think thats a good thing," Ms. Coe said.
The deadline is significant, in that it goes beyond the state's 1988 regulations, which only require that developers build a walkway at the time they develop their property.
"Were trying to nudge things along," said Stan Eason, a spokesman for Mayor Glenn Cunningham of Jersey City, referring to the 2005 deadline. "The mayor stepped in and said, hold on, youve got a whole lot of people who live down there who want to have some input."
The walkway also runs through Weehawken, West New York, North Bergen and Fort Lee, and other citizens groups are fighting similar battles to make their waterfronts more accessible.
Richard LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, said his company had already provided 3,200 feet of walkway at Newport at a cost of $9 million.
"Do I think its a nice amenity, yes, I think its a nice amenity," Mr. LeFrak said. "Not only for my tenants, I think everybody in the community has enjoyed the walkway."
Regarding the peninsula, Mr. LeFrak said, the entire perimeter would be ringed by the walkway, plus a 1.4-acre pier jutting from the peninsula will be made into a park.
But there always comes a point when property owners assert their rights, which Mr.k O'Keefe pointed out are established under the Fifth Amendment, providing for just compensation when land is taken for public use. Making the public pay for public amenities, including waterfront access, is the whole point of the condemnation process, said Mr. LeFrak, who warned against trying to push developers and other waterfront property owners too far.
"There is a limited amount of public infrastructure that can be extracted from the development community," Mr. LeFrak said. "The state always has the option of condemning property and paying for a park. The last time I looked my name wasn't the State of New Jersey."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE; 
Big Loco, Shy Girl and Friends: A Debate About Stereotypes

BYLINE:  By ADRIAN BRUNE 

 BODY:
When children in most New York neighborhoods plug a coin into a gum-ball machine, a toy car or tiny space alien is likely to roll down the slot into the waiting hands below.
 But in largely black and Latino neighborhoods like the South Bronx, especially at the local chain supermarkets like C-Town, the most coveted prizes are miniature plastic figures wearing baggy jeans, knit caps and bandannas, otherwise known as the Homies. 
 Homies are an offshoot of a comic strip of the same name created by David Gonzalez, a California graphic artist, that first appeared in the mid-90's in Lowrider Magazine. In 1998 they made their way East as two-inch gum-ball machine miniatures. 
As their tale has unfolded in the comic strip, the Homies are a group of tightly knit Chicano buddies raised in the bleakness of the Mexican-American barrio of East Los Angeles. Their culture involves cruising around in low-riding cars, rapping at local hangouts and picking up scantily clad women. Fellows like Pelon, Smiley, Eightball, Mr. Raza, Droopy and Big Loco hang out at the local taco stand and trade provocative remarks with Babydoll, CatEyes, Bouncy and Shy Girl.
Ask a random sampling of people on the streets of the South Bronx if the Homies accurately represent them and their neighbors, and they will mostly answer no. At the Point, for example, a community development center, many young people in the after-school program are outfitted not in gangster garb but in Abercrombie & Fitch or the Gap. 
"They depict people from the West Coast," said Wilfredo Feliciano, a member of the graffiti collective Tats Cru, who nonetheless contributes to the collection of Homies in the collective's office on Garrison Avenue.
"We know the guy that makes these," added Mr. Feliciano, who was wearing work boots, jeans and a yellow T-shirt. "They are funny because each one represents what many of our friends look like."
But despite their appeal, the Homies do not win universal praise; a Latino supermarket chain in Los Angeles County pulled the toys from its gum-ball machines in 1999 after the police and prosecutors complained.
"I would not let my daughter play with a woman figurine that is dressed like a slut or something," said Tanisha Thompson, a 23-year-old mother from the South Bronx. "It's bad enough that there is already such a negative interpretation of this neighborhood."
Others, however, see the Homies simply as yet another art form, like rap and graffiti, that is unique to the urban community. 
"I don't see anything negative about them," said Cinderella Martin, an administrator at the Point. "The way they dress is just the way they are." 
Gesturing toward one of the little figures, she added: "This guy right here looks like most of the artists who come to the Point. What's negative about that?" ADRIAN BRUNE

Fortunoff Is Set to Begin Major White Plains Project

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
FORTUNOFF, the Long-Island based jewelry and home furnishings retailer, is about to start work on a 180,000-square-foot store in White Plains on the site of a closed Saks Fifth Avenue store. The change will bring the first full-size Fortunoff store to Westchester County, while marking the departure of Saks from the county after almost 50 years. 
 The company, which also has a store on Fifth Avenue in New York City and four other suburban stores, will build an additional 80,000 square feet in its building for other tenants, possibly including a restaurant. Saks, whose store at the site was 128,000 square feet. announced its plan to close its Westchester store in June, saying its interests would best be met by "concentrating our resources on our other locations in the surrounding area." 
 The department store's closest outlets are in Stamford and Greenwich in Connecticut and in Manhattan. The shuttering of the White Plains store is one of several Saks Fifth Avenue closings within the past two years. In all, Saks Inc. operates 61 Saks Fifth Avenue stores.
The old department store building in White Plains, which contains pockets of encapsulated asbestos, according to city officials, is to be razed.
The opening of the new Fortunoff is part of a larger redevelopment effort in downtown White Plains, according to Teri Waivada, executive director of the county's Industrial Development Agency.Officials and merchants hope that new retail development in the city -- particularly Cappelli Development's construction of a $300 million retail, entertainment and residential complex on a former Macy's department store site at Mamaroneck Avenue and Main Street -- will inject new life in the downtown area, which, outside of several retail malls, has been struggling in recent years.
White Plains, often called the City of 1,000 Stores in the 1940's and 1950's, has experienced a high vacancy rate in its downtown retail area in the past decade, with the smaller stores on Mamaroneck Avenue and the side streets languishing in the shadow of the malls.
Several blocks away from the small stores along Mamaroneck Avenue, Saks has stood by itself for much of the past decade, across the street from and in competition with The Westchester, a million-square-foot mall, built in the early 1990's and anchored by Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. In 1998, Saks considered a $65 million project involving 155,000 square feet of small shops next to a renovated Saks. But the project never proceeded.
ALTHOUGH Fortunoff will also stand apart from the city's two major retail malls -- the Galleria Mall and The Westchester -- its planners expect it to fare better than Saks. "Fortunoff is a separate destination in its own right, offering a very large selection of housewares and jewelry and not competing with anyone else," Ms. Waivada said.
Fortunoff, a privately held company, is predicting $90 million in sales for its first year of operation in White Plains, and this would translate to $2.4 million in city sales taxes annually, said Paul S. Wood, coordinator of economic development for White Plains. Saks generated $18 million in sales in 2000 and about $600,000 in tax revenues for the city.
The new Fortunoff is expected to have 600 full- and part-time workers. In June, Saks said it employed about 100 people at the White Plains site.
Mr. Wood said the city had been courting Fortunoff for several years and was pleased when the Saks site at 100 Bloomingdale Avenue -- the street also has a longstanding Bloomingdale's store -- became available.
Fortunoff paid $14 million for the Saks Fifth Avenue building and six acres of land on which it is located, said Louis Fortunoff, the retailer's vice president. 
Mr. Fortunoff, who is the grandson of the Max and Clara Fortunoff, who opened the doors of their first store in Brooklyn in 1922, said demographic studies indicated a move to Westchester would be propitious. In addition to its Fifth Avenue store, the chain has suburban stores in Westbury on Long Island and in Wayne, Woodbridge and Paramus in New Jersey.
Mr. Fortunoff said the retailer locates in areas where there are 200,000 households with an average household income of $75,000 or more within a 15-mile radius. "When we get that, we're pretty happy," he said, adding that Fortunoff tested out Westchester with an outdoor-furniture store in Scarsdale that it first opened in 2000. "That store did well," Mr. Fortunoff said. "It was the confirmation we needed." The Scarsdale store is open only during the warm months.
He also presented material to the city citing statistics from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that Westchester residents annually spend $114 million on jewelry, $959 million on home furnishings and $506 million on housewares, appliances and tabletop items like china, crystal and silverware.
After considering other sites in White Plains, Fortunoff decided on the Saks site, opposite The Westchester, which attracts many well-to-do customers. Because it is not practical to construct a bridge between the mall and the new Fortunoff site, the city will spend $2 million to improve pedestrian access between the two sites, Mr. Wood said. The money will cover curb, water main and sidewalk work; traffic signals; and underground wiring.
White Plains was designed with an emphasis on its roads -- to facilitate the efficient movement of vehicles transporting workers in the city's office buildings, especially during rush hours. "Now we're hoping to encourage more pedestrian traffic," Mr. Wood said. "We're looking to make White Plains more of a 24-hour city."
Last month, the White Plains Common Council approved plans for Fortunoff's retail center after the company made several changes to allay neighbors' concerns. Initially, neighbors objected to the proposal, saying it would further disrupt life in their quiet neighborhood of one- and two-family homes.
Residents were worried about noise, exhaust fumes and other pollution; increased traffic; and cars parking on side streets in front of their houses.
IN response to their concerns, Fortunoff has agreed to enclose its loading dock, which is near a private backyard, and move a proposed service road to make room for a planted buffer zone. In addition, asbestos removal will be carefully monitored when Saks is demolished, and construction workers will be instructed to park on site or in specially designated areas. 
While the city of White Plains is offering no specific financial incentives to Fortunoff, the county will issue $90 million to $110 million in taxable bonds, Ms. Waivada said. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds will be dispersed to Fortunoff to pay construction costs, and the interest and principal on the bonds will be repaid by the company, which has made a commitment to have the store in operation by December 2003. The bonds are typically purchased by corporations or banks looking for short-term liquid investments.
The developer is also receiving state and local sales tax breaks on construction and equipment.
"We're helping Fortunoff because projects like these create jobs and help the tax base," Ms. Waivada said. "We're looking forward to this next step for White Plains."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS; 
Maya MacGuineas, Robin Brooks

 BODY:
Maya Carol MacGuineas and Robin Jermyn Brooks were married yesterday at their home in Washington. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Washington.
 Ms. MacGuineas, 33, is keeping her name. She is a senior fellow specializing in fiscal policy at the New America Foundation, a public policy research institute in Washington. She is also on the boards of Common Cause, the government watchdog organization, and Third Millennium, an organization specializing in public policy issues for people born in the 1960's and 1970's. She graduated from Northwestern and received a master's degree in public policy from Harvard. 
 She is the daughter of D. Biard MacGuineas of Washington and the late Carol Kalish MacGuineas, and is the stepdaughter of Peggy Miller. The bride's father is a partner in the Washington office of Dykema Gossett, a Detroit law firm. Her mother was a freelance writer.
Mr. Brooks, 31, is an economist in the research department at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, where he is working on the impact of globalization on financial markets. He graduated from the London School of Economics and received Master of Arts and Master of Philosophy degrees in economics from Yale, where he also received a Ph.D. in that subject.
He is the son of Val and Jermyn Brooks of Friedrichsdorf, Germany. His father retired as the senior partner for Europe of PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P., in London, and is now an executive director of Transparency International, an organization in Berlin that seeks to increase governmental accountability and uncover corruption. His mother teaches drama at the Phillip-Reiss-Schule, a high school in Friedrichsdorf.
The couple met at the Brookings Institution in 1997, where Mr. Brooks occupied a cubicle outside of Ms. MacGuineas's office when she was a senior research analyst and he was a research fellow. Mr. Brooks said it took several months for him to make it clear that, despite appearances, he was not her personal secretary and did not take memos. Despite the confusion, he said they became fast friends and soon were inseparable as a couple.

HEADLINE: Insurance Bills Provoke Sticker Shock 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
BUILDING owners and residents are doing double-takes these days as they look at their insurance bills and see premiums that have jumped sharply -- even, in a few cases, doubling. 
 With a significant chunk of insurers' assets suddenly dissipated by payouts set aside after the World Trade Center attack -- about $50 billion in claims out of about $140 billion in available capital -- the insurance companies and their network of financial backstops, the reinsurance companies, have taken steps to restuff that cushion against possible future losses. 
 Landlords, co-op shareholders, condominium owners, market-rate renters and even, eventually, rent-regulated tenants will pay the price. Premiums have been increasing by about 30 percent nationwide, and far more for many New York buildings -- 66 percent according to one landlord group's survey.
For now, industry analysts say, owners of private homes, particularly in more suburban environs, will not be hit as hard, though circumstances other than the events of Sept. 11 are expected to also raise premiums on homeowner policies. 
Paul Brensilber is president of Jordan Cooper & Associates, managers of 40 residential buildings with about 6,000 apartments -- most in "core Manhattan," he said, "but not downtown at all."
Last month, when insurance policies for 30 of those buildings were renewed, "the increases averaged 60 percent," Mr. Brensilber said. "And we have another package of properties, luxury buildings, where we've experienced an 87 percent increase."
One of the smaller buildings that Mr. Brensilber's company manages, a 58-unit co-op on the Upper West Side, saw its premium increase from $18,000 to $30,000 a year -- a 66 percent jump. "The owners will get a 75 cent per-share increase, or an average of $207," he said. "It's significant, it hurts."
Daniel Benedict is president of Benedict Properties, which owns 40 buildings with 2,000 apartments, most of them rent-regulated six-story structures in Queens and the Bronx. "My insurance policy expired Oct. 29, just in time for the new rates to come into play," Mr. Benedict said. "The rates increased between 40 and 100 percent. In past jumps, it's been 10 to 12 percent."
"I've seen cycles before," Mr. Benedict said, "but nothing like this."
There have never, of course, been circumstances like this. 
"First of all, the impact will be greatest on multiunit structures that are dense with people," said Robert P. Hartwig, vice president and chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade association. Besides office buildings and other businesses, those structures include co-op, condominium and rental apartment buildings, all of which must carry commercial insurance because they are operated as businesses, usually organized as corporations.
"Now, post-Sept. 11," Mr. Hartwig said, "any building like this could be viewed as a possible target that is attractive to terrorists -- either the structure itself being the target or the structure suffering collateral damage because of proximity to another attractive target." Citing Battery Park City as an example, he said, "It was not the target itself, but nevertheless suffered severe damage."
And while those risks are, as Mr. Hartwig put it, "considerably diminished in places like suburban Yonkers and Dutchess County, or the more rural parts of the metropolitan area," clusters of multifamily buildings and even single-family homes in proximity to less obvious potential targets could also eventually be affected. Those targets could include, according to industry officials, airports, corporate complexes, military bases, port facilities, a stadium, a chemical factory, a power plant.
SOME real estate executives wonder, however, whether the insurance industry is stretching to its own advantage. "Things are so out of control," said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest landlord group in New York City. "Post-9/11, in some respects, gave insurance companies an excuse to really jack up these rates."
"Several companies, both U.S.-based and international," Mr. Strasburg said, "have ceased writing for residential, which reduces competition and further increases pricing."
Mr. Hartwig confirmed that assertion, saying: "It is true that some insurers and reinsurers have stepped back from some lines of insurance in order to limit their potentially catastrophic loss-exposure from terrorist acts. It's not limited to residential."
Mr. Brensilber, whose buildings are facing sizable premium increases even though they are not downtown, said: "What we're being told is that the insurance companies are just considering them high-risk. I can understand high risk -- like my office is right by St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefeller Center. But the Upper East Side or West Side? I don't imagine that would be first and foremost for terrorist activity. I don't understand it."
It has been, to be sure, a course-changing year for the industry. Insurance companies have experienced, as have all others, a drop in the value of the stocks and bonds in which they invest. They have begun to turn away from their decade-old practice of using homeowner insurance -- the policies by which individual home and apartment owners insure their possessions -- as a loss leader; that is, as a discounted lure in a package with other types of more profitable personal policies, like automobile insurance. At the same time, after Sept. 11, many businesses that were underinsured are now clamoring for increased coverage. So there is a squeeze.
Then, on Dec. 20, Congress rejected legislative efforts to create a federal backstop for the industry by which the government would have shared some of the losses in the event of future terrorist attacks.
And so, with the unprecedented "global decrease" in the capital available to pay claims after Sept. 11, Mr. Hartwig of the insurance institute said, there has been upward pressure on premiums. That pressure has also been caused, he said, "by the fact that reinsurers have indicated that they will no longer, in many cases, be willing to provide coverage for terrorist acts."
Reinsurance is, in effect, insurance for the primary insurance companies -- a way of reducing their exposure. And in some instances, particularly for large buildings, the primary insurance company will take out policies with several reinsurers, thereby further spreading the risk.
"You're left with a situation," Mr. Hartwig said, "where fewer primary insurers are holding all the risk for acts of terrorism with no way to spread it out around the globe. For many insurers, this represents an unacceptably high level of risk."
To cover that risk, insurance companies have taken steps other than simply raising rates. While in the past they had offered their good customers credits (discounts on the premium), some companies have reduced or eliminated those credits. Some companies have reclassified policyholders from a "superpreferred" tier to a preferred or standard tier -- classifications based on the age and condition of the building. And in some cases, companies have decided to eliminate coverage in the basic comprehensive policy for certain risks -- like terrorist attacks or the presence of lead -- requiring customers to buy a rider at an additional expense.
But the primary method of raising premiums, other than through the rate, is to increase the valuation on a building. "Typically, when you bought a policy in the past," said Dan Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a group representing about 2,500 landlords in the five boroughs, "you worked with your broker to establish an agreed-upon value for replacement of the building, and the policy premium would be based on that agreed-upon value. Now the insurers are saying they don't agree, essentially saying, 'The building is worth more and we're going to charge you more.' "
Based on several surveys, Mr. Hartwig, the industry representative, estimated that premiums for commercial policies are rising by about 30 percent as they come up for renewal across the country. "So the cost of insuring apartment complexes will rise, nationally, somewhere in that 30 percent range," he said. 
But John Schule, vice president of Smyth, Sanford & Gerard, the chief insurance broker for the Rent Stabilization Association, said that a recent survey of 400 building owners showed that the average rate increase has been 66 percent. "It's for five-unit apartment buildings in the five boroughs on up to 300-unit owners," Mr. Schule said. "The sticker shock has hit them."
And Mr. Margulies of the Community Housing Improvement Association said, "We're seeing typical renewal increases in the 40 to 60 percent range and, in some cases, double." 
With many of his members owning rent-stabilized buildings, Mr. Margulies wondered how the city's Rent Guidelines Board would calculate insurance increases in its annual Price Index of Operating Costs and deliberations over possible raises in regulated rents. "We have a big concern that they won't take full account of the increases," he said. "It's never a straight pass-through, because they look at all the costs -- taxes, oil, labor, supplies, water, legal, insurance -- and then they flip a coin." Officials of the Rent Guidelines Board declined to comment.
Doing some quick calculating, Stuart Saft, chairman of the 2,200-member Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said, "According to the agents I've spoken to, the cost for insuring most buildings is currently 8.5 cents per square foot."
"So let's say you have a building that's 200 feet by 200 feet; that's a footprint of 40,000 square feet," Mr. Saft continued. "If it's 15 stories, the building has 600,000 square feet. If the insurance is 8.5 cents per square foot, the premium would now be $51,000." But last year, he said, "the rate would have been about half of that, so the premium would have been about $25,000."
If the building has 300 apartments, meaning the apartments average 2,000 square feet, "the insurance cost doubles to $170 per apartment," Mr. Saft said, "and that will show up in the maintenance."
Citing an actual renewal, Mr. Saft said a recently constructed building on the Upper East Side that paid $31,035 for insurance last year will pay $49,128 this year -- a 63 percent increase "in a brand new, fully sprinklered building with no loss history."
"There are 76 units," he said, "so the average insurance cost per apartment is going from $408 to $646."
Asked about increases of 50 to 100 percent for buildings in New York, compared with the national average of about 30 percent, Mr. Hartwig said: "Yes, that will happen for some properties. One thing we've learned from Sept. 11 is that terrorists are intent on not only destroying property, but also destroying lives. So a residential structure itself could be targeted."
"I should stress," he added, "that prior to Sept. 11 rates were rising in the 10 to 15 percent range anyway."
Three primary cost-drivers were at work, nationally, before Sept. 11, and still are, Mr. Hartwig said: record losses from natural catastrophes over the last decade, rising rebuilding costs and a slimy black substance called Stachybotrys chartarum -- mold.
The latter, he said, "is a completely new category of suit, and it's having a dramatic impact on the cost of insuring homes and, in some areas, apartment complexes and office buildings."
Last month, 500 tenants and the landlord of Henry Phipps Plaza, an apartment complex in the Kips Bay section along the East River in Manhattan, reached a $1.17 million settlement of a lawsuit over mold that the tenants contended had caused health problems ranging from respiratory disease to hastened deaths. The original suit had sought $12 billion.
BUT even before mold joined the list of cost-drivers, premiums were already rising, particularly because of an increase in natural disasters. In 2001 alone, Mr. Hartwig said, there were 14 named storms across the country, "which is well above average."
"Fortunately, none came up this way," he said. "But 2002 could change all that. In the metro area, there are many homes that are considered at great risk for damage from windstorms, including hurricanes, because they are close to the shore." At the same time, there has been an acceleration in the cost of home repairs, Mr. Hartwig said, caused by, among other things, higher material costs and a shortage of skilled labor.
All of that, he said, raised the cost of homeowners insurance by 6 percent in 2001, and is expected to do the same this year -- after a 1.5 percent increase in 2000.
Stephen Batkin, president of Lampe-Batkin Associates, an independent insurance agency in White Plains, said that while premiums have been inching up, he has not yet seen much change, "from the suburban homeowner's point of view," after Sept. 11. That is true, in part, because state insurance departments review and sometimes trim rate increases for homeowner policies. 
The World Trade Center attack has, however, "caused people to review their policies to see if their coverage is adequate," Mr. Batkin said. "That we've seen a lot of. People finally realized that it is possible to have total losses, and they want to be sure their policy will protect them."
Pointing out that the global tremors from Sept. 11 -- particularly "the uncertainty about reinsurance" -- have yet to ripple through the more tranquil lanes and cul-de-sacs of suburbia, Mr. Batkin said: "We're just waiting to see what will happen. All signs point to a change."
Mr. Benedict, the landlord with many buildings in Queens and the Bronx, was befuddled by it all. "It has nothing to do with claims histories!" he said.
And in Manhattan, Mr. Strasburg of the Rent Stabilization Association, the large landlord group, was both troubled -- about "the double whammy of rate increases and valuation increases" -- and philosophical.
"We believe it's cyclical," he said, "and things will ease off in two years."

HEADLINE: CENSUS; 
A Welcome Mat for Immigrants

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
LIKE many other Cuban families, Felipe Gorostiza's found northern New Jersey warm and accommodating.
 "The Cuban population when I was in North Jersey was big in a few towns," said Dr. Gorostiza, who is now the executive director of Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs at Rutgers University here. "Then they became the typical American immigrant experience and moved to the suburbs. Cubans went everywhere, and I guess I am one." 
 The latest census information shows that New Jersey still embraces immigrants searching for the American dream. While the state lost nearly 40,000 people to other states from April 2000 to July 2001, that was more than made up for by over 60,000 immigrants who came to New Jersey from other countries during that same period.
Since 1790, the Census Bureau has made complete counts of the nation's population, but it now has a mandate from the federal government to update those statistics regularly, especially those relating to race, ethnic origin and immigration.
Indeed, the latest population estimates show that New Jersey, while ranked only 24th among the states in overall population growth, is adding people faster than any other state in the Northeast -- primarily because of the increase in the number of immigrants coming to the state.
"It is the continuation of a trend that started back in the 1970's," said Sen Yuan-Wu, the chief demographer for the New Jersey Department of Labor. "Immigration policy changed in the late 1960's, putting fewer restrictions on non-European immigrants. Since then, New Jersey has been a welcoming place for immigrants from, particularly, Asia and Latin America."
Current statistics back this up. Overall, New Jersey's population rose by 70,081, to 8,484,431. Nearly 50,000 of that was because of the state's internal birthrate. But a loss of 39,215 people to other states was more than offset by the 63,361 immigrants who decided to call New Jersey home during the same period. That disproportionate population shift placed New Jersey sixth among the states in net immigration.
"I would think one of the biggest reasons immigrants come to New Jersey is that they don't have that preconceived notion that New Yorkers and Philadelphians have about New Jersey being somehow undesirable," said Dr. Gorostiza.
He said immigrants today are not looking to be those huddling masses of lore.
"They don't turn up their noses and move to Brooklyn just because it isn't New Jersey," he said. "They see it is a good place to live, convenient to working in the cities, safe and cheaper than cramming into some apartment in the city."
Most of the people leaving New Jersey, according to the census data, move to either New York and Pennsylvania (presumably those native-born New Jersey naysayers Dr. Gorostiza talked about) or to Florida (primarily retirees).
But those immigrating come from an increasingly wide range of countries. The large Cuban immigration of the previous 30 years slowed in the last decade. In 1990, for instance, there were about 80,000 Cuban-born New Jersey residents; in 2000, there were 72,000.
On the other hand, there was a boom in Mexican immigration to the state -- a 258 percent increase from 1990 to 2000. And though the increase was statewide, the largest increase was was centered in Cumberland County, where the Mexican population rose sixfold in 10 years.
Dr. Gorostiza attributed the large in increase in Cumberland County, in South Jersey, to a change in agricultural patterns in the areas around Vineland and Bridgeton.
"Things have changed from food growing to nurseries," said Dr. Gorostiza. "It is now not a migrant community, but a year-round one. The migrants used to come from Puerto Rico and then go back home, but the Mexicans who replaced them work from spring to Christmas in the nurseries and greenhouses."
However, he noted that the Mexicans came to the area in the first place because there was a Spanish-speaking infrastructure already in place from the Puerto Rican community.
"If you come to a place where your language is spoken, where it is easier to get the food or other items you are used to, where people are used to having people somewhat like you, you are more likely to build a community there," he said.
Similarly, he said, Central American immigrants have resettled in the urban neighborhoods of North Jersey that 10 or 15 years ago were primarily Cuban.
Conversely, what seemed to be a burgeoning Japanese immigrant community, especially in Bergen County, has dwindled somewhat in recent years. The census figures show that there are 15 percent fewer Japanese-born New Jersey residents than there were in 1990.
"The Japanese economy has taken a nose dive, so the people who were sent to work in New York and who lived in Fort Lee for three years are just not there anymore," said Dr. Gorostiza. "They would naturally move to that area, since there was a great place to shop, the Japanese mall in Edgewater, and much larger apartments than they were used to in Japan."
According to Dr. Wu, the state demographer, the major age groups that New Jersey is losing to other states are the over-60's and those in their teens and early 20's.
"The first is not hard to figure out," he said. "It's retirees who are moving to the Sun Belt. This is a national trend, and I'm afraid even New Jersey will not escape it.
"But it is more distressing among the young people," he added. "That is mostly because we send so many people to college in other states. Rutgers is nowhere as big, for instance, as Ohio State, so we have a hard time keeping young people here for college. That can be a disturbing population trend for the future."
In the near future, New Jersey may also lose its foothold among the 10 most populous states. It is currently ninth, but census figures show that at their current rates of growth, Georgia and North Carolina are poised to overtake New Jersey in population. Georgia is almost certain to do so by 2005, and North Carolina will probably overtake New Jersey by the end of the decade.
Nonetheless, New Jersey is still the most densely populated state, with about 1,200 people per square mile as against the rest of the country, where the average is about 77 people per square mile.
"We are growing more than any other state in the Northeast, but I am afraid that isn't enough with the trends of population moving South and West," said Dr. Wu. "But as long as the economy here stays strong, immigration will continue and we will continue to prosper as a state no matter how many people we have."

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT; 
A McGreevey Cabinet Takes Shape

BYLINE:  By SARAH RUBENSTEIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
AS New Jersey's fiscal outlook wors ened considerably with its budget shortfall growing by a billion dollars to $2.4 billion since the last accounting only five weeks ago -- Governor-elect James E. McGreevey last week pressed ahead to fill out his nascent cabinet.
 Mr. McGreevey, who is poised to take the oath of office on Tuesday, has so far cobbled together a cabinet that includes, on the one hand, political allies, and on the other, figures who have accumulated years of experience in their fields without becoming too embroiled in the state's political system. 
 "These are qualified individuals who do not raise any eyebrows," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School at Rutgers University.
Among those whom Mr. McGreevey has named to fill some of the most powerful positions in the state's first Democratic administration in more than 10 years are a Trenton outsider, a lawyer who has worked on both sides of the political aisle and a fellow Woodbridge insider. 
In the aftermath of a campaign -- both truncated and at the same time dominated by such issues as terrorism, a yawning budget shortfall and educating the state's 1.3 million public school students -- Mr. McGreevey's choices of William L. Librera as education commissioner, David Samson as attorney general and John E. McCormac as treasurer have drawn the most attention.
As Mr. Librera, a former schools superintendent in Montclair, admitted in an interview last week, he is hardly a Trenton insider. After meeting with Edithe Fulton, president of the New Jersey Education Association, for the first time last week, he said he doubted that people had guessed that Mr. McGreevey would choose him for the post.
Still, he vowed to use his more than 30 years of experience to address many of the issues that Mr. McGreevey has emphasized. He said he would focus on early childhood literacy while also working to implement reforms that require the state to provide more aid for some of the poorest districts. 
In addition, Mr. Librera said he would work to reorganize the Department of Education, a body whose leadership role has drawn criticism in recent years.
The 55-year-old Mr. Librera, currently an associate professor in the educational leadership department at New Jersey City University who also runs Educational Nexus, an educational consulting firm, was superintendent in the Montclair public schools from 1992 to 1997 before becoming superintendent in Allamuchy, a much smaller district.
Those who worked with Mr. Librera, who served Montclair -- always a highly politicized district -- at a particularly fractious time said he devised innovative solutions to some of the district's problems.
Herman White, who was board of education president in Montclair during Mr. Librera's tenure, said he was one of the first educators to analyze and to begin to address an achievement gap between black and white students. He also addressed the district's growing space crunch by opening a new middle school and making a controversial decision to allow the town to take over the prekindergarten program.
Yet many said that the superintendent's position in Montclair -- always an exhausting one -- eventually tired Mr. Librera, who left the district, with a student body of 6,200, to run the schools in Allamuchy, a district with 350 students in kindergarten through eighth grade, all in one school.
"In a town this diverse, wrestling with so many important issues, you're not going to make everybody happy," Mr. White said. "It wears on you, and I think it wore upon him."
While Mr. Librera is a Trenton outsider, David Samson -- a lawyer from Roseland whom Mr. McGreevey has selected as attorney general -- has worked for Republicans and Democrats alike. Having allies on both sides of the aisle could well benefit Mr. Samson, who takes over an office that has been enmeshed in the battle over racial profiling and an array of demands on law enforcement because of the Sept. 11 attacks.
A senior partner at Wolff & Samson, a firm with 85 lawyers working out of offices in Roseland and Hackensack, Mr. Samson has overseen the firm's managerial and budgetary responsibilities. In addition, he was appointed by former Gov. Thomas H. Kean as chairman of the Governor's Task Force on the Laws Governing the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and by former Gov. Jim Florio to the Governor's Commission on Health Care Costs.
"The very fact that he's not a Democratic partisan tells you that he wasn't selected for that purpose, and I think that's a nice statement to make," Mr. Florio said in a telephone interview. "That should send out a message that you're interested in evenhanded law enforcement that hasn't got anything to do with any overtly partisan philosophy."
Indeed, Mr. Samson represented Chuck Haytaian, the Assembly speaker and chairman of the State Republican Party during former Gov. Christie Whitman's administration, in a sexual harassment case that was eventually settled. Later, he and employees of his firm donated more than $50,000 to Mr. McGreevey's 1997 and 2001 gubernatorial campaigns.
For his part, Daniel Waldman, president of the New Jersey State Bar Association, said Mr. McGreevey made a "brilliant" move in his selection of a lawyer who has been involved in civil, rather than criminal, litigation.
Because Mr. Samson is not known as a defender or prosecutor, it would he difficult to accuse him of choosing sides on racial profiling or the prosecution of potential terrorists, Mr. Waldman said.
"He comes with no baggage in that regard," he said.
But no baggage also means no clear reputation on the divisive issue of racial profiling, something that Frank Askin, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said could be a problem unless Mr. Samson takes immediate action.
"I would certainly feel more confident if the attorney general had a track record," Mr. Askin said. "There's no particular reason the minority community should have confidence that he's going to jump in and do the job."
However, those who know the 62-year-old Mr. Samson said he would bring strong managerial skills and extensive experience to the office. And Peter C. Harvey, a Morristown attorney whom Mr. McGreevey chose to be first assistant attorney general, will be the first black to hold the position.
To handle one of the new administration's most daunting challenges -- a budget shortfall projected at $2.4 billion -- Mr. McGreevey turned to Woodbridge's acting business administrator and chief financial officer, John E. McCormac, whom he credited with helping to bring the city out of a "fiscal abyss."
"Programs and services and funding will have to be cut, but I think we can do it," Mr. McCormac said in an interview last week, adding that in Woodbridge, he "dug in" and fixed the budget, one section at a time.
Filling out some of the other 18 cabinet positions, Mr. McGreevey designated Albert G. Kroll, a West Orange lawyer who has represented numerous labor organizations, to lead the state Department of Labor, and Ida L. Castro, who headed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Clinton administration, to lead the Department of Personnel.
In addition, Dr. Clifton R. Lacy, senior vice president for medical affairs and chief of staff at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, was Mr. McGreevey's choice to lead the Department of Health and Senior Services, and Mayor Susan Bass Levin of Cherry Hill was designated to lead the Department of Community Affairs.
Mr. McGreevey chose Bradley M. Campbell, a regional administrator for the federal Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, to head the state's Environmental Protection Department, and Rev. Dr. William D. Watley, senior pastor of St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church in Newark, to head the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission.
Holly Bakke, who has worked in the insurance industry, was chosen to lead the Department of Banking and Insurance, and Col. Glenn K. Rieth, director of the State Army Aviation Office for the New Jersey Army National Guard, was designated to head the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
So far, said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University, Mr. McGreevey's team reflected an emphasis on diversity and expertise.
Mr. Rebovich said the extent to which Mr. McGreevey actively involved his commissioners in the policy-making process remained to be seen, though he emphasized that Mr. Samson and Ms. Levin were two people "who will not tolerate being in the background."

In Other Cities, the Grass Is Browner

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON; This column about the local economy will appear every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THERE are worse places to be right now, economically, than in New York City.
 That may seem unlikely. After all, in the past four months the city has lost 3,000 lives and perhaps as many as 100,000 jobs. According to the most recent government statistics, in the aftermath of Sept. 11 New York City suffered the biggest 12-month job loss of any metropolitan area in the country. 
 Those who live in and around the city have been bruised, battered and bereaved -- physically, emotionally and financially.
But there are plenty of cities across the country where economic life is at least as lousy. Small cities, like Yuma, Ariz., where the unemployment rate has been hovering around 20 percent -- except during the summer, when it shoots up to about 30 percent (in New York, the rate is under 7 percent).
Big cities, like Los Angeles, where the unemployment rate is not bad, but corporate hiring, as measured by help wanted ads, has plunged by more than 60 percent in the past year (making New York's 40 percent drop look less dire).
Extremely unfortunate cities, like Danville, Va., where the big products used to be textiles, tires and tobacco. In the 12 months ended in November, Danville's unemployment rate soared to 9 percent, and the number of jobs shrank by 4.8 percent. (If that had happened here, the job count would be down by almost 210,000 through November, rather than by the 82,500 reported by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.)
Of course, the existence of misery elsewhere is no consolation for the people here who are out of work.
And New Yorkers can only hope it won't be any justification for the federal government's failing to pony up all the money it has promised to this wounded city. The folks in Washington aren't exactly sharing the rest of the country's economic pain; our nation's capital has added more jobs in the past year than any other metropolitan area.
But trying to figure out where New York fits into the national recession may help provide some perspective, even (dare one say it?) a little optimism.
For one thing, the fact that so much of the region's economic pain stems directly from the terrorist attack suggests that some of the job losses may be temporary, says Jason Bram, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Even if they do come to goggle at ground zero, some tourists will also eat at Tavern on the Green and put waiters back to work. Some of those Wall Street firms that fled to Jersey City will find it more convenient to move some of their staff back to Manhattan. And, eventually, construction workers will build whatever it is that will coexist with a memorial at the trade center site, assuming the entire project does not turn into this decade's version of Westway.
Across the country, most of the really devastating job losses have been in industries involved in making things, like cars and computers and couches (this has not been a happy time to be living in Detroit or San Jose, Calif., or Hickory, N.C.). In New York State, this explains why the unemployment rate has risen more sharply in Binghamton and Elmira than downstate.
The only thing New York City makes much of is money. The bad news is that Wall Street continues to lay people off, as Merrill Lynch proved last week. The good news is that the stock market, a leading indicator, started rebounding in late September.
Things are likely to get worse here before they get better. But when the national economy does turn around, which many economists are hopeful will happen later this year, so will New York's.
How much and how fast is a matter of some debate. In the optimistic camp is Mr. Bram, who says, "I find it hard to believe we would do worse than the nation, even with this disaster." Less cheery is Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, who says that New York City will not snap back as much as other places, because it will not lose as much as other places (which doesn't sound so bad).
A decade ago, New York's poor economic prospects helped prompt people to move to areas with sunnier outlooks. Today, employment hot spots are hard to find, except in a few places not exactly known for their bright lights (Fayetteville, Ark., say, or Fargo, N.D.). For ambitious young people, Mr. Goldstein said, "the Big Apple is still the big lure."
And as long as that is the case, there will be plenty of worse places to be, economically, than New York City.

The NewM.B.A. Vogue: A Job at a Blue Chip

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU 

 BODY:
HIS father worked as a manager at Bristol-Myers Squibb for 22 years, but Brandon Thomas, a student at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, had no intention of following in his footsteps. The staid culture of a Fortune 500 company just wasn't for him.
 Not until the dot-com meltdown and the recession came along, that is. Suddenly, the prospect of a steady paycheck and a steady climb up the corporate ladder looks pretty good to Mr. Thomas, now 25, who plans to receive his degree next year. 
 "I'm working on getting an internship right now with larger, well-known companies in D.C. and New York," he said. "It will help me evaluate how well I can morph into the corporate culture."
Just a few years ago, many M.B.A.'s fresh out of school would rather sell dog bones than take a job with a stodgy corporation that made Buicks or macaroni and cheese. The allure of the dot-com world, with its freewheeling culture and promise of stock-option riches, made the traditional office seem banal.
But on business school campuses across the country, students who watched the technology bubble burst or who worked at start-ups that never really started are rediscovering the virtues of stability and a healthy balance sheet. "Before, it was sexy to take the risk for 1 percent in the company," said Jonathan McBride, co-founder of Jungle Interactive Media in New York, publisher of MBA Jungle, a magazine for M.B.A.'s and young business executives. "Now it's a status symbol to have a job."
At least 75 percent of M.B.A. students at the Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington are looking for jobs at larger, more stable companies, compared with fewer than 50 percent a year or two ago, said August Schomburg, director of graduate programs. He said many M.B.A.'s were focused on industries like pharmaceuticals, energy and consumer products.
Frank A. Beck, director of human resources for the marketing unit at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco in Winston-Salem, N.C., said: "It's night and day. Over the past three to five years, with all the interest in e-commerce, telecommunications and consulting, the pool of M.B.A.'s concentrating on marketing more traditional consumer packaged goods was drained. Now the pendulum has swung. We've probably been receiving two to three times more resumes since early fall."
For new M.B.A.'s, the most popular safe harbors just a year ago were consulting and banking, but jobs are now scarce in those areas. At high-tech start-ups, workplace specialists say, they are almost nonexistent.
"Those companies no longer come to campus or place jobs with career centers," said Andy Chan, director of the Career Management Center at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. "Students are saying, 'I need work.' "
Garrett Wilson, a student at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, had a recent fling with small business, but he now thinks bigger companies are better. Mr. Wilson, 31, held a summer internship last year at a medical-device maker that was seeking Food and Drug Administration approval for a potentially lucrative product. If the product had gone to market, he figured at the time, he would have had a good shot at a full-time job. "There would have been a huge upside to getting in on the ground floor of that," he said. But the F.D.A. rejected the application, and the company failed.
NOW Mr. Wilson is shopping for a position at a medium-size to large corporation, preferably in consumer products, that will give him a chance to move up through the ranks. "C.E.O? Maybe someday," he said, half-joking. "But I'd settle for head of marketing."
That kind of attitude means that names like General Motors and R. J. Reynolds are back in vogue among the estimated 100,000 students who graduate from the nation's business schools every year. It has also created a much larger, and potentially cheaper, pool of talent from which hiring managers can choose.
At General Motors, M.B.A.'s who left the company to join dot-coms or start their own companies are returning, according to Thomas Thivierge, director for talent acquisition at G.M.'s North America unit. "They say, 'Please, can I come back?' because they know we'll be here 100 years from now," he said.
Mr. Thivierge says a big benefit for him is the new glut of M.B.A. holders with experience as senior information technology executives at smaller companies. His annual recruiting turned up two or three such prizes in 1998, he said, but a choice of 10 candidates last year.
Because of the economic slowdown, Mr. Thivierge has cut back slightly on his hiring and on internships for M.B.A. students. But he said, "We are excited about getting the latest and greatest talent." 
Other companies are more aggressive about offering jobs to business school graduates, according to Mr. Chan, at Stanford. "Businesses have high expectations that these people will do something big in their companies," he said. Now companies are in the driver's seat. "They may pay less than they had to," he said, "or give them lower titles, but the M.B.A.'s are gaining security and getting into a company that may start their careers off on the right foot."
Stephen F. Johansson, associate dean for corporate relations at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management in Nashville, estimated that starting salaries were down as much as 10 percent this year from those of recent years, though recent graduates of the top business schools could still expect to earn $60,000 to $100,000 a year.
That creates a golden opportunity for big corporations to stack their middle-management ranks with M.B.A. holders, headhunters say.
"Companies are facing the realities of, Do they have the right people in the right jobs?" said Jeffrey Heath, president of the Landstone Group, a recruiting firm in New York. "They are re-evaluating everything they've done over the past five years, correcting what they did wrong in hiring."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: TRIBECA; 
Preservationists Fear a Rush to Judgment Downtown

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
New York has a problem: Much should not be forgotten, but much must be remade.
 In TriBeCa, this issue has gained urgency since Sept. 11, with Community Board 1, the Historic Districts Council and others seeking a new historic district in the southern part of the neighborhood. 
 The real estate boom of the late 90's brought a few boxy penthouses to that area. But most of its 19-century dry goods and textile warehouses, and a few stretches of sandstone buildings, are intact. 
"The idea is to save the rest," said Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of the community board. 
The concern stems from some residents' fear that the push to revitalize downtown will wreck what the boom passed over. "Developers are seeing this as an opportunity to get development through quickly," said Roger Byrom, co-chairman of the landmarks committee of the community board.
Furthermore, small businesses in the area, which was blocked off for two months after Sept. 11, are struggling. Some fear a wave of closings could precipitate widespread development. "Vacant buildings could be delivered to developers," said Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the Historic Districts Council.
Sherida E. Paulsen, the chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, seemed to understand the worry. 
"The landmarks law doesn't take into account some of these other pressures sometimes," she said. "We are taking the time to really look at this right now because we do understand the community has real concern."
In 1991 and 1992, the commission designated four historic districts that encompass about half of TriBeCa. The southern area now under discussion had been included in the community's original landmark proposal, but lay outside the final district boundaries. However, at that time, the commission considered 17 buildings in the currently proposed district as possible individual landmarks. To date, it has voted on one.
Ms. Paulsen said her staff had identified an area, containing 12 of the 17 buildings, as a potential extension to the southernmost TriBeCa historic district. "The community proposed something that was much larger," she said, adding that the commission would decide next month if it scheduled a hearing on the matter.
But Ms. Wils, who is also on the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation, an agency to rebuild downtown, said some fear was misplaced. "We have millions of square feet of empty office space, so there is not any need to rush or forgo any process for rebuilding," she said. ERIKA KINETZ

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Why It Takes Psychology To Make People Save

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to saving for retirement, Americans are not rational. They know they do not put away enough, surveys show. But ask them to save more in their 401(k) plans and they balk. A buck in hand is irresistibly spent. Try a different approach. Ask them to commit now to increasing their savings in the future, make the increase coincide with the next raise, and they cheerfully sign up.
 Various quirks embedded in human nature come into play. Saving more in the future seems much less of a sacrifice. When the future arrives, opting out succumbs to inertia. And timing the increase to coincide with a raise, so that one cancels out the other, is much more palatable than a cut in take-home pay. In the human psyche, giving up a raise not yet in hand is easier for people to accept emotionally than a loss, even the illusion of a loss. After all, the money "lost" is still there, in one's savings account. 
 Standard economics allows for none of these quirks. Over a lifetime, people rationally save an optimal amount, mainstream economics holds. Confronted with the reality that people do not save enough, the mainstream has no solution, except to reiterate that people are rational, so whatever they save must be enough. No wonder behavioral economics is making such a splash, becoming the "in" specialty of young economists from the best graduate schools.
"You have to force savings and take the money away before people have it and can't resist spending it," said Richard H. Thaler, a University of Chicago economist.
Mr. Thaler is a pioneer in the development of behavioral economics over the last 25 years, and now he is a leader in finally applying the insights to daily life. So far the application focuses on persuading people to save more in 401(k) plans. But there are other potential uses. Fiscal policy is one. Allowing for human quirks, what is the most effective way to spend public money to promote jobs and economic growth? "If we invested six months in designing a stimulus package using insights from behavioral economics, there is good reason to think it might work," Mr. Thaler said.
That is still off in the future. Medicine offers an immediate application. Some dentists, for example, are beginning to ask behavioral economists how to get patients to return every six months for teeth cleaning. Reminder postcards don't often work. People put them in a drawer and procrastinate -- another human quirk that messes up mainstream theory, with its faith in rationally taking good care of teeth. Most people delay, unless the dentist extracts a commitment, by persuading a patient, when he or she comes in for a cleaning, to make an appointment on the spot for the next cleaning, six months hence.
"The postcard system only facilitates procrastination," said David I. Laibson, a behavioral economist at Harvard, who gets calls from dentists.
THE most promising application so far is retirement savings. At a time when workers must save for their own retirement, they are in danger of inadequate income in old age unless they contribute 10 percent of their pay to 401(k) plans, pension experts say. And that does not count losses in 401(k) money invested in high-technology stocks or in the Enron Corporation.
Such hearty contributions are certainly in the interest of the Vanguard Group, which administers 401(k) plans for companies like Philips Electronics North America, a unit of Royal Philips Electronics. Philips also has a stake: under federal law, top executives cannot have retirement savings too out of line with those of ordinary employees.
So Vanguard and Philips turned to Mr. Thaler and to Shlomo Benartzi, at the University of California at Los Angeles. Executives had read a paper they wrote, entitled "Save More Tomorrow," reporting on the results at a Midwestern company where 162 employees, more than half the staff, had agreed in advance to annual increases in their 401(k) contributions, each increase coinciding with a raise. Over three years, the contributions rose to 11.6 percent of income from 3.5 percent.
Most of the 16,000 Philips employees enrolled in 401(k) plans save 6 percent or less. So Philips is experimenting. With Vanguard administering the test and Mr. Thaler and Mr. Benartzi giving advice, the company will ask 2,000 workers next month to commit to annual increases in 401(k) contributions of one, two or three percentage points. The first increase would be in April, when Philips gives annual raises, although this year, in a recession, a raise is not a sure thing, says Lisa Pyne, Philips's benefits director.
Still, she is counting on inertia to keep people from opting out -- even the 3 percenters who, absent a raise, might notice the slight decline in take-home pay. "Behavioral economics seems to work," Ms. Pyne said.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
In Recession Talk, Economists Shift to the Past Tense

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
JUST before the new year, James E. Glassman and his associates at J. P. Morgan made a big change in their economic outlook, updating their growth forecast for the first quarter to zero from a decline, at an annual rate, of 2 percent.
 A zero may not seem like much. But for economists, it means that the recession is not going to end in the spring, as they had predicted. It's over now. 
 Other forecasters have joined in. At Goldman, Sachs, the first-quarter forecast has shifted even more radically, from minus 1 percent to plus 2 percent. At Morgan Stanley, the shift was more modest, to plus 0.1 percent from minus 0.6 percent. But the effect would be the same: the recession would end this quarter.
"When I see people changing their minds so quickly, it makes me think they were not prepared for the economy to be so resilient," said Mr. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan, including himself in his criticism. "Economists need to be humble. We have always misjudged the turn."
The sudden speed-up means that Federal Reserve officials, meeting at the end of this month, may decide that there is no need to cut their benchmark short-term interest rate by another quarter-point, to 1.5 percent. Many analysts are still betting on another rate cut, but more positive news in the next few weeks could change that view.
The shift in outlook also suggests that the sharp jump in long-term interest rates at the end of 2001 -- in anticipation of a nice recovery soon -- was more reasonable than many analysts thought at the time. The same may be true for the surge in the stock market, which, like the bond market, is supposed to be forward-looking.
Mr. Glassman also says the early end to the recession may mean that the subsequent recovery will be stronger than the mild rebound that many economists have forecast. "The fact that the bottom is coming early makes me feel better about the outlook," he said. So it is possible that long-term interest rates, already at relatively high levels, could move even higher.
The new forecasts are a result of the persistent strength in consumer spending even as businesses reduced their orders sharply. "Right now, the level of production is significantly below final demand," said Jan Hatzius, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
A result is that product inventories fell sharply in the fourth quarter, a decline now estimated at $100 billion to $120 billion at an annual rate. (Fourth-quarter data on the gross domestic product will not be released until Jan. 30.)
Because of that steep drop, economists expect the inventory drain to slow greatly in the current quarter, maybe to around $40 billion. But in the calculation of G.D.P. numbers, this slowdown in the rate of decline becomes a positive.
Also contributing to the changing outlook is new strength in manufacturing. The manufacturing index of the Institute of Supply Management rose to 48.2 in December -- still in recession territory but close to breaking through 50 into recovery. In addition, the index for new orders, considered a good predictor of future manufacturing activity, shot up to 54.9, its highest point in 20 months.
An increase of 2.3 percent in chain-store sales in December showed that many retailers had a better Christmas than expected.
"There is something you can hang your hat on if you want to claim that the economy is at an inflection point," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, referring to an end of the recession.
So what are Federal Reserve officials thinking, after all this new data? Several regional bank presidents said last week that the recovery would come later in the year. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, agreed with these comments in a speech on Friday. He warned that "despite a number of encouraging signs of stabilization, it is still premature to conclude that the forces restraining economic activity here and abroad have abated enough to allow a steady recovery to take hold."
Private economists must react quickly to new data. (Ahead of his colleagues, Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics predicted in October that there would be recovery signs before the end of the year.)
Fed officials must be more cautious. Still, one wonders if they are just trying too hard to talk down stubbornly high long-term interest rates while locking themselves into one more rate cut on Jan. 30. If they continue with this cautious view, a decision not to cut rates will be a big surprise.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/W. George Greig; 
William Blair International Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WITH all the world outside the United States to choose from, W. George Greig, who runs the $425 million William Blair International Growth fund, says he is emphasizing more investments in the emerging markets of Asia.
 The youthful population of many countries there and "the important transformation of Asian economies from producer-driven to consumer-driven" make the region attractive, said Mr. Greig, who works in Chicago. He said stock markets in China and other countries that export heavily to the United States had begun to respond positively to the Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus. 
 The fund returned 14 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with a loss of 3 percent for its peer group of foreign stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc. In the last 12 months, it lost 11.9 percent, versus a loss of 20.7 percent for its group. 
Mr. Greig, 49, looks for what he calls "the best-managed companies with the best growth prospects and the strongest balance sheets." While most of the fund's money is invested in Europe, he has put almost one-third of it into Asia and Australia. He has made a relatively big bet on Asian emerging markets, at 12 percent of assets, versus 5 percent for his benchmark, which is technically called the Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World Index Free Ex-U.S.A.. (Translated, that means an index of all world markets outside the United States that are easily accessible to outside investors.)
The portfolio, which contains 120 or so stocks, is broadly diversified among industries and market capitalizations. He typically holds a 15 percent stake in emerging markets worldwide; that has crept up to 18 percent, just below his policy limit of 20 percent. "When leading economic indicators turn up," he said, "the emerging markets, and Asia in particular, tend to do well."
He screens companies periodically, seeking above-average three-year earnings and revenue growth. Earnings growth of the portfolio averages 18 percent a year, roughly double the benchmark's rate.
His valuation analysis uses multiple variables, including multiples of price to earnings, price to book and price to cash flow. That "helps us to overcome gaps and inconsistencies across different industries, different countries and different accounting systems," he said. If interest rates are low in a particular country, like Japan, P/E ratios may be very high, he said, so he may put more emphasis on other multiples.
He also compares a company's current P/E ratio with its historical multiples and those of its rivals.
In Asia, Mr. Greig likes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a big maker of chips for American companies and for local markets. He originally bought shares in March at a split-adjusted price of 56.85 Taiwan dollars, then worth $1.69. They now trade at 87.50 Taiwan dollars, or $2.50. "To be successful, a foundry must be very efficient and very versatile," Mr. Greig said. "This company can shift quickly among products and has money to invest in advanced technology." 
He said analysts expect the company's earnings growth to be 28.3 percent a year, on average, for the next three years.
Mr. Grieg has added to his investment in Ryanair Holdings, which runs the discount Irish airline. He originally bought American depository receipts of Ryanair in March 1999 at $18.76, adjusted for splits; the A.D.R.'s now trade at $30.25.
"Ryanair operates extremely efficiently at a very low cost," Mr. Greig said, and has much opportunity to grow because discount air travel is not as entrenched in Europe as in the United States. He said analysts expect earnings to grow 14 percent a year for the next three years.
He also likes BHP Billiton, the mining conglomerate based in Melbourne, Australia. "What makes this company interesting is that it's a great growth company in a low-growth business," Mr. Greig said. Management is equally skilled at exploration, prospecting, mining, controlling costs and arranging acquisitions and joint ventures, he said. 
Earnings are expected to grow 20 percent a year, on average, over three years. He originally bought shares in September 2000 on the London market at a split-adjusted price of $:3.14, then worth $4.48; they now trade at $:3.75, or $5.42.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Taking After Father; 
A Frozen Sperm Riddle

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
IN the ethical quagmire of assisted reproduction, many of the toughest questions eventually land in court: Who has the right to frozen embryos, frozen eggs, frozen sperm? Whose name should appear on the birth certificate, the genetic mother, who provided the egg, or the carrier, in whose womb the baby grew?
 And now comes this one: What are the inheritance rights of children conceived posthumously, with frozen sperm, years after their father's death? 
 "It's another in the long string of examples of the law struggling to come to terms with new reproductive technologies that raise questions that traditionally did not have to be faced," said Sally Goldfarb, who teaches family law at Rutgers Law School in Camden, N.J. "It used to be that a child born more than a year after a man's death was conclusively presumed not to be his child. We can't say that anymore. There's a vacuum in terms of legislation on the issue, so the courts deal with it, case by case." 
The highest court in Massachusetts ruled this month that twin girls born two years after their father's 1993 death from leukemia should have normal inheritance rights, if both the man's consent to the conception and his genetic relationship with the children could be proven.
"Posthumously conceived children may not come into the world the way the majority of children do," said Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. "But they are children nonetheless. We may assume that the Legislature intended that such children be 'entitled,' insofar as possible 'to the same rights and protections of the law' as children conceived before death."
Her decision acknowledges that granting inheritance rights to posthumously conceived babies may complicate life for earlier-born heirs. "In an era in which serial marriages, serial families, and blended families are not uncommon, according succession rights under our intestacy laws to posthumously conceived children may, in a given case, have the potential to pit child against child and family against family," she said, since the later child's share of the inheritance would reduce the amount available to any older children.
And in the expanding universe of assisted reproduction, she said, there are many possible parent-figures whose benefits or estates may be claimed: egg donors, sperm donors, gestational carriers, and others with no biological connection who arranged the conception and intended to raise the child.
As a practical matter, there is the vexing question of how long an estate might have to be held open for an afterborn heir -- or whether heirs who already received bequests might have to give back part of their inheritance.
The Massachusetts case, and a similar one still pending in New Jersey, are relatively simple ones, each involving twin girls conceived posthumously with frozen sperm from a young husband who died of leukemia, without a substantial estate or other children. And in both cases, the twins' mothers sought benefits for the children paid for by taxpayers, in the form of Social Security, not a portion of a contested estate. 
In Massachusetts, the Social Security Administration told Lauren Woodward, who had applied for benefits for her twins, Mackenzie and Michayla, that the girls could not be treated as Warren Woodward's heirs, because they were conceived after his death. Years ago, a family court judge deemed Mr. Woodward the girls' legal father, and ordered their birth certificates amended to include his name. But the federal government would not pay benefits, so Ms. Woodward sued in federal court -- and because Social Security benefits are paid according to state inheritance laws, a federal judge asked the state's Supreme Judicial Court to rule on the issue.
The New Jersey case is following a similar path. Like Ms. Woodward, Mariantonia Kolacy was denied Social Security benefits for her twins, Amanda and Elyse, born in 1996, nearly two years after their father's death. Last year, a state judge ruled that the girls should be deemed legitimate heirs. But the Social Security Administration still refused benefits because the ruling was not from New Jersey's highest court. In July, the Kolacys' lawyer, Robert Kerekes, took the case to federal court.
ULTIMATELY, legal experts said, state legislatures may provide guidance on the rights of posthumously conceived children. So far, only Louisiana has passed legislation allowing posthumously conceived children to inherit -- but only if the dead spouse authorized, in writing, such use of the frozen gametes, and only if the child was born within two years to the surviving spouse. The law grew out of a long campaign by Nancy Hart, who was refused Social Security benefits for her posthumously conceived daughter, but won an out-of-court settlement in 1996.
According to Mr. Kerekes, there are a handful of other posthumously conceived children, scattered through the United States, receiving Social Security benefits. But the Woodward case is the first in which a state's highest court faced the issue.
"The Massachusetts court almost pleads for legislation in the field, saying the issues 'cry out for lengthy, careful examination outside the adversary process,' " said Carol Sanger, who teaches family law at Columbia University's law school. "Still, because this was one of the easier situations, the court could afford to be philosophical, saying without having to decide that there very well could be time limits set, but that, on the other hand, psychologically, time limits might push a woman still grieving her husband's death into bearing a child before she was ready. And, as the court said, conceiving a baby with frozen sperm can take many tries over many months." 
Professor Sanger noted, moreover, that the Massachusetts ruling addressed a relatively narrow question. "The Massachusetts case was explicitly about married men and women, and even in that case, the court wanted proof that the child came into being with the sperm donor's consent, and said that the fact that he'd frozen his sperm wasn't enough to show consent," she said. "You can imagine some guy passing out 15 vials of frozen sperm to 15 different women, each with a little note saying, 'Go for it.' And that's really not what Social Security was intended for."

HEADLINE: A Haven For Women Is No Longer Quite Home 

BYLINE:  By NANCY HASS 

 BODY:
FOR decades, the halls of Linda Brady's co-op on East 18th Street were redolent with a comforting mix of old-fashioned smells: L'Air du Temps perfume, takeout Chinese food, fabric softener.
 That was because her 1960's-era building, like scores of other white glazed-brick high-rises that are ubiquitous on the East Side of Manhattan, had a large number of occupants who were women like herself -- single, well employed and now over 50. Such buildings, mostly made up of studios and one-bedroom apartments, had a reputation for dowdiness and were considered architectural eyesores by purists, but Ms. Brady loved hers, and the women who were her neighbors. 
 "We all knew each other," she said. "A lot of the people had been here since the 1960's and 70's. Back then we threw parties, we shared houses together in the Hamptons." As her friends in the building grew older, she said, they would all look in on each other. "It had a family feel to it." 
But then one day the scents that Ms. Brady, 51, a corporate architect, once associated with home seemed to evaporate. The halls now smell of aromatherapy candles, Dolce & Gabbana perfume and occasionally marijuana. The recyling room, where old Redbook magazines and Loehmann's boxes were once stacked, holds empty imported-lager bottles, Prada shopping bags and discarded brokerage statements from Chase.
And Ms. Brady's building is bustling not with her friends, many of whom had modest incomes as public-school teachers, secretaries and department store buyers, but instead with bond traders and public relations executives, nearly all under 35.
"They work until late at night; then they go to the gym; then they go out," said Carol Chesler, 60, a freelance copy editor who is among the dwindling number of longtime tenants."They seem to have a plan. We never had a plan. We just went along and saw what would happen."
The transformation of Ms. Brady's and Ms. Chesler's co-op is being repeated in similar white-brick buildings all over town. Because of an unusual combination of sociological trends and the history of Manhattan real estate development, the buildings -- largely built in the 1960's -- became havens for many middle-class single women. But since the mid-90's, these longtime residents have been vacating their apartments, retiring and moving to sunnier climes. The buildings, once shunned as "white whales," have grown fashionable with young professionals who are moving in and changing what was once a Manhattan version of "The Golden Girls" into a Wallpaper magazine layout -- people like Terence Riley, chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, and Marcy Swingle, an editor at Daily Candy, a Web site aimed at young fashion-conscious shoppers.
"You can make a 60's apartment really kitschy and modern," said Ms. Swingle, who is in her early 30's and bought her 60's Village apartment a couple of years ago from an elderly occupant.
In an informal survey, doormen and superintendents at 20 white-brick co-ops around Manhattan all echoed the observations of Spiros Pappas, the super at the Mayfair, 207 East 74th Street: "This place used to be filled with them -- these ladies who are here living alone forever. Now there are not very many left. My favorite one has the walls padded to keep out the noise. In the past couple of years, there's been a complete change. It's young people with good jobs, great clothes." The metamorphosis of an entire class of buildings is, like many tales of the city, a matter of being in the right place at the right time. White-brick buildings, nearly all of which are east of Lexington Avenue, with others scattered throughout the Upper West Side and Greenwich Village, were built as rentals primarily between 1960 and 1968, following a decade when, as a result of the postwar obsession with the suburbs, there was little residential construction in Manhattan. The specially glazed brick, which architects hoped would reflect light to the street in an increasingly crowded, dark metropolis, was first used in 1950 by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill at Manhattan House, on East 65th Street between Second and Third Avenues. But the white-brick boom didn't really begin until the late 50's, and it lasted only a decade.
Unlike the sumptuous prewar residential buildings lining Park and Fifth Avenues, white-brick buildings were pared down in scale and detail -- mainly because that made them cheaper to build. Most apartments were small, designed to attract the single people developers expected to opt for city life in an increasingly suburbanized society. Unlike tenements, the only other type of building widely available to people who weren't rich, 60's-era apartment houses had elevators and doormen. At a time when single women were starting careers in unprecedented numbers, the buildings offered a haven. They were safe, clean and affordable. (Ms. Chesler's rent in the mid-70's, when she moved into her ground-floor studio, which has a small patio, was only about $300, and she bought it for $25,000 in 1983.)
"This was the era of 'The Best of Everything' -- all those melodramas about young girls coming to New York to have a career and then to wrench their guts out about whether to get married instead," said Ann Douglas, a historian who writes frequently about New York City.
The buildings were meant to be transitional. "The way it was supposed to work was that single people would live in these small apartments in these buildings until they got married," said Emanuel Tobier, an emeritus professor of economics and planning at New York University. "Then they would move to the suburbs, and new ones would take their place,"
But it was mostly the men who seemed to move on. About the same number of men and women moved into the buildings in the first decade or so, according to managing agencies, residents and superintendents. But by the early 90's, many more longtime residents were single women than single men, according to data from the annual New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey analyzed for The New York Times by Andrew Beveridge and Susan Weber, demographers at Queens College. The figures show that of the people who moved into buildings built between 1960 and 1969, nearly 40 percent were women living alone in 1991. Less than 2 percent were men living alone. The rest were a mix of couples, and men and women with roommates. (A great majority of apartment houses built in the 1960's were the white-brick variety.)
Why did more men than women leave? For the same reason, apparently, that has often drawn complaints from single women in the city: the greater proportion of straight women than straight men in the local population. "By the 1960's New York had become the nation's most competitive marriage market," Mr. Tobier said. "Most of the men got married and moved away. But many of the women never did."
Longtime residents and building managers said that white-brick buildings were also a magnet for women, some of them divorced, who were seeking an independent life. "I had plenty of chances to be married back in the 60's," said Emily Weiss, a retired teacher who is in her early 60's and has lived in a one-bedroom apartment painted robin's-egg blue in a white-brick building in the East 70's since she was 27. "But I never found anyone who was interesting or creative enough. They just wanted me to move to Scarsdale or Riverdale or somewhere and be a house mouse. I never found a good enough reason to leave this nice place."
Thousands of women like Ms. Weiss were in the right place at the right time. Their rents were protected under rent-stabilization laws, and in the 1980's, when most of the buildings went co-op, the residents either stayed on as renters or bought their apartments at insider prices. As real estate prices soared in the 80's and 90's, they were sitting pretty. As one of the few remaining groups of middle-class Manhattanites, they helped support a wide variety of low-key local businesses, especially along First, Second and Third Avenues. "By accident, this whole generation of women hit upon a time when it was possible to live a decent life alone in Manhattan," Mr. Tobier said.
But that is changing. In recent years, many of the women have reached their 60's or 70's, and with the market for small apartments retreating from its highs of the late 90's, they are selling. Some are moving to be closer to their families. Others have died. "Within about a year and a half everyone I know, all my friends, have either died or moved away -- poof!" said Ms. Brady, the retired architect on East 18th Street.
In their place has come a generation of buyers who covet the 60's buildings for entirely different reasons. Because it has been years since prewar buildings with doormen were within reach of most young people, balustrades and crown moldings no longer cast so long a shadow. Even lofts are too expensive for just about anyone.
When Jennifer Star, 32, an executive recruiter, was shopping last year for an apartment on the Upper East Side, she never considered a prewar building. She eventually found a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom place with an alcove in a white-brick building for $350,000; the seller was a rabbi who had inherited the place from an older unmarried woman in his congregation who had lived there since the 60's. "Who thinks of a prewar anymore?" Ms. Star said. "You adjust your tastes completely. This apartment was totally a mess when I first saw it. I wound up gutting it completely. But the minute I walked through the door that first day, I thought, this is fabulous."
Arguably, the duckling-to-swan transformation of the white-brick buildings has as much to do with aesthetics as price. In the past few years, midcentury furniture and design have had a renaissance. This has given a sheen to the angular 60's buildings, most of which have eight-foot ceilings, boxy rooms and little detail. "More and more people are accepting the world in a horizontal vernacular," said Jeffrey Bilhuber, who has decorated homes for clients like Anna Wintour and David Bowie in prewar buildings, but has many friends who have moved into white-brick co-ops. "Modern furniture profiles much lower to the floor, which looks fantastic in a 60's-era space."
That attraction was felt by Mr. Riley, of the Museum of Modern Art. He said there was "no question" that he wanted a minimalist 60's building when he went apartment shopping. "I can't tell you how long I looked for an eight-foot ceiling," said Mr. Riley, who lives on West 12th Street in an apartment that is a paean to Modernist furniture. "There were all those 80's buildings where they shaved feet off the floor plan and then jacked the ceiling up. And all the yuppies who had lived there before had put ceiling fans in every room. It felt like you were in a Cuisinart."
Ms. Brady and Ms. Chesler are glad to see that the buildings they have always loved are now being appreciated by others. But they fret that their way of life is rapidly receding. "You don't want to feel like it's in with the fabulous new kids and out with women like us," Ms. Chesler said. "We're an important part of the life here. Maybe we aren't as driven as the new crop, but we brought a down-to-earth quality to the place. You want to think that that's worth something."

HEADLINE: Rebuilding New York; 
The Possibilities of Lincoln Center

 BODY:
The combined effects of the terrorist attacks and the recession have left many Manhattan institutions reeling -- including Lincoln Center, the city's premier performing arts complex. Sept. 11 caught its resident companies in the midst of protracted wrangling over an ambitious 10-year, $1.2 billion redevelopment plan that will depend, in part, on an infusion of city money. Not long after his inauguration, Mayor Michael Bloomberg made it clear that a harsh new fiscal reality might mean, at the very least, postponing that plan. Now Lincoln Center must adjust to this new reality while finding a way to perform seriously needed repairs. It must also find leadership with the ability and vision to continue planning for the future.
 At the moment, Lincoln Center lacks a president. Its chairwoman, Beverly Sills, who has done her very best to keep the peace at Lincoln Center, is 72 and has said she would like to retire when a new president is hired, something she planned to do several years ago. This might look like the brink of crisis, but it may well be an enormous opportunity instead, a chance to embrace a generational transition in leadership and bring new dynamism and openness to the center itself. 
 The building of Lincoln Center transformed the Upper West Side, but as the neighborhood has grown up around it, Lincoln Center has come to seem less and less like the vital heart of a community and more and more like a moated bastion of the status quo. Its patrons still enjoy some of the greatest music, dance and theater on the planet, but those audiences are increasingly homogeneous. The shared spaces of the center, including Damrosch Park, often have a barren stillness that reflects the sometimes chilly relations among the resident companies.
Lincoln Center may be the largest performing arts center in the world, but other arts centers around the world have done a far better job of being destinations in themselves, of belonging to the public at large and to the next-door neighbors as well.
As economic conditions and the fund-raising climate begin to improve, it will take forceful new leadership to overcome the entrenched personality conflicts at Lincoln Center and, eventually, to move redevelopment forward on a scale suited to the center's magnitude. Lincoln Center's plans for renovation should be as ambitious as the plan for building it in the first place. But the time, and the cast, will have to be right for doing so.
The real question facing Lincoln Center is whether it can find a strong and permanent new leadership to recreate the sense of a common good, which has fractured under the strain of the last few years. There is a risk of making weak appointments simply to preserve the status quo, the balance of psychological power among the quarreling artistic companies. That is exactly what Lincoln Center cannot afford to preserve.
The generational shift at Lincoln Center is imminent, and nowhere more so than at the New York Philharmonic. Even as critics embrace the possibilities of Lorin Maazel's first season as conductor -- a season containing an abundance of contemporary and newly commissioned music -- they are looking over the horizon of 2006, when his contract expires. By hiring Mr. Maazel to replace Kurt Masur, the Philharmonic brought in 71-year-old new blood. No one doubts Mr. Maazel's vigor or his desire to enliven the Philharmonic's schedule, but the clamor for a younger conductor -- a young American conductor -- will only grow as time passes.
Of all the problems facing Lincoln Center, the knottiest has been what to do with the New York City Opera. It needs a theater of its own, but, for separate reasons, neither the New York City Ballet nor the Metropolitan Opera wants it to have one, at least not on the Lincoln Center campus. The question for City Opera was always where to go if it left the West Side. In the wave of redevelopment that will begin downtown around the World Trade Center site, the opera management might look at the possibility of building a theater there.
Nothing would be better suited to the larger purposes of restoring Lower Manhattan or to City Opera itself. What a gift it would be to bring music to the neighborhood of that site, to make it a place for rejoicing as well as mourning.

Argentina's Crisis: It's Not Just Money

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT Argentina's long, slow-motion slide into bankruptcy, default and devaluation, Wall Street and Washington worried mainly about what came to be called "contagion," the fear that the economic crisis here would infect neighboring countries. Now that the collapse has occurred, the larger, more immediate danger may prove to be the spread of an old and eternally appealing political idea: resentment-based populism.
 Four South American countries will be having presidential elections over the next 10 months: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil. In each, the disintegration of the Argentine economy after a decade-long experiment with free-market policies provides ammunition for candidates who reject the notion, propagated by the United States, that there is an unbreakable link between democracy and the North American model of an open economy, a combination Latin Americans call neoliberal. 
 "The idea that the neoliberal model of the Washington consensus is dead is something heard not just in Argentina, but being repeated throughout Latin America," said Felipe Noguera, a political consultant and analyst here. "There are a lot of people out there right now who are looking for an alternative and have concluded that Argentina offers one."
The new president who took office here on Jan. 1, Eduardo Duhalde, is the product of an electoral machine founded by Argentina's original 20th-century populist, Juan Peron. For more than 50 years it has had a top-down view of politics, preferring to organize society into "sectors" like labor unions and employer associations, rather than appeal to voters primarily as individuals. In return for their loyalty, Argentine companies and workers were allowed to flourish behind protective tariff walls, at least until a decade ago.
Combined with Hugo Chavez, the former paratrooper and perpetual critic of "savage neoliberalism" who has served as president of Venezuela since 1999, that gives advocates of populism beachheads at both ends of the continent. And in Brazil, where anxious voters have been monitoring both the Venezuelan and the Argentine experiments, Luiz Inacio "Lula" da Silva of the Workers' Party, an admirer of Mr. Chavez and an opponent of free market policies, continues to lead the polls as he makes his fourth run at the presidency.
Until recently, the traditional solution to a crisis like Argentina's would have been a military coup. But the armed forces are discredited nearly everywhere in Latin America, and in the few places where they are not, like Venezuela, officers are extremely reluctant either to tarnish their image by intervening in politics, or to take over a mess they can't clean up.
"Populism implies that you have money to spend, and these days the money just isn't there," said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at Inter-American Dialogue, a policy analysis group in Washington. "What you're seeing in country after country is that they've simply run out of options."
Indeed, South America's most worrisome problem may be that nothing seems to work anymore. In Venezuela, even Mr. Chavez is not immune. These days, his popularity is falling even faster than the price of oil. The result is a radicalization of his "Bolivarian Revolution," with incitations to class warfare and the rare spectacle of a successful national strike called jointly by labor unions and employer groups to protest what they see as the president's growing authoritarian tendencies.
General Peron, an archetypal Latin American caudillo, or strongman, has always been one of Mr. Chavez's idols. The Venezuelan leader has also been counseled by Norberto Ceresole, a neo-Peronist Argentine sociologist who preaches a "postdemocratic" ideology based on the idea that a charismatic leader can forge a mystical bond with the masses, thereby eliminating the need for political parties. Critics of the ideology like to point out that Europe's early fascists had a similar skepticism about classic democracy; Mr. Peron, in fact, modeled his government after Mussolini's.
In the column that he writes for leading Latin American newspapers, the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa noted last week that "the sound and the fury of a popular mobilization against the political class" here in Argentina last month was very much like "that which preceded the meteoric political career of Comandante Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and began the erosion of its democratic system."
With traditional political leaders and parties increasingly discredited, a space has opened for leaders who present themselves as outsiders and emphasize their distance from the system. In Mr. Vargas Llosa's own country, that kind of voter rage and disgust has already produced both Alberto Fujimori and, after a traumatic decade of authoritarianism, the current president, Alejandro Toledo, without an accompanying reinvigoration of the political system.
IN urging countries around the world to embrace free markets and free trade alongside free elections, the United States has held out the hope that rapid economic progress, benefiting all segments of society, will follow. But with their economies wobbly or worse, critics in Latin America are increasingly skeptical, and their attention is now focusing on the political side of the formula as well as the economic one.
"When you pursue the economic logic, you tend to shortchange the political logic," said Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University in Miami. The United States, he said, "urged policies that dismantled traditional ties, between labor and the Peronists, for example, but didn't construct anything in its place. Now the problem is how to construct those when there is an absolute rejection of political parties and the political system."
After having largely ignored Latin America since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the White House seems to be awakening to the danger of instability in its own hemisphere and moving to demonstrate American interest. President Bush is expected to visit the country he knows best, Mexico, in March, and a trip to South America is being contemplated for later in the year.
But that late recognition is a far cry from Mr. Bush's initial promise of a foreign policy focused on spreading prosperity and democracy throughout the hemisphere. And it does not offer a solution to the threat implicit in a piece of graffiti sprayed on a sidewalk across from the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace that has been the focus of violent antigovernment protests here: "We are going to keep on coming. Signed, the People."

Can Crying Race Be Crying Wolf?

BYLINE:  By By KATE ZERNIKE 

 BODY:
"PEOPLE in academe bruise real easily, and African-Americans at white institutions even more so," Gerald L. Early, a professor of English and African-American studies at Washington University in St. Louis, said recently.
 It is a pity Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers had not been briefed by Mr. Early before he met with Prof. Cornel West in October for their now-famous private chat. 
 Among other things, Mr. Summers suggested that Mr. West put some of the social philosophy expressed in his recent rap CD into something scholarly, and he emphasized his concern that professors were inflating grades. 
It was meant to be a routine meeting between boss and employee, one of dozens Mr. Summers has had since arriving on campus six months ago. But Mr. West saw it otherwise. He very publicly claimed personal disrespect and humiliation, and threatened to bolt to Princeton. And the constellation of stars who are his colleagues in Harvard's Afro-American Studies department rose as one to join him in outrage.
It wasn't just that meeting, several prominent department figures let it be known; Mr. Summers had snubbed them by failing to call on the department and pay his respects when he arrived on campus. They demanded an apology, a public statement of support for the department and affirmative action, and claimed that the gains achieved by members of minority groups in higher education were threatened by a resurgence of the old boy network -- old white boys, that is. 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson raced to Cambridge to stage a press conference, and he demanded to meet with Mr. Summers. The Rev. Al Sharpton threatened to sue and demanded an apology of his own. Even after a special summit meeting called to mend fences, Mr. West continued to vent his hurt feelings in public, calling in reporters last week to insist that he just might leave, anyway. Meanwhile, conservative editorialists mocked what the writer Stuart Taylor, in Slate magazine, called a "feast of victimology."
Surely the chemistry department could not have triggered such an explosion. But then, this was not just an academic dispute. Setting aside the question of Mr. West's scholarship, the debate at Harvard sparked such a stunning display of inflamed sensibilities because it raised many of the deeper, enduring questions about race and the role it plays in black achievement. 
"The question of academe is a smaller subset of the larger question of what does it mean to be a successful black person," said Mr. Early. "How do you get your success, how much does what you're doing empower the black community, and for African-Americans at white institutions, is it important for me to serve the role of showing that you aren't racist?"
Blacks on the more conservative end of the political spectrum are less sympathetic. They blame the Harvard professors for using race to get their way. 
"People with the talent that these people have have so much more to offer the United States than shooting a gun at Larry Summers' feet and making him do the 'I'm not a racist' dance," said John McWhorter, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley and author of "Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America." "It suggests that too much of modern progressive black thought is dedicated to crying victim rather than to trying to move ahead. These people are doing just fine, but as soon as there's any kind of crisis, the natural conditioned reflex is to pretend to be under siege."
Oddly, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the head of Harvard's African-American studies department and among those who threatened to leave for Princeton, was previously involved in a very similar fracas. 
Two years ago, he was honored by his alma mater, Yale University, where he had been denied tenure. During dinner, the university's president confessed his professional "jealousy" of Mr. Gates' department at Harvard. The head of Yale's African-American studies program resigned, saying that the comment signaled disrespect. She, too, threatened to move to another university, and the Yale president, like Mr. Summers, apologized for having "unintentionally caused great consternation."
The program chairwoman then consented to stay, and a week later, her program was elevated to department status.
Of course, if some African-American studies departments are politically sensitive, it may be because they started out that way. Back in the 1960's black students at a number of colleges and universities, including Harvard, staged sit-ins to demand that their culture and history be given separate recognition within the curriculum. They won, but because they had done so through political activism, the departments themselves came to be seen as having a political purpose -- to "do your scholarship and trouble the waters," as one scholar said.
The universities, in turn, used black studies departments as instruments of integration, which troubles some black scholars.
"There's always the question, Is my worth being appreciated or am I being used to integrate this school?" said Mr. Early, at Washington University. "It's not the worst reason for being at Harvard or any other school. But you start thinking, that's not why English is here, that's not why philosophy is here, that's not why economics is here. Am I here because these people think African-American studies is an important part of their mission, or am I here as a problem eliminator?"
THIS is precisely the sort of insecurity that plays out around affirmative action: did I get this job, or did I get into this college because of merit or race? Do people see me as an equal, or as an "affirmative action case?"
And this in turn is one of the reasons conservatives of all races generally object to such programs. To them, calling attention to race, whether in preferences or in demanding respect, is a perversion of the proper goal of civil rights: colorblindness.
Shelby Steele, writing in The Wall Street Journal last week, criticized Mr. West and his colleagues for using white guilt as the path to black power. From this standpoint, it might have been a step in the right direction that Mr. Summers -- fresh from a stint in a Democratic White House -- would feel at liberty to have the conversation he did with Mr. West. Instead, last week, Mr. Summers' aides were continuing to mop up after Mr. West's latest interviews, insisting they would do anything to keep him.

The Stripes Are on Their Sleeves, Not Their Pants

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
EACH evening, as Army Special Forces troops rise with the moon to stand sentry in this former Taliban stronghold, a lieutenant colonel named Dave sits on the carpeted floor of the Governor's Palace to advise local leaders on the complexities of turning tribal warriors into a civilian-controlled security force respecting the rule of law.
 Each day, one of the young Special Forces captains is out assessing the city's health care, checking international relief efforts. 
 With such missions, the Special Forces officers are doing what United States troops abroad have regularly done: imprinting images of America on a people who might have only a hazy notion of the nation and its principles. Though the Pentagon deliberately limited the number of troops on the ground, the American military is the most public of the diplomatic missions in the former combat zone. Soldiers are taking up the delicate task of helping reconstruct a civic fabric. 
This is obvious as Special Forces patrol the gritty marketplace of a city struggling to recover from Taliban dictates, or assist relief agencies setting up shop amid the low-lying houses built of local adobe, or train local security forces at a base camp beneath the talcum-dry peaks that encircle Kandahar. Special Forces teams are negotiating their way through a complicated social network of tribal loyalties and tensions, of religious restrictions and inspirations.
Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the United States Army chief of staff, likes to take note of how military men and women from a diverse democracy set a standard, by their actions, in nations with no history of tolerance or democracy. Bosnia and Kosovo are just the most recent examples.
Others are more skeptical that the military possesses the finesse, the nuanced understanding of the regional issues, to act as surrogate diplomats. "Where I think you have to be careful is that the military can end up making regional policy," said Lawrence J. Korb, director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, who served as an assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration. Especially among commanders, he said, "they run the risk of believing they can act like a proconsul. That, to me, is the danger."
One diplomatic historian stressed the enormous cultural barriers to changing Afghan civil society through direct American action. "They should essentially be following a military purpose -- providing military protection and military advice," said Gaddis Smith, Larned professor of history emeritus, at Yale University.
Yet, by doctrine and training, Special Forces troops are the exception that proves the rule that the military is not the best group to deal with the finer points of foreign cultures. Alone in the United States military, they train to be proficient in the continuum from combat to civil affairs. Each of the Army's Special Forces groups has a regional orientation, allowing its members to master foreign languages and history. 
Post-combat Afghanistan, then, is fitting into a historic template forged by American troops in Germany and Japan after World War II. "The role of the American military on the ground in Japan and in Germany after World War II was really quite extraordinary," said Alan K. Henrikson, professor of diplomatic history at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. 
Professor Henrikson cited Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the postwar military governor of Germany, whose background in engineering and logistics allowed him to address the immediate needs of reconstructing a civil society: supplying food and fuel, getting a market economy walking toward recovery -- the issues facing Afghanistan today.
In Japan, after the allied victory, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff helped draft the constitution, bringing an American imprint to the character of a former foe.
THIS imprint can be more individual. Generations of French, Italians, Germans and Japanese remember their first meeting with an American soldier -- or at least the American's chocolate or chewing gum.
American troops today also offer a face of diversity. That, too, is something soldiers have done since World War II, or so Hollywood has it, with every Army unit in old movies cast accordingly: a sincere white kid from a Midwest farm, a tough Irish kid from urban Detroit, the Italian, or maybe Jewish kid from Brooklyn and a Southerner.
For an Air Force combat controller named Martin -- the Pentagon asked that only first names be used -- most conversations with Afghans begin warily. They take note of his combat fatigues, but only after taking note of his M4 automatic weapon -- and that only after taking note of the color of his skin. The first question is usually something like, Are you a Jihadist from East or North Africa? No, he says. The African ancestry is correct, but his family has been American for many, many generations. At that point, Martin says, the kids and also the adults reach out and rub his forearm.
Much work of Special Forces here involves teaching military professionalism to tribal warriors, and helping establish a civilian security force. Just a week ago, the biggest firefight in town was a shoot-out between militiamen and the police. 
"A common problem in post-conflict situations is what to do with the paramilitary forces," said Fiona Hill, a scholar on Central Asian issues at the Brookings Institution. She said training local regiments is a priority. But if not monitored, these same forces can become the better-armed units capable of standing up to the central government, pushing Afghanistan back into its inter-tribal conflict once Americas depart.
Senior Special Forces commanders stress they are aware of the political ramifications of their work, and are constantly assessing factional disputes in their territory.
"Now that the fighting is mostly over, we're dealing with those things that are harder to work through," said Captain Matt, a Special Forces team commander. "When you have a pretty quick victory like this, you want everything else to be quick, too. But you can't walk around with a big stick. That just doesn't work on infrastructure. You have to use the easy push rather than harder pull."
The members of Captain Matt's A Team arm for their patrols in full "battle rattle" -- bulletproof vests and automatic weapons. But they assign one soldier on each Toyota to "wave duty" -- to smile and wave back at gaggles of kids who always line their route.

Fund Manager Moving To New Role at Janus

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
The Janus Capital Corporation, whose stock mutual funds plummeted after the Internet bubble burst, has appointed James Goff, a fund manager, to the vacant position of director of research. 
 Mr. 
Goff, 37, managed the Janus Enterprise fund from its inception in 1992 until this month. Last year, the fund lost almost 40 percent of its value. 
 Assets under management at Janus, formerly the best-selling fund group in the country, fell to $193 billion last year from $260 billion.
The company's previous director of research was James Craig, who retired in August 2000. Mr. Craig was also chief investment officer of Janus.
Mr. Goff will train Janus analysts, according to Tom Bailey, chief executive of the fund group, which is a unit of Stilwell Financial of Kansas City, Mo. Mr. Bailey said the move would "ensure that Janus's research-driven culture continues to be instilled."
Janus also appointed Helen Hayes, co-manager of the Janus Worldwide and Janus Overseas funds, as managing director of investments. Jonathan Coleman will take over from Mr. Goff as manager of Janus Enterprise, the company said.

To the Editor:
Re "Yes, There Are Still Optimists in Japan" (Dec. 30), which discussed how the Japanese yen lost 16 percent of its value against the dollar in 2001: 
 As the article points out, the stocks of major Japanese companies are trading near 10-year lows. And many of these companies have strong brands and well-trained work forces. 
 The combination of a strong dollar and low prices for leading Japanese companies provides American companies with a rare opportunity to purchase such companies at bargain-basement prices.

HEADLINE: 'Will & Will,' 24/7 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif. 

 BODY:
Back in the nation's capital, in Bushworld, singles don't exist. The president and even the Democrats focus on traditional families, parents and children. 
 Here in television's capital, in NBC world, children don't exist. NBC sitcoms and dramas focus on quirky and unsettled singles, battered by work and dating problems, with friends serving as family. 
 NBC has so relentlessly pursued the young-hip-urban singletons beloved by advertisers that it has ended up with a barren prime time.
At the television press tour here, the NBC Entertainment president, Jeff Zucker, was asked by a critic if it was "coincidence or design that there are no children on any NBC show?"
"Obviously, our No. 1 comedy is about to have a baby in 'Friends,' he said. "But the fact is you raise a point that we've talked about, and I would actually like to see us have a show or two that has some kids."
When MTV and Showtime disclosed last week that they were creating a gay channel for cable, one NBC executive joked that there already was a gay channel -- and he worked there. Besides the trailblazing "Will & Grace," NBC has the tortured lesbian Dr. Kerry Weaver on "E.R." and, of course, "Frasier," which gays jokingly call "a friend of Dorothy."
Once families sat in the blue TV light, laughing or crying together. But now the proliferation of sets and taping devices, as well as kiddiecentric cable channels, let parents and kids avoid each other completely. 
We have niche narcissism marketing. You may as well cover your TV screen with a mirror. I watch the Maureen Channel, dramas about workaholic, single, urban, tough-but-vulnerable Irish women, with Gaelic tin whistles on the soundtrack.
Lifetime, now the No. 1 rated cable network in prime time, succeeded with its women-in-distress and disease-of-the-nanosecond movies. (Will and Grace eat popcorn and watch Lifetime constantly.) The Oxygen network has yet to catch on because it tried to do empowering shows for smart women. But exhausted smart women just wanted to watch women do dumb things on Lifetime at night.
"You want the ability to see yourselves and get away from yourselves," says Gene Falk, a Showtime vice president. Mr. Falk and a MTV consultant, Matt Farber -- both gay -- are developing the new gay cable channel. "I want to see mushy romantic moments with people like me," Mr. Falk says. "As a friend of mine says, gay people want trash, too."
Hollywood has come a long way from the days when Cary Grant depicted Cole Porter as straight and Clifton Webb feigned a romantic interest in Gene Tierney in "Laura."
"I can envision everything from comedy shows to game shows to reality shows to relationship shows to issues shows to travel shows to biography shows," Mr. Farber says.
Game shows? "Like the old 'Newlywed Game,' " he says.
Biography? "David Geffen," Mr. Farber offers. "Barney Frank, Philip Johnson," Mr. Falk proposes, adding that the show could be modeled on "Inside the Actor's Studio."
Travel? "Provincetown or Paris," Mr. Farber says.
My gay friends had a mixed reaction. While pleased that their economic muscle is recognized, they worry that the channel might lead to a cabaret of stereotypes. "All Joan Crawford, all the time," one says dryly.
They are also skeptical about how the channel will serve both gays and lesbians, who have a history of friction. "Will they alternate showings of 'Mommie Dearest' and 'Personal Best' "? one friend asks slyly.
Mr. Farber concedes the point: "I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a challenge." And Mr. Falk agrees that "a 21-year-old lesbian is not interested in the same things as a 50-year-old gay man."
"If you offer enough different images, the stereotypes will cancel each other out," Mr. Falk adds. "We don't necessarily see an effeminate character as bad any more. Now you can have a strong effeminate character."
David Ehrenstein, the author of "Open Secret: Gay Hollywood, 1928-2000," is not concerned about gays being ghettoized. "There is already the aura of gay niche marketing in advertising," he says. "Like the Volkswagen commercial where the two guys are driving around town picking up furniture."
Max Mutchnick, the gay creator of "Will & Grace," can't wait to see more ads tailored his way. "We'll go from Coors Light," he muses, "to Coors Light in the loafers."

HEADLINE: States Seek to Counter U.S. Deregulation 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Sensing a growing deregulatory movement in Washington, state officials have been moving swiftly to fill what they perceive as voids in areas like antitrust, environmental law, consumer safety, telecommunications, banking, health care and energy.
 In recent months, the states have brought suits, rewritten regulations or adopted laws in those areas after perceiving opposition or lack of interest by the Bush administration or Congress. 
 One public break with Washington was a dissent by nine states to a plan by the Justice Department to settle the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit.
In another break, attorneys general from six Northeastern states challenged the administration's plans to loosen regulations that require all industries, including utilities, to upgrade pollution control equipment when they upgrade. 
But there have been many other recent cases of states' intervening on regulations when Washington has not asserted itself, though they have received less attention: 
*Last month, 29 states sued Bristol-Myers Squibb in an antitrust lawsuit that said the company misled the Food and Drug Administration to block the marketing of a cheaper generic alternative to BuSpar, an antianxiety medicine. The agency has taken no action in the case, although the Federal Trade Commission filed a friend-of-the-court brief last week that urged a judge to reject the drug maker's efforts to dismiss the suit.
*Because Congress and federal regulators have not acted to curtail the growth of telemarketing, seven states -- Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas and Wyoming -- adopted "Do Not Call" laws last year, in the footsteps of states that had adopted similar laws. The laws generally require telephone solicitors to avoid calling consumers who list their objections to such calls on a registry. The Federal Trade Commission is considering whether to propose a new rule.
*California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and Vermont recently filed a federal suit to challenge the revisions by the Energy Department of efficiency rules for air-conditioners and heat pumps, saying the rules weaken efficiency standards, increase the cost and use of electricity and add pollution.
*North Carolina and California have outlawed what consumer groups call predatory lending -- loans with excessive or hidden fees, for example. Federal regulators recently clamped down on some lenders, but Washington has not curbed most predatory practices in the face of strong opposition from the banking industry.
*Representatives from 31 state utility commissions have led a so-far successful battle in Congress to block a bill, supported by some administration members, that would deregulate local telephone markets and ease the way for regional Bell companies to enter the long-distance and high-speed-Internet markets.
*Some states have promulgated their own consumer safety standards. Oregon recently increased the standards for baby cribs. Last year, California adopted tough standards for mattress flammability.
Experts and state officials say the states' growing involvement is reminiscent of a movement in the Reagan administration, when the perception of lax enforcement prompted a core group of state prosecutors and lawmakers to form new alliances.
Relations between state regulators and the federal government became somewhat more harmonious in the Clinton administration, although there were episodic disagreements like those over pursuing the tobacco industry and an earlier effort to settle the Microsoft case.
"There is a clear dramatic trend of Republican and Democratic attorneys general expanding the scope of their law enforcement efforts in a more aggressive and proactive way to fill gaps left at the federal level or to address unmet needs," Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general and a Democrat, said. "The climate is now very similar to the Reagan years, where there was a retreat at the federal level in many of these areas and in some instances actually a complete abrogation of authority."
Some federal officials have tried to build ties to the states. 
The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Timothy J. Muris, said the relationship between his agency and the states had been "generally quite cooperative" on merger and consumer cases. Mr. Muris, a senior antitrust official in the Reagan administration, added that on some issues like the state laws restricting telephone solicitations, the states had been ahead of the federal government and had provided important models for nationwide rules.
But the White House has made some moves that alienated the states. One such signal was its announcement two months ago that President Bush would nominate Harold Stratton, a former attorney general of New Mexico, to be the next chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
Mr. Stratton has accused state prosecutors of misusing their authority and being too activist. He was also president of the Rio Grande Foundation of New Mexico, a research organization devoted to "principles of limited government, economic freedom and individual responsibility."
Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa and a Democrat, said, "Appointing him shows they are not particularly sensitive to our role in light of his previous positions." 
Sensing that the new regulatory battles are shifting, consumer groups like AARP, which represents millions of older Americans, are moving with it. Next month, when the organization opens an office in Louisiana, it will have established local lobbying operations in all 50 states, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The organization has been recruiting support from state lawmakers and officials on issues of importance to retired people, including curbs on predatory lending, wider availability of generic drugs and limits on telephone solicitation.
"The impetus for the local movement has come about as a result of the frustration with Washington," said Cheryl Matheis, director of state affairs for AARP, which says it has 35 million members. 
"In the past," Ms. Matheis said, "it was easier to fix a problem at the federal level and you didn't have to go to the states. Now, when you have a problem, and you go to the federal government and don't get anywhere, you can go to the states and attract a critical mass."

HEADLINE: The Health Card 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The great challenge for Gov. George E. Pataki this year will be to weather a financial crisis without seriously damaging either public services or his chances of re-election in November.
 The Republican governor is proposing a sprawling health care plan that would get the state through the toughest budget year since the 1970's without major cuts, while adding money for popular items like low-cost prescription drugs for the elderly and breast cancer screening for all women. It would also placate the politically potent health care workers' union, by providing hundreds of millions of dollars for higher wages. 
 Democrats and Republicans alike say the plan is politically shrewd.
"George Pataki didn't get through Yale and Columbia Law by being stupid, and this is a very smart move," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Health Committee, who objects to some details, but not to the overall plan. "He has always been very good at either buying or bludgeoning support, when he needed it, from various interest groups and from the Legislature."
But some lawmakers and independent budget monitors say that while the plan is smart politics, it is not smart policy, and that it contains sharp reversals by the governor.
Mr. Pataki has long been a critic of using so-called one-shots, one-time sources of revenue, to pay for permanent programs. Experts at Wall Street firms and nonprofit groups that monitor government finances say one-shots merely paper over problems in the short run, making them worse in the long run -- a view that the governor has endorsed.
But Mr. Pataki's latest proposal includes what those fiscal monitors are calling the biggest one-shot in state history. The governor would take a $1 billion windfall the state expects from Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield's conversion to a for-profit company, and use it to help balance the state's budgets over three years. Other one-shots in his health plan total $131 million in the fiscal year beginning April 1. The governor has yet to propose an overall budget, so it remains to be seen whether it contains other one-shots.
In past years, Mr. Pataki has repeatedly tried to curb health care spending, the largest part of the state budget and one of the fastest growing. But now, with the state facing a multibillion-dollar deficit, he is calling for significantly more health care spending, with new and expanded programs that, when fully phased in, will cost $600 million a year.
"It's certainly not an auspicious way to begin addressing the state's fiscal problems," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a group that monitors public finances. "It's got a huge one-shot and it adds spending to a budget that's already way out of balance."
Some influential members of the Assembly's Democratic majority said they would support the Empire conversion only if the state invested its $1 billion share for use over many years, for things like helping uninsured people buy health coverage. "Spending this money quickly would squander a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, chairman of the Insurance Committee.
The governor's plan also relies on a major new infusion of federal aid, more than $1 billion a year, the bulk of which is in serious doubt.
Mr. Pataki is asking Congress to raise the federal government's Medicaid payments to New York, to 53 percent of all costs from 50 percent. That would give the state an additional $700 million a year. But Republicans and Democrats alike in New York's Congressional delegation, and many state officials who follow the issue, say that Congress is unlikely to approve the money. "I certainly wouldn't be counting on it," said a Republican congressman from New York.
Aides to the Democrats running against Mr. Pataki, H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, say the candidates will accuse the governor of fiscal mismanagement and hypocrisy, but even they do not express great hope that such charges will stick if people are relieved to escape budgetary pain for the next year.
Mr. Pataki and his advisers have not forgotten the trauma of 1995, his first year in office, when he tried to make deep cuts in the health care budget to eliminate a big deficit. The health care workers' union, 1199/S.E.I.U., and the hospitals mounted an advertising campaign against the plan and geared up the union's feared phone banks. The governor's popularity plummeted and he backed away from much of his proposal.
Since then, Mr. Pataki has cultivated a close relationship with 1199's leader, Dennis Rivera, who played a central role in developing the governor's new health care package. The plan will funnel more money to hospitals and nursing homes to pay higher wages to 1199's members -- wages reflected in a new contract announced Friday by 1199 and a major group of hospitals.
It could also go a long way toward ensuring that the left-leaning, mostly minority union does not support a Democrat against Mr. Pataki, though both the governor's office and union leaders insist that political considerations never entered into the deal.
All that stands between the governor's health care plan and reality are the objections of some legislators, mostly Democrats, about some of its elements. But they are every bit as eager as Mr. Pataki to survive an election year without unpopular cuts, and to please Mr. Rivera.
"If I had to guess, I'd say we're going to do it in some form," a top Assembly Democrat said. "It's a package that's hard to resist."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMICS; 
Attacks May Cost U.S. 1.8 Million Jobs

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will cost the nation more than 1.8 million jobs by the end of the year, a study has estimated.
 The Milken Institute, an economics research group in Santa Monica, Calif., that studied 315 cities, said the losses would spread across industries including restaurants, financial services and aerospace. 
 "The consequences of Sept. 11 for individuals and unique localities have been profound," the report said. 
The report said that 248,000 jobs had already been lost because of the attacks and that an additional 1.6 million jobs were expected to be lost this year.
New York City should lose nearly 150,000 more jobs; followed by Los Angeles, with 69,000 jobs; and Chicago with at least 68,000, the report said. Las Vegas should prove the most vulnerable metropolitan region in percentage terms. The report said it was most likely to see nearly 5 percent fewer jobs this year.
"The good news is that many of those jobs should come back," said Ross DeVol, director of regional studies at the institute.
The researchers expect most cities to begin to recover next year, with the exception of New York, which should start its rebound in 2004. New York lost billions of dollars worth of assets and thousands of jobs directly related to the shutdown of its financial district in the week after the attacks.
The Labor Department, which compiles job losses, found a total of 1.1 million jobs were lost from September through December. Those four months account for all but 300,000 of the jobs lost since the economic recession began in March, the department's statistics show.
The Milken report used economic models to extrapolate employment losses based on each metropolitan region's trends before Sept. 11.
Of the estimated 1.6 million losses this year that the study ties to Sept. 11, 760,000 will be directly related to the attacks, with two-thirds of those in travel and tourism.
The largest decline will be in aviation, accounting for 20 percent of the lost jobs, the report said. Spending on airline travel dropped 38 percent in September, a decline of $12.5 billion, and improved modestly in October. 
"We do feel the impact, and it hurts," said Erika Brandvik, a spokeswoman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. "But nobody ever gets a long-term feeling of doom and gloom about the Las Vegas economy. We have a record of recovery."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: INSIDE BASEBALL; 
Abbott and Costello Would Feel Right at Home in This Series of Comedies

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Spring training begins a month from Tuesday, and Major League Baseball is spinning crazily out of control. Four teams can't be certain if they will even see spring training. Three of those four teams plus another team don't know who will own them when they begin spring training. Two owners don't know which team they will own, if any.
 And none of this has anything to do with bank loans or negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. Negotiations? Lawyers for the players and the owners have spent two months on contraction, and they might as well be talking about words like can't and won't for all of the progress they have made. 
 Now members of Congress have jumped in, feet in their mouths first. Better it should be Abbott and Costello and who's on first. 
Donald Watkins, who has money in his left pocket for a team and money in his right pocket for a new park for that team, wants to buy the Minnesota Twins. If he is successful, he will spare the Twins from contraction. If the Twins cannot be eliminated, Commissioner Bud Selig will have to select another team to seal in the history books.
The most likely replacement candidate is Tampa Bay, but it could also be the Florida Marlins. If it's the Marlins, what will happen with Jeffrey Loria's prospective purchase of them? Without playing a game, Loria could suffer a doubleheader loss: the Marlins and the Montreal Expos, the team he owns now, which is No. 1 on the contraction hit list.
John Henry could be a double loser, too. If he loses the Boston Red Sox, whom he had in his $660 million grasp, to Charles Dolan, the crafty Cablevision man, would Henry keep the Marlins, or would he still sell them to Loria? 
If he were to sell to Loria, what would he do? Would he revive his talks with Disney for the Anaheim Angels, who have been said to have reneged on deals twice with him before he got into the expensive Red Sox race?
Or would Henry simply retain his 1 percent share of the Yankees (Yankees holdings, now that the team is part of a larger outfit), which he has not sold in the three years he has owned the Marlins, and call off his deal to sell it to Al Neuharth, founder of USA Today?
If the commissioner designates the Devil Rays for demise, they would have only themselves to blame. If they had taken Watkins more seriously last summer when he was interested in them, he might have bought them before he knew the Twins could be available. Devil Rays, here today, gone tomorrow, never having won 70 games in a season. What an epitaph.

A Twisting Path
Early last season, Donald Watkins related, he saw a newspaper article that said the Devil Rays might be for sale. He found the report believable because as a banker with contacts throughout the banking industry he knew the club was trying to borrow a huge sum of money but with no success. Watkins, a billionaire from Birmingham, Ala., let the Devil Rays know he was interested, but they replied that they did not know if they were selling and don't call us, we'll call you.
On Aug. 8, they called; that is, J. P. Morgan, the investment firm, not the man, called. Yes, Watkins said, he remained interested, and he proceeded to fill out a Major League Baseball application, personal financial data and all. Watkins was instructed to communicate only with J. P. Morgan, not with the Devil Rays, not with baseball.
Watkins was so eager to get into baseball he sent periodic updates of his financial information. Each one, he said, enhanced his economic position. Sometime in October, Watkins saw a series of news articles about contraction, and Tampa Bay was listed as one of the possible candidates.
"I departed from the instructions," he said, "and wrote a letter to Commissioner Selig. I had spent a lot of time and money on it and was surprised to see Tampa Bay mentioned. About an hour after I faxed that letter, I heard from J. P. Morgan saying Tampa Bay was not one of the teams being considered. They said my information was on Selig's desk and I should be hearing something in the next couple of weeks. I never heard from them."
Vince Naimoli, the Devil Rays' managing partner, said through a spokesman, "I have never had any contact whatsoever with Donald Watkins." Watkins doesn't dispute that. It's possible that they never will have any contact. If time and legal rulings allow, Naimoli could be gone by the time Watkins joins the previously all-white club.
By November, Watkins had made public his interest in buying a team. Fans in Minnesota picked up on it faster than the Devil Rays had and zealously urged Watkins to buy the Twins. Watkins turned his attention to Minnesota, and with baseball's blessing he plans to call a Twins executive tomorrow to set up a meeting with Carl Pohlad, the owner, and his sons.
"The way I was treated by Tampa Bay surprised me," Watkins, 53, said, adding that he mentioned one particularly irritating aspect of that treatment in his meeting last Thursday with two baseball officials.
"There was a quote in a newspaper that they looked at my application and couldn't understand some of my financial information. If somebody felt the need to discuss my financial situation, they could at least have discussed it with me first. If they were unclear about something, they could have asked me about it. That was confidential information."
Watkins, a longtime lawyer who also owns an energy investment company, has a background filled with the country's post-1950's history. He grew up in Montgomery, Ala., and his family attended the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, as it was known then, the church of Martin Luther King Jr.
"That was his first church," Watkins said. "We grew up with King, with the Abernathys, with Rosa Parks. We all knew each other. You can't come out of Montgomery as a child of the 50's and 60's and not be a child of the movement. Nobody knew anybody was going to be famous. Our families still stay in touch."

An Invaluable Player
Two years ago the Cincinnati Reds refused to trade a particular player to the Seattle Mariners in a package for Ken Griffey Jr., and the trade stalled for two months. "There was a certain player that was key for them and we were not going to trade that player," Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, said at the time. "We told them that at one of the first meetings. We never wavered off that. We just can't get past that particular player."
That player was Pokey Reese, and in a three-day period last month, the Reds traded him to Colorado, the Rockies traded him to Boston, and the Red Sox made him a free agent by not tendering him a contract.
The person who went whizzing through that whirlwind of career changes was not the same one the Reds refused to trade to the Mariners. His batting average, for example, plummeted from .285 to .255 to .224. But the Reds also traded him, Bowden said, because Reese, a middle infielder, rejected a four-year, $21 million contract offer in April.
"He refused to counter," Bowden said. "His agents felt he could get more in the open market. They said he had been with this organization all his career and wanted a change in scenery. We would have received no compensation when he walked after the season, and we have a budget that fits only so many arbitration-eligible players."
Bowden noted Reese's two declining seasons but said: "I will say he's still a good player, a Gold Glove infielder, and he will rebound offensively. He'll hit .260 to .270, 12 to 15 homers, drive in 60 runs and will steal 30 bases."

The Wrong Target
In the end, Juan Gonzalez did not really surprise anyone by signing with the Texas Rangers rather than the Mets. But John Hart, the Rangers' general manager, who also signed Gonzalez in Cleveland a year ago, made a somewhat surprising comment upon signing him this time.
"The name of the game is runs scored," Hart pronounced, "and Juan Gonzalez is certainly going to add to an already potent offensive club."
The Indians, under Hart, scored plenty of runs, but they lacked a deep corps of starting pitchers and failed in five of the past six years to wrest the American League championship from the Yankees, who knew that the name of the game is preventing runs from scoring.

HEADLINE: The Fall of Enron: Messy Politics 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Familiar Capital Script" (news analysis, front page, Jan. 11): 
 It would seem that some of the president's lofty campaign words about raising the integrity of government may well be coming back to haunt him. 
 One hopes that the state of the economy and the war on terrorism will not be used as reasons to divert attention from an urgently needed, thorough and bipartisan investigation of what really happened regarding Enron. Such an investigation should delve into the president's economic stimulus plan, which would benefit big companies with close ties to the administration.

HEADLINE: THE BOATING REPORT; 
Mix Money and Water, a Perfect Recipe

BYLINE:  By GARY BECKETT 

 BODY:
They came, they shopped and, in surprisingly strong numbers, they appear to have parted with their hard-earned cash to buy some pricey toys. They were the nearly 100,000 people who attended the New York National Boat Show, which ends today after a nine-day run at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. While a final tally of the deals done will not be known for days, or even weeks, exhibitors were hailing this year's show as the best in recent memory. 
 Of course, that is what they always say. But judging by the crowds walking the aisles and by the activity in the booths, it is clear that something unexpected was taking place. People were not merely shopping, they were buying, in some cases writing checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
 "In the first two days of the show we saw a 40 percent increase in sales over what we did during the same period last year," said Al Chianese, general manager of Surfside III, which owns a dealership at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan and 10 other sites in New York and Connecticut.
Only a few exhibits away at the Grady-White Boats booth, Bing Fishman, the company's northeast regional sales manager, made a similar grand pronouncement. "We're slightly ahead of last year, which was a record year for us at the show," Fishman said.
The news was especially positive for those selling big boats. For some exhibitors of large yachts, the buying started early on the first day. "We sold our first boat two hours into the show for almost $250,000," said Darren Mathews, vice president of Staten Island Boat Sales, which exhibited the show's largest boat, a 57-foot Carver motor yacht.
But wait. This cannot be happening. After all, the nation is mired in a recession. Unemployment is on the rise, and consumers typically shun big-ticket discretionary items like boats, in weak economic times. 
In fact, sales of powerboat and marine engine units have fallen by nearly 10 percent the last two years, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, which owns the New York show. In response, boat and engine makers have been idling or closing plants and laying off workers by the thousands. Several well-known companies have filed for bankruptcy, including Outboard Marine Corporation, once the industry's second-largest powerboat and marine engine manufacturer until it filed for Chapter 11 protection, sold off its engine and boat brands, and ceased operations last February after nearly 60 years in business.
So how does one explain this unexpected spurt of boat show buying?
Blame it on aggressive promotions and a renewed desire since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 to spend time with the family, exhibitors said. Dealers were definitely dealing, offering sizable markdowns to those who bought at the show. On top of that, several manufacturers were offering low-interest, even no-interest, financing to qualified buyers. 
And, of course, boat show specials were everywhere. Surfside III was giving away a BMW Z3 sports car to buyers of Sea Ray motor yachts 46 feet long or longer through a company-sponsored promotion. 
Offers like these have been unheard of in the conservative boat business, where show promotions were once limited to free accessory packages or extra discounts on boat sales. 
"I think consumers recognize that there has never been a better time to buy a boat than now," said George Buckley, chairman and chief executive officer of Brunswick Corporation, the world's largest powerboat and marine engine maker. 
Buckley and others, however, said something else was at work. "People want to get on with their lives," said Mathews, referring to what he said was a change in attitudes since Sept. 11. "People would rather stay close to home and spend time with their families boating than fly to Europe."
Buckley agreed. 
"People are reassessing their priorities," he said. "They seem to be more interested in family activities, and boating fits that need perfectly."
But will this trend be strong enough to reverse the current downward spiral in the boating business?
For its part, the marine manufacturer's association predicts that the industry will rebound in the second half of the year, if an anticipated general economic upturn materializes by summer.
The New York Boat Show kicks off the all-important winter boat show season, which can account for as much as 50 percent of a boat dealer's annual sales. For that reason, it is considered by many to be a bellwether for the year ahead. 
On the heels of better-than-expected results at New York, several show exhibitors were declaring an end to the recession and the return of better days. But others were more pragmatic. 
"Dealers are looking for signs of optimism," said the cautious Buckley. "But a sunny day in November does not necessarily mean that summer is coming."

 BODY:
 PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS
A Study of Decline.
By Richard A. Posner.
408 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $29.95.
 I'm not sure I'm qualified to review this book. Starting on Page 209, there is a chart of the top 100 public intellectuals for the years 1995-2000. I'm all the way down at No. 85, whereas Richard A. Posner, the man whose work I'm supposed to be evaluating, is up at No. 70. It's true that on paper I should be able to satisfy reader demand better than those poor saps who are mired in the 90's (Noam Chomsky, James Q. Wilson, David Frum, William Butler Yeats and Lani Guinier). But there's just no way I'm going to be able to offer the kind of intellectual firepower you would get from, say, the big brains at rankings 72 through 76 (Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Lillian Hellman, Ann Coulter, David Horowitz and Albert Camus). 
If the editors of The Times Book Review are going to maintain any credibility, I do think the reviewer they choose should outrank the author (the rankings are based on media mentions, by the way). They should start by asking the National Champion Public Intellectual, Henry Kissinger, to review books, and then work their way through the rest of the chart toppers: Larry Summers, George Will, Salman Rushdie, Alan Dershowitz and so on. An outlet with the prestige of The Times shouldn't have to settle for a reviewer not in the top 50.
Then again, I'm not sure anybody is qualified to review "Public Intellectuals." Posner -- who, aside from being a judge on the United States Court of Appeals and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, publishes a new book more or less after every meal -- got the idea for it while surveying the work of public intellectuals on issues as diverse as the Clinton impeachment and the Microsoft controversy. He noticed something: We stink. Our logic is flawed. Our use of evidence is shoddy. Our ratiocination is crude. Not content simply to accept a world in which others are not as intelligent as he is, he set out to explain this surprising incompetence.
A founder of the theory of law and economics, Posner conceives the world of the commentariat as a market and tries to uncover what economic flaw explains our lousy product. He constructs a supply-and-demand chart as it applies to intellectuals, and helpfully explains:
"Line S represents the supply of that work. It slopes upward to indicate that the cost of supplying public-intellectual services increases with the quantity supplied. The intersection of D and S determines the quantity of public-intellectual services produced (q) and the 'price' (p) in money and other (call it psychic) income that the producers receive."
This allows him to point out:
"The reduction in the cost of supplying public-intellectual services could be shown in Figure 2.1 by rotating S downward from its intersection with the vertical axis. When this is done, S intersects D at a lower point, implying a lower market price and a greater output." 
I confess that my first reaction was that this must be a parody of law and economics reasoning. But this book is no parody. And so watching Posner try to apply economic laws to public debate is a bit like watching a Martian trying to use statistics to explain a senior prom. He is able to detect a few crude patterns, but he's missing the fraught complexity of the thing. Just consider the serial posturings of your average panel discussion -- the sycophantic introductions, the flattering references by the panelists to one another's work, the showtime vehemence of the professional radical, the slow-talking gravity of the emeritus thumb-sucker, the pompous pose of cogitation that symposiasts adopt as they pretend to listen to the other speakers. None of this is reducible to supply and demand. Cornel West cannot be captured in a chart.
With his Homo economicus mentality, Posner is at once too idealistic and too cynical. He's too idealistic because he misses all the little vanities of intellectual life. But he's too cynical because he is too quick to presume that intellectuals will respond like companies to the laws of supply and demand. If left-leaning intellectuals accrued greater benefits than right-leaning intellectuals, he posits, "there would then be a tendency for public intellectuals to reposition themselves politically until an equilibrium was restored." His attempt to reduce debate to economics leaves him disturbed that even though Robert Bellah's "Habits of the Heart" was gloomily wrong about the health of American culture, it still ranked a respectable 6,188th on the Amazon.com list as of Oct. 5, 2000. Why doesn't the market punish failure? he wonders. 
Posner's explanation is that public intellectuals aren't very good because nobody cares. Idea consumers don't care enough about what intellectuals say to monitor rigorously the quality of what gets said, and intellectuals, knowing that they can get away with anything, lazily spout whatever comes into their heads. "Absent, then, from this market are the conditions (such as an informed consuming public or expert consumer intermediaries, legally enforceable warranties of product quality and high costs of exit for sellers detected selling products of poor quality) that discipline other markets in credence goods," Posner writes. Fortunately, he argues, public intellectuals don't have any influence on debate, so it doesn't matter.
This conclusion doesn't stop Posner from reading, well, just about everything -- and finding it wanting. When he is not sketching out his theory of intellectual market failure, he scrupulously ignores it so that he can go off and correct the errors of others. He is like an omnidirectional Gatling gun, spraying shrapnel in all directions. He spends a few pages dismissing Robert Putnam here, a few paragraphs discarding David Riesman there, then a few pages exposing Richard Rorty somewhere else. Judge Posner is truly a hanging judge, because every public intellectual who comes into his sights is found wanting. Stephen Jay Gould is in error. Allan Bloom is wrong. Paul Krugman is ignorant. Sean Wilentz is full of it. Gertrude Himmelfarb, Christopher Lasch and Edward Luttwak are incorrect. The dozens of public thinkers Posner takes down are accused of everything from insufficient knowledge of British warplanes to ignorance of the anthropological literature on genital mutilation. If any modern intellectual has written a good book or made a valuable point, it escapes his notice (though he does call John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty" "great," if "superficial").
"Public Intellectuals" has a slapdash quality. Posner never tries to apply his theory to the people he condemns. If Robert Putnam is wrong, is it really because he is lazy and careless, as Posner's market failure theory would suggest? The way Posner shamelessly jams in his old book reviews to pad out his text -- he has an extraneous chapter on the depiction of technology in the works of Orwell and Huxley -- will leave journalist hacks like me gaping and applauding. When Posner is at his most disjointed, one is reminded of the cruel barb that a French critic once hurled at Jacques Attali: He's not prolific, he's incontinent.
BUT that's not really fair. Because Posner is, despite it all, a marvel. He is hyperactive like Harold Bloom, audacious like Christopher Hitchens and a practical man of the world like Alan Greenspan. About how many Americans can that be said? So he deserves attention no matter how infuriating he can be. Moreover, he charges gaily into the fray, voraciously aware of his own superiority. "We Feinschmeckers have to live with vulgarity in popular culture, the sight of overweight middle-aged men wearing shorts and baseball caps, weak coffee and the blare of the television set in every airport waiting lounge," he sighs. "It is doubtful that the public-intellectual market is a more debilitating or less intractable feature of contemporary American culture than these other affronts to the fastidious." 
In the end Posner is his own best refutation. He is not motivated by any impulse that can be captured through the reasoning of law and economics. No rational actor writes a sloppy book accusing the entire universe of American intellectuals of sloppiness; it's an act of reputational suicide. Posner wrote it, it seems, for the same reason the rest of the public intellectuals write their stuff: because human beings are social creatures who feel compelled to express their ideas. You might as well try to build an economic model to explain prayer. We express ourselves because of who we are, whether we do it on TV or in print or over dinner. Some are good at expressing ideas, some are not so good, and almost all of us, like Richard A. Posner, make asses of ourselves some of the time. Or at least we should.

 BODY:
 JOHN MARSHALL AND THE HEROIC AGE OF THE SUPREME COURT
By R. Kent Newmyer.
Illustrated. 511 pp.
Baton Rouge:
Louisiana State
University Press. $39.95.
 When John Marshall was appointed chief justice 200 years ago, the Supreme Court was an institutional backwater. By the time he died in 1835, it had become central to strong national government. When it spoke, usually through a Marshall opinion, the nation listened -- even if the political arguments continued. The court was not identified with the Constitution -- that would come much later -- but it shaped the terms of debate.
R. Kent Newmyer's long-awaited "interpretive biography" is less interested in Marshall as institution builder than in showing how Marshall's constitutional thinking developed during three decades as leader of an increasingly divided body. Marshall was not an aggressive nationalist whose views sprang full blown when he took office, as many critics and even early-20th-century scholars argued. According to Newmyer, he was a constitutional idealist "working to consolidate and legitimate the work of the Philadelphia convention" -- a strong union where private property was legally protected. Marshall only developed stridence when economic crises and the rise of Andrew Jackson made states' rights a more potent threat to the national government than at any time since the first administration of Thomas Jefferson.
The focal point of Marshall's change in tone, if not in temperament, was McCulloch v. Maryland in 1819, in which Marshall unified the court to uphold the constitutionality of the second Bank of the United States. The backlash was swift and sustained. "Rather than settling constitutional meaning once and for all," Newmyer notes, McCulloch and other "great nationalist opinions had called into action a Southern states' rights movement that dominated politics from the 1820's to the Civil War." 
Part of what fueled the Southern fury over McCulloch was the fear -- first raised in the constitutional ratifying conventions a generation earlier -- that the national government would use such broad power to undermine or abolish slavery. Newmyer carefully works through Marshall's private and public compromises with the slavocracy (he owned slaves himself, tried to keep the court from becoming entangled in the issue and privately chided colleagues willing to take it on).
Unlike Jean Edward Smith, whose 1996 biography sketched the personality and private life of Marshall in rich detail, Newmyer, who teaches law and history at the University of Connecticut School of Law, is more concerned with the pedigree of Marshall's ideas. That presents a problem. As Newmyer admits, Marshall "showed little interest in preserving his papers for posterity -- and even may have destroyed some of them." A diary, a bundle of revealing letters, private notes on cases -- Newmyer has nothing rich to mine. What remains, aside from plantation records and the odd letter here and there, are the opinions. Any biographer ends where he starts -- with Marshall's pronouncements from the bench. So Smith may emphasize personality; others, like Charles F. Hobson, may concentrate on Marshall's management of the court; and Newmyer can tease out the nuance of his thinking.
"John Marshall and the Heroic Age of the Supreme Court" is the most sophisticated one-volume treatment we now have of the great chief justice. Still, one longs for a volume that critically examines the humanity of Smith's Marshall, the active intelligence of Newmyer's and the institutional savvy of Hobson's. Until then, we have a series of attractive Marshalls who are nonetheless haunted by the specter of the accidental jurist who Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. thought had little truly original to offer beyond "a strong intellect, a good style, personal ascendancy in his court, courage, justice and convictions of his party."

HEADLINE: The Therapy Generation 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Berger; Leslie Berger is a freelance writer in New York and author of "The Grand Jury" (Chelsea House).

 BODY:
YOU see him walking north on Broadway, arms swinging, legs moving at such a brisk clip that you almost miss him, and suddenly you're sucked into the force field of a very busy, self-confident Co-lumbia University sophomore.
 The woman at the newsstand recognizes him and knows his brand of cigarettes, Dunhill Internationals. The freshman he bumps into at the corner, an eager fraternity pledge, solicits his advice on proper dress for a party later on. "I want you to look sharp, man," he tells the freshman, punching his arm. The pretty java jerk at Starbucks knows his preferred form of caffeine. "Another quad, huh?" she asks, laughing about the quadruple es-presso he downs three times a day. 
 You see him sitting cross-legged on the twin bed in his room, an oasis of family photos and DVD's on the top floor of a terminally disheveled fraternity house, and suddenly you're drawn into the leaden doubts of an often lonely, self-aware Columbia sophomore. 
Like other idealistic young people accustomed to affluence, Jeffrey Lorch is torn between a life of public service and one of creature comforts. His father and uncle were top executives of large corporations. He's clearly proud of their success, yet he feels tremendous pressure to meet Fortune 500 expectations. He's disappointed that none of his many dates have become long-term girlfriends. For that matter, he wonders how many true and lasting relationships he's actually made at college, or whether he's just racked up a bunch of acquaintances.
"There have been times when I've felt like every conversation was a sham," says Mr. Lorch, a wiry 20-year-old with wavy auburn hair and the mischievous look of a Peter Pan.
Late last spring, so mired in such thoughts that he holed up in his dorm room for several days, ordering in food and not wanting to see anybody, Mr. Lorch began therapy at Columbia's campus counseling center. He estimates that he attended a dozen sessions before he was referred to an off-campus psychiatrist, whom he continued to see through the summer and into his sophomore year.
In taking that step, Mr. Lorch joined some 2,600 other students who sought help at Columbia's counseling center last year and thousands more across the nation whose increasing use of psychotherapy is forcing campus mental health services to reevaluate their mission and expand. This fall, partly in response to highly publicized suicides and partly because of growing recognition of mental health needs, Columbia, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Michigan began new research projects and programs aimed at improving their services. Concerns remain, however, over waiting times for appointments and frequent referrals off campus, especially at suburban and rural colleges with long commutes to medical centers and limited public transportation.
Columbia's counseling service reports a 40 percent increase in use since the 1994-95 academic year. Illustrating experts' views that the Ivy League is not alone in increasing demand, the State University of New York at Purchase has seen a 48 percent increase over the last three years. The events of Sept. 11 and since have further strained resources. On the Purchase campus, for example, counselors saw almost as many students during the fall semester as the entire 1997-98 school year.
"We are drowning here," says Robin Kaufman, director of the SUNY-Purchase counseling center. "Right now, if it's not an emergency, it's two to two and a half weeks to get an appointment. Plus, students seen on a regular basis are getting bumped."
No one seems to dispute that diagnosis has improved or that the stigma of therapy has faded. But experts cite other reasons for the steadily growing use of campus counseling, including a complex blend of cultural forces that has created new levels of student anxiety and depression. 
The classic concerns -- leaving home, fitting in, forming relationships, doing well, finding the right career -- have been complicated by more split families, more lifestyle choices, the alienating effects of technology, constant bombardment of information, a shrinking economy and mounting academic pressure.
"College does not exist independently of society," says Vivian Boyd, director of the counseling center at the College Park campus of the University of Maryland and president of the International Association of Counseling Services, which accredits university counseling systems. "The whole notion of the divorce rate among parents, the economic shifts that are occurring, the disappearing of whole classes of jobs that people used to count on going into, the fact that the degrees of freedom of making choices in your life are growing shorter and shorter because the cost of being wrong comes at a higher price -- there are societal pressures that exist independent of the college environment to which young people are responding."
"People are being exposed to all kinds of things at a much earlier age, including pressure to compete," Dr. Boyd adds. "How many people do you know who don't have a 3-year-old in some sort of preschool program?"
YOU see her outside Columbia's metal and glass student center, and she beams through her pale freckles and long curls and readily shares that she saw a therapist in high school, in suburban Boston. 
A quintessential overachiever -- "It's like a compulsion. I just have to do well!" -- Rebecca Warner explains that she had started to panic during tests and briefly tried anti-anxiety medication before her exams. At some point, whether it came from her therapy or her own common sense, she learned how to recognize when she was putting too much pressure on herself, a valuable tool for a college freshman.
"I'm considered pretty high-strung," the 18-year-old says, smiling. Her candor and the slightly goofy cock of her head suggest otherwise.
Weeks later, you sit across from her in Starbucks and hear the excruciating saga of how, in the midst of midterms, her roommate and assumed friend announced that she wanted to move out. 
"It was really strange to find out that what you thought was going really well, really wasn't," she says. Even someone as solid as Ms. Warner, it seems, can be buffeted by the twists and turns of college life.
"At first, my response was that I felt really guilty and horrible," she says. "Then I felt really angry. Apparently she had been thinking about moving out for a couple weeks and hadn't told me at all! Then I felt like I needed her to move, because it was too strange to live with someone who felt they couldn't live with me."
"It was a failure, sort of," says Ms. Warner, who is interested in neurobiology and modern dance. "I wanted a roommate for good and for bad, and she had a totally different perspective." 
YOU hear him talking about life away from home and he seems to be a model of serenity and cerebral detachment. It's a glorious Indian summer afternoon, and Plato's "Five Dialogues" lies open on his lap.
"The hardest thing about adjusting to college is eating and sleeping," says Ryan Ruby, a Columbia freshman. "It sounds petty, but when you're in high school, you have a regimented schedule. At college, you have to coordinate your own schedule with the dining hall and classes and that tends to be destabilizing."
He suggests that more students may be seeking help simply because therapy has lost its stigma. "This is a generation of psychological kids," he says. "We were really brought up with the idea that you go and get help and talk out your ideas."
He acknowledges that he has thought about seeing a therapist. "I'm a really moody individual," says Mr. Ruby, who is from Los Angeles. So far he hasn't sought counseling because his moods may be part of who he is and he's not sure he wants to lose them. Playing the guitar he brought from home seems to help when he's worried or feeling low.
"Once you're removed from your comfort zone, if you will, you have to find a new one," he says.
Though upperclassmen are hardly exempt and comprise a proportionate share of campus counseling patients, separation from home and old friends and the double-edged sword of freedom can make freshman year especially disorienting. 
Martin E. P. Seligman, a widely published author and research psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, tries to prevent depression in freshmen by teaching those at greatest risk how to defend themselves against pessimistic thoughts. A modern-day proponent of old-fashioned optimism, he offers training sessions for 8 to 10 students aimed at disputing negative thinking. 
The idea is to catch yourself in self-defeating thoughts like, "This is going really badly, I've really lost my touch," Dr. Seligman says, and then to build up a mental argument for why that isn't so. 
For the last 11 years, in a program replicated elsewhere, he has been sending a questionnaire about pessimism and optimism to all students admitted to the University of Pennsylvania. Those who rank among the most pessimistic (viewed as more susceptible to depression) are urged to participate in the workshops.
Researchers at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor also hope to catch depression early through detection and intervention. A new Comprehensive Depression Center, announced in November, will study the illness in the general population but will also treat students as part of the university's mental health system, according to John F. Greden, its director and chairman of the department of psychiatry. 
"These disorders are treatable," he says. "The progression is generally preventable." Eventually, the program is supposed to be consolidated within a proposed $32 million building.
M.I.T., criticized for having the highest student suicide rate in the country, similarly announced plans in the fall for a major overhaul of its mental health services. Changes include extended appointment hours, 100 percent insurance coverage for off-campus services, and an education and outreach program aimed at making students more comfortable seeking help. 
In its mental health task force report in November, M.I.T. showed a 50 percent increase in the use of its mental health services between 1995 and 2000. It also showed an increase of about 69 percent in student psychiatric hospitalizations, "reflecting a growing number of students with serious mental health conditions."
Columbia, meanwhile, just began a survey of the class of 2005, an effort to provide better services by tracking 200 freshmen through the current academic year and possibly until they graduate. Though not the first of its kind, the $100,000-a-year study claims to be the deepest. Participants log on to a confidential Web site once a week, respond to a checklist of questions about personal events, and then write briefly about the highs and lows of the past few days.
"There is growing concern on campuses about student mental health," says George A. Bonanno, the psychologist at Teachers College at Columbia who is directing the study. He expects the responses to shed new light on students' inner lives and explain why some cope better than others do, how those at risk might be better identified, and what experiences are the hardest.
Even before its new research project was conceived last spring, Columbia was steadily expanding its counseling center and a network of related services, adding staff almost annually for the last several years. The counseling center employs the equivalent of 20 full-time psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, the backbone of a mental health system described by the counseling center's director, Richard Eichler, as "an unusually well-funded and extensive service." 
That service includes individual and couples counseling, and daily walk-in sessions for those in urgent need. "If you say you need to be seen, you'll be seen," Dr. Eichler says. 
The students' yearly health plan covers the costs of mental health services, including off-campus referrals. The center also sponsors support groups for minority students, students in bereavement, those who procrastinate and those who are coming out as gays and lesbians, among others.
Still, Dr. Eichler acknowledges that the center has what he calls "an expectation of brief psychotherapy," meaning a few months of treatment at most. He also worries that nonemergency appointments must often be made several weeks in advance. 
"I'm in the process of adding five or six new therapists on a temporary basis because our wait was getting a little longer than we'd like," Dr. Eichler says. Before Sept. 11, 55 new students a week were seen at the center; afterward, that figure climbed to 90. 
YOU hear her describe her new fear of flying and you can't help but empathize. Lisa Goldenberg, a sophomore at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., did not go home to Tampa, Fla., for Thanksgiving because she could not bring herself to board a plane after Sept. 11. Two sessions with campus counselors (one a private pilot) helped calm her, but then the Nov. 12 American Airlines crash in Queens set her back. She did finally board a flight home for the year-end holidays. 
"I've always been aware that anything could happen at any time, but it was kind of like constantly in my head," says Ms. Goldenberg, who has traveled widely by herself. "I felt like I had no control over anything."
"All my friends here are just a drive away from home, and all my friends in Florida are a drive away from there," she continues. "And I just hated being so far away. If it had happened two years ago, I probably wouldn't be at school."
Though the reaction has been felt more keenly closer to New York City, marked increases in traffic at counseling centers, an estimated 17 to 22 percent, have been seen across the country, according to Dr. Boyd of the International Association of Counseling Services. Counseling centers traditionally see an increase during late fall because visits home and the approach of final exams tend to stir strong emotions. But Dr. Boyd and others suspect the sharp rise reflected a response to the terrorist attacks, although a direct link is hard to pin down because many first-time patients describe classic symptoms of distress without specifically mentioning hijackings, war or bioterrorism. 
"They can't concentrate, and they can't understand why," says Dr. Kaufman at SUNY-Purchase, a suburban campus about 45 minutes north of New York City. "They have lots of anxiety, they can't get out of bed. Basically, it feels like a very unsafe world."
But the apparent reaction to Sept. 11 only underscores issues that campus mental health workers were already seeing.
To begin with, Dr. Kaufman and others note, the college years are when depression and other mental illness tend to first manifest themselves. College itself does not cause depression, but its stresses, including sleep deprivation and substance abuse, can trigger depression in those already vulnerable, as some 15 percent of the general population is believed to be. Moreover, some research shows that depression among young people has been steadily increasing, Dr. Seligman says. "It's gone from being a housewife's disorder to a student's," he says.
Dr. Seligman blames cultural factors for building an emotionally fragile generation, including a self-centered society and victimology, or "the belief that when bad things happen, you played no role, it was done to you." 
"It's learned helplessness," he says, "and when you feel helpless, that's a recipe for depression." 
The self-esteem movement has also backfired, Dr. Seligman says, by causing children to become addicted to constant praise.
Antidepressants and Ritalin may also account for a greater number of students going off to college with psychiatric histories. For the last several years, 85 percent of those polled by the National Survey of Counseling Center Directors reported seeing more college students with severe problems, including learning disabilities, clinical depression and bipolar disorder. 
"Many who wouldn't have made it to college in the past now do so because of medication," says Robert P. Gallagher, the author of the annual survey and former director of the University of Pittsburgh's counseling center. 
"Anybody capable of doing the work ought to have a crack at it," Dr. Gallagher says. "But it's putting more pressure on the people providing the services. It's a bit of a struggle because many centers have gone to briefer-term interventions in the last 10 years or so. Those with more serious problems obviously need more time, and many have gone to 8- or 10- or 12-session limits. And it's harder to find places to refer students because community mental health places are also overwhelmed."
Several of these concerns played a role in the suicide last year of Candy R. Wei, a 20-year-old sophomore at the University of Michigan, according to her mother, Jing Wang. a professor of Chinese cultural studies at M.I.T.
Ms. Wei suffocated herself with a plastic bag in her dormitory room on Jan. 16, 2001, apparently after learning that her appointment with a new, off-campus psychiatrist had been switched to another patient. 
Ms. Wei, an art and design major who had a five-year history of psychiatric treatment, had just returned to the campus from home after a breakdown during the fall semester. She and her mother had been anxious for her to quickly establish a rapport with a local therapist. But Dr. Wang says she had called three off-campus psychiatrists before finding one who could schedule a meeting with her daughter.
She says that before her daughter came home, she had sought help at Michigan's campus counseling center but was told she had to wait a week and a half to see someone. "She felt so discouraged, she didn't want to go back," Dr. Wang says.
Ms. Wei had also been to the university hospital's emergency rooms twice: the first time, she was told about its psychiatric emergency services, but she was not admitted; two days later, she went to psychiatric services with her mother, who had sensed her daughter was in crisis and had flown in to help her. A doctor recommended hospitalization. But Dr. Wang says that by then, after all the delays, she was not comfortable with the campus services and had just wanted to get her daughter home.
"We consider Candy Wei's case a real tragedy," says a University of Michigan spokesman, Michael Harrison. "Although I can't comment on the specifics, I will say that we very carefully assess each patient and determine their care, under the guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association and our own experts, to develop treatment protocols. We hope that their family or their support system will take advantage of these treatment recommendations."
Dr. Greden of Michigan says that "mental health services in general, not just at the University of Michigan, are filled with gaps in providers and in coverage -- our society has yet to step up to that."
Is too much expected of universities? It seems, Dr. Greden responds, that they are being held to a different standard.
"When corporations don't provide coverage for mental health, when insurance companies provide limits for coverage for mental health, it's puzzling that universities should have different standards," he says. "I wish all of us had a higher bar."
THERE are success stories: You see her sitting in the counseling center's sun-filled waiting room at SUNY-Purchase, and her quiet composure tells you she is thankful. She is 24, older than most seniors, and she is light years ahead in hard-won wisdom. For more than a year she has been coming to therapy here once a week, always booking the first appointment of the day so she won't miss any classes. She doesn't want her name used because her case involves sexual abuse, and relatives who won't acknowledge it. 
Her crisis came last year when she was a resident adviser at a campus dorm and one of her charges was being beaten by a boyfriend. Despite her efforts to help, the young woman refused first aid, refused to fill out a police report and finally went home with the abusive man. 
Yet she was the one who was left feeling helpless. "I felt alone," she remembers. "I couldn't go to class." 
A professor urged her to get counseling. "I'd probably been dealing with lifelong depression without knowing it," she says she realized.
A prep school student from the Bronx on a scholarship, she recognized how hard it had been to reconcile her background with that of her classmates. "I come from a poor background, though it's still very hard to say that," she says. The contrast between school and home was overwhelming. "Going home hurt a lot, every single time."
SUNY is her fourth college and her second round of therapy, although the counselor at her first school, an elite private college, "didn't get it." Her current one apparently does. She no longer smokes, drinks or eats refined sugar. She is weaning herself off Wellbutrin. She is applying to law school. She was thrown a lifeline.
"I feel it's been a complete turnaround for me," she says.
YOU see Mr. Lorch again, this time in a neighborhood bistro. The restaurant staff clearly recognizes him and seats him in the smoking section. In a perfect French accent, he orders the spring rolls of duck confit, followed by fresh mahi. Memories of a disappointing date are bothering him. 
"She's only a freshman," he says with a sigh. "There's that ever-present question about the last boyfriend, the boyfriend from home, whether or not to get together with him again over break." 
He has spent the afternoon meeting with two professors, both times about midterm papers, including one he may have to revise. 
He's pretty sure he wants to major in Middle Eastern history, culture and languages, an existing interest that was clarified by the war in Afghanistan. So were his plans to enlist in the Navy after college for a career in military intelligence before possibly entering politics. "I feel one of our biggest problems today is that we're ignorant of different cultures, and if I become a policy maker, I feel I'd be better at it if I know something about them," he says. 
In one way, recent events have made him feel more confident about his future "because I can make a real impact," he says. But it also makes him feel "less comfortable about humanity as a whole, less confident about the general goodness and understanding in people that we should all have."
Even now, six months after withdrawing to his room, the inability to find authentic human connections worries him. He describes growing up in Lancaster County, Pa., and what it was like to be a boss's kid. Moving to Paris for high school was liberating. Moving back to the United States for college was a shock. 
He has stopped seeing his therapist, though he is supposed to keep taking Prozac and check in when it runs out. He seems no more sensitive than the next overtired collegian, and a lot more succinct than most. "Getting an A on a paper gives me a boost," he says. "Getting dumped really doesn't."
Staying busy helps, so he keeps his days filled with classes, meetings with professors, his hobby of painting, his mentoring of pledges and other fraternity work.
"Through therapy and my friends I think I've been able to find an equilibrium, though I'm not entirely happy with it," he says, sipping a double espresso. "I'm done with therapy for now. It's not a quick fix."

 BODY:
Parents squealed last fall when state colleges, pinched by the economic slowdown and declines in state aid, raised yearly tuitions, many of them by several hundred dollars a student. But some of those same parents have been less attuned to finances in another area, sending their children off to college with wallets bulging with high-interest-rate credit cards. 
 The incongruity was noted by Tahira K. Hira, an associate vice provost at Iowa State University. "We had kids and parents all over the place saying, 'We can't afford this,"' she said, referring to the recent $300 tuition increase at Iowa State. "Meanwhile, they or their kids were paying a 22 percent interest rate on their credit cards." 
 Dr. Hira's observations are not just hyperbole. After years of studying and teaching family financial planning and personal finance, she is certain that many, if not most, students do not understand the effect that unpaid credit card bills have on their well being, financial and otherwise. 
"We know there are kids who start bringing in a lot of credit card debt without recognizing they are adding debt," Dr. Hira said. "They don't realize the cards move from an instrument of transaction to an instrument of borrowing at a very high cost. They don't understand that because they have never been taught that clearly."
Nearly 80 percent of undergraduate degree recipients in the 1999-2000 school year carried at least one credit card as students, according to a report by the American Council on Education. The data came from the Department of Education's National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, which in 2000 included questions about credit cards for the first time.
Almost half the students who responded carried a balance on their cards from month to month, and the median balance on those cards was $1,600. That means that students were racking up, on average, $240 to $400 of interest charges each year. 
That estimate is probably conservative, moreover, because the Department of Education survey covers only students who completed a degree or certificate program, and who were financially dependent on their parents. College and university officials report that it is no longer uncommon for some students to drop out before completing their degree because of the burden of credit card debt. 
Drop out, or worse. Last year, the television newsmagazine "60 Minutes II" profiled two college students -- one who had recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma and the other who was enrolled at the University of Central Oklahoma -- who had committed suicide while struggling with credit card debts of thousands of dollars apiece.
Pick a campus virtually anywhere in the country, stroll around on registration day or during orientation, and you are likely to run into a table where students are offered Frisbees or T-shirts or even cash rebates if they sign up for a credit card. These are not disinterested solicitors. They are often students at the same university who earn extra money for each completed application delivered and whose fraternity or social club is being paid a fee by the credit card issuer.
Universities sometimes work hand in hand with the credit card companies on these efforts. In June, the General Accounting Office published a study that surveyed 12 universities and colleges, both public and private and of varying sizes, about their credit card policies. It found that 10 of the 12 allowed on-campus "tabling," or solicitation of students in the student union or at other sites. Eight allowed credit card applications to be inserted into bookstore bags. And 11 had alumni associations that offered an "affinity card" -- a credit card that carries the logo of the university and pays rebates to the institution based on cardholder spending.
Those programs can provide substantial payments to the universities. Edmund Mierzwinski, the consumer program director for the United States Public Interest Research Group, said large public universities typically earned millions from contracts with card issuers. 
The G.A.O. also surveyed the companies. Among its findings were that four of the six credit card issuers that responded to the survey had eliminated standard income and employment requirements for college students. One issuer deemed it more important which college a student attended than whether the student was employed.
The credit card issuers, which hope to capture upwardly mobile graduates as lifelong customers, argue that it is important for students to build a good credit record so they can buy a car or otherwise establish themselves once they leave college. Also, the students to whom they market are of legal age and able to vote and to drive -- if not, in most cases, to drink.
"If you are old enough to go to college, we think you can understand the idea that when you sign up for a credit card, using the card creates a loan," said Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. "Yes, there are people who get into credit card trouble, but those are people of all ages, not just college students."
Training in financial literacy has to begin at a young age, she said, adding that the credit card industry contributed to the effort with programs in junior high and high schools as well as at colleges.
"A lot of consumer groups like to make it sound like you turn 18 and you go to college or go into the workplace or into the Army and you start spending money," Ms. Pulley said. "That's just not the case. In our society, an 18- or 19-year-old has already been targeted and marketed to with far more aggressive tactics" than those used by credit card companies. "It's ridiculous for consumer groups to claim that students are unfairly lured by a T-shirt or a Frisbee."
After several years of negative publicity, credit card issuers have vowed to restrain some of their practices or discontinue them, like offering cash gifts to successful applicants.
But Mr. Mierzwinski does not believe they have restricted their marketing to students much. "We have seen increased activity by student activists trying to rein in some of the programs," he said. "And some colleges have added debt orientation programs. But I've seen no real decline in marketing or aggressiveness."
Some schools are beefing up their activities. Iowa State plans to add sessions on credit cards and personal finance to its orientation program next fall. For the last several years, Wellesley College has sent parents of incoming freshmen a letter requesting they sit down with their children to discuss credit cards and their appropriate use.
Voncile White, the dean of first-year students at Wellesley, said that while the college had offered sessions on financial strategies during student orientation, "we find there's very little we can do if parents haven't talked to students before they left home."
The pattern that has been repeated too often, Dean White said, was for a student to fall behind on credit card payments. "Then, she'll think she can pick up a job to deal with it. Then, her academics suffer," sometimes leading to failure or withdrawal from school. "They are already in trouble before someone like me finds out about it," she added. 
Debt problems are not limited to college students, as Ms. Pulley pointed out. But in many cases, students mirror the financial behavior of their parents, who are often laboring under their own burden of debt.
"Financial illiteracy is one of America's untold stories," Mr. Mierzwinski said. "Every survey we've ever done suggests the need for more training, more skill building. Certainly there is value in a student building a credit record. But many students are ruining their credit record before they even leave college."
And often, it seems, parents are unwittingly helping them do it.

 BODY:
MAGGIE CHAU was in her final year of high school in Hong Kong when she saw a newspaper ad for a college fair. Organized by Linden Tours, a private company, the fair took place in a Hong Kong hotel ballroom, where admissions representatives from some 40 American institutions handed out brochures and fielded questions from students interested in studying in the United States.
 Ms. Chau browsed the exhibit hall with a couple of goals in mind: she wanted to go to an institution with the word "university" in its name -- not a college -- and she wanted to be in New York City. So she applied to Adelphi University and the University of Pittsburgh. 
 Pittsburgh? Fortunately for Ms. Chau, she wound up at Adelphi, in Garden City, Long Island -- a stone's throw from Manhattan by comparison. 
According to Linda Heaney, the owner of Linden Tours, which has organized college fairs abroad since 1982, Ms. Chau is not alone in her preferences. Just try to convince a prospective foreign student that a liberal arts college is as good as a university.
"I think I am qualified for a university," Ms. Chau says. She likes the small classes and dormitory life at Adelphi enough that she has persuaded a friend in Hong Kong to join her there next fall. 
Higher education, in the form of international enrollments, is the fifth-largest service export in the United States. It brings $11 billion into the American economy each year through the nearly 550,000 students who live and study here. Its impact on foreign policy is harder to measure but no less vast: experts are fond of pointing out that Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations, President Vicente Fox of Mexico and Prince Abdullah of Jordan, among other world leaders, all studied here. 
And yet, for the most part, this industry's movers and shakers, the deal makers behind it all, are 17-year-olds like Ms. Chau in far-flung places like China, India, Mexico and Turkey. 
Many of these prospective students have no reason to know that Pittsburgh isn't in New York. They're not necessarily interested in a university's fraternity scene, its varsity sports or even its student-to-faculty ratio. What they do know is that they want a degree in their field of interest from the world's most highly valued education system, in the language that dominates international business, culture and politics.
With more than three times as many students as its top four English-speaking competitors combined -- Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- the United States is the No. 1 destination for international students. "The United States is almost universally viewed as having the very best system with the broadest number of choices," says Barmak Nassirian, an official with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. "There is not a field I can think of where the United States does not dominate."
But recent events may make international admissions officers' jobs significantly harder. "Since Sept. 11, and in the context of all the suspicion, concern and trepidation about the presence of foreign students on U.S. campuses," Mr. Nassirian laments, "there is a tremendous degree of uncertainty within admissions about whether any kind of reasonable approach to recruitment of foreign students will in fact be possible."
GIVEN the popularity of American higher education, recruiters have not had to expend much energy persuading potential students to come. Instead, their focus has been on steering them toward a particular institution. There are more than 3,000 colleges and universities in the United States -- many in cities the students have never heard of. How do they distinguish among all these options? It's hard enough for American teenagers. 
New York University, the single most popular university among international students, has it made. "There is no more cosmopolitan city than New York, and we bear the city's name," notes John Beckman, an N.Y.U. spokesman. "In a different city, would it be the same? It's somewhat unlikely."
Foreign students gravitate to the country's 12 largest urban regions. Many prefer to go "where there are ethnic restaurants and diversity is understood," Ms. Heaney says. But as much as New York's immensity seems an asset to N.Y.U., Garden City's tranquillity is a selling point for Adelphi, says its associate director of international admissions, Claudia Salazar. Parents of Latin American students are especially keen on Adelphi's safety, she says. And Paul Greene, director of international undergraduate admissions at Boston University, says international students love Boston's "Old World, European charm." Far from home, many choose a simulated proximity: European students often select Massachusetts, Latin Americans Florida, and Asians California. 
Ms. Heaney estimates that on average, prospective students have heard of 10 American universities. Six or seven will be the usual high-profile suspects. But the others are often surprising. Malaysian students tend to know Western Michigan State University, the University of Northern Illinois and the University of Missouri. Why? Because Malaysian students have attended those universities in the past, taking back stories and building alumni networks. The universities, in turn, have become familiar with Malaysian students' needs and qualifications. A relationship was born.
Because they actively recruit, 200 to 250 universities enroll almost all the foreign students in the United States, Ms. Heaney says. 
For some institutions, of course, recruiting isn't an issue at all. Everyone knows the Harvard name. Foreign students at N.Y.U. shrug when asked how they came to hear of the university. "We know some famous American schools," says one South Korean student. 
But active recruitment can make a big difference for lesser-known places like Adelphi, which increased its foreign enrollments by 30 percent in 1999-2000 and 31 percent in 2000-2001. Face-to-face contact is the secret. If a guidance counselor at a high school in India knows Claudia Salazar's face, he's that much more likely to direct his students toward Adelphi. Boston University, the longtime frontrunner in absolute numbers of foreign students (recently surpassed by N.Y.U. and others), has recruited actively overseas for years, even setting up permanent liaison offices in seven countries. As a result, its international enrollments have approximately doubled to 4,400 since the early 1980's. 
Boston's early 80's recruitment drive matched a broader national trend. A demographic dip in the number of American 18-year-olds coincided with the 1979 Iranian revolution, which reduced a once sizable stream of Iranian students to a mere trickle. Universities recruited students from Asia and Europe to fill out shrinking classes. Another sea change came as recently as the late 1990's, when East Asia's financial crisis forced many universities to turn to Latin America to replace the international students they lost from the Pacific rim. Since then, Latin American enrollments in American universities have been growing at twice the rate of European ones. Enrollments from Saudi Arabia have dropped off over the last 40 years as its own, more religiously oriented education system has grown. 
Given how politically sensitive foreign recruiting can be, it's no surprise that along with the Commerce Department, which runs college fairs around the world, the State Department sponsors some 450 advising centers globally. These offices, often attached to United States embassies or Fulbright commissions, reach out to prospective students and disseminate information. International admissions professionals rely on them as an alternative to the expense of private touring (a Linden Tours fall jaunt through Asia costs up to $15,000). But the system was stripped of funds by the Republican Congress in 1994, and it is only slowly being rebuilt.
"Every other country that is a major provider of higher education in English has a proactive recruiting strategy," says Victor Johnson, associate executive director for public policy at the Association of International Educators. "The United States doesn't." Ms. Heaney is blunt: "The United States government assumed everyone would learn about us through CNN and 'Dallas."'
Recently, a more unsettling image of American life has dominated. In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, many foreign students and parents had safety concerns. These days, campuses are calm. But in every corner of the recruiting and admissions business, experts report student anxiety, even in friendly states like Kuwait, over whether they'll be subjected to harsher visa scrutiny, or get visas at all.
"Even before this happened, we'd been hearing that students from some countries were looking at other options because it was becoming so difficult to get visas," Mr. Greene of Boston University says. "Students were feeling alienated from the United States because of the whole process. They don't feel welcome." 
After Sept. 11, members of Congress criticized the student visa system as being virtually unregulated, a weak link in efforts to keep terrorists out of the country; at least one hijacker had entered the United States on a student visa but had never showed up for classes. In an ensuing crackdown, 10 foreigners were arrested in San Diego for violating the terms of their student visas.
Early on, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, had called for a moratorium on all student visas and a more extensive tracking system for all foreign nationals within the United States. In the end, the bill she co-sponsored, which will be debated in the Senate in mid-January, prohibits entry to students from seven countries suspected of sponsoring terrorism -- Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, North Korea and Cuba -- unless applicants obtain special clearance from the State Department. Once in the country, all student visa holders would be tracked by both universities and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The House passed a nearly identical bill in late December.
"We know there are going to be delays" in getting visas, Mr. Nassirian says, "but it makes a difference how long. A few extra weeks? A few extra months? If it ends up being a few extra years, that will for all intents and purposes eliminate those students from play."
That, most everyone in admissions agrees, would be a bad thing. The economic rationale is clear, not just on account of the tuition and consumer spending foreign students bring in, but also because foreign graduate students provide up to a third of all teaching assistants at many large research universities, and they contribute to the nation's edge in fields like computer science. David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, a lobbying group, goes so far as to suggest that were it not for East Asian students bringing their skills to American research universities, the information technology revolution of the 1990's would probably have happened in Japan rather than in the United States.
The politics, however, are equally compelling. For example, Mr. Johnson points to the up to 2,000 Iranians studying in the United States. "It would be silly to cut those people off," he says. "Iran is in the middle of a fundamental debate in its society about what direction that society is going to go. Why would we say that no Iranian can come here, be exposed to American society, and go back and be a force for Westernization in Iran?" Indeed, Iranian students in Ms. Feinstein's home state have actively protested her bill. 
If there is to be a chilling effect, it has yet to be seen. So far, admissions offices report that early admissions applications from foreign students have equaled or exceeded numbers from past years. Adelphi, which has a rolling admissions policy, has already had 15 percent more international applications than last year. Inquiries by phone, e-mail and walk-in have continued to keep the State Department's advising centers hopping. Recent college fairs in Latvia and India reported unabated interest.
Mr. Greene guards against hasty optimism, suggesting that such reports are not necessarily an indicator of applicants' final intentions. "You have to put it in perspective," he says. "Our admissions deadline is Jan. 1. A student can't afford to wait until May or June to see that the coast is clear, or that the legislation is not as bad as we thought it was." That is, will the students who are accepted choose to matriculate? If they do, will they be granted visas? And even then, will they go through with their plans? 
Like all export industries, higher education faces competition. But whether the edge will pass to Canada or Australia is a question not for economists or trade analysts, but for some 17-year-olds, somewhere.

Like a Tsunami

BYLINE:  By Jacques Steinberg; Jacques Steinberg is a national education correspondent for The Times.

 BODY:
THE highest court in Hawaii had just dealt a setback to the islands' beleaguered native population, and Evan S. Dobelle, the new president of the state university, decided that he had to respond.
 Never mind that he was neither a plaintiff nor a defendant in the case. 
 Dr. Dobelle was angry that the judges had brushed aside the native Hawaiians' claim that they were entitled to some revenue from the state's main airport, which sits on territory that their ancestors ceded to white settlers in the 19th century. But he was more incensed about the timing: the much-anticipated ruling had been issued on Sept. 12, just a day after the terrorist attacks. Dr. Dobelle was sure the judges were trying to bury it. 
And so Dr. Dobelle, who had moved to Hawaii only two months earlier, summoned his senior aides to inform them what he was going to do: convene a news conference to denounce the decision, and announce that the university would immediately spend $1.5 million to improve its teaching of native culture and language. The court might not be willing to do right by native Hawaiians, but the university would certainly try.
"I apologize for not cornering everyone and asking their opinion,o Dr. Dobelle told his top aides inside the mahogany paneled conference room adjoining his office. "I'm just going to assume it's everyone's opinion. It's the right thing to do. And when you know the right thing to do, you don't have to have a discussion.o
For those who have followed his many previous incarnations -- as the self-described "kid mayoro of Pittsfield, Mass. (in his 20's), as chief of protocol for President Jimmy Carter (in his early 30's) and, until last spring, as president of Trinity College in Hartford -- this was vintage Dobelle: self-confident, impatient, maybe a little condescending, but always perched on the moral high ground.
The only surprising thing was that his act was now playing in Hawaii.
Dr. Dobelle, 56, has washed ashore in Honolulu with the quiet calm of a tsunami, jolting a state university that has long enjoyed a reputation for being as laid back and intellectually flabby as a tourist on Waikiki. Yet few here have disputed how he has framed his mission: to take an institution that caters mostly to commuters living at home with their parents (more of a high school than a college, many say), and transform it into a world-class university that attracts thousands of top students from the mainland United States and Asia.
After he has fulfilled the terms of his contract -- which will pay him nearly $450,000 a year for at least the next seven years -- Dr. Dobelle has pledged that Manoa, the university's flagship campus on the outskirts of the state capital, will be on its way to joining Ann Arbor, Charlottesville and maybe even Berkeley in the pantheon of public higher education.
"Change is always hard," said Dr. Dobelle, who has put away his well-worn button-down shirts in favor of the flowery blouses that Hawaiians wear for business and pleasure. "It's particularly hard in a state where the status quo is celebrated, and mediocrity is acceptable. For whatever reason, this institution has not, historically, had the opportunity to compete."
In seeking to reverse that trend, Dr. Dobelle has been a font of big ideas since his arrival in July. He has won permission from the State Legislature to sell $150 million in bonds to help build a medical school, cancer research center and biomedical research complex, which, he said, would generate more than 2,000 medical and construction jobs. 
To help envision that satellite campus, Dr. Dobelle has enlisted the help of a respected planning firm from the mainland, Cooper, Robertson & Partners, which has also been hired by two developers to design plans for the World Trade Center site.
Because the university has only 3,000 dormitory rooms in Manoa for its 18,000 students (most rooms are occupied by those who grew up on the outer islands), Dr. Dobelle has proposed building 5,000 new rooms to help attract students, as well as student-athletes, from the continental United States and abroad. 
"Why can't we have Chinese swimmers, Japanese baseball players and Korean soccer players?" he asked. "We can."
To market the university to that wider audience, Dr. Dobelle has imported another established outsider to serve as vice president of external affairs. He is Paul Costello, who was assistant press secretary to the first lady, Rosalynn Carter, in the late 1970's and press secretary to Kitty Dukakis when her husband, Michael, was running for president in 1988.
But in looking toward the mainland, Dr. Dobelle has hardly neglected those already attending the university. He has pledged to build a small town full of restaurants and retail shops -- again, think Ann Arbor -- adjacent to the main campus, which is now so devoid of commercial establishments that there is little reason for students and professors to hang around after class.
And he has proposed creating a program for honors students that would urge its matriculants to graduate in four years. (Many now take as many as seven years, and the average age at graduation is 25.)
"It's refreshing to have someone with ideas who's talking about making changes," said Mary Tiles, a professor of philosophy at Manoa for 12 years. "But at the moment, it's hard for us to know what's going to be taken seriously and what's going to turn out to be hot air."
Indeed, in seeking to realize his vision, Dr. Dobelle faces numerous challenges. 
For one thing, the percentage of students enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools in Hawaii (nearly 20 percent) is higher than in any other state, according to a recent Associated Press analysis of census data. Partly in response to Hawaiians' historic attachment to religious schools, and partly because of the state's low-rated public school system, the stigma of a Hawaiian public education has attached itself to the university as well: children who have the resources to attend college on the mainland usually do.
Moreover, their recent largess notwithstanding, the State Legislature and governor have cut the university's $800 million budget several times in recent years, prompting its professors to strike for 13 days last spring. (Though the Hawaiian economy plunged after Sept. 11, Dr. Dobelle said he had received assurances from Gov. Benjamin Cayetano that he supports the university's request for more than $300 million in additional construction financing in 2002.)
The much-talked-about aloha spirit, characterized by good will and generosity in its best sense, has also created an insular world of noncompetitive government contracts that are sometimes steered to officials' friends and family, practices that Dr. Dobelle has vowed to stamp out as the university heads into a construction boom.
It was in that spirit that Dr. Dobelle sent letters this fall to more than 200 top administrators, including the dean of the medical school, informing them that he reserved the right under state law to fire them, as he rethinks how the university should be governed. 
"Unless you receive notice to the contrary,o he wrote, "your executive/managerial appointment will end effective the close of business Dec. 16, 2002." 
Dr. Dobelle has said that he cannot realize his dreams if he is surrounded by people he does not trust. 
But in seeking to lift up the university, which has 13 smaller campuses on Oahu, Maui and on the other outer islands, Dr. Dobelle has plenty of existing assets on which he can build.
Though the main campus is dotted with temporary trailers that house many professors' offices, it has the trappings of an island paradise, with Christmasberry trees offering shade and majestic green cliffs rising in the near distance. Also, several of the university's graduate programs are already recognized as international leaders, including those in astronomy, oceanography and Indian and Chinese philosophy.
"We have the capacity to hit home runs," said Dr. Dobelle, whose predecessor, Kenneth P. Mortimer, resigned after eight years. "We're just doing it in empty ballparks. No one's watching us."
Thus far, Dr. Dobelle has enjoyed the support of faculty members, which is somewhat astonishing considering how embittered they were last spring. He has vowed to raise their salaries -- the average full professor earns about $78,000, which is near the national average -- even if he has not suggested where he will find the money.
"He's a whirlwind of fresh air," said Richard L. Rapson, a professor of history at Hawaii for more than three decades. "No one has really been much interested in education here, in the president's seat or in the government." 
Students, too, have been captivated by his fast-paced style, which several described as calibrated to "New York Time."
Though Dr. Dobelle has placed no computer on his chest-level desk, which frees him to pace -- "I need to think at work, not type," he said -- he has pledged to respond to any e-mail message within 72 hours. He often does so before dawn, at home.
Anson Hokama, the editor in chief of the student newspaper, Ka Leo O Hawaii (The Voice of Hawaii), said he decided to test the policy by sending Dr. Dobelle a thank-you note after an interview. "He got right back to me," he said.
"Initially, there were detractors," said Mr. Hokama, 24, a senior who grew up on Oahu and is studying journalism. "They wanted someone with local ties. But if the most qualified person is a haole from the mainland, what can you say? I'd rather have that than a semiqualified local person."

HEADLINE: The Abyss Yawns 

BYLINE:  By Stephanie Gutmann; Stephanie Gutmann is a freelance writer in New York.

 BODY:
OVER nearly three decades, Lewis Fortner has tried to steer generations of students through the slalom course that is four years of college. In private counseling sessions, he has heard a lot of venting and obsessing, and he has learned that the famously anxious freshman year is only "one of the major, articulating points in one's life." The other is senior year.
 "After all, it isn't just the end of four years," says Mr. Fortner, an associate dean of students at the University of Chicago. "It's the end of 16 years or 17 years of education, which is a highly artificial form of existence. At that time in their lives, students can hardly remember a time when they were not in school, so they usually feel some trepidation about this extraordinary change. The abyss of freedom yawns." 
 Seniors manifest that anxiety with "trouble concentrating, distractibility, irritability or disturbed sleep," says Mary Way, director of mental health services at Southern Methodist University in Fort Worth. Seniors are anxious about finding jobs, of course, and about managing their own money, finding insurance and a place to live. "But," Dr. Way says, "seniors also face great sadness and loss in leaving the familiar structure and cocoon of friends, classes and activities."
According to Susan M. Art, a dean of students at the University of Chicago, "seniors often go into a prolonged period of mourning" about leaving. "They can't believe this is going to end, that they're not going to continue to have this life of going to class, the library and meeting with friends."
A student may even fail a course to forestall leaving the nest. Mr. Fortner has seen this "senior slowdown," too, and says it's like a "kind of academic self-destruction."
"Out of the blue a student who's been exemplary in all ways suddenly sets himself up for failure by failing to meet deadlines and generally doing work below what he or she could do." (There is a more positive explanation for the legendary senior slump; midyear, seniors may already have a job or a graduate school berth lined up.)
If it's always hard to leave the nest, for many seniors it's particularly tough this year, as they graduate into a world shaped by the war against terrorism and by recession. Indeed, job prospects are not good. Every year the National Association of Colleges and Employers asks a representative sample of employers in a wide spectrum of industries about their hiring plans for the coming year. In its latest survey, in late December, 20 percent fewer employers said they planned to hire a new college graduate.
How to stay in the nest? One way is to go right back in. At times like this, Mr. Fortner says, students go directly to graduate school "while the economy mends itself." (Also, as long as one is still in school, the undergraduate loan is held in abeyance.)
Kaplan, the test prep company, reports seeing a 20 percent increase in its course enrollment for graduate students from last January to October: 34 percent more for the Graduate Management Admissions Test, usually required by business schools, and 26 percent more for the Law School Admissions Test. (Medical school, which re-quires substantial long-term planning and commitment, depends less on employment opportunities.)
Trudy Steinfeld, director of the Office of Career Services at New York University, says that the uncertain times have encouraged students to reflect more. "We've had a lot more students coming in and questioning what they're thinking about doing," she says.
For reasons emotional ("I want to make a difference") and materialistic ("It's where the jobs are"), a nationwide surge of interest has developed in government work like the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Peace Corps.
"When we had a job fair here on 9/25, the biggest table mobbed was the F.B.I.," Dr. Steinfeld says. "That definitely wouldn't have happened last year. Nobody would sign up for their schedules, nobody would come to their tables."
Since Sept. 11, there has been a sixfold to sevenfold increase in applications for the C.I.A.; 1,100 were received in one day. Well-established nongovernmental organizations like Teach for America, which trains graduates to teach in troubled elementary schools, are doing well, too.
ONE recent evening, a Teach for America alumnus held an information session in an N.Y.U. classroom. The room was full of students who revealed with their tough, practical questions ("Can you choose your city?" "What about health benefits?") that they were there for more than free pizza and soft drinks.
Mathew Harkins, 21, was typical of the students. A liberal arts major, he was resigned to the fact that no one would be clamoring for his talents this year. Mr. Harkins didn't seem unduly panicked about building a career right away and didn't think a year with the Peace Corps (whose information session he had also attended) would set him back.
"Sept. 11 put things in perspective," he says. "It reaffirmed my desire to do something I enjoy. Anything could happen at any moment, so enjoy it while you have it."

HEADLINE: COVER STORY; 
A Film's History Continues, as It Began

BYLINE:  By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
IS this "The Magnificent Ambersons" of Orson Welles' dreams? Clinphiles, film historians and Welles buffs will not doubt be tuning in for their own appraisals tonight at 8, when A&E unveils an eagerly awaited remake of the 1942 movie that was the subject of one of the bitterest chapters in the artistic life of Welles, the celebrated director of classics like "Citizen Kane" and "Touch of Evil."
 Working from Welle's original script - an adaptation of a novel by Booth Tarkington that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1918 - the Mexican director Alfonso Arau has fashioned a lavish three-hour television movie that is considerably longer than the original, which before its release had been cut severely by RKO Radio Pictures, to Welle's eternal consternation.
 Shot in Ireland in the fall of 2000 at a cost of more than 15 million, this sprawling new "Magnificent Ambersons" has a cast that includes Madeleine Stowe ("The Last of the Mohicans"), Bruce Greenwood ("Thirteen Days") and James Cromwell ("Babe"). They portray members of a turn-of-the-century Indianapolis aristocracy contending with all manner of social and economic upheaval as the genteel agrarian culture of the late 1800's gives way to the up-by-the-boot-straps industrialism of the early 1900's. 
 Taking a second stab at such a fabled property - many in the film world regard Welles's "Ambersons" as a kind of ruined masterwork - was daunting, to say the least. Norman Stephens, one of the producers of the new version, estimates that 75 to 80 percent of what is on the screen in the television movie was taken directly from the script by Welles that the producers found in the RKO files.
 "I had seen the Orson Welles film, and it certainly seemed incomplete to me," Mr Stephen said "We read the script, and as someone who has dealt a lot with making literature into film, I thought, 'My God, there's a lot more to the story than is in the film' Then I read the book, and it was a revelation: I really believe that Tarkington got lost in the postwar generation of writers. So all of that inspired us to try to find a way to remake 'The Magnificent Ambersons.' "
 Welles's picture, with a cast headed by Joseph Cotten, Anne Baxter, Agnes Moorehead and Tim Holt, was a financial failure. Pared down by the studio from more than two hours to less than an hour and a half, it did miserably at the box office and lost more than $600,000 for RKO, although it earned four Academy Award nominations. Even so, Welles, who died in 1985, spoke in anguished terms about the project for the rest of his life.
 Welles had already shown his affinity, in "Citizen Kane," for stories of the desparing rich; in Tarkington's novel, he was no doubt drawn to the idea of a proud 19th-century family watching in uncomprehending helplessness as its wealth and power fades. A motif of the parallel love stories - between a middle-aged widow in the Amberson family (Ms. Stowe) and her nouveau riche suitor (Mr. Greenwood), and between the widow's spoiled son (Jonathan Rhys MEYERS) and the suitor's radiant daughter (Gretchen Mol) - is the dawning of the age of the automobile. Mr. Greenwood's character is a manufacturer of motorcars, and there is the sense in the story that this revolutionary new machine all but mows down landed gentry like the Ambersons.
 Buoyed by their enthusiasm for Tarkington's narrative, Mr. Stephens and his colleagues set about the task of revival. The director they first chose was Herbert Ross, who, in the middle of an acrimonious divorce, was forced to withdraw while the film was in preproduction, Mr. Stephens said. (Ross died three months ago.) With elaborate sets under construction in Dublin, they had to scramble for a director, eventually hiring Mr. Arau, best known for his 1993 film "Like Water for Chocolate."
 Mr. Arau may have seemed an unorthodox choice, but to Mr. Stephens his selection was in keeping with the spirit of the project. "We decided there was no point in doing this if we didn't take a risk," he said. "It made a crazy kind of sense to me that we should have a Mexican director directing a piece of Americana."
 Although much of the dialogue would belong to Tarkington and Welles, there was no mistaking who the director was "Alfonso gave this picture a look," Mr. Stephens said. "He wanted it to have a modern feel."
 Indeed, the stamp of a modern filmmaker is all over the movie. One striking liberty Mr. Arau took with the script was to show the birth of the willful George Amberson Minafer (Mr. Rhys Meyers) from the point of view of the fetus emerging from the body of his mother, Isabel, played by Ms Stowe.
 "That is pure Alfonso," Mr. Stephens said, adding that he "loved all the inventiveness, the physicality" that Mr Arau brought to the production.
 Not everyone on the set was similarly smitten. Ms. Stowe, in a recent telephone interview, said she had had serious disagreements with Mr Arau over the emphasis he was giving in the film to an Oedipal conflict between Isabel and George. That emphasis, she felt, went beyond subtle suggestion.
 The dispute was particularly vexing for her because the idea of playing Isabel had so completely enthralled her. "This script came to me and it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever read," she said. "It was perfect, and my heart broke for Isabel."
 With her expectations so high, she was upset, she said, when she discovered that Mr. Arau's embellishments included a scene in which the mother and son engage in a lingering kiss.
 "I think there's a certain incestuous value, but there are more complex things at play," Ms. Stowe said. "I certainly did not feel it was coming from the mother. Alfonso did not agree." Efforts to draw him out, she added, were not appreciated: "His style of working was to not have a lot of discussion."
 Attempts to read Mr. Arau were unsucessful. Mr. Stephens said that while he had not spoken to Ms. Stowe about her objections, he was aware of her unhappiness, particularly about trims made in some pivotal speeches.
 He said that he did not believe the movie was in any way compromised by the disagreement. "I must say, to Madeleine's credit, that she was terrific and totally professional," he said, adding that he hoped Mr. Arau's approach would be vindicated by the viewers. "All we can do is say, 'Look at the end product.' "
 This kind of artistic dispute seems to be par for the course for "The Magnificent Ambersons," a faint echo of a controversy long ago that left a famous young director deeply unsatisfied with the movie he had made.
 As Ms. Stowe said, "A film can break your heartfaster than anything."

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
As FatWire Goes, So Goes the Island's Economy

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
MARK FASCIANO and and Ari Kahn started FatWire in the summer of 1996, financing their venture with credit cards and using a spare bedroom in Mr. Fasciano's parents' house in Oyster Bay as their office. Newly minted graduates of the University of Chicago's computer science doctoral program, the two 20-something entrepreneurs set to work perfecting a software program that allows thousands of people at different computers to work simultaneously on the same project.
 Within two years, I.B.M. and Wells Fargo had signed on as customers, and other large corporations were showing interest. Mr. Fasciano hired more programmers, sales representatives and marketers, moving his staff of 30 into leased office space in Port Washington. In 2000, tapping a $9 million infusion of venture capital, Mr. Fasciano tripled his work force and relocated again, this time to still larger office space in Mineola. 
 Deloitte & Touche has recognized FatWire as one of Long Island's fast-growing high-tech companies, and Ernst & Young named Mr. Fasciano as Long Island Entrepreneur of the Year in 2000.
FatWire, which employs about 100 people, is part of a new breed of high-tech companies that the Long Island Association says have added more than 23,100 jobs to the region and helped diversify an economy once overly dependent on defense contractors and aerospace companies.
The success of companies like FatWire was envisioned in the mid-90's by Project Long Island, a $1.5 million job-creation campaign initiated by the association, the region's largest business organization. Begun in 1996 with much fanfare, the campaign wheezed to a close last month, largely unnoticed but nonetheless praised by the association's president, Matthew T. Crosson. 
"Project Long Island was a remarkable success," Mr. Crosson said. "It focused the region on its high-growth technology industries, rejuvenated the business community's confidence in Long Island's ability to not only survive defense downsizing but prosper, and led directly to significant job and payroll increases."
Assigning a grade to Project Long Island is difficult, in part because the association changed its target goals in midflight. The association originally set as its target "the indirect creation of about 28,000 jobs in five industries," Mr. Crosson said. The industries were biotechnology, computers, electronics, health-care information systems, and graphics. In September 1996, the association revised its goal downward, to 22,400 jobs, and eliminated one target industry -- health-care information systems -- when several major companies in that industry changed direction. 
Of course, the gains from an effort like Project Long Island are ephemeral at best; many of the new jobs have already been lost to layoffs. And who can say with certainty whether it was the project's efforts, or simply a vibrant economy, that resulted in the hiring?
In several ways, FatWire exemplifies both sides of the coin. Like many high-tech companies, FatWire's growth has flagged.With the computer industry enmeshed in a prolonged global slump, last year Mr. Fasciano laid off 15 people, a task he described as the hardest thing he has ever done as an executive. But he added that the cuts have kept the company on track, and it is now developing its next generation of software. 
The end of the Project Long Island comes at unlucky time, of course, and the current economic downturn minimizes its benefits. High-tech industries are among those hardest hit, and so the benefits the association is claiming seem oddly out of sync with the economic moment, like a poorly dubbed foreign film.
In an interview earlier this month Dr. Pearl Kamer, the association's economist, described "enormous growth in electronics wholesaling and cable television," seemingly oblivious to the major layoffs announced by Long Island's largest publicly traded companies, including Arrow, Computer Associates and Symbol Technologies.
"Yes, we know we have had some layoffs in the second half of '01, and we may see some continued weakness going into this year," Dr. Kamer said. "But the layoffs in computer-related industries were relatively moderate in comparison with the dot-com implosion."
In Jericho, Brian D. Lee, the managing director of the Long Island office of Insignia/ ESG, the real estate management company, questioned whether the claims of high-tech job growth were justified.
"As someone leasing office space to technology companies, it seems odd to say there is a growth in high-tech jobs," said Mr. Lee, a founding member of LISTNet, the Long Island Software and Technology Network. "Most of the marginal tech companies and dot-coms are closing up shop or downsizing. Currently we are seeing an abundance of job layoffs."
A clear sign that the region's high-tech sector is wobbling is seen at the half-empty Long Island Technology Center in Great River. The Long Island Association, along with other business leaders, had encouraged real estate developers to rebuild the former Grumman test hangar as a showcase for high-tech companies. But they have had a hard time leasing the space and have now opened the center to companies outside the original high-tech niche, renaming it the Long Island Business and Technology Center. The occupancy rate has declined from about 70 percent to 50 percent, Mr. Lee said.
Peter Goldsmith, LISTnet's chairman and a former Grumman project director who served as Mr. Crosson's economic development director for the early years of Project Long Island, said that the campaign's main achievement was in promoting economic diversity as the Island struggled to rebuild an economy weakened by the departure or downsizing of the aerospace and defense contracting companies that had been the backbone of its prosperity. 
"The defense contractors like Grumman were gone or disappearing, and people had lost confidence in Long Island as a place to live and do business," Mr. Goldsmith said. "People thought the economy had tanked and that things were going to get worse, not better. The idea of Project Long Island was to turn around the thought process. We wanted people to think about the fact that the economy wasn't just big defense contractors but plenty of small and midsized electronics companies." 
Keith Banks, an executive vice president of Lloyd Staffing, a Melville company that places permanent and temporary employees at many high-tech companies, said that job-growth figures used by the Long Island Association excluded temporary workers and consultants. If they were included, he said, the job-growth statistics would be more impressive.
"We are dealing with companies that announce layoffs but are still hiring people for short-term projects," Mr. Banks said. "Our information technology consulting division just completed the one of the best years in our history."

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for JOHN LONSKI; 
Rising Debt Brings Rising Risk

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
AMERICANS are swimming in debt these days. Low borrowing costs -- the product of the Federal Reserve campaign to drive down interest rates to keep the economy afloat -- are enticing more people to run up credit card balances, take out loans for new cars or refinance home mortgages. Last week, the Fed reported that consumer borrowing rose in November by $19.8 billion, the biggest monthly increase since the Fed began keeping records in 1943. 
John Lonski, the chief economist at Moody's Investors Service, which tracks corporate and consumer debt, says the rise in consumer borrowing and spending is a mixed blessing. Following are excerpts from an interview on Wednesday.
 VIVIAN MARINO

Q. What has the rise in consumer spending and borrowing done for the economy?

A. Without question, the ability of consumers to continue to borrow and spend has diminished the severity of the current recession. We find that consumer spending has held up much better in the 2001 recession than in the 1990-91 recession and the 1981-82 recession. We can cite a dramatic increase in mortgage refinancing at a pace that seems surprisingly lively, given the recession.

Q. Many credit card companies and automakers have been offering zero-percent financing and other incentives. What are the risks to consumers who accept these offers?

A. You have to remember that these low rates are not going to last forever. The credit card companies, for instance, will eventually start to charge full-market rates, and maybe an annual fee, if you stay on with them. You may not fully realize just how great a burden you'll be facing once the inducement is over.
Also, when it comes to zero-percent financing, the terms might be more restrictive. I think that consumers may find that their monthly payment might be reduced if they move from a three-year, zero-interest loan to a loan that has, say, a 7 percent interest rate but is repaid over a five-year span.

Q. What problems do you foresee because of increased borrowing by individual households? And how will they affect the economy?

A. The record shows that household debt repayment problems will continue to rise with the unemployment rate, so we have to be prepared for a higher incidence of delinquencies regarding outstanding consumer debt as well as home mortgages. We're already seeing that.
In the end, the fact that many households are already highly leveraged will have the effect of slowing the forthcoming recovery.

Q. But with interest rates so low, why shouldn't we borrow more now, provided we can afford to pay it back?

A. If you're confident about the long-term prospects, you probably can go ahead and justify taking on some additional debt, but you cannot ignore that in the near term there is some economic uncertainty. If you lost your job or had difficulty meeting debt payments, you ought not be in a total shock by such a turn of events.
Given the above-average level of uncertainty regarding job opportunities, it behooves consumers to approach everything more cautiously unless they are quite wealthy or very confident about job security. It's reason enough to use debt sparingly. 

Q.Do you anticipate a slowdown in consumer borrowing this year? If so, why?

A. I think it will happen. The still-healthy pace of housing activity will level off and slow the growth for household mortgage debt outstanding. Mortgage yields are unlikely to return to the 6.7 percent low of October 2001. They already are above 7 percent again, and they will most likely edge higher. Higher mortgage yields amid a still-slack labor market suggest that home sales are close to topping off.
 Interestingly enough, there are important segments of the housing sector that have run into a diminished ability to borrow -- the subprime borrowers. Suppliers of credit have reduced the amount of money available, particularly for manufactured housing or mobile homes.

When Pension and Unemployment Checks Don't Mix

BYLINE:  By DORI R. PERRUCCI 

 BODY:
JANICE SWEET FAIRLEY spent virtually all of her working career at the telephone company, starting as an operator for Michigan Bell, and rising to a manager of data services after the company was reorganized as Ameritech.
 "I was Miss Ameritech to the world," said Mrs. Fairley, who lives in Clark Lake, Mich. But in December 1997, several months before SBC Communications acquired the company, she was laid off as part of a general downsizing. She had just turned 50. 
 But Mrs. Fairley said she received more bad news later, after she learned that her former employer was challenging her right to collect unemployment benefits. 
Ed Greenawald, 59, of Greensboro, N.C., said he ran into similar problems after he was laid off from Wachovia Bank in November 2000, where he was a senior manager. He had worked for the company for 16 years. It was only after he challenged the company's initial refusal to pay unemployment, he said, that he was able to collect partial benefits. 
How did these problems arise? Unknowingly, Mrs. Fairley and Mr. Greenawald had set off an overlooked, 25-year-old provision in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act that requires states to offset or reduce unemployment benefits against pensions to avoid what might be perceived as "double dipping." After she left Ameritech, Mrs. Fairley said, she took a lump-sum distribution on her defined-benefit pension plan and her 401(k) plan and rolled it over into an Individual Retirement Account. Mr. Greenawald said he chose a small lump-sum payment and a monthly annuity, which he started receiving right away.
Because the states, not the federal government, administer unemployment benefits, it is up to each state to interpret the federal unemployment law as it sees fit. 
All states, by law, must reduce unemployment benefits whenever there is an annuity payout from a pension plan that is funded in full by an employer, such as a defined-benefit plan and certain defined-contribution plans that offer annuities, pension experts say. Although most states, they add, no longer count rollovers as the receipt of a pension, and therefore, do not reduce unemployment benefits, about a dozen states still do, including New York and North Carolina. Michigan was once in that category, they say, but it changed its policy in 1999 -- a change that is now being challenged by Mrs. Fairley's former employer. About 20 states, meanwhile, will also offset unemployment benefits if someone is collecting Social Security benefits, pension experts say.
WHILE the federal Labor Department says it has no position on the Social Security issue, it maintains that rollovers should not affect unemployment benefits. "Generally our position is that if the money is not received, it's not deducted from unemployment," said Grace Kilbane, director of the Labor Department's Office of Workforce Security, which oversees the unemployment system. But she added that "it's the states' choice" and that the federal law "gave them lots of options."
Many consumer advocates want all the states to follow the Labor Department's guidance. 
"The rules were written for a time that no longer exists," said Clare Hushbeck, a labor economist in Washington with AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons. "We've gone from assuming 20 years ago that people retire at 65." 
For one thing, Ms. Hushbeck said, more retired workers may want -- or need -- to return to the work force, especially those whose 401(k) investments have shrunk in value because of the stock market's downturn. It is unfair, she said, to make them ineligible for unemployment benefits if they return to work and are then laid off.
AARP is planning to campaign for policy changes in some of the 20 or so states that still apply the pension offset provision against retired workers receiving Social Security, she said.
Rick McHugh, a staff lawyer and Midwest coordinator based in Michigan for the National Employment Law Project, a legal aid group, said that because state interpretation of federal law varied so widely, "there's been no serious efforts to fix FUTA," as the federal law is known. He is representing Mrs. Fairley in her challenge and has handled other pension-offset cases. 
"There's no quick fix, and because of that, it hasn't gotten on anybody's radar screen in Washington," he said. "I think it's out of step with the other policies we have in place in our society, where we generally try to encourage people to accumulate funds for retirement."
Others, however, say the law is fine the way it is. "People who are collecting retirement pay, by and large in the vast majority of cases, are not in the job market, and thus some sort of coordination with unemployment is essential," said Eric Oxfeld, president of UWC Strategic Services, a group in Washington that lobbies for employers on unemployment law. "Pension offset is critical in guarding against double-dipping by workers, especially in a time of high unemployment; it even acts as an incentive in getting workers back to work."
Mrs. Fairley, now 55 and a training manager for NCO Financial Services in Jackson, Mich., said she had not been planning to retire when she chose to roll over her pension instead of leaving it with her employer. "I didn't want to leave my money with them," she said. 
She said she knew she would have to pay taxes and a penalty on withdrawals from her I.R.A., and she even checked with the state's unemployment office to make sure that withdrawals from her new I.R.A. account would not jeopardize her benefits. 
She says she regrets, however, that she never thought to ask whether just rolling over her pension money into an I.R.A. would affect her unemployment benefits. Neither did Mr. Greenawald, now a math teacher at Davidson Community College in Lexington, N.C. "I wish I had been a little more savvy up front," he said. "You just assume the money is going to be there."
And neither had read this advice, posted on the Web site of the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (www.dol.gov/dol/pwba): "Receiving a lump sum or other distribution from your pension plan may affect your ability to receive unemployment compensation." Mrs. Fairley and Mr. Greenawald could have left their pensions with their employers, a move that would not have caused a reduction in their unemployment benefits.
Thomas Murphy, a retirement benefits consultant at Buck Consultants in Tenafly, N.J., said workers should become familiar with their pension plans. "Most people don't understand their pensions until they're leaving a job," he said. "Get the summary plan document and read it. If you don't understand it, take it to someone who can, either in human resources, a knowledgeable friend or your accountant." 
HE also suggested learning about state unemployment laws: "Call and ask, 'How will taking my pension affect my ability to receive unemployment? If I leave my pension with my employer, will that affect my weekly benefit check?' "
Mr. Greenawald was fortunate -- his state extended benefits for 12 months, although the payment was reduced to $175 a week from $300 because of the $500 monthly annuity he was receiving. 
Mrs. Fairley, meanwhile, has continued to contest Ameritech's action. She will have to pay back the $6,900 in unemployment benefits she collected in 1998 if Ameritech succeeds in its challenge of the Michigan policy that permitted laid-off workers to roll over their pensions and still collect unemployment. Mrs. Fairley's case and at least a dozen others are now in the state's lower courts, all of them involving laid-off Ameritech workers, said Jack Wheatley, director of the Michigan Unemployment Agency. 
Steve Kauffman, a spokesman for SBC Communications, said the company was confident that the Michigan Supreme Court, which heard testimony in its case in early December, would rule in its favor. The state, he said, has upheld pre-existing state law in 10 circuit courts over the last three years.
Mrs. Fairley says she is willing to wait it out, too. "I intend to keep going. There are lots of others facing the same issue," she said.

HEADLINE: For Women, to Soar Is Rare, to Fall Is Human 

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

 BODY:
IT is not enough for women to succeed in business. They also must fail.
 The fate of Carleton S. Fiorina, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and the highest-ranked female chief executive in the Fortune 500, could be the test. She is waging a highly public battle to complete a merger with Compaq Computer against the wishes of the heirs of Hewlett-Packard's founders. If she is thwarted, it is almost inevitable that she will leave the company. 
 That failure could, paradoxically, spawn a different kind of victory -- or defeat. The key would be whether she is then viewed as simply another risk-embracing chief executive who was driven out when shareholders balked at the company's stock price, or as a poignant symbol of how women still can't quite make it in the cutthroat, male-dominated corporate world. 
No one, of course, would ask such a question about men. But so few women have made it into the corner office -- the appointment on Monday of Patricia F. Russo as chief executive of Lucent Technologies brings to nine the number of the nation's largest 1,000 companies now headed by women -- that the failure of one is sometimes viewed not only as her own, but also as somehow emblematic of deficiencies of her sex. 
Each departure of a high-level executive woman -- voluntary or with a push -- unleashes a torrent of scrutiny and, often, sweeping conclusions about the female condition in modern society. The talk also resonates in corporate boardrooms.
In the last few years, there has been plenty to talk about. 
Several high-profile women have faltered, including Linda J. Wachner, who was ousted from the top slot at Warnaco in November, six months after the company filed for bankruptcy protection; Diana D. Brooks, who resigned as head of Sotheby's and pleaded guilty to price-fixing last year; and Jill E. Barad, who was forced out of Mattel last year after an acquisition went awry and earnings repeatedly fell short of her promises.
Just below them were women like Karen L. Hendricks, who stepped down as the chief executive of the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company last February after clashing over strategy with a large investor four months before the company filed for bankruptcy protection, and Deborah C. Hopkins, the chief financial officer of Lucent -- and, she thought, chief executive-in-waiting -- who was ousted last May, essentially for being perceived as too pushy.
If the sheer scarcity of women as chief executives guarantees them enormous attention when they are hired, the glare is as great or greater when they are fired. When Ms. Wachner, once the highest-paid businesswoman in the country, was fired without severance for driving the company she had built into a powerhouse into hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, the story landed on the front page of The New York Times and Women's Wear Daily.
THAT kind of publicity can give a board pause when it considers whether to select a woman as chief executive. 
"Can we risk the company on him? Can we risk the company on a her?" is how Ellen M. Hancock, who resigned under pressure in September as chief executive of Exodus Communications, put the distinction. Exodus, a Web site company, sought bankruptcy protection the same month.
Ms. Hancock, a seasoned Silicon Valley executive who worked at I.B.M., Apple Computer and National Semiconductor before taking command of Exodus four years ago, said she hoped to find another such job. "We used to say that men C.E.O.'s had Teflon -- they leave one company and pop up in another," she said. "Whether women can do the same remains to be seen -- I am hoping that I will show up in another slot."
Chief executives like Andrea Jung of Avon Products, Meg Whitman of eBay and Shelly Lazarus of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide have proved that women can run major companies successfully. But they remain far less prominent at the top rungs of the business world than in other high-pressure fields. For years, men excused the dearth of top women executives by calling it a "pipeline problem" -- there were, they said, simply too few women who had enough experience. Given time, women would climb the corporate ladder the same way men did.
But today, 20.6 percent of federal judges are women. So are 13 percent of United States senators and 4.6 percent of neurosurgeons. Only 1.2 percent of Fortune 500 chief executives are women. Carly Fiorina is one. The others are Ms. Jung, Ms. Russo, Anne Mulcahy of Xerox, Marion O. Sandler of Golden West Financial (whose husband, Herbert, is co-chief executive) and Cinda A. Hallman of the Spherion Corporation. And when the sample is broadened to the Fortune 1,000, the percentage drops to less than 1 percent.
The gap between women's equality in business and in other fields is so pronounced that books have been devoted to examining the possible reasons. They range from the inflexibility of work hours at the entry level to the chummy old-boy network forged over golf games and in steam rooms. Experts on "glass ceiling" issues also list women's tendency to shoulder most of the responsibility for raising children and taking care of the house, men's perception that women are less committed to career and less willing to take risks, and the unflattering "abrasive" image that attaches to female ambition.
Some psychologists cite a greater fear of success among women or, a corollary, the idea that career success somehow translates into a loss of femininity and sexuality. And some women complain that they are held to higher standards than men.
Such distinctions could be called "A Boardroom of One's Own" -- a corporate version of the ideas laid out by Virginia Woolf to explain why there were no female Shakespeares in the 17th century.
Ms. Fiorina, however, may not fit into any broad pattern of subtle sex discrimination -- or she ignored and superseded it. When she was recruited to Hewlett-Packard, Ms. Fiorina herself famously stated: "I hope that we are at a point that everyone has figured out that there is not a glass ceiling."
If she succeeds, it will not be because she ran the company in a feminine way; if nothing else, her bold, even stubborn insistence on pursuing the merger defies the stereotype that women are more conciliatory and risk-averse than men.
In a recent issue, Business Week put her on its cover with the headline "Carly's Last Stand." The adjectives used to describe her -- "gutsy" and "bold" and "unflinching" -- were the kind routinely applied to male chief executives who take a gamble with bad odds, not those often used for women, like "emotional" or "shrill." 
No studies exist on whether women chief executives fail more often than men, mostly because the sample is still too small to make a statistical analysis meaningful. 
"There is no data, but I do not think women flame out or burn out at a disproportionate rate over men," said Sheila Wellington, the president of Catalyst, a nonprofit women's research organization. "It's just that there are so few of them that they get a disproportionate amount of attention when they do. And when one person becomes the personification of an entire group, we tend to conclude, if one fails, then they all will."
It would be laughable to see corporate directors debate whether it is safe to appoint other men as chief executives because, say, Jacques Nasser fell afoul of the Ford family and was ousted from the executive suite there. Yet some boards raise such issues when it comes to women, executive recruiters say.
"I recently presented a board with a few ladies, and the 'Carly' question came up: Is she a grandstander?" said Gerard R. Roche, the senior chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, an executive placement firm. "Boards are more apprehensive, even though they shouldn't be."
Betty Spence, president of the National Association of Female Executives, put the perception problem this way: "The Enron collapse is a story about Enron. The Hewlett-Packard story is about Carly Fiorina."
For whatever reasons, some executive women prefer to see things differently.
Ms. Hancock said she felt that the media treated her no differently than any man would have been in her position. "There is more interest in the personality of the leadership now, and a company is identified through its head, whether it is Carly, Bill or Scott," she said, referring to Bill Gates of Microsoft and Scott G. McNealy of Sun Microsystems as well as Ms. Fiorina. "I got more attention on trivial matters -- my clothes, how I wore a scarf -- but in general, I found the media fairly consistent."
Some experts agree, saying that any chief executive who courts celebrity gets it -- and the intensity grows if and when they fail. "The press likes to take down what they put up, and they do it proportionally," said Ed Niehaus, a co-founder of Niehaus Ryan Wong, a public relations firm in San Francisco that has technology companies as clients. "It's not a gender issue."
But any woman who becomes chief executive of a major company is automatically under a giant media spotlight. Men can avoid it far more easily.
"It's not all about disadvantages -- being a woman helps her stand out among the masses of other executives," said Andrea Redmond, an executive recruiter at Russell Reynolds Associates. It can also help some women be chosen for corporate boards, which remain mostly male. Some companies are very interested in recruiting high-profile women as directors, but others, having enlisted one, have returned in recent years to their old-boy networks for new members, some recruiters say.
MS. FIORINA'S gender helped put her on Hewlett-Packard's radar screen. More to the point, Ms. Fiorina did not shy away from publicity once she got the job, using it instead to her own and her company's advantage -- appearing in corporate advertisements, for example. Hewlett-Packard, one of the oldest and stodgiest Silicon Valley firms, reveled in the public-relations coup. 
"The fact that she was a woman was met with a whole lot of enthusiasm at H-P," said Jeffrey E. Christian, the chairman of Christian & Timbers, a search firm in Cleveland that recruited Ms. Fiorina for Hewlett-Packard. "They thought it was kind of cool."
If Ms. Fiorina departs, she will become part of an elite sisterhood of ousted chiefs. But she would also stand with a vast -- and growing -- old-boy network of men who flamed out as chief executives after only a few years and, in some cases, a few months. In 1997, for example, John R. Walter was dismissed from AT&T barely nine months after he was brought in as president and heir-apparent to the chief executive. Lloyd D. Ward at the Maytag Corporation, Richard A. McGinn at Lucent Technologies and Michael C. Hawley at Gillette are among the other chief executives who left under pressure after failing to deliver the performance Wall Street demanded. 
THE turnover rate at the top rose so high in the 1990's that unemployment has become for chief executives what divorce is to politicians -- a status too common to necessarily connote disgrace.
John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm in Chicago, tracks the comings and goings of chief executives in America and has recorded 2,246 departures, voluntary and involuntary, since August 1999. The average tenure, he estimates, is now less than six years. 
"I do not think women C.E.O.'s flame out any quicker than men, though they may face added pressures in the job," Mr. Challenger said. "But I do think we are pushing a lot of people out unnecessarily -- short tenures are now the norm because C.E.O.'s are not given time to make mistakes."
Some may want new posts but are unemployable. Mr. Challenger said, however, that the pressures on chief executives were so high that many chose not to re-enlist. On this issue, he has detected some differences in public perception. "When a man leaves, he is getting the golden parachute to enjoy the good life," he said. "When a woman leaves of her own accord, they say, 'Well, she couldn't take the pressure.' "
The headlines reflect that. When Lewis E. Platt, who preceded Ms. Fiorina as chairman and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, resigned at 58 and became chief executive of Kendall-Jackson, the winery, the move did not stir splashy coverage.
But when Brenda C. Barnes walked away from her perch as chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America in 1997, at the age of 43, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family, the decision became a cultural milestone. It unleashed a vast public debate about women's conflicting ambitions for achievement at work and time at home. "It was so much more attention than I ever expected," Ms. Barnes recalled. "I was shocked at the sheer magnitude of the reaction." She is now a member of several corporate boards, including that of The New York Times Company. 
More and more men who leave top jobs cite family reasons, she noted, adding that there was skepticism about the underlying motives, particularly for men. "When I read that, I laugh -- these people are really high-powered people who are unlikely to spend a lot of time at home." 
Yet Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington, sees the trend as positive: "The good thing is that it has become an acceptable cover story, for men as well as women."
Ms. Barnes said she had no desire to seek out another chief-executive job, but others, like Ms. Hancock, do want to stay at the top.
And that may be more difficult. "I don't think Carly will have any problem if she leaves Hewlett-Packard," Mr. Christian said. The fact that the board and the company's senior management supported her would help ease her into another good position, he said.
But, he added, that was not necessarily the case for others. "I think the higher the degree of negative attention, the harder it is for anyone to find a new opportunity, and women do get higher levels of media attention," he explained. "I'll say the unspoken: A lot of companies are still more comfortable with a white male in the job."

HEADLINE: The Talk Of Kabul 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
I've got good news and bad news from Afghanistan. The good news is that America doesn't need a lot to satisfy its basic security interest here, which is that this distant land never again be so uncontrolled that a tumor like Osama bin Laden can grow in its midst and then metastasize into the world and threaten us. We really don't need much to get that -- just a loose Afghan federal government, some basic police and army units, a functioning economy and a few institutions.
 The bad news: it's not clear that we can get even that. 
 It is impossible to exaggerate how broken this place is. You know what ground zero looks like, where the World Trade Center once stood? Well, probably half of Kabul looks the same way, thanks to 22 years of civil war. And the "good" half -- with its scant electricity, no phones, no mail, a 10 p.m. curfew and only a bare minimum of food -- looks like a caravan ghost town. We might as well be doing nation-building on the moon.
You see sad and bizarre scenes here: a white donkey galloping down the main street right behind our car; a man with one leg peddling a bicycle; people washing a car with water from a port-a-potty; thousands of refugees crammed into the fetid old Soviet embassy, living in subzero temperatures with nothing but plastic wrap for windows. The central government is so broke it has less money than most American network crews here, so the government can't even pay salaries. "When some ministers come to see me they have to take a taxi," said Lakhdar Brahimi, the senior U.N. envoy here.
This is a travesty. Afghanistan needs a quick infusion of cash. (Maybe the Muslim world, which was so worried about Afghan civilians when America was bombing here, could send some cash now that the bombing is over and people need to eat?) In addition, though, Afghanistan needs a multinational force that can forge a secure environment in its major cities -- so refugees will return home, commerce will resume, and people will consider investing. Such a force could buy the frail Afghan government time to build up an army and police force of its own. Already, Afghanistan's carnivorous neighbors smell a power vacuum developing here, and some, like Iran, have begun brazenly sending people across Afghanistan's borders to buy influence. No good will come from that.
And that brings me to the Bush team. Right now there is a fight within the administration over whether to allow a robust multinational force here, and whether to participate in it ourselves. Let me be blunt: if the Bush team thinks our allies are going to send peacekeeping troops here in any numbers for any length of time without U.S. leadership and participation, they're crazy. And if they think that Afghanistan is going to pull itself together without the aid of such a force -- just pour in money and stir -- they're equally mistaken.
The U.S. won the war in Afghanistan by remote control, with air power, pilotless drones, local tribal fighters and a few U.S. Special Forces. The Bush team now seems to hope that it can win the peace in Afghanistan by remote control as well. It's not going to happen. The Pentagon's reluctance to put troops on the ground here to go cave by cave has already resulted in the vanishing of bin Laden and most of his key aides. A reluctance to create some kind of multinational security force here could end up costing us the peace.
Interior Minister Yunus Qanooni told visiting U.S. Senator Joe Biden, "We expect from the U.S. that it won't leave Afghanistan alone." Interim President Hamid Karzai told me in an interview: "I received delegations from every province after I was elected. I must have received 2,500 people. People from every province asked me to help get a multinational force here. People are desperate for security. One mullah opposed the idea."
I appreciate Mr. Bush's wariness about becoming involved here. We barely know who's who here, and the history of this place doesn't offer much hope. I wandered into an English bookstore in Kabul and was struck by how many books had "Afghan wars" in the title. I picked up one called "A History of the War in Afghanistan" and discovered it was part of a thick two-volume set that covered only the years 1800 to 1842.
Naturally, the Bush team doesn't want to "own" this problem. But unless we at least "rent" it for a while, and make at least a limited commitment to a security force here, for a limited period of time, this country will go right back to what it was: Mr. bin Laden's neighborhood.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
On the Rise: Private Charters

BYLINE:  By DAVIDSON GOLDIN; DAVIDSON GOLDIN is a reporter for New York 1 News.

 BODY:
IN the aftermath of September's terrorist attacks, a growing number of leisure travelers are turning to private planes to avoid the fears and hassles that many people now consider synonymous with commercial flights. 
 Charter companies report business across the board has surged since Sept. 11, with the most notable increases for leisure travel by families and small groups that had never considered private planes before. 
 "It's up about 40 percent for new inquiries, mostly in the East Coast and West Coast and also some of the major Midwest areas," said Jacque Rosser, flight operations manager for the National Air Transportation Association, which represents 800 charter operators. Operators are seeing "more families flying, more women and people who are combining leisure travel with business travel," said Meara McLaughlin, vice president of interactive services for Air Charter Guide, an online guide to private charters. 
Booking a trip is relatively straightforward. Air Charter Guide is a helpful resource on the Web (www.aircharterguide.com), providing links to major charter operators and brokers that arrange trips. Nationwide, Ms. McLaughlin said, there are more than 1,800 companies that book charter flights. And soon, she added, online travel sites that sell seats on commercial planes are expected to offer charter options. 
For the most part, charter prices vary only about 10 percent. But unlike commercial airlines, which charge by the seat, charters charge by the plane -- if all the seats are used, the price per person drops.
After the attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration moved up plans to increase security requirements for private flights -- although the rules are still less strict than those for commercial carriers. Charters generally don't use metal detectors or X-rays, but they do screen passengers and allow pilots to open bags at any time. 
As for safety, though charter pilots must have 10 hours of rest between flights, as opposed to 8 for commercial airlines, the airlines generally have more rigorous maintenance programs. "We hold the airlines to a higher level of safety," said Alison Duquette, an F.A.A. spokeswoman. 

Security and Convenience
Although newcomers to private air travel since Sept. 11 might be motivated by security concerns -- there are no strangers on the plane -- they ultimately wind up talking most about the convenience. 
"To get out of a car and walk to the plane, get on the plane, get off the plane and walk into a car, with no hustle and bustle, is great," said Jay Joel, a trucking executive in Bay Shore on Long Island who used a private plane for the first time in October for a weekend trip to Montreal with his wife and some friends. He chartered a plane, he said, because his wife, concerned about safety, refused to fly on a commercial flight. He booked the trip through Blue Star Jets, (866) 538-8463, www.bluestarjets.com, a broker that doesn't own any aircraft but has access to more than a thousand. 
The Lear 35 jet the Joels took accommodated six people and cost $6,000 round trip, less expensive per person than the approximately $1,155 United Airlines currently charges for a nonstop flight to Montreal in first class. 
The Joels liked their first charter so much that they used a private plane again for a family vacation to Miami over Thanksgiving. This time, though, they recruited another family to bring down the price. The round-trip flight from a private airport on Long Island on a Gulfstream III jet was $15,000 for 10 people (four adults, six children) -- again, less than the approximately $2,000 American currently charges for first class from New York to Miami. 
To be sure, chartering a plane -- no matter how many seats you fill -- is not nearly as inexpensive as an advance-purchase economy ticket. But for people willing to pay the premium for a first-class ticket on a commercial airline, a private plane isn't necessarily more expensive. 
When it comes to booking a trip, travelers have a choice between using brokers (similar to travel agents) and contacting charter operators directly. Paul K. Class, a vice president at Tag Aviation, (800) 331-1930, www.tagaviation.com, said direct bookings offer travelers slightly better prices and faster service in the event of a mechanical problem. 

How Prices Are Set
Charters are priced according to the size of the plane and number of hours in the air. A small jet seating about six passengers like a Lear 35A, costs about $1,800 an hour. A medium-sized jet that seats up to 10, like a Lear 60, costs about $2,500 an hour. A large jet that seats up to 15, like a Challenger 604, costs close to $4,800 an hour and can fly coast-to-coast without refueling. 
"Charters make the most sense for short- and medium-length trips, unless you're a billionaire who can afford to take it across the country," said George-Ann Rosenberg, the public-relations consultant for Washington-based SkyJet, (888) 275-9538; www.skyjet.com. 
"If someone had suggested a charter I might have said they were crazy," said Dean Powell, a New York City photographer who booked his first charter flight through Blue Star Jets in October. "But after Sept. 11, you have to think, because it's a different world." 
Mr. Powell took his wife, two daughters aged 6 and 9 and their nanny on a day trip to Hershey Park in Pennsylvania. The round-trip flight for the five of them on a King Air 200 turbo-prop cost $2,500 -- less per person than the full coach walk-up US Airways fare of $760 to Harrisburg, and without the inconvenience of a connection. 
Commercial airlines use about 900 airports nationwide, while smaller charter flights have access to nearly 5,000 domestic airfields. There are no schedules to work around, no security lines at the airport and you don't need to check the family dog -- pets are welcome, too. (As for meals, the food is extra.) 
Charter prices for trips of more than a few days cost double the time you're actually on the plane. With a short stay, the plane will stay on the ground until your return flight, at a cost of roughly $500 a day depending on the aircraft. But when you stay for a while, the operator may send the plane back to its base and then make a second round trip to pick you up. If a charter company can fill the empty legs, the charter can cost up to 50 percent less. Brokers say that as private air travel becomes more common, prices will fall as more empty legs are filled. But for now, one way to shop around for a private flight is to check whether an operator or broker might be able to fill that empty leg once you book. 
Some veterans of private air travel say they're not surprised at the growing interest in private planes.
"I have some friends who are not as financially secure, but they're trying to change some things around in their lives so they can do this," said Mark Mariani, a Greenwich, Conn., home builder who uses charter flights to get to a second home on Martha's Vineyard. "Since Sept. 11 more people on the fence are going forward with this because of the safety and the convenience."

HEADLINE: O'Neill's List 

BYLINE:  By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author of "The New New Thing" and, most recently, "Next."

 BODY:
By the time I first went to see Paul O'Neill this past fall, a lot of people in Washington had written him off. He'd been secretary of the treasury for less than a year, and in that time he had received painfully bad press. The harshest protests against him came in the conservative media. The National Review had called for his resignation. The Wall Street Journal had run a pair of front-page articles saying that he was a boob whose mere presence undermined confidence in the financial markets. The New York Post had published a report that Vice President Cheney had met with possible successors, specifically Donald Marron, chairman of UBS America.
 O'Neill himself, on CNBC, when told of the New York Post report, said, "Hallelujah." The Treasury Department spokeswoman, Michele Davis, said, "He meant it as a joke," though she added that she has long since given up hope that people will take a nuanced view of anything her boss says. His tendency to say things that treasury secretaries never say had turned him into a figure of fun. 
 Dick Cheney poked his head out of his cave to tell me that the reports in The New York Post were "total garbage" and that O'Neill was welcome to keep his job as long as he wanted. President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew Card, told me that "the president is really pleased with the job Paul is doing." O'Neill's chief of staff, Tim Adams, told me, with a knowing smile: "The White House has never complained about O'Neill. Not once. And I can guarantee you that O'Neill won't be the first to go. He won't be the second or the third either." The White House even let it be known that the president was sufficiently irritated by the rumor in The New York Post of O'Neill's being on the way out that he'd had the rumor tracked down to its supposed source -- a public-relations person hired by . . . Donald Marron. 
None of this has had the slightest effect on O'Neill's predicament. Because the people who determine O'Neill's fate are unable to express the slightest dissatisfaction without communicating total despair, the people who interpret what they say ignore everything but the bad news and assume that any support expressed for the man is a case of What else are they going to say? A treasury secretary -- or any other senior cabinet member -- will always officially be doing a great job right up until the moment he is fired. There's a signaling problem between the White House and the press, and in the Bush White House it is worse than in most, because the Bush people don't speak to the press in anything but the official tone of voice. They've shut down the sneaky little off-the-record chats through which the truth finds its way into print. 
And so the White House's communications strategy has had the reverse of the intended effect. I've never had so many important people express such confidence in another human being as senior Bush people expressed to me about Paul O'Neill, but for all I know he'll be gone by the time you read this. 
When he left his job as chairman of Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum manufacturer, and became treasury secretary, O'Neill moved from a world in which he exerted near total control over his environment -- and on which he was able to impose his own sense of reality -- to a world in which he was virtually hostage to other people's perceptions of him. And he knew it. Yet despite knowing it, he bulled ahead anyway with his own idea about how things should be done. He may not be the first corporate big shot who has refused to acknowledge the difference between his old job in business and his new job in government. But he is the only one I can think of whose refusal is perfectly intentional. You can laugh at him, but if you do, you'll miss the whole point of him. 

THE O'NEILL RESUME
O'Neill was offered the job in a hurry in December 2000. His name, pushed by Dick Cheney, was a surprise, as he had done nothing to help Bush be elected -- hadn't even given him money. But Bush was unhappy with the list of Wall Street big shots he was given. The red-map/blue-map distinction is more of a cultural phenomenon than a financial one; there are red-map rich people and blue-map rich people. Wall Street people are blue-map Americans. O'Neill is a creature of red-map America, about as far as you could get from Wall Street and still be in the land of the rich, which Bush liked. It also didn't hurt that O'Neill was a friend of Alan Greenspan's.
O'Neill proves that there is more than one species of Main Street chamber of commerce Republican. He began his career, oddly enough, as an employee of the United States government. He was studying computer systems at Fresno State University in the mid-1950's when, as a lark, he followed a friend into a California post office and applied for a government internship. Three hundred thousand other people applied for an internship, 3,000 were invited to take a standardized test, 300 were granted interviews and 30 were given jobs. O'Neill was one of the 30. Had he not wandered into the post office, O'Neill says, he would have wound up in the construction business back in Alaska, where he had gone to high school and met his wife. 
He began at the bottom rung of the Veterans Administration in 1961. For the next 20 years -- except for a year off to acquire a master's of public administration at Indiana University -- he climbed the ranks of the civil service, until, in the Ford administration, he became deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget (where he met Cheney, Greenspan and Donald Rumsfeld). You can waste a lot of time looking for foreshadowings of his current problems back then. "It was one of those jobs where you were always on a hot seat," says Bo Cutter, who now works as a venture capitalist but who, more than 25 years ago, as Jimmy Carter's deputy director of O.M.B., was the Democrat who succeeded O'Neill. "You were always having to make tough decisions, and to deal with huge egos, to make sure that politics didn't lead to bad decisions. I could see that O'Neill hadn't been just good at it. He'd been fantastic." 
When Carter took office, O'Neill, at the age of 41 and for the first time in his life, entered the private sector. His subsequent success caused a lot of people to forget he had ever had a career in the public sector. He had gone from career civil servant to C.E.O. of a midsize company, International Paper, inside of a decade. (He had been elevated to that job from another one inside the company by a board that included his old friend Greenspan.) He was then brought into a giant company, Alcoa, and became the first person to run it who hadn't worked there all his life. When I asked senior Treasury officials what struck them most about their new boss, several mentioned this out-of-left-field quality to his rise. "This isn't a guy who went to Harvard or Yale and had life handed to him on a silver platter," said David Aufhauser, the Treasury's general counsel. "This is a guy who went to Fresno State and began as a career civil servant." 

O'NEILL'S LIST OF REASONS NOT TO TAKE THE JOB
O'Neill had just turned 65 and was resigning as chairman of Alcoa when he heard from Cheney. Cheney recalls that when he offered the Treasury job to O'Neill, O'Neill told him, flatly, no. He had other plans. Of course, O'Neill must have known that Cheney wouldn't leave it at that, and of course he didn't. Cheney asked O'Neill to come to Washington from his home in Pittsburgh to meet President Bush.
O'Neill prides himself on thinking analytically about big, complex problems. He has spent all of his working life in meetings with other guys in suits, and in these meetings he is inevitably the one who has the most data at his fingertips and who has thought the most about the problem under discussion. Or, if he isn't, he has everyone else believing that he is. As his youngest daughter, Julie Kloo, says, "My father is the sort of person who can, like, quote numbers from the 1977 federal budget."
Now the problem to solve was his own future, and so, characteristically, he set about analyzing his aversion to being Bush's treasury secretary. He wrote down all the reasons he did not want to be and should not be. When he was finished, the list came to three single-spaced pages. Then he flew to Washington to eat a hotel breakfast with Cheney and Bush. 
The breakfast wasn't a great deal different in spirit from the job interviews Bush had with most of the top shelf in his cabinet. Ashcroft was his own peculiar story, but Rumsfeld, Colin Powell and Cheney, like O'Neill, didn't need the job. Lord, how they didn't need the job! Each of them had somewhere between $50 million and $300 million and status to burn. All of them could plausibly approach their government as if it needed them more than they needed it.
When he heard about O'Neill's list, Cheney had to be pleased: if you don't want a job, you don't bother making a three-page list of the reasons you won't take that job. Besides, the vice president had put himself through exactly the same exercise. "Paul came loaded for bear with all the reasons he didn't want the job," Cheney says. "I'd spent five years as the C.E.O. of a major company, so I knew where he was coming from. I had my own list, too." Of course he did! The first requirement for a top job in the Bush administration was a long list of the reasons you didn't want it. (The only ambition Bush trusted was the kind he couldn't see.)
Actually, when you boiled these lists down to their essential ingredients, they weren't very long at all. They all had the same few general objections. "Cheney had the same list I had," O'Neill says, "except his had three heart attacks on it."
O'Neill's list served another purpose -- in addition to giving Cheney and Bush a number of specific objections to overcome. It allowed him to believe he was taking the job on his own terms. O'Neill's list formed the basis of a social experiment. Implicitly, it asked an interesting question: what happens when a supremely successful businessman tries -- as a matter of both pride and principle -- to descend, rather than claw his way up, into politics?

REASON NO. 1: 'WASHINGTON HAS CHANGED FOR THE WORSE SINCE I LEFT IT'
For many years, one of O'Neill's pet peeves has been the coarsening of public life caused, in his view, by a combination of bad journalistic incentives and what he calls "that awful sense in both parties of 'We don't care what's right or wrong, all we care about is getting more of our kind elected."' As a corporate big shot, he peppered his speeches with off-the-cuff outrage on this theme. For instance, here he is, in May 1999, addressing a group of his fellow business leaders:
"I saw something over the weekend that suggested to me the depths of the problem . . . about the vice president's wife disclosing that because her son was nearly killed in an automobile accident she was treated for depression. And the reason -- at least the reason given by The New York Times -- for this disclosure is that it was important for her to get it out before it was disclosed . . . in the midst of a political campaign. And it made me think to myself -- we've gotten so accustomed to what's going on, we're not even shocked by the notion that someone not running for office, but someone related to someone running for office, has to pre-empt in order not to become a liability in a political campaign. I, myself, find it just remarkable that we seem to have been so sandpapered by our current way of conducting political business that we just don't scream in outrage at what's going on around us."
From the moment O'Neill took office, he set a different tone, or tried to. Maybe the biggest break he made with local conventions was in his attitude toward his own thoughts. He found it useful to air them in a fairly straightforward manner for public consideration -- and never mind what a treasury secretary is and is not meant to say. The list of things O'Neill has said that have undermined the confidence of the financial markets, or created the impression with reporters that he is undermining market confidence, which may amount to the same thing, is now so long that it cannot be fully appreciated in a single paragraph. 
The smaller category of O'Neillian indiscretion arises from his tendency to express certainty about inherently uncertain situations. Examples of this include his prediction not long after he took office that the Treasury wouldn't need to raise the debt ceiling before 2008 (it asked Congress to raise it Dec. 12), his prediction that the Bush administration, unlike the Clinton administration, wouldn't be bailing out third world countries that failed to repay their debts (four months into the job, he agreed to send $10 billion to Argentina) and his prediction after Sept. 11 that the stock market would hit new highs within 18 months. Even the people on Wall Street who get paid to predict where the stock market will be in 18 months don't know where the stock market will be in 18 months. When the treasury secretary pretends to know, he earns their disdain. 
But by far the larger category of O'Neill's indiscretions are the many things he has said that are true, and that most people know to be true, but that treasury secretaries are not supposed to say. Included here are (a) his observation that despite decades of treasury secretaries suggesting otherwise, the United States government does not pursue a "strong dollar policy" and that in any case the Treasury has no ability to affect the level of the dollar; (b) that the most recent House Republican economic-stimulus package is "show business"; and (c) that the real trouble in Argentina is that "they don't have any export industry to speak of. . . . And they like it that way." It's hard for sane people to see any problem with any of this. Some, for example, will point to the convulsion in the market for Argentina's bonds that followed that last remark. So what? It's now clear that the bonds would have convulsed anyway.
But that isn't the point. To the financial-establishment mind, O'Neill's approach to Treasury Department big-shot-dom is a travesty. It violates the central tenet of Washington financial life: never use the English language to convey meaning. The idea is that the economy benefits when important financial policy makers preserve their mystique and that they do this only when they avoid saying what's on their minds. The assumption underpinning this behavior is that the financial markets need to feel as if there is someone somewhere who knows something that they don't and who can, in a pinch, fix things. Greenspan has made a living by saying nothing in the most complicated possible ways and letting other people infer his genius. O'Neill's immediate predecessors, Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, took a slightly more direct approach but still stopped well short of saying anything worth discussing. And in any case, Rubin, who created the model Summers followed, was genuinely so diffident that his opinions were never likely to get him into trouble. 
For better or worse, O'Neill instinctively takes the opposite view: that people are more likely to prosper if you develop positive opinions on subjects and tell them what you think in plain English. "I thought there would be a bigger market here than there is for clarity of expression," O'Neill says. He remains incredulous about the outrage over some of his comments. Take his remark about the strong dollar. It was simple fact: the value of the dollar is determined in the long run not by some Treasury policy but by America's growth rate relative to that of other nations. "But nobody wrote that," he says. "Not one person. All they wrote was 'controversy!"' 
The first time I went to visit O'Neill, I felt professionally obliged to try to get him to say something he shouldn't. When a man, with a single slip of his tongue, can turn you into the envy of investigative reporters, you have to go into any discussion with him armed with banana peels. But this business of getting him to make a spectacle of himself wasn't easy; these horrible gaffes aren't provoked -- they pop out of the treasury secretary unbidden, and either you are there to immortalize them or you aren't. 
Which brings me to the time I caught him at his Bloomberg, the desktop financial-news machine. 
O'Neill has a phobia of closed office doors and keeps his own wide open, in case anyone wants to walk in. Having learned from his secretary that he had returned from lunch -- a little doorbell had gone off, alerting the secretary that he had slipped in through a back door -- I quietly poked my head inside his open door. There he stood with his back to me, about 20 yards away, jabbing at the keyboard on his Bloomberg. (The Bloomberg arrived with O'Neill. Rubin never had one.)
I walked up behind the treasury secretary, and he gave a start, then let out a noise that fell somewhere between a chuckle and a giggle. He knew well enough that he shouldn't let me catch him at whatever he was doing, but he decided to go ahead and let me catch him anyway. When he smiles, which he often does, there is a trace of the imp about him.
"I think I just made news," he said. He kept staring at the Bloomberg screen. He left a lunchtime meeting with Republican senators just 20 minutes before. "I came out of the meeting with Grassley," he said now, referring to Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, "and we were immediately surrounded by all these microphones." Into these, he said something about the stimulus package debate he was sure would cause trouble -- I never could find out what it was -- and the memory of it still lit his face with a grin. Then he walked out the door of the Senate and into his private car, which whisked him back to his office, where, just a few minutes later, he expected that he would already be able to read news of his indiscretion. When you are treasury secretary, you don't have to wait long for your feedback. 
On his Bloomberg, O'Neill brought up the page with the news of the moment and scanned the headlines for his name. It wasn't there. In a gesture that was clearly already second nature to him, he pulled up a search page and, with a single index finger, tapped in P-A-U-L H O' N-E-I-L-L. Up popped the many headlines from the past few days with his name in them, but none from that day. He skipped around cyberspace in the spirit of a boy who had just hurled a stone into a pond and was trying to count the ripples. It wasn't just a matter of principle with him to shock people with his iconoclasm. It gave him pleasure. 

REASON NO. 2: 'I'VE CHANGED SINCE I LEFT WASHINGTON'
O'Neill didn't put it that way to Cheney, of course. What he said was, that as the C.E.O. of a company with 145,000 employees, he had grown used to being the final word on any subject. People who have known O'Neill for a long time say that to understand his behavior as treasury secretary you have to understand that he wasn't just any old C.E.O. When he became C.E.O. of Alcoa in 1988, O'Neill knew nothing about aluminum, and Alcoa was in trouble. Just about everyone believed that it would soon be impossible to make stuff for a profit in America and that commodities like aluminum and steel would be supplied by poor countries with cheap labor. Alcoa's previous C.E.O. had tried, with ill effects, to wriggle out of the closing trap by buying other kinds of businesses and getting Alcoa out of aluminum. O'Neill took the opposite tack: he shed all the extraneous businesses and made nothing but aluminum. In the next 12 years, he doubled Alcoa's global market share and more than doubled its number of workers. After several years of depressed earnings in the early 90's, O'Neill took Alcoa from a profit of $4.8 million in 1993 to a profit of $1.5 billion in 2000. Along the way, he transformed Alcoa's manufacturing process and grafted his character and his beliefs onto the lives of its workers.
He also created, pretty much by an act of will, a new corporate culture. How he did this is actually interesting, in view of how he has gone about his job at the Treasury. He began by making a big pain in the rear of himself. On his first day, he told Alcoa's executives that they weren't going to talk people into buying more aluminum and that they weren't going to be able to raise prices, so the only way to improve the company's fortunes was to lower its costs. And the only way to do that was with the cooperation of Alcoa's workers. And the only way to get that was to show them that you actually cared about them. And the only way to do that was actually to care about them. And the way to do that was to establish, as the first priority of Alcoa, the elimination of all job-related injuries. Any executive who didn't make worker safety his personal fetish -- a higher priority than profits -- would be fired.
On his second day, O'Neill told the same executives that he was eliminating the longstanding practice of paying their membership dues at a Pittsburgh-area country club that excluded women and blacks. (The club soon went looking to scare up a few blacks.)
Well before it became fashionable -- that is, before the Internet boom -- O'Neill replaced the old corporate hierarchy with a flatter management structure. It took him several years, and he was forced to fire a few otherwise useful people who refused to believe he was serious about worker safety, but he eventually established Alcoa as the world's safest place to work. (To give you an idea of what he achieved, Treasury Department employees, most of whom don't do much but sit at desks, missed work because of injury 20 times as often as Alcoa employees, most of whom work with molten lava and man-eating machinery.) He proved to the satisfaction of the people who worked for him that their old ideas of what was possible were based on artificial limits. What Alcoa achieved with worker safety became a metaphor that could be applied to attacking any goal, including the goal of lowering costs. And having persuaded the workers that he was on their side, they paid him back with greater efficiency. 
Pretty much everything O'Neill did at Alcoa reflected his belief that most hierarchical distinctions were nonsense. (The great exception was the big money he and other top executives earned.) He created a profit-sharing plan that was the same for hourly workers and managers. He got rid of the company's headquarters -- in which senior executives worked on top floors with lovely views of everything but ordinary workers -- and moved everyone into a building that he more or less designed to maximize face-to-face encounters between employees of every level. As a corporate boss, O'Neill took a wholly original view of an ancient business -- metal making -- imposed on it his idea of how it should work and changed people's lives.
That's the short version of a more complicated story. But it's enough to help explain why when Dick Cheney called him there wasn't a trace of the post-office-to-O.M.B. civil servant left in him. He was 100 percent Captain of Industry. He had proved that if you had a taste for extreme measures and a strong will you could bring about big changes. Alcoa had imbued him with a new idea of the possible. And at the same time, Alcoa had grounded him in the real, the tangible, the measurable. That day in his office, when he had given up looking for whatever controversial thing he had said, he clicked back to the default page on his Bloomberg screens. Up popped the prices on the London Metals Exchange: aluminum, copper, tin. These prices are the first thing O'Neill checks every morning. I said that it surprised me that the guy who oversees the financial markets wasn't more interested in financial prices. "This is the real down-to-the-ground stuff," he said. "Not advertising and marketing and Hula-Hoops." Or, he might have added, stocks and bonds. "Commodity prices tend to be a leading indicator," he said. "And they're moving up." 
In places where perception is conflated with reality, cause is often confused with effect. There is a tendency on Wall Street to see finance primarily as cause rather than effect -- a view that inflates the importance of people who work on Wall Street. O'Neill sees finance as effect rather than cause, and the people who work in it as cogs in a bigger machine. Even now, when you talk to people who work on Wall Street about O'Neill, they can't quite get past what he said about them in an interview he gave to The Wall Street Journal last January. In their paper, he described Wall Street professionals as "people who sit in front of a flickering green screen" and went on to say that those traders "are not the sort of people you would want to help you think about complex questions." When The Journal asked him if he had ever worked in front of a flickering green screen, he said he hadn't, but "I probably could learn in about a couple weeks." 
It was a marvelous red-map moment: At Alcoa, O'Neill liked to say that he didn't focus on the company's stock price or even the bottom line but on the factors that led to the bottom line. Indeed, one reason O'Neill is disinclined to worry about the effect of his words on financial markets is that he doesn't think words affect financial markets -- not in any fundamental way. And even if they did, the financial markets are really beside the point. The point is the real down-to-the-ground stuff. 
To that end, O'Neill has tried to create a new and better view for himself of the U.S. economy by gathering more data about down-to-the-ground stuff. For instance, Treasury staffers are now busy trying to elicit from the big automobile companies real-time information about the effects of auto sales on auto-parts suppliers. Other Treasury staffers are trying to persuade Visa and Amex to give them real-time data on credit card purchases. 
But knowing what is going on is not the same thing as doing something about it. The odd thing about being treasury secretary is that while people may pay attention to what you say, you can't actually do very much. "When you're treasury secretary," says Bo Cutter, who, in addition to serving in Jimmy Carter's O.M.B., worked under Rubin in Clinton's White House, "you get to talk about the world economy, but you can't actually do anything about the world economy. By definition, you get invited to the meetings, but you don't by definition get to control them." The sort of power even the most exalted treasury secretary has is only the power to persuade. He has, at best, the power to manipulate public perception of big events and to infect the mind of the president with his ideas. 
This is an uncomfortable position for a person who has grown used to holding the levers that control every detail in his environment. O'Neill has responded on the one hand by trying to sell his view of the world to the White House and on the other by yanking on what levers he has. 
One afternoon, O'Neill took me on a little tour around the Treasury. It was the day after Argentinians had first rioted in the streets, responding indirectly to the I.M.F.'s sudden tightfistedness. "I hate seeing how this gets translated into physical violence on the street," O'Neill said. In refusing to supply further funds to Argentina, the I.M.F. seemed to be following O'Neill's lead on how to deal with the crisis. When the Argentinian economy minister turned up in Washington last month to beg for help, O'Neill's Treasury officials avoided meeting him. The White House, too, seemed to be taking O'Neill's lead, agreeing with him that you couldn't create confidence in Argentina by pouring more money into it -- that before it received any additional financial aid, the country needed to change the way it approached the real down-to-the-ground stuff. "I think what we've been doing over the last 40 or 50 years in the World Bank and the I.M.F. has to some extent gone astray," O'Neill said. He knows a thing or two about turning a failing enterprise into a thriving one, and he sees no evidence that the I.M.F. has a similar understanding about a failing country. "We still don't really understand in a straight-line way how to create economic development," he says.
We walked out of his office and into the dark corridor, floored with black-and-white marble tiles and lined with portraits of 70 former treasury secretaries. (Rubin's picture hangs just outside O'Neill's door.) We left the third floor -- where all the most important people sit -- and marched down the hall. We passed a cleaning lady who had dropped her keys and spray cans. O'Neill stopped to help her pick them up. If she knew who he was, or found it remarkable in any way that this trim, taut figure in his well-pressed shirt had stopped to help, she didn't show it. Government workers, unlike, say, Alcoa workers, haven't any incentive to know who is boss. It takes an act of will to promote them and an act of Congress to fire them. 
The Treasury's halls are impossibly long, and as we walk them we have plenty of time to talk.
"I really like building things that are the consequence of ideas," O'Neill says. 
His notion of building something that is the consequence of good ideas is Alcoa's Pittsburgh headquarters. The Alcoa building has the added attraction of being a consequence of his ideas. 
I tell him that when I visited the Alcoa building in Pittsburgh, I'd learned that pretty much everyone liked it except the lawyers -- an ominous sign for a man now working in a city run by lawyers. The lawyers, I was told, couldn't stand the idea of working out in the open, where they could be seen.
"The lawyers hated it," he says. "With them, it's a professional gene. I'd say: Tell me, why do you need secrecy? I'm out in the open, and you're working for me." 
So far as O'Neill is concerned, the Treasury building represents pretty much everything that can be wrong with a building. Or, rather, the ideas that led to its design are, from the point of view of a modern American C.E.O. who is trying to get things done, bad ideas. The reverence of the past interferes with technical progress; the thick walls disrupt communication; the huge offices with massive wooden doors dissuade anyone outside them from imagining what should go on inside them and hide those on the inside from critical scrutiny. "The idea of people working together is really defeated by walls," O'Neill says, "and even more so by hierarchy."
By law and architectural design, our government is resistant to change. Its walls are some of the thickest in the free world. But here O'Neill, for once, got lucky. He arrived in the middle of the first big renovation in a century. One-quarter of the building was already under repair. So, O'Neill says, as we curve up the semispiral staircase, "when they took all the walls down, I told them they couldn't put them back up. They said I couldn't do that. Their argument was that history was present. In the walls. They were historical walls." He's smiling now. "So I said, Which are the historical walls? And I let them keep a couple of those." 
The Treasury halls are dark, the stairways even darker. In places, you have to squint to see who is passing in the other direction. Then O'Neill throws open a door on a different epoch. Before us, in the middle of a 19th-century pile of stones, which everyone pretty much assumed could never be changed, is a cube farm. Light pours in from tall windows. It is clean and neat and open and straightforward and hopeful. It is, in fact, a replica of an Alcoa cube farm. 
"Look at all that light," he says. "Isn't it wonderful?"

REASON NO. 3: 'TAKING THIS JOB IS GOING TO COST ME $250 MILLION'
In 2000, his last year as chairman of Alcoa, O'Neill made $25 million. When he left the company, he had almost 4 million stock options and 2.37 million shares, worth another $80 million. The O'Neill fortune was different from the fortunes accumulated by the other pooh-bahs in the Bush administration. Powell made his tens of millions mainly speaking about leadership to businesspeople who wanted to rub shoulders with him. Rumsfeld and Cheney made their tens of millions as stewards of, and arrangers for, businesses they had no great effect upon. And Bush of course himself made his millions through connections.
O'Neill was truly different. If you asked a seriously competent American C.E.O. -- that is, one you have never heard of, because he doesn't hire people to get his name in the papers -- whom in the Bush administration he admires as a businessperson, the only name he would come up with would be O'Neill's. Only O'Neill made his money by transforming a business and making it more productive. 
Taking the Treasury job meant walking away from the bigger part of his Alcoa-based fortune. He could sell the stock, but he assumed, at least at first, that he would have to give up his stock options. Interestingly, he calculated the value of these options at $250 million. Well-established pricing models value these options at roughly $25 million. O'Neill got to his number using financially naive assumptions about how high Alcoa stock was likely to go in the next 10 years. Whatever. It was a lot of money. "It wasn't my money ultimately," he says. "It was my children's. So I talked to them before I went to this lunch" -- with Bush and Cheney -- "and I told them that it's not my money, I have more money than I'll ever use, it's your money. And they said, If this is the price of your doing it, fine. They didn't give a damn." 
His daughter Julie recalls less being consulted by her father than her father calling her and her siblings together to inform them of his decision -- which is maybe a tiny sign that when O'Neill makes important decisions he is less interested in a flat management structure than he would like to think.
In any case, the kids honestly didn't care about the millions, and O'Neill liked that they didn't care. Then things got complicated: Treasury lawyers told O'Neill that he could exempt himself from decisions that might affect Alcoa's stock and keep his Alcoa stock options. He decided to try it. He couldn't imagine anyone accusing him of ethical lapses because no one ever had, with reason. For the first three months on the job, he woke up every morning to find another jab in the newspapers about his potential conflicts of interest, as both a huge Alcoa shareholder and a man making decisions that could affect Alcoa's share price, and another joke at his expense on the Democratic National Committee Web site. "They set up a Web site, and they were having a ball," he says. "And I realized I should have walked away from all of it and not listened to the lawyers." On March 25, he walked away from a good part of his fortune. 
The whole mess still eats at him, however, partly because it is much less fun not to have those millions than to have them, but also because of the implications of the debate about his morals. "If your standards are so low that you would let your personal finances affect your decision, then you have no business being here in the first place," he says. "It should be grounds for nonconfirmation." But the moment he chucked his list and took the Treasury job, O'Neill became an artificial construct based only loosely on the man he was before he took the job. He was finding out that in public life as currently lived it doesn't matter what's "real." All that matters is perceptions. 
There's an analogy to this experience in O'Neill's attitude toward the financial markets. Just as he refuses to accept that there is such a thing as "an appearance of a conflict of interest" (either you are conflicted or you aren't), he refuses to accept that the perceptions he creates with his words matter all that much. 
In this he couldn't be more different from his old friend Greenspan, the other government official who can move financial markets with a subordinate clause. One morning, I was sitting in one of the deep, dark leather chairs in O'Neill's office, beneath a portrait of Alexander Hamilton, having spent two hours or so watching him confer with several Treasury staff members who were trying to find him better economic data. As the staff members made to leave, O'Neill began to talk to me about one of the high points of each week, when he ate breakfast with Greenspan and argued about economic data.
"Why don't you come along this Friday to breakfast?" he said. 
The thought of it clearly amused him. The two men share not only a lot of history, having worked together in and out of government, but also a hobby: no other human being on the planet can match their interest in General
Motors order books or the latest inventory numbers. Their breakfast has become a ritual.
"That'd be great," I said. 
"I'd better call Alan just to make sure it's all right, but I can't see why he'd object," he said.
O'Neill went off to call Greenspan, and as he did, I was able to think of about 10 reasons he would object. For one thing, Greenspan has always been the sort of guy who likes reporters to know that he is talking about complicated economic stuff with some treasury secretary over breakfast but never permits them to judge for themselves the interest of the conversation. A few hours later, I was back in O'Neill's office when Greenspan returned the call. I sat in the deep leather chair and listened to one end of a conversation. 
"I have a journalist here," O'Neill began, and went on to explain who I was and what I wanted. There followed an ominously long pause.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
"Uh-huh."
"O.K."
O'Neill hung up and walked over with the closest thing to no expression on his face. "Alan says he'll come, but he won't say anything," he said. I tried my best to look surprised.
"Probably better if you didn't come."
It was hard not to like him for trying. It wasn't that he thought he was letting me in on some secret. In his mind, there was no reason for secrets.

REASON NO. 4: 'MY POLITICS AREN'T NECESSARILY YOUR POLITICS'
It was with this point that O'Neill, so far as I can piece together and he can remember, filled most of the lines on his three-page list. In the late 1980's, he advocated a 50-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax. He thought global warming was a real problem. He thinks that the whole Social Security system should be scrapped and replaced with accounts owned by individuals and invested in stock market indices and bond funds. On and on, this list of specific policy points went. Some were clearly not Republican policies. He doesn't think in terms of Republican policies or Democratic ones. When you build your political views from the ground up, basing them on your own set of closely observed facts, you wind up in your own private place, well outside the boxes built by political parties. The greatest part of O'Neill's list can be summarized in a sentence: I disagree with you because I know more than you do about the down-to-the-ground stuff. He didn't put it that way to Bush, of course. Instead, he said, "I've taken unpopular positions."
The last time I saw O'Neill was just before Christmas. I had finally gotten around to reading everything he had ever said publicly. I told him that if I didn't know anything about him but what he was on record as having said I wouldn't be sure if he was a Democrat or a Republican.
He laughed and said, "You're going to get me into trouble, aren't you?"
"But it's true that the only way anyone would even guess you might be Republican is to know you were a rich businessman."
"Now there's a stereotype!"
I said that while it's possible (just) to be a maverick in the Senate, it's another thing to be a maverick in the cabinet. Inside an administration, you aren't really allowed to stake out an independent political identity. O'Neill has a physical tic, a tendency to turn his head to his left in profile in the middle of a conversation, when he wants a moment to himself to actually think. He did this now. Then he said, "That's not who I am." He is a registered Republican, he said. "But if you asked me what I am, it would be a long time before I got around to political identification." He paused again, then said, "When George Shultz hired me at O.M.B., he never asked if I was a Republican." Pause. "Come to think of it, no one at O.M.B. ever asked me what I was." 
"Did Bush and Cheney ask?" Given the complete absence of O'Neill money from the Bush campaign, they might at least have probed him on this.
"No." 

REASON NO. 5: 'I TOLD MY WIFE I'D FINALLY PLAY SHUFFLEBOARD, TAKE CRUISES AND IN GENERAL BEHAVE LIKE AN ORDINARY RETIRED PERSON'
Everywhere O'Neill has worked, he has been known as the guy who puts in the longest hours. For a Kennedy School interviewer in the early 1990's, he recalled how at O.M.B. he had worked every day except Christmas, a minimum of 12-hour days. O'Neill's daughter Julie told me, "My mother was saying how they were going to do this and do that when my father left Alcoa, but we all knew that it wasn't going to happen."
Last January, O'Neill moved from his nice home in Pittsburgh into a room in the Hotel Washington, across the street from the Treasury building, where he lived for the next 10 months. He might as well have slept in a cube. Where he lived didn't much matter because mostly all he did was work. 
He actually had a fairly long list of reasons for wanting to be treasury secretary to offset the list of reasons for not wanting the job. At the top was a chance to push ideas about public policy -- and especially about radically changing Social Security. Just below that was the chance to change the biggest organization on the planet -- the federal government. 
He has concerned himself with the most quotidian details of Treasury operations. Two months into the job, he visited the Philadelphia Mint and wound up on the factory floor making changes in the production line. He requested the Treasury worker-safety records and made a priority of eliminating job-related injuries. (Already he has cut the lost days in half.) He found that Americans made 77.5 million phone calls last year to the Internal Revenue Service -- which is part of the Treasury Department -- to ask for explanations of the tax code and that 3,654 government workers do nothing but answer these calls. He has set as a goal to create such clear explanations of the rules -- or even better, to simplify the tax code -- that the calls cease. 
When I asked him once how he judges himself, he said: "It's not, Did we get some bill passed or did someone like what I said or wrote? What really matters to me is lasting institutional change." Then he turned his head to the left and thought a minute. "Metal has shape. If you form metals into a shape they'll tend to return to that shape. Institutions are like that. I'd like to turn this into a place where people get fulfillment out of what they do with their life -- and it'll really be hard for subsequent people to take it away. Because it becomes a right." 
It's a blessing, but also a curse, that our government resists people who want to change its shape. Much of what O'Neill has done as a boss has been aimed at eliminating indignities from the work lives of ordinary people. Small wonder that he has so little patience for indignity himself. But there is an aspect to being treasury secretary that is inherently undignified -- especially to a former C.E.O. who never had to worry one bit what people who didn't know him thought of him. It's the democratic part of his current job that requires saying what you don't really mean or believe, or at the very least remaining silent about what you actually think, all to make a shallow impression on a lot of people who don't know you. O'Neill has mostly ignored this part of the job. He has refused to sell himself to the financial markets. It should not come as a huge surprise that the financial markets haven't bought him.
No one can say with authority whether O'Neill will be staying or asked to go. O'Neill himself may not know. On some level, the White House political people must realize that if they fire their treasury secretary they will implicitly be taking the blame for the stalled economy. But if he is still around as you read this, maybe it is because, in hiring O'Neill, Bush and Cheney knowingly signed on for an unusually interesting ride. If they did, now they've got it.

 BODY:
IN his official farewell address last month, at St. Paul's Chapel, a stone's throw from the rubble, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made headlines, calling for a memorial at the former World Trade Center site.
 "I really believe we shouldn't think about this site out there, right behind us, right here, as a site for economic development," he said. "We should think about a soaring, monumental, beautiful memorial that just draws millions of people here that just want to see it. 
 "If the memorial was done correctly, you'll have all the economic development you want, and you can do the office space in a lot of different places." 
Art before business: an amazing thought. The new mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, promptly made clear that, in the midst of a fiscal crunch, turning the site over mostly to a memorial was pretty unlikely. More likely was a mix of office and retail space in addition to a memorial. 
Proposals for memorials have poured in to City Hall and elsewhere, some of them strangely identical. (Twin light beams seem to have occurred to many people simultaneously.) Ultimately, the tough part won't be deciding to build a memorial but agreeing about what it will look like. From Berlin to Oklahoma City, this has been a gigantic problem, not least because victims and their families feel they should have a say (who can argue with that?), and in New York's case there are thousands of victims. But even when small groups of so-called art experts decide, the process is usually a struggle.
I have a guess. A memorial, as part of a mixed-use project, will in some way turn out to look Minimalist, Minimalism, of all improbable art movements of the last 50 years, having become the unofficial language of memorial art. What used to be men on horses with thrusting swords has morphed more or less into plain walls and boxes. Once considered the most obstinate kind of modernism, Minimalism has gradually, almost sub rosa, made its way into the public's heart. And now those bare walls are blank slates onto which we project our deepest commonly held feelings.
Maya Lin's Vietnam memorial in Washington is the obvious example. Peter Eisenman's proposed Holocaust memorial in Berlin, originally conceived with Richard Serra, is another, a Minimalist field of plain concrete pillars, like headstones. Rachel Whiteread's Holocaust memorial in Vienna, a big eggshell-colored box made to resemble an inside-out room with shelves of books, is yet another. And Oklahoma City, with a grid of chairs lined up like Donald Judd boxes, representing the victims of the terrorist bombing there, is the most germane example for New York. Even the temporary viewing ramps at the former Trade Center site are in a Minimalist vein.
The purpose of a memorial is to get people talking, so that the memories being honored are kept alive after the events memorialized pass into history. What kind of art best serves that function? The artist Nathan Rapoport, responding to criticism that his 1948 Warsaw Ghetto Monument, a realist sculpture, was inadequate to the enormity of its subject, asked: "Could I have made a rock with a hole in it and said, 'Voila! The heroism of the Jewish people'?" In a modern world, he realized, neither abstraction nor realism was going to be universally acceptable as a style for memorializing the dead.
The exercise of taste is a matter of who wields power at a given moment. You may have heard how both sides in the debate over the World War II memorial on the Mall in Washington, the most conspicuous non-Minimalist memorial of recent years, claimed to speak for the preferences of the war veterans, as if veterans were a monolithic group.
Centuries ago, when public art was commissioned by royalty, aristocrats and the church, official taste was synonymous with high art. Democracy and the modern era altered all that. Official art in a democracy requires consensus, an aesthetic common denominator.
But modern art is about one person's vision. The idea of a consensus is antithetical to it. Its concerns are often entirely formal: line, color, mass and weight. Memorial art, on the other hand, is therapeutic, redemptive and educational. These are different things.
Modern artists also love ambiguity and irony. Monument builders don't. "The notion of a modern monument," Lewis Mumford famously wrote 60 years ago, "is a contradiction in terms. If it is a monument, it is not modern, and if it is modern, it cannot be a monument."
You will notice the speed with which the Oklahoma City memorial to the people who died in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995 was undertaken. It wasn't until 1922 that the United States got around to building a memorial to Lincoln, and even then it was controversial. But in our day, the impulse to memorialize tragedy is instantaneous. It is as if the memorial were a quick fix for whatever bad happens and a way to move on. The moving on is crucial. So is the coming together in a sometimes uneasily diverse society, through a presumptive communal or national bereavement, which the monument embodies.
But I said impulse. The impulse to memorialize is immediate; arriving at a design in Oklahoma was grueling because the wounds were still fresh and everyone who had anything to do with the event wanted to contribute to the design. The process was fascinating. First came the calls to destroy the Murrah building to obliterate evidence of the tragedy and help erase its memory, and also avoid the site's becoming a pilgrimage spot for lunatic sympathizers with Timothy McVeigh. John Wayne Gacy's home in Chicago and Jeffrey Dahmer's apartment building in Milwaukee had been destroyed for these reasons.
But then the question came up: is obliterating forgetting? In a very different context, that's what the Nazis wanted to do to the Jews. Obliterate and forget. It's the dilemma that faces the keepers of every Nazi death camp: is Auschwitz today a cautionary tale or a tourist attraction or both? The French writer Jean Baudrillard, in a remark also germane to New York now, talked about how "forgetting the extermination is part of the extermination itself," but eradicating what the evildoers did may also be a way of exterminating them. The desire among survivors to eradicate McVeigh -- to execute him -- was about trying to forget him.
That was one discussion, anyway, but it was overwhelmed by plans to build something where the Murrah building was. The first memorials, spontaneous, were like the makeshift shrines that have sprung up in New York: flowers, letters, quilts, toys, clothes. People claimed to have sudden visions for memorials entailing doves, angels and bells. Ideas for parks were popular, too. 
The public clearly expected a memorial to be everything: a place to mourn; a place that warned against terrorism; a symbol that the terrorists hadn't won; a history museum; a spot to which local people could come to hear music and tourists could meditate on American values (and spend money).
The final design called for a grid of bronze and glass chairs in a field, the chairs representing the 168 people who died. When it was done, many survivors said the process, although sometimes bitter, was constructive -- it brought them together to create something that might enlighten people, someplace they could go, something good that came from bad, a show of fortitude by survivors.
From an art perspective we could note two things: that the headstonelike sculptural array of chairs is Minimalist in concept, or Minimalist-derived. And that it commemorates ordinary people, something so obvious and commonplace that it is taken for granted, but not something that memorials always did. 
You can trace the roots of the common-man memorial at least to Rodin in the 19th century. He was commissioned in late 1884 to design a monument to the burghers of Calais. In 1347, six burghers offered their lives to the English in return for ending a siege of the city. Rodin made the figures life-size, grouped one next to another, looking gaunt, not heroic. The expressions suggested doubt or fear.
This was a very different monument from other memorials up to then. The six figures were of equal importance. Critics noticed that Rodin represented not the moment they decided to sacrifice themselves, when they were their noblest, but them in bondage. "The effect is most graceless," one writer said at the time. Rodin envisioned them either high on a pedestal, silhouetted against the Houses of Parliament, or on the ground, "closer to the people," he said. His point was to level the human condition: he brought the masses into proximity with his heroes by eliminating highfalutin allegory and stressing the real. The burghers were plain folk who became heroes.
Leap several decades to Constantin Brancusi and another kind of modern monument, the one Brancusi finished in 1938 at Tirgu-Jiu in Romania, a memorial to the soldiers who perished defending that town against the Germans during World War I.
It is a complex of sculptures with the famous "Endless Column" at one end, an enormous modular pole in the middle of a field. Brancusi described it as a votive or funerary monument. Leading up to the column along an axis are what he called the "Table of Silence," a circular table with hourglass-shape stools, then the "Gate of the Kiss," a stone portal that may have been partly inspired by Rodin's "Gates of Hell" and also by local folk carvings. 
This was a purely abstract memorial linked not by some narrative, like Rodin's "Burghers," but by formal properties, a thoroughly modern monument, encapsulating the radical idea that a modern memorial could be, first of all, modern and not necessarily explicit.
But a crisis was brewing. After World War II, artists increasingly distrusted monuments, which the Nazis and Soviets had used so conspicuously to promote totalitarian ideas. By the 1960's and 70's, Claes Oldenburg was making giant sculptures of clothespins and lipsticks, Pop Art monuments. They implied that what people shared now was no longer a set of common ideals or heroes -- the stuff of traditional monuments and memorials -- but a bunch of everyday household objects and consumer desires. Mr. Oldenburg's frequently quoted remark was: "I am for art that does something other than sit in a museum, that takes its form from the lines of life itself, that twists and extends, accumulates and spits and drips and is as heavy and coarse and blunt and sweet and stupid as life itself."
His most notorious public monument, a kind of antimemorial, was "Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks," at Yale. A giant phallic lipstick that looked like a warhead, it had been inspired partly by something the philosopher Herbert Marcuse said: that a really subversive modern monument would help bring society as it existed to an end. People, Marcuse said, would thereafter "refuse to take anything seriously, neither their president, nor the cabinet, nor the corporate executives."
Several years later this concept of the antimonument became the basis for an extraordinary antifascist memorial in Germany. During the mid-80's, the artists Jochen and Esther Gerz came up with a scheme for a pedestrian shopping mall in Harburg, a dingy suburb of Hamburg, with a population mostly of Turkish migrant workers and blue-collar Germans.
The monument they designed consisted of a column, 40 feet high, 3 feet square. It was a hollow aluminum pillar with a layer of soft lead and a steel stylus attached to it so people could write into the pillar. Whenever a section of the pillar got sufficiently covered with graffiti, it would be lowered into the ground. This was a disappearing monument. Unveiled in 1986, it vanished in 1993.
Harburgers scrawled all sorts of things onto it, as they were supposed to, including Stars of David and swastikas. A local newspaper called it a "fingerprint" of the city: "The filth brings us closer to the truth than would any list of well-meaning signatures."
The visual analogies between Brancusi's column and the Gerzes' pillar were obvious. But there was another visual connection: between the pillar reflecting German public sentiment and Maya Lin's Vietnam memorial, which reflected the faces of visitors who came to see it. Ms. Lin talked about her reflective black granite walls as mirrors: "The point," she said, "is to see yourself reflected in the names."
What was happening was a gradual, unexpected transformation of high modernism's abstract language into something like its rhetorical opposite: something sentimental, narrative, populist. In art terms: the adaptation of postwar Minimalism and its solipsistic legacy of formal and material concerns to a successful form of public memorial art. 
IF you want to know how the public used to perceive Minimalism, to the extent it knew about Minimalism at all, remember how Mr. Serra's "Tilted Arc" in New York was loathed by some of the people who worked near it. A huge curved sheet of Corten steel, the sculpture traversed the plaza in front of a downtown federal office building. Mr. Serra's defenders did not help the cause by saying that the work addressed the condition of alienation in modern society. Disgruntled office workers just plain hated it, not only because it was so big but also because it seemed to them industrial and blank. It was removed in 1989 after a bitter court battle.
"Tilted Arc," among other things, led Mr. Serra to do the immensely popular sculptures he makes today. They are inextricably linked to that work formally, conceptually. The paradox has not been lost on him. The difference between these new works and "Tilted Arc" is partly context: "Tilted Arc" was not in a museum or a gallery but in a public plaza, thrust upon people (so they felt) and thwarting their (questionable) expectations that public art should be friendly. At the same time they recognized in their discomfort a latent aspect of Minimal or Post-Minimal art: its emotional intensity, which derives from its mass, its austere, abstract and elemental form. Minimalism is a deeply rational kind of modern art, and rationalism, like spiritualism, carried to an extreme level of control can become a form of terror.
But it can be turned to other purposes, too. And this is the brilliance of Maya Lin's Vietnam memorial, which comes straight out of Mr. Serra's sculptural vocabulary. It has helped change the popular perception of Minimal or Post-Minimal art, even if people don't think about it that way, being basically the same sort of design as Mr. Serra's so-called elevation sculptures: two 10-foot-high, 250-foot-long walls meeting at a 125-degree angle, one pointing to the Washington Monument, the other to the Lincoln Memorial.
The walls are inscribed with the names of the 59,939 soldiers who died or were missing in action, listed in chronological order. When it opened, a feminist writer described the monument as a wide V-shape surrounded by a grassy mound at the base of Washington's giant phallus. Detractors, less creatively, simply disliked the plan because of the black walls, which seemed to them grim and maybe racist. And there was also a realist art contingent, led by Ross Perot and former Interior Secretary James Watt, who managed to get a figurative sculpture installed nearby, the abstract-realist argument going back to Rapoport's Warsaw Ghetto memorial.
That said, Ms. Lin's monument quickly became almost universally admired. The reason is partly the names: people go to read, touch, leave flowers and photographs beside the names. But the genius of the design is the combination of names with Minimalist sculpture: Ms. Lin recognized and exploited the inherent theatricality and ambiguity of Minimalist abstraction, linking it with the most literal kind of descriptive device, a list, which represents every person who died not through some generalized image of a soldier holding a gun or a flag but specifically, by name. She grasped two things: the value of naming and the nostalgia inherent in what you might call the modern memorial sublime, the way Minimalist art and its Post-Minimal legacy, precisely because of its stripped-down, elemental forms, evokes a kind of long-lost grandeur. It is the closest modern art has come to an alternative to the heroic public sculptural ambition of Michelangelo or Bernini.
Memorials, being fixed in concrete and stone, have an inherent problem because memories aren't fixed. Perceptions change. Minimalist abstraction, with its allegorical pliancy, turns out to function in a memorial context as the best available mirror for a modern world aware of its own constantly changing sense of history. Good art outlasts the events that prompted the artists to make it. We need good memorials now for future generations to remember what we refuse to forget.
