PERSON: Steve Fossett 

HEADLINE: Adventurer Steve Fossett Declared Dead

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Steve Fossett, the wealthy, record-setting adventurer who for years blithely sailed, soared and drove through all manner of danger before disappearing in September during what was meant to be a routine short flight, was declared dead Friday by a Chicago court. He was 63, and had homes in Chicago; Beaver Creek, Colo.; and Carmel, Calif.
 Mr. Fossett was declared legally dead by Judge Jeffrey A. Malak of the Circuit Court of Cook County, said Mary C. Downie, a lawyer for Mr. Fossett's widow.
 At 8 a.m. on Sept. 3, 2007, Mr. Fossett took off alone from the Flying-M Ranch, near Yerington, Nev., in a Citabria Super Decathlon, a single-engine two-seater. He was scheduled to be back by noon but never returned. That evening, a search was begun, with airplanes and a helicopter scouring the wild terrain on the Nevada-California border over which he had disappeared. Mr. Fossett had filed no flight plan, and no electronic signal had been received from the plane. 
 The search was called off after several weeks. In late November, Mr. Fossett's wife, Peggy, petitioned the court to have her husband declared dead. The value of his estate is said to exceed eight figures, Ms. Downie said.
 A retired commodities trader who had made millions in soybean futures, Mr. Fossett was an explorer out of the great Victorian tradition, though with far better equipment. Balding, round-faced and paunchy, he did not fit the popular notion of a dashing adventurer in any era.
 But his exploits were legion. He set more than a hundred world records in the skies and on the water, according to his Web site, www.stevefossett.com. (Many of these records have since been broken.)
 In 2002, Mr. Fossett became the first person to circumnavigate the world solo in a hot-air balloon. In 2005, he became the first solo pilot to fly a plane around the world without stopping to refuel. In 2006, he set the nonstop distance record for an aircraft, flying solo from Florida to England -- the long way -- for a total of 25,766 miles. (The trip, which included two Atlantic crossings, took 76 hours, 42 minutes and 55 seconds.)
 Mr. Fossett was an equally accomplished glider pilot. In 2006, he and a co-pilot, Einar Enevoldson, became the first people to fly a glider into the stratosphere, setting an altitude record of 50,671 feet. It was one of 10 world records for the glider set by Mr. Fossett, his Web site said.
 At sea, Mr. Fossett, set 21 world records, among them the round-the-world speed record for vessels under sail. In 2004, aboard the Cheyenne, his 125-foot maxi-catamaran, Mr. Fossett and his crew circumnavigated the globe in 58 days, 9 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds, shaving nearly 6 days off the previous record.
 Mr. Fossett also chased records on land. On his flight over Nevada the day he disappeared, he was believed to have been scouting locations for an attempt to break the world land-speed record, 766.6 miles an hour in a turbojet-powered car.
 With Will Hasley, Mr. Fossett wrote an autobiography, ''Chasing the Wind,'' published by Virgin Books in 2006.
 In the weeks after Mr. Fossett disappeared, his friends and family expressed their belief that he would be found alive. After all, he had survived fire, flood and a great deal else.
 In August 1998, on Mr. Fossett's fourth attempt to fly round the world in a balloon, he was sucked into a thunderstorm off Australia's northeast coast. The capsule fell nearly 30,000 feet into the Coral Sea. But it was also on fire, set alight by the balloon's propane burners. Mr. Fossett was still inside. Sharks were outside.
 Mr. Fossett managed to grab his life raft and dive out through the capsule's submerged hatch. He was picked up by a boat after 10 hours at sea. 
 Besides the dramatic dangers, there were persistent discomforts. The capsule of Spirit of Freedom, the balloon in which Mr. Fossett made many voyages, measured just 7 feet long by 5 feet wide by 5 feet high -- too small to allow him to stand upright. It was also unpressurized, requiring him often to wear an oxygen mask. And if a fuel tank or burner malfunctioned, he had to climb outside, in temperatures well below zero, to fix it.
 There was also the risk of being shot down. It was a vivid concern on his fifth attempt at circumnavigation, in December 1998. On that trip, Mr. Fossett, flying with Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand, was barred -- too late to alter course -- from entering Chinese airspace. There was the real possibility that once the three men were over China, fighter jets would fire on them.
 At the last minute, diplomacy prevailed, and the men flew over China without incident. (Mr. Branson, the president of Virgin Atlantic and a former balloon racer, underwrote many of Mr. Fossett's adventures.)
 But for all the hazards, Mr. Fossett said he felt little pressure. To him, flying, sailing or soaring faster or farther or higher than anyone had done before were merely a series of logistical problems that could be satisfyingly, if expensively, worked out.
 James Stephen Fossett was born on April 22, 1944, in Jackson, Tenn. He grew up in Garden Grove, Calif., in Orange County, where his father managed a soap factory. As a child, he suffered from asthma, but he pushed himself athletically. He loved hiking and other outdoor adventure. 
 Mr. Fossett earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Stanford University in 1966 and an M.B.A. from Washington University in St. Louis two years later. He took a job in Chicago running the information-technology division of a department store, but was quickly bored. He decided to switch careers.
 He went to work for Merrill Lynch, and later started his own brokerage firm, Lakota Trading. Mr. Fossett was also a principal in Larkspur Securities and Marathon Racing, which developed and owned much of the technology he used in his adventures.
 Besides his wife, the former Peggy Viehland, whom he married in 1967, Mr. Fossett is survived by a brother, Richard L. Fossett III, and a sister, Linda G. Dansby.
 Mr. Fossett had his detractors. Some critics saw him as a graying playboy, awash in a rich man's toys. Others took him to task for deliberately courting danger, heedless of the cost to taxpayers of his various rescues. But Mr. Fossett often said that it was novelty and adventure, not danger, that he sought.
 ''I don't like to be scared, and I spend a lot of effort figuring out how to reduce risks,'' he told The Times of London in 2004. ''The sports I'm involved in are high risk; to pursue them you have to be risk averse.''
 Not all Mr. Fossett's ventures were spectacularly successful. After swimming the English Channel in 1985, for instance, he received a trophy -- for the slowest crossing of the year. He managed to scale the highest peak on every continent except Mount Everest. 
 Mr. Fossett also drove a dogsled in the Iditarod race in Alaska (he placed 47th); skied from Aspen to Vail, Colo. (an enterprise of nearly 60 hours); drove a Kremer Porsche 962C for 24 hours in the Le Mans sports car race; sailed an airship to a world speed record; and competed in the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii.
 The only frontier on which Mr. Fossett had not made an assault was outer space. This owed, perhaps, to a reluctance to consign himself to the role of mere crewman, as he told Newsweek in 2003.
 ''Flying in the space shuttle would be fascinating,'' Mr. Fossett said. ''But I'd want to be the pilot.''

HEADLINE: Data Shows Struggling Manufacturers, Costly Imports and Gloomier Consumers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
A fresh batch of data released on Friday revealed an economy in distress, as manufacturers struggled, import prices rose, and consumer confidence continued to erode.
 ''The reports didn't seem to confirm recession, but they confirmed slow growth,'' said Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America. ''Given what was happening in the financial markets this week, the vibes aren't that good.''
 Import costs grew last month at the highest annual rate since the Labor Department began keeping records in 1983, primarily because of surging oil costs. 
 The high price of gasoline is putting pressure on Americans to cut back on nonessential purchases. Consumers responding to a national survey this month said they felt worse about the economy than at any time since the recession era of the early 1990s. 
 ''This is just horrible,'' Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. ''The sustained volatility in the markets, the rise in energy and food prices and, of course, the catastrophe in the housing market, is making consumers extraordinarily miserable.''
 A closely watched measure of consumer confidence, the Reuters/University of Michigan survey, fell to 69.6 in February, the lowest reading since February 1992. It stood at 78.4 in January.
 Manufacturing activity in New York fell to its lowest level in five years, and a separate report from the Federal Reserve showed that auto manufacturers cut back on production in January. Output for the entire manufacturing sector was flat for the month. 
 ''Companies are responding remarkably rapidly to signs of weakness by cutting their production and cutting back on hiring,'' said Edward E. Yardeni, an investment strategist. ''If we're not careful we may push ourselves into a recession.''
 The slowdown in growth is likely to result in further cuts to the Fed's benchmark interest rate, which central bankers have already lowered by 1.25 percentage points this year.
 But the rise in import prices underscores concerns that inflation might also be posing a problem, a development that could complicate the Fed's rate-cutting decisions. Lower interest rates stimulate growth by easing the flow of money among banks, consumers and businesses. But they can also lead to higher prices and a weaker dollar.
 Import prices rose 1.7 percent in January and were 13.7 percent higher than the level in January a year earlier. Fuel, food and beverage costs led the rise, with the cost of imported petroleum up 67 percent from January 2007, according to the Labor Department.
 The higher costs may partly explain the slowdown in import sales, which are lagging even as sales of exports surge. The trade deficit narrowed in 2007 for the first time in five years, the Commerce Department said Thursday, a sign that Americans are less willing to spend on coatly imports.
 Export prices rose 1.2 percent in January as American companies charged more for food products, industrial supplies and agricultural products. 
 Friday did bring a sliver of good news for the economy. The Fed reported that industrial production grew 0.1 percent last month, keeping pace with December. Cold weather pushed up activity at electric and natural gas utilities, which offset a sharp decline in output at auto manufacturers.
 Capacity utilization, which measures the proportion of plants in use, held steady in January at 81.5 percent.
 ''There was a surprising amount of resilience outside of the housing and construction areas,'' said Mr. Kretzmer of Bank of America. ''Everywhere else, including technology equipment, was still pretty good.''
 But manufacturers have been hit hard. The Empire State Manufacturing survey, a measure of business conditions in New York State, fell in February to minus 11.7, its lowest reading since April 2003 and the first negative reading in three years. A sharp drop in orders and payrolls led the decline, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 And analysts forecast more headwinds.
 ''An increasingly constrained consumer, deepening woes for the housing sector and no desire to build inventories will all weigh on manufacturing output, which we expect to remain weak for some time,'' wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm.

HEADLINE: Today In Business

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
HOLLISTER HELPS ITS PARENT Abercrombie & Fitch said that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 9 percent on increased sales from its expanding Hollister chain that cater to teens and its stores for children. The apparel retailer said it earned $216.8 million, or $2.40 per share, for the quarter ended Feb. 2, compared with a profit of $198.2 million, or $2.14 per share, a year ago. Fourth-quarter sales rose 8 percent to $1.23 billion, from $1.14 billion. The year-ago quarter had an extra week. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected profits of $2.36 per share excluding one-time items on revenue of $1.25 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, considered to be a key indicator of a retailer's strength, were down 1 percent for the quarter. . (AP) 
 LOSS FOR MORTGAGE INSURER Radian Group, whose primary business is insuring mortgages against defaults, posted a massive loss for the fourth quarter as the nation's housing crisis continued to hurt the company's bottom line. ''2007 was indeed an extremely challenging year,'' said S.A. Ibrahim, Radian's chief executive, during a conference call with analysts. ''Market conditions have continued to deteriorate,'' he said, adding ''The housing downturn will continue to challenge us during 2008 and into 2009.'' But he also said Radian is moving to shore up its business. It increased its mortgage insurance loss reserves to $1.3 billion, since the company is on the hook to pay lenders when homeowners default. Radian also posted positive cash flow in the quarter. (AP) 
 FORECLOSURES RISE Countrywide Financial said home loan delinquencies and foreclosures rose in January as more borrowers struggled to make their mortgage payments. The nation's largest mortgage lender and servicer said loan delinquencies as a percentage of unpaid principal balance increased to 7.47 percent last month from 7.2 percent in December and 4.32 percent in January 2007. Still, the lender's average daily mortgage applications rose last month to $2.6 billion from December's $1.5 billion. Interest rates have been falling this year, and that's fueled a spike in mortgage applications industrywide, particularly as homeowners look to refinance existing loans. (AP)
 VERIZON DEAL ADVANCES
 Verizon Communications' plan to transfer phone lines to FairPoint Communications . won approval in Vermont, leaving New Hampshire as the only state yet to consent to the $2.7 billion deal. The transaction has received approval from regulators in Maine and the Federal Communications Commission, FairPoint said in a statement. To save on taxes, Verizon plans to spin off the lines as a separate business instead of selling them directly. Verizon is shedding the lines as it invests in faster-growing businesses such as television and high-speed Internet service. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 TELECOM ITALIA'S FINANCES 
 Shares in Telecom Italia. Italy's biggest phone company, fell the most in 10 months after unions said the company's chief executive told them the company is ''compromised from a financial point of view.'' The chief executive, Franco Bernabe, below, said Telecom Italia's debt is three times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, making it difficult to borrow more, according to a union leader who attended a meeting with Mr. Bernabe in Rome. 
 Telecom Italia later issued a statement denying that Mr. Bernabe ''made any reference to dividend policy, capital increases or the sustainability of debt.'' Shares of Telecom Italia fell 4.6 percent to 1.82 euros in trading in Milan, the biggest decline since April. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 LEAR CUTS BACK PRODUCTION
 Lear Corporation, the second-biggest maker of automotive seats after Johnson Controls, said in a regulatory filing that t expects restructuring-related expenses ''beyond the current year'' as customers cut back production. Lear estimated it has paid $386 million in such costs since 2005. Lear has been trimming jobs and closing factories as automakers reduce production. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 TOBACCO SMUGGLING Nearly 130 countries have taken the first steps toward a new World Health Organization treaty to combat tobacco smuggling, blamed for higher consumption and up to $50 billion in lost tax revenues each year, officials said. Many countries said the new pact should include a licensing system for suppliers and distributors. (REUTERS)

HEADLINE: In Pakistan, Islam Needs Democracy

BYLINE: By WALEED ZIAD. 
Waleed Ziad, an economic consultant, is an associate at the Truman National Security Project.

DATELINE: Islamabad, Pakistan 

 BODY:
 WHILE it's good news that secular moderates are expected to dominate Pakistan's parliamentary elections on Monday, nobody here thinks the voting will spell the end of militant extremism. Democratic leaders have a poor track record in battling militants and offer no convincing remedies. Pakistan's military will continue to manage the war against the Taliban and its Qaeda allies, while President Pervez Musharraf will remain America's primary partner. The only long-term solution may lie in the hands of an overlooked natural ally in the war on terrorism: the Pakistani people.
 This may come as a surprise to Americans, but the Wahhabist religion professed by the militants is more foreign to most Pakistanis than Karachi's 21 KFCs. This is true even of the tribal North-West Frontier Province -- after all, a 23-foot-tall Buddha that was severely damaged last fall by the Taliban there had stood serenely for a thousand years amid an orthodox Muslim population. 
 Last month I was in the village of Pakpattan observing the commemoration of the death of a Muslim Sufi saint from the Punjab -- a feast of dance, poetry, music and prayer attended by more than a million people. Religious life in Pakistan has traditionally been synonymous with the gentle spirituality of Sufi mysticism, the traditional pluralistic core of Islam. Even in remote rural areas, spiritual life centers not on doctrinaire seminaries but Sufi shrines; recreation revolves around ostentatious wedding parties and Hollywood, Bollywood and the latter's Urdu counterpart, Lollywood. 
 So when the Taliban bomb shrines and hair salons, or ban videos and music, it doesn't go down well. A resident of the Swat region, the site of many recent Taliban incursions, proudly told me last month that scores of citizens in his village had banded together to drive out encroaching militants. Similarly, in the tribal areas, many local village councils, called jirgas, have summoned the Pakistani Army or conducted independent operations against extremists. Virtually all effective negotiations between the army and militants have involved local councils; in 2006, a jirga in the town of Bara expelled two rival clerics who used their town as a battleground.
 The many militant outfits in the frontier regions are far from a unified popular movement. Rather, they are best characterized as ethnic or sectarian gangs, regularly changing names and loyalties. More often than battling the army, they engage each other in violent turf wars. For many of them -- some with only a handful of members -- ''Taliban'' is a convenient brand name that awards them the status of international resistance fighters. It is not uncommon for highway bandits to declare themselves Taliban when stealing tape decks from vehicles. 
 The Taliban franchise that has battled the army for months in the Swat Valley is held by an outfit whose founder marched thousands of local youths to their death in a campaign in Afghanistan in 2002. Upon returning, he virtually solicited his own arrest by Pakistani authorities to escape the vengeance of the victims' families. The group is now led by one ''Mullah Radio'' who, armed with an FM station, preaches that polio vaccinations are a Zionist plot and that the 2005 earthquake was retribution for a sinful existence. A worrisome crank, yes, but hardly Osama bin Laden.
 The big problem -- as verified by a poll released last month by the United States Institute of Peace -- is that while the Pakistani public condemns Talibanism, it is also opposed to the way the war on terrorism has been waged in Pakistan. People are horrified by the thousands of civilian and military casualties and the militants' retaliatory attacks in major cities. Despite promises, very little money is going toward development, education and other public services in the frontier region's hot zones. This has led to the belief that this war is for ''Busharraf'' rather than the Pakistani people.
 Naturally, Washington must continue working with Mr. Musharraf's government against extremism. But we also need a new long-term policy like the one outlined by Senator Joe Biden last fall that would strengthen our natural allies and rebuild faith in the United States at the public level. 
 This isn't just wishful thinking. Interestingly, the Musharraf era has heralded a freer press in Pakistan than ever before. Dozens of independent TV channels invariably denounce the Taliban, while educational institutions are challenging the Wahhabist ethos. My conversations with Pakistanis, from people on the street to intellectuals, artists and religious leaders, only confirmed that after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, anti-militant sentiments are at a peak. 
 This is where the lasting solution lies. As Donya Aziz, a doctor, former member of Parliament and prominent voice in the new generation of female leaders, told me: ''Even now, as the public begins to voice its anti-militancy concerns, politicians across the board are seizing the opportunity to incorporate these stands into their political platforms.'' 
 What can America do? Beyond using our influence to push the government to expand democracy and civil society, we need to develop close ties with the jirgas in the violent areas. The locals can inform us of the best ways to infuse civilian aid. (According to Ms. Aziz, ''the foremost demand of the tribal representatives had been girls' schools.'') We should also expand the United States Agency for International Development's $750 million aid and development package for the federally administered tribal areas.
 If next week's elections are free and fair, it will be an encouraging sign for Pakistan. But as far as Washington is concerned, this should constitute only the first stage of a broader policy intended to make average Pakistanis see the United States as a long-term partner. In the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake, American popularity soared as American aid helicopters -- widely called ''Angels of Mercy'' -- soared to the rescue. If we can bear in mind that our long-term interests are the same as those of average Pakistanis, the challenges of fighting the militants and rebuilding credibility may not be as daunting as they seem.

HEADLINE: Phoenix Police to Check Arrestees' Immigrant Status

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
The police in this city at the center of the immigration debate will soon ask all people arrested whether they are in the United States legally and will in certain cases report the information to the federal authorities, Mayor Phil Gordon announced on Friday. 
 People stopped for civil traffic violations like speeding will not be questioned, nor will crime victims or witnesses. 
 All those arrested on criminal charges like drunken driving and murder will be asked by officers whether they are in the United States legally.
 The police may decide to recommend checking by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
 The change includes having the police notify the immigration agency about people who are detained but not arrested who officers have ''reasonable basis'' to believe are illegal immigrants.
 A conservative legal group said the policy did not go far enough. 
 Civil rights advocates suggested that people who appeared to be Latino or spoke with accents would be more likely to be checked than others. 
 Hispanics make up 34 percent of Phoenix, the nation's fifth-largest city, with 1.5 million residents.
 At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Gordon and the four lawyers on a commission that recommended the changes tried to emphasize that the program would be closely monitored. Police officers, they said, would not become immigration agents and would not stop people at random and ask their legal status.
 ''We are doing what every city in this country should be doing but doesn't,'' Mr. Gordon said.
 He added that the policy drew ''a bright line between what should and should not be the role of the Phoenix Police Department.''
 The program departs from a policy that is more than 10 years old that bars officers from asking people about their legal status in most cases. It also sets Phoenix apart from most other big cities with large immigrant populations, including New York and Los Angeles. The police in those cities generally avoid such questions over fears that they would lead to racial profiling and discourage immigrants from cooperating with the police.
 Mr. Gordon had faced criticism that the current policy was in effect helping make Phoenix a sanctuary for illegal immigrants. The city is 200 miles from Mexico and is the largest in a state with the heaviest influx of illegal immigrants.
 An illegal immigrant killed a police officer last fall, and the police union and others stepped calls to change the policy. Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning legal group in Washington, began preparing a suit and looked into a recall of Mr. Gordon.
 Police Chief Jack F. Harris, who has been outspoken in warning of the dangers of major police involvement in immigration enforcement, said he endorsed the policy, would write regulations for it and put it into place within three months.
 Christopher J. Farrell, director of investigations with Judicial Watch, called the change a ''public relations feel-good piece'' that ''split the baby.'' The main problem, Mr. Farrell said, is that it continues to restrict officers from contacting the immigration agency, which Judicial Watch believes violates federal law.
 Antonio D. Bustamante, a member of Los Abogados, a Hispanic legal group in Phoenix, said the policy changed ''only because of xenophobia'' and people ''who hate the undocumented without understanding the huge contribution they make to the city and the economy.''

HEADLINE: Running From Despair

BYLINE: By JOE SPRING

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M. 

 BODY:
On a cold Saturday morning last month, 16-year-old Chantel Hunt ran across a highway onto a gravel road where the snow under her shoes packed into washboard ripples. She ran around a towering red rock butte, past two old mattresses dumped on the roadside, and into the shadow of a mesa she sometimes runs on top of. 
 Hunt, a high school junior and a resident of the Navajo Nation, was on a short training run for the national cross-country championships being held Saturday in San Diego. Her team, Wings of America, has risen to prominence with an unlikely collection of athletes. It is a group of American Indians from reservations around the country, and a Wings team has won a boys or a girls national title 20 times since first attending a championship meet in 1988.
 ''You say Wings of America to anyone in the running community -- it's synonymous with the best Native American runners,'' said Eric Heins, the cross-country and distance coach at Northern Arizona University, a program that has benefited from having Wings runners in recent years. 
 American Indians have especially high rates of youth suicide, Type 2 diabetes and deaths attributed to alcoholism, and extreme poverty is pervasive on many reservations. Wings of America, a 20-year-old nonprofit organization based here, has embraced the challenge.
 ''The hardest part is getting people to understand, to make the case how important it is,'' said Anne Wheelock Gonzales, the organization's former executive director who now serves as a consultant. ''One time someone said, 'Well, it's not like you're saving lives.' And I said: 'Excuse me, we are saving lives. That's exactly what this does.' ''
 Dillon Shije, another member of the Wings team who will be competing Saturday, runs 60 to 70 miles a week around Zia Pueblo, near Albuquerque. He zigzags between junipers and cactuses on trails, and he sometimes runs five miles up an arroyo. 
 ''Those are typical running trails all over the reservations,'' said Alvina Begay, 27, a former Wings runner who will compete in the United States women's Olympic marathon trials in April.
 Shije, a 16-year-old high school junior, commutes an hour each way to attend Sandia Preparatory School in Albuquerque. In the winter, when the light is short and his training regimen requires running before dawn and after dusk, Shije will run while his mother drives behind him on dirt roads with the headlights on.
 ''Sometimes I need the extra push from the car,'' he said. ''The honk.'' 
 In the Navajo Nation, where Hunt lives, many of the statistics concerning health problems are even higher than for the overall numbers for American Indians. A study in the American Journal of Public Health showed that nearly 15 percent of youths in the Navajo Nation in grades 6-12 had attempted suicide. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 40 percent of adults ages 45 and older had Type 2 diabetes, and that the rates were increasing among children. 
 ''There's this element of historical post-traumatic stress that's occurred in Indian communities,'' said Dr. Chuck North, the chief medical officer for Indian Health Services. ''The history of Native Americans in the United States is one of loss: losing land, losing language, losing culture and losing family members.''
 More than 180,000 people live on the Navajo Nation, which spreads over 27,000 square miles in Utah, New Mexico and Arizona. Unemployment hovers at about 40 percent. More than three-quarters of the 6,184 miles of roads are not paved. Roughly half the homes lack plumbing. 
 Hunt lives on reservation land about 15 miles from Navajo, N.M., in a small two-bedroom house at an elevation of about 8,000 feet. Navajo has about 2,100 residents, and 64 percent of the families are below the poverty level. Her family drives into a town called Crystal each week to fill a 1,000-gallon cistern with water. They chop and haul wood in the winter to heat their home. 
 ''We camp year-round,'' said Delores Hunt, Chantel's mother. 
 The Navajo culture centers on strong women. The Navajo believe that Father Sky and Mother Earth gave birth to Changing Woman, a deity who has the power to change her age with the seasons by walking to the horizon. When a Navajo girl comes of age and has her first period, the community celebrates with a rite of passage called the Kinaalda. For four days, the girl re-enacts the role of Changing Woman, waking up before dawn and running east, toward the sunrise. 
 The longer a girl runs, the longer she will live. 
 ''You build up your strength by running,'' said Mary Willie, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona and the coordinator of its Native American Languages and Linguistics program. ''You are also reflecting back what the Navajo people value: being responsible, being able to take care of yourself and your family, hard work and perseverance.''
 Wings holds a high school coaching clinic and about 30 youth summer camps each year. Hunt was a facilitator at one of the camps after eighth grade. 
 Hunt played traditional games with large groups of young children and talked to them about avoiding drugs and alcohol, and about eating healthy. But even with education, the ability for families to change their diets is difficult because extreme poverty and remote living conditions can make obtaining fresh food difficult. 
 ''Sometimes we go to areas and kids have never seen a fresh avocado,'' said Kelly Concho-Hayes, a consultant for Wings. ''One summer ago, a kid said, 'Tomatoes are bright red?' ''
 Many runners who go through the program end up as teachers, coaches and health professionals. This year's girls coach, Jill Jim, attends the University of Utah, where she is working toward a master's degree in public health and health care administration.
 Hunt said she started running year-round in ninth grade, ''because I decided I'd have a better chance of getting scholarships and being noticed.''
 She ran old logging roads through pines, on the packed dirt trails her grandparents herded sheep over, on game trails carved by deer, and through aspens to the top of a roughly 9,000-foot peak. 
 She said her older brother, Arvid, pushed her. They ran on clay roads past other remote homes, saving energy for sprints. 
 ''That dog on the side is the one we watch out for,'' Arvid said as he pointed at what looked like a pit bull mix. ''We save our energy so when we come through here we can do a speed workout for a half-mile.'' 
 Hunt's experience at the Wings camp was a boon to her high school cross-country team at Navajo Pine. As a freshman, she was the team's top runner, and at a meeting halfway through the season she challenged her teammates to work harder. 
 ''That transformation in the team came from the transformation in Tails,'' said Tim Host, one of Navajo Pine's coaches, referring to Hunt by her nickname.
 The team did not win the state title that year, but it did the next two. Hunt led the team each time with top-five finishes.
 In six years, Navajo Pine's two coaches, Host and Gavin Sosa, have seen the cross-country team grow to about 45 from 12, with the boys winning three consecutive state titles and the girls winning two in a row. 
 During the state finals in the two-mile her freshman year, Hunt recalled, she fell to sixth place and became frustrated. ''I just got tired, and asked myself: Why am I doing this? I don't have to,'' she said. ''And I said, No, keep going, keep going.''
 Hunt, wearing a blue uniform, passed one girl after another on the last lap. In the final 100 meters she had one girl to beat, Cassandra Sanchez from Acoma. 
 They started sprinting around the corner. ''The crowd was cheering,'' Hunt said. ''It was a head-to-head race.''
 Having watched ''Chariots of Fire'' multiple times, Hunt said, she knew what to do. ''I was pumping my arms, and I could hear Cassandra breathing,'' she said. ''And right at the end I leaned.''
 After throwing her weight forward without fear, she heard the race official say: ''Blue's got it. Blue's got it.''

HEADLINE: Religious Right May Be Fading, but Not the 'Culture Wars'

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
On every side, one can read obituaries for the religious right. 
 Jim Wallis's new book, ''The Great Awakening,'' carries the subtitle, ''Reviving Faith and Politics in a Post-Religious Right America.'' E. J. Dionne Jr.'s book, ''Souled Out,'' is subtitled ''Reclaiming Faith and Politics After the Religious Right.'' The subtitle of David P. Gushee's new book, ''The Future of Faith in American Politics,'' poses ''The Public Witness of the Evangelical Center'' against that of the religious right. 
 Sometimes stated outright and sometimes between the lines is the hope that the decline of the religious right will ease what Americans have come to know as the culture wars. 
 There is no question that many evangelical Christians and conservative Roman Catholics have grown disenchanted with both the political agenda and what they see as the strident style of the organized religious right. Some have been convinced, by their own Scriptures and by new leaders, that poverty, human rights, genocide, sex trafficking and global warming must be no less matters of Christian concern than abortion, homosexuality and embryonic stem-cell research. Even more have reacted against their faith being enlisted in partisan politics. 
 But what will this retreat of the religious right mean for the future of the culture wars? Caution is in order. Combat may wane, at least a little, at least for a while. But there are good reasons to doubt any lasting truce, let alone a real peace. 
 The culture wars, it should be remembered, predated the religious right. They began in the 1960s when the youthful counterculture and the antiwar movement were pitted against solid citizens.
 In 1969 President Richard M. Nixon appealed to the ''silent majority,'' without any explicit religious reference -- a decade before the Rev. Jerry Falwell organized the Moral Majority. In 1970 Vice President Spiro T. Agnew denounced the ''nattering nabobs of negativism'' and ''effete corps of impudent snobs'' whom he held responsible for misleading public opinion. Other Conservatives berated ''limousine liberals'' as hypocritically assisting the poor and blacks at the expense of working-class whites. 
 About the same time, the first generation of neoconservatives was constructing an elaborate theory (naturally) of the nation's cultural crisis. They drew on the literary critic Lionel Trilling's notion of an ''adversary culture'' in literature and art that had opposed bourgeois society throughout the 19th century. 
 By the 1960s, this outlook was said to have become a mass phenomenon, communicated by higher education to a ''new class'' of workers in knowledge-based sectors of the economy. The campus-spawned new class, according to the neoconservatives, was at war with the traditional business class for control of the culture. 
 Religion was only a marginal factor in this first round of the culture wars. They were fought on grounds of patriotism, support for a war overseas (Vietnam), middle-class virtues and social resentment against racial minorities and liberal elites. 
 Four decades later, issues of that sort have not disappeared as fodder for culture wars. The threat of radical Islamist terrorism, the still-distant exit from Iraq, and the cultural and economic anxieties stirred by immigration may very well replace any relaxation of the religious right's ability to mobilize voters around abortion or gay marriage. 
 But, in fact, significant cultural flash points like those over abortion rights and gay marriage have not gone away. They may be eclipsed in 2008 by national security or economic insecurity. They may be subject to compromises, as some advocates of a post-religious-right agenda hope, like proposals to cooperate on reducing the number of abortions or to settle for civil unions that are not called marriage. 
 But conflict on these issues will remain ready to flare up at the least provocation. Legislation that might bring both opponents and supporters of legal abortion together to reduce abortion has remained trapped in a spider's web of details and suspicions dividing the two groups. The next president, whether Republican or Democrat, may very well loosen President Bush's restrictions on federal financing of embryonic stem-cell research. And then there are Supreme Court appointments. 
 But there are also still deeper disagreements, as is inevitable in a pluralist society -- for example, about the sources of moral authority, about the nature of knowing and the limits of scientific rationality, about how best to live out one's sexuality, about purpose or accident in the universe. 
 In many ways, these are not directly or properly political questions, but they are nonetheless public. They are struggled over in the marketplace, the arts, the news media and popular entertainment, like sitcoms and video games. 
 There is a third reason the culture wars will not only persist but may also regain their former intensity. The leaders of the Democratic Party have done their best to counter the impression that it is hostile to religion and religious values. The potential of Senator Barack Obama's religious stance to heal the culture wars of the baby boom generations was an underlying theme of Andrew Sullivan's brief for the Illinois senator in The Atlantic in December. 
 But it is unclear how far this sensitivity goes into the ranks of the liberals and progressives who will be filling posts in executive agencies, Congressional offices and the judiciary if the Democrats win in November. The occasions for friction are legion, including decisions about financing religion-based charities, nondiscrimination legislation and regulations of many kinds. 
 After years of enduring attacks from the religious right, a few may relish the opportunity for payback. Many more may simply have little patience for religious objections and little familiarity with religious allies as they press measures they care about deeply. And not a few may be in more agreement with Christopher Hitchens's maxim that ''religion poisons everything'' than with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's or Mr. Obama's public affirmations of faith. 
 When it comes to religion and politics, the culture is at a strange conjuncture. Over the last four years, a growing stream of evangelicals, including a former president, Jimmy Carter, have published books calling for a broader, kinder, gentler religious public agenda than the religious right's. Just as the message has apparently been heard, it has encountered a counterwave of books arguing that religion is totally unfit, not merely for public life, but for personal life as well. 
 If the latter surge finds any receptive audience, it is much more likely to be among liberal Democrats than among Republicans. If a Democratic administration is not watchful, it could set off another of the overreactions to overreactions that have marred American politics.

HEADLINE: A Split-Up Of Insurers Of Bonds Considered

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Regulators and bankers racing to bolster troubled bond insurance companies are considering splitting the firms into two parts: one for safe municipal debt and the other for riskier mortgage-related securities.
 Proponents of the idea say such a step could restore confidence in the financial markets broadly, and specifically in the $2.6 trillion municipal bond market, which provides financing for bridges, airports, museums and other civic projects. But the move would be unlikely to allay the worst fears about losses in mortgage-related securities, these officials acknowledge.
 On Friday, one of the three big insurers, the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, endorsed the idea, telling New York State regulators that it wanted to start a company that would inherit insurance contracts it has written on generally safe municipal bonds totaling about $224 billion. Its guarantees on about $72 billion in mortgage-related bonds, which analysts expect to suffer higher losses, would stay in the existing insurance company. 
 ''It takes the whole thing out of the hypothetical and into reality,'' Eric R. Dinallo, the New York State insurance superintendent, said in a telephone interview. On Thursday, he and Gov. Eliot Spitzer told Congress that they were considering encouraging a split in the insurance portfolios as a last resort.
 Officials involved in negotiations on another insurer, the Ambac Financial Group, have also been discussing splitting that company's insurance subsidiary in two, according to a person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to speak about them publicly.
 If that plan goes forward, the banks involved would inject new capital into the firm that inherits the municipal business while the firm backing mortgage-related securities would keep much of the capital in the existing firm.
 But the idea of dividing the companies' insurance portfolios faces opposition from MBIA, the largest of the three insurers. Some large investment banks that have bought protection on mortgage-related securities from the insurers are also expected to oppose a split. The banks are worried that such a move would leave their insurance contracts backed by smaller and less financially stable companies that will not have a top triple-A rating.
 It is unclear how the ratings agencies -- Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings -- would react to a split and how they would rate the two resulting companies. In a statement released Friday, S.& P. voiced concern that dividing Financial Guaranty might leave some policyholders ''disadvantaged.''
 For several weeks now, Wall Street banks and the guarantors have been meeting at the urging of Mr. Dinallo, who wants the banks to inject more capital or provide loans that would forestall a downgrading of the firms' triple-A ratings. Fitch has already downgraded Ambac, and Moody's downgraded Financial Guaranty on Thursday.
 At issue is whether the guarantors have enough capital to pay out the expected future losses on the bonds they have guaranteed. Until recently many analysts thought they did, but as defaults on mortgages have surged, many, including the ratings firms, have begun to question their previous assumptions. (MBIA and Ambac officials still assert that they have enough capital to cover future losses, which they say their critics have exaggerated.)
 If the insurers lose their ratings, it would strip the implied triple-A rating from thousands of municipal bonds that carry protection from the firms, increasing the borrowing costs of cities, states and other issuers. Wall Street banks would also be forced to write down the value of mortgage securities they had protected through the guarantors.
 The banks ''are in a no-win situation,'' said Donald Light, an insurance analyst at Celent, a research firm based in Boston. ''They are going to have to salvage what they can.''
 Mr. Light said a split held some appeal for the guarantors, because it would allow them to start writing insurance policies again on municipal bonds through a new firm that presumably would have a solid triple-A rating. In recent months, the guarantors have underwritten very little new business. 
 Splitting the portfolio ''gives them a path to stay in business in their beloved and profitable original line of business of insuring municipal bonds,'' he said.
 The bond insurers declined to comment on Friday, though on Thursday, MBIA's chief financial officer, Charles E. Chaplin, vigorously defended his company at a hearing in Congress and said it did not need any help.
 If MBIA and Mr. Dinallo remain at odds over whether the company needs to do anything, the dispute could end in court, legal experts say. Mr. Dinallo has significant power as superintendent to take control of insurers if he believes there are not enough assets to pay claims by policyholders, but the company and its policyholders can fend him off if they can prove his decisions are ''arbitrary and capricious,'' said Francine L. Semaya, an insurance lawyer at the law firm of Cozen O'Connor.
 Mr. Dinallo said on Friday that the negotiations with MBIA had not progressed as far as the talks involving Ambac and Financial Guaranty. ''I feel optimistic that this Ambac consortium is doing real work -- they are engaged,'' he said. ''I am optimistic that they will come to a private-side economic solution.''
 Shares of MBIA fell 3 percent, to $12.24 on Friday, and Ambac fell 3 percent, to $10.22. Financial Guaranty is controlled by the PMI Group, the mortgage insurer, and the private equity firms Blackstone Group, Cypress Group and CIVC Partners.

HEADLINE: An Iranian Revolutionary, Dismayed but Unbowed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
 REVOLUTIONARIES know exactly what they want to tear down, but often lack the ability to predict what will come next. That was true of Ebrahim Yazdi and many of his allies in the Iranian revolution who now, three decades later, still savor the memory of the day the shah fled Iran, but struggle with the bitter reality that they have been spit out, marginalized and rejected by what it is they helped create.
 Iran celebrated the 29th anniversary of its Islamic Revolution this month, but there are many fathers of that revolution, like Mr. Yazdi, who have not been part of any official celebration.
 ''Of course this is not a monarchy, it's a republican state,'' Mr. Yazdi said during an interview in his living room, where he reflected on the government he helped to establish. ''However, the political system, basically, is a despotic one. Many basic rights and liberties are continuously being denied. Therefore, one inspiration behind the revolution, restoration of people's sovereignty, democracy and so on, hasn't been achieved -- yet.'' 
 Mr. Yazdi was an adviser to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the moving force behind the ouster of the shah, the larger-than-life cleric who forged a nation that sought to merge religious governance and republican ideals. Mr. Yazdi was the first deputy prime minister and the first foreign minister.
 Today he is 76 years old, the leader of an illegal, if tolerated, party that has virtually no influence in Iranian affairs. He tried to run for president in 2005, but was disqualified and barred from the ballot.
 Mr. Yazdi has white hair now, a white beard, and a face softened by time, barely resembling the tight, stern young man who strode beside Ayatollah Khomeini in the early days of the revolution. He has a nice house in a nice section of Tehran, with crystal chandeliers in the living room, a large collection of parakeets that sing all day, a study lined with books and old photographs -- and time, a lot of time.
 MR. YAZDI opposed the student takeover of the United States Embassy in 1979, but that is not to say he was pro-American. He was a critic of Washington's policies toward Iran, and an enemy of Zionism. But he wanted a normal state, one recognized by the international community, not a pariah, isolated and radicalized. He says he knew that taking diplomats hostage would lead to the kind of Iranian state that exists today, one that continues to reward the most radical ideas.
 Unexpectedly, Mr. Yazdi finds himself today aligned with some of those hostage takers, like Abbas Abdi, who, like Mr. Yazdi, now want to reform the system, and, like Mr. Yazdi, have been marginalized for their views.
 ''We thought we knew a lot of things back then,'' Mr. Abdi said. ''Everything was simplified. We thought, if only the shah goes, everything will be solved and finished. But the revolution was right, there was no alternative, no solution.''
 Mr. Yazdi says he is a fundamentalist, but what he means is that he is a Muslim intellectual, traditional in his adherence to ritual and teachings. But he is a staunch democrat who defines democracy not by the mechanics of governance, not by elections and institutions, but by ideas.
 ''We recognize tolerance as a basic component of democracy,'' he said. ''God has not created all of us alike -- we are different -- human society is a pluralistic society. In the Koran, God is telling us that man is created to be free. So we are free to think, and think different. So the aim of democracy is to recognize the pluralistic nature of human society. The second item is tolerance, I have to tolerate my opponent. With tolerance comes compromise; without compromise democracy doesn't exist.''
 But, Mr. Yazdi says that those who took over, those whose voices are loudest among Muslims these days, not just in Iran but around the region (and, he said, in Washington, too), are those who condemn diversity, and demand allegiance to one view. In Iran, he says, those he sees as having hijacked his revolution are the traditionalists, the people like President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who he says want to rule as religious leaders did centuries ago.
 ''The simplistic perception of the state was that there is a leader, chosen by God, a divine person, so they were expecting that the system would work as it was working centuries ago,'' Mr. Yazdi said. ''They have succeeded. They have a leader, and he can do everything. And yet the problems are still here.''
 Mr. Yazdi turned to radical politics after the United States and Britain helped stage a coup in 1953, deposing the democratically elected government of Mohammed Mossadegh, a nationalist who opposed foreign control of Iranian affairs, and installed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
 Mr. Yazdi joined an underground organization opposed to the shah but in 1960 traveled to the United States to study. He remained there -- mostly in Houston -- until 1979, when he returned with Ayatollah Khomeini. After earning a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Tehran University, Mr. Yazdi did postdoctoral work in molecular genetics at Baylor University in Houston before joining its medical school faculty.
 IT is hard to reconcile the American-trained scientist, fluent in English, comfortable in Houston, with the images now available on YouTube, old washed-out pictures of a young revolutionary. In one, Mr. Yazdi, Ayatollah Khomeini and Yasir Arafat are shown taking over the Israeli Embassy in Tehran. Mr. Yazdi held Mr. Arafat's hand as they faced a sea of cheering men and women. 
 ''The story of the Iranian revolution is similar to the story of other revolutions,'' he said. ''It was a restoration of people's rights and liberties -- people rose against the tyrannical regime of the shah.''
 ''The day after the revolution, Khomeini was facing the question: What is an Islamic republic?'' Mr. Yazdi recalled. ''I was in favor of a constitution and elections. They were against it. Khomeini was oscillating, but gradually he turned to the conservative side.''
 Nevertheless, Mr. Yazdi remains an optimist. He says he sees more traditional thinkers taking an increasingly pragmatic view. He says that Iranian society is maturing, moving through a difficult stage on its way to constitutional democracy. Economic hardships now, he says he believes, are the sign many traditionalists need to accept changes. 
 ''Iran is learning democracy,'' he said, ''because democracy is a learning process. Nobody will learn in a classroom. Democracy is not a commodity to be imported. America doesn't carry democracy in its soldiers' rucksacks. Democracy should come from within, through our own challenges and experiences.''
 ''Trial and error,'' he said, of the people running the state now. ''They have to do it by themselves, just to learn what they are doing doesn't work. There is no other way.''

HEADLINE: Hardball With Warren and Eliot

DATELINE: States and localities 

 BODY:
including New York State and New York City -- took a hit from the credit crunch this week. And in separate yet complementary ways, the investor Warren Buffett and New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer struck back.
 With major bond insurers hobbled by an ill-advised foray into subprime mortgage territory, Mr. Buffett made a tough offer aimed at the biggest and healthiest chunk of their ailing business. The insurers either turned Mr. Buffett down or haven't responded, which puts the onus on them to devise their own rescue plan. Mr. Spitzer on Thursday gave the insurers five more days to do just that. If they fail, they face a potential breakup by New York State's insurance regulator.
 In the past week, hundreds of routine Wall Street auctions failed to attract enough buyers for debt securities issued by states, hospitals, cultural institutions, student loan authorities and port authorities, among them the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
 Investors were not worried about the creditworthiness of the issuers, but about the reliability of the bond insurers that guarantee payment in the event of default. Municipalities and tax exempt organizations have very low default risk. But the biggest insurers, MBIA and the Ambac Financial Group, have unwisely insured securities linked to toxic subprime mortgages. 
 Those guarantees now threaten to cost the insurers their sterling credit ratings; one, the FGIC Corporation, the fourth-largest, was downgraded on Thursday. And the turmoil has caused investors to shun all of the securities they have insured. The auction failures, in turn, have forced the issuers to pay sharply higher rates on their borrowings. The situation could get considerably worse if the other insurers have their credit ratings downgraded. The insurers would be crippled. Banks and Wall Street firms could face tens of billions of dollars in additional write-downs on their insured subprime holdings because when an insurer weakens, so does the value of the securities they insure. 
 Even worse, a downgrade of the insurers would likely raise the cost of borrowing for states and municipalities because they rely on insurance to raise their securities' appeal. Since state and local spending is a big driver of economic activity, that would create yet another drag on the faltering economy. And it could mean cuts in services, which, in turn, would expose even more Americans who had no role in creating the subprime crisis to its debilitating spillover. 
 For several weeks, the New York State insurance superintendent, Eric Dinallo, has tried to persuade insurers, their major shareholders, banks and other government officials and industry players to come up with a rescue plan, say, by getting the banks to bail out the insurers in exchange for stakes in the companies.
 Then, earlier this week, Mr. Buffett offered to provide backstop insurance for $800 billion of municipal bonds insured by the troubled companies, for a hefty fee. His proposal would essentially split the bond insurers' profitable municipal business from the money-losing subprime business. They were loath to do that, but unless they come up with a better plan, a potential breakup along those lines by New York State regulators could be in store. Municipalities and tax-exempt institutions that need to borrow money -- and the investors in those securities -- cannot be allowed to suffer from problems caused by others.
 The pressure Mr. Spitzer has applied is needed. For its part, the Bush administration's main approach to the subprime mess -- to merely cajole the private sector to act in the public interest -- is not working.

HEADLINE: Political Heir Is Less Rosy Than Putin on the State of Russia

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The presumptive successor to President Vladimir V. Putin presented his platform for seeking Russia's highest office on Friday, giving a speech before business leaders in Siberia in which he vowed to continue Russia's economic revival, but also struck markedly liberal notes.
 The speech by the candidate, First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, was a contrast to the public appearance only a day before by Mr. Putin, his sponsor. Mr. Putin was confrontational and sometimes caustic in what the Kremlin had billed as his final news conference as president. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Putin had sharply criticized the West and the United States, threatened to aim strategic missiles at Europe and said Russia would continue to develop its own, state-centered brand of democracy without instruction from outside.
 Mr. Medvedev, speaking in Krasnoyarsk, a city near Russia's geographic center, spoke in softer tones, addressing Russia's middle class and small-business owners and embracing themes more often heard in the West. 
 ''Freedom is better than nonfreedom,'' he said in his opening remarks, according to a transcript provided by his campaign. ''These words are the quintessence of human experience.''
 Mr. Medvedev, the 42-year-old protege of Mr. Putin, then elaborated. ''The talk here is about freedom in all of its manifestations: about personal freedom, about economic freedom and at last about freedom of self-expression,'' he said. He added, ''Freedom is inseparable from the actual recognition of the power of law by citizens.''
 He is the all-but-unchallenged front-runner in the presidential election set for March 2. He seems certain to inherit the formal reins of power from a president who, his critics say, has extinguished many elements of personal and political freedom in Russia and rolled others back. 
 Mr. Medvedev faces three weak candidates who critics of the Kremlin say have been allowed to run by Mr. Putin only to create the appearance of a contest. 
 The declarations about the universal values of freedom immediately raised eyebrows among analysts and diplomats in the West. 
 But Mr. Medvedev pressed on, issuing an implicit and broad indictment of Russia's current state of civic affairs. He moved past the economic and political successes of Mr. Putin's eight years in power and focused on the country's deep and enduring problems. 
 The courts, he said, are riddled with corruption, the state bureaucracy is weighted by indifference, predatory officials and bloat, and Russia's business climate has been smothered.
 Some of Mr. Medvedev's assessment echoed statements by Mr. Putin, including his denunciation of official corruption. But his picture of the society and government veered from the rosier account provided by Mr. Putin. 
 Mr. Putin had said, coolly and directly, that his administration had had no major failures during his two terms.
 Western diplomats suggested that Mr. Medvedev's speech should not be taken entirely at face value. 
 Under Russia's Constitution, Mr. Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term. Mr. Medvedev is Mr. Putin's personally selected successor, and Mr. Putin has said that he will serve as prime minister and plans to wield power and to influence Russia's course for years to come.
 ''Medvedev in this speech and in previous speeches has been enunciating liberal themes, and that's encouraging,'' said Cliff Kupchan, a director at the Eurasia Group, a global risk consulting firm based in Washington and New York. 
 ''But we have to remember that this entire campaign is being run by Putin, and Putinism, broadly meaning a large state role in the economy and an assertive foreign policy, is not going to change soon, because Putin is not going to leave the scene.''
 But Mr. Medvedev's speech also seemed tuned to the ears of Russia's expanding consumer class, which has seen its purchasing power and standard of living rise during the oil-and-gas boom that has buoyed Mr. Putin's years in power, but has seen its political rights decline and still faced an ossified bureaucracy. 
 He said as well that ''our schools would have the opportunity not to have one computer for 20 students,'' but Internet access at every desk.
 And he warned, with candor, that the boom in Moscow and other population centers had not reached many Russians -- a theme Mr. Putin has also noted. 
 Mr. Medvedev, like his sponsor, outlined a need for more attention to social programs and health care. ''Part of the population is practically still socially comatose,'' he said. ''They see neither opportunities nor prospects of improvement of their living standards. Hence, the drunkenness and a still very high level of suicide.''
 A senior American diplomat noted that Mr. Putin, early in his presidency, had pledged to make the country more democratic and to fulfill a broad social agenda. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity as part of diplomatic protocol, said it was much too soon to know whether Mr. Medvedev would have the power as president to choose his own course, much less to realize the goals stated in his speech.

HEADLINE: Prosecutors in Germany Expand Tax Evasion Inquiry

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
German prosecutors said on Friday that they were investigating several hundred people on suspicion of tax evasion in a case that quickly claimed the job of Klaus Zumwinkel, the chief executive of Deutsche Post.
 The investigation has rapidly become an embarrassment for the country's moneyed elite and is feeding a simmering debate over economic justice.
 A day after the police searched the home and office of Mr. Zumwinkel, a special financial crimes unit in the northwestern city of Bochum said that it had obtained highly conclusive evidence of tax evasion on a much wider scale. 
 Little has been disclosed about the suspects in the case, though German officials made clear that they expected at least some household names to pop up. Torsten Albig, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry, said that the investigation included wealthy and accomplished Germans who were ''known and unknown'' to the wider world.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin: ''I think I feel the same way that many people feel in Germany. This is beyond what I could have imagined and what many people could have imagined.''
 The prosecutors said that their evidence concerned the investments of hundreds of people, particularly in foundations in Liechtenstein, that appear to have been created solely to evade taxes.
 Leaving no doubt as to the magnitude of what they called a nationwide investigation, the Bochum authorities said that they had called in reinforcements from agencies in three other cities as well as state investigators from Dusseldorf.
 The German authorities said that they had strong evidence that would lead to prosecutions. Senior German officials noted that the law looks favorably on people who confess, often allowing them to escape with a fine rather than a prison sentence. The prosecutors' tactics included a raid Thursday accompanied by television crews.
 ''This has a new quality for us in Germany,'' said Rudolf Schwenger, a former tax investigator in Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt. ''Normally we associated investigators arriving with TV cameras with the United States, not this country.''
 Mr. Zumwinkel, the first target of the investigation, said late Thursday that he would remain in his position but he immediately faced a ferocious political reaction. By Friday afternoon, he announced that he would resign as chief executive of Deutsche Post, which operates the German mail system, and chairman of its majority-owned banking subsidiary, Postbank. The company is also the parent of DHL, the package delivery service.
 Deutsche Post, though listed on the Frankfurt exchange, is still 31 percent owned by the German federal government, and senior German officials made clear Friday that they would use that leverage to force Mr. Zumwinkel out. He also serves as chairman of Deutsche Telekom, a position he is widely expected to quit as well.
 Mr. Zumwinkel had been expected to step down this year after 18 years on the job, and he had already begun grooming a successor, Frank Appel, who heads Deutsche Post Logistics.
 Mr. Zumwinkel told the newspaper Bild that he would take an ''active role in clarifying the questions about my private finances.'' He added: ''I wanted to usher in a new era, but with a different changeover than has happened now.''
 Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck said the example of a senior executive's being accused of not paying his fair share of taxes -- and not immediately stepping down -- was sure to provoke widespread outrage.
 ''What should the taxpayer believe?'' he said in an interview with the German broadcaster N24. ''He pays his taxes dutifully, and the big guys cash in?''
 Despite the reputation of Germans as law-abiding, tax evasion is widely thought to be rampant among the wealthy, who have a selection of tax havens -- notably Luxembourg, Switzerland and Liechtenstein -- at their doorstep.
 Using a Liechtenstein foundation is a tactic well known to German prosecutors, though one notoriously difficult to unravel from the outside. Liechtenstein's law imposes only light taxes and allows foundations to pay proceeds from their investments to owners and their family members. The money is usually then routed to other bank accounts outside Germany.
 ''It depends on keeping this quiet from the tax authorities in Germany,'' Mr. Schwenger, the former tax investigator, said.

HEADLINE: Rising Prices and Buffett Stake Bolster Food Company Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Food company shares regained a bit of their luster on Friday when several showed they could keep customers while raising prices, and Warren E. Buffett disclosed an 8.6 percent stake in the largest company in the sector. 
 On Friday, the ketchup maker H. J. Heinz Company forecast quarterly profit above expectations and Hormel Foods posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Both benefited from price increases that helped offset rising commodity costs, though lower pork prices also aided Hormel.
 Even Campbell Soup Company, which missed analysts' estimates for its fiscal second quarter, reported on Friday that its domestic soup business had improved and that it should benefit from price increases it took this month.
 Friday's reports came a day after Mr. Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had taken an 8.6 percent stake in Kraft Foods, making it the largest shareholder.
 ''I think there's a bit of a halo effect that comes with any announcement of Buffett taking a position in any security and how it ripples through the sector,'' said Matthew P. Kaufler, portfolio manager at Clover Capital Management. Clover owns 670,596 Kraft shares and 364,576 Heinz shares.
 The Standard & Poor's packaged foods index rose more than 3 percent on Friday, to its highest level in almost a month.
 Food stocks are traditionally considered defensive plays when the economy slows, since people always need to eat. The shares, however, had been battered over the last two months by soaring prices for wheat, cocoa and other commodities. Adding to those cost pressures was concern that consumers in the United States would begin to balk at the price increases being used to offset some commodities' costs.
 ''We clearly know that we need to try to continue to advance pricing to try to keep up with these cost increases,'' Jeffrey M. Ettinger, Hormel's chief executive, said. He said that the company has not seen consumers balking at the prices in grocery stores, but added that its food service business was enountering some softness as consumers eat out less often.
 Hormel said profit rose to $88.2 million, or 64 cents a share, in the first quarter ended on Jan. 27, from $75.3 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier, on an 8 percent sales increase.
 Analysts on average forecast 58 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Campbell profit fell to $274 million, or 71 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 27, from $285 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier, despite a 7 percent increase in sales.
 Heinz said it expected a profit of 67 cents to 68 cents a share in the third quarter ending Jan. 30. Analysts on average were expecting 63 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Hormel shares rose 3.9 percent, Heinz shares rose 5.2 percent, Campbell rose 6.1 percent and Kraft was up 6.9 percent.

HEADLINE: The Workplace as Clubhouse

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
BOEING is known around the world for building jetliners, but in Washington State, it also has a reputation for turning out top winemakers.
 At least a dozen wineries in Washington have been started by current and former employees who honed their skills as members of the Boeing Employees Wine and Beer Makers Club in Washington. Others have used the club as a springboard to jobs at wineries.
 Giving its employees the space to store grapes for wine might be a tough sell to investors. But the company considers it an integral part of building and maintaining a quality workplace -- as long as employees do it on their own time. 
 ''We believe that Boeing should be concerned with its community and encourage employees to find excellence in all they do at work and at play,'' a company spokesman, Bob Jorgensen, said. ''It's just good business.''
 Fat paychecks, pensions and health insurance are not enough to recruit and keep employees these days. Companies are again finding that adding a bit of social context to work is crucial to keeping employees happy and productive. That is where employee clubs come in. Workplace specialists say clubs are a way to build camaraderie and help people get to know fellow employees away from work. Companies benefit, too. Clubs help create loyal employees, reduce turnover and improve morale while costing very little.
 ''Companies are trying to differentiate themselves from the competition for talent. They're providing a social network that transcends a paycheck,'' said Steve Gross, global leader of broad-based performance and rewards consulting at Mercer in Philadelphia.
 It is hard to pin down how widespread employee clubs are. Many are small and highly informal like a softball or basketball league or require little from the company other than the use of a meeting place, server space and office supplies. 
 Sometimes clubs get a small stipend from the company. Google, for example, backs everything from jugglers to ultimate Frisbee to gay employee clubs.
 The clubs are getting added attention because they can help reduce turnover.
 A business cannot afford to lose an employee when it takes eight months and three times the salary to find and train a replacement, said Jeffrey Pfeiffer, professor for organizational behavior in the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
 Twenty years ago, most companies tied high morale to accomplishments on the job. Today, managers realize they need to think more broadly about what makes workers happy.
 A Towers Perrin survey released last October reported that operating margins rose nearly 4 percent over three years among companies where employees felt supported and involved.At workplaces where that was not the case, profits fell 2 percent.
 The SAS Institute, a business software maker in Cary, N.C., has taken that to heart. The company has one of the lowest turnover rates in the software industry, largely because of its strong company culture and benefits, like unlimited sick leave, on-site day care and medical clinics. Where most technology companies lose 15 percent to 20 percent of their employees every year, SAS loses 4 percent, said Jeff Chambers, vice president for human resources. 
 John Shafeei, a software developer, has stayed at SAS for 13 years because of the benefits and company-sponsored clubs. (SAS gives each club an annual stipend of $3,000.) He has improved his speaking skills with the Toastmasters club, saved time by going to the company's on-site medical clinic and built up his leadership skills with an immigrant club he helped form. 
 ''It's helped me to create that great connection with other employees,'' said Mr. Shafeei, an Iranian immigrant. ''We're not competitors, but friends.''
 Still, perks can be impermanent. During the technology boom in the 1990s, companies piled on the benefits to attract talent and then promptly got rid of them when the economy soured. Many companies, whether they are battling bankruptcy or are flush with cash, have rolled back benefits, eliminated pensions and increased health care premiums to reduce expenses. Any nonessential perk, like an employee club, is also fair game.
 ''If they ever existed, the first thing that goes is the frilly, frilly stuff,'' said Kris Dunn, vice president for human resources at SourceMedical, a Birmingham, Ala., software company, and author of the blog The HR Capitalist.
 Boeing supports 100 clubs at its seven offices nationwide, from rubber stamp collecting to square dancing, because it creates camaraderie and helps employees make friends. Any Boeing employee, retiree or spouse can join one.
 The Boeing wine and beer making club, which counts flight test engineers, graphic artists and technical designers among its 140 members, started more than 30 years ago as a wine tasting group. It later morphed into a group for making beer and wine. Employees buy grapes from vineyards, store them on the company dime at a Boeing-owned recreation center and then crush the grapes, but ferment them at home. All that help has turned into thousands of bottles of employee-owned cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, syrah and cabernet franc over the years.
 ''People ask us all the time, can we join? But I always tell them, you have to work at Boeing to be a member,'' said Brad Sherman, the club's vice president for wine.

HEADLINE: Bush Proposes Linking the Medicare Drug Premium to Beneficiaries' Income

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush proposed legislation on Friday to increase prescription drug premiums for higher-income Medicare beneficiaries. 
 The proposal, which the administration said would generate $3.2 billion of additional revenue for Medicare over five years, was part of a broader package that is intended to rein in Medicare costs while advancing the Republican vision of a larger private role in the health care system.
 The Democratic-controlled Congress is unlikely to approve Mr. Bush's legislation. Indeed, though the 2003 Medicare law requires the lawmakers to consider it on a speedy timetable, that law does not guarantee even a vote on the package. 
 But Republican supporters will be able to force Congress to debate the ideas. With Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund expected to run out of money in 11 years, Democrats acknowledge that Congress and the nation will eventually need to consider such proposals.
 Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said the legislation would allow ''a fundamental transformation of the way Medicare works.''
 ''Currently, Medicare is a price-setting system in which the government makes decisions about who is covered and how much is paid,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''We have a better option, to provide beneficiaries with reliable information about the cost and quality of their care. When given that kind of information, we know that consumers will make decisions that drive costs down and the quality up.''
 The bill would require the secretary to provide price and cost information to Medicare beneficiaries to help them select treatment options and choose among doctors, hospitals and health plans.
 Under the proposal, the federal government would have to ''release to the public physician-specific measurements of the quality or efficiency'' of doctors. 
 Doctors have been working with the government to develop such measures, but many doctors fear that the government will use the data simply to reward the lowest-cost providers.
 As for the prescription drug proposal, it would create an income-linked system of premiums similar to the one already in effect in Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and outpatient services. Prescription drug premiums would increase for any individual with income over $82,000 and any couple with income exceeding $164,000. Premiums would more than triple for many individuals with incomes over $205,000 and for many couples with incomes over $410,000.
 While premiums vary by plan, the monthly premium for standard drug coverage, as defined by law, is about $28 this year.
 Initially, fewer than 5 percent of people with Medicare drug coverage would have to pay the higher premiums. But this proportion would grow because the income thresholds would remain the same, with no allowance for inflation. 
 The president's package does not include proposals to cut payments to hospitals or other health care providers, which could have touched off a furor in this election year.
 Reaction to the proposed legislation was mixed.
 Robert D. Reischauer, a Medicare expert who is president of the Urban Institute, said: ''The president's proposal is pretty thin gruel, compared with what many had expected. It's not likely to change the long-run trajectory of Medicare spending.''
 Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the House Republican whip, said: ''Without substantial reforms, Medicare will not be able to meet the basic needs of tomorrow's seniors. The legislation put forth by the president is the needed first step to help give this program a solid economic footing.''
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said the president was offering ''common sense solutions'' to Medicare's looming financial crisis. ''Most important,'' he said, ''this plan does not include any benefit cuts that could limit seniors' access to health care.''
 Representative Pete Stark of California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said it was hypocritical of Mr. Bush to try to increase some premiums while not proposing any cuts in ''overpayments to private insurance companies'' that manage care for nearly nine million beneficiaries.
 Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was ''glad the president is not pursuing the draconian cuts to Medicare originally in the White House's budget'' for 2009. 
 The idea of linking premiums to a person's income is, in some ways, ''an attractive option,'' Mr. Baucus said. But he added, ''It's a major change that should be considered only in a broader review of the benefit.'' 
 Under the 2003 Medicare law, the president was required to submit legislation to Congress because of a widening gap between total Medicare spending and revenues dedicated to the program, like payroll taxes.

HEADLINE: The Mittification of McCain

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
As Mitt Romney said this week when he endorsed John McCain, the campaign might have been rough but ''we always had good laughs together.'' As examples of this hitherto-unnoticed good fellowship, Mitt pointed cheerily to the fact that he and McCain had shaken hands before the debates and ''said hi to each others' wives.''
 Getting along with people you loathe is part of the business of politics, and nobody is blaming McCain for buddying up to the man he virtually accused of aiding and abetting Al Qaeda during the Florida primary. Although when you've said that somebody's campaign was ''based on a wholesale deception of voters,'' calling it a ''hard, intensive, fine, honorable'' effort is perhaps one adjective too many. 
 It's not as if McCain has been caving in on anything important, like economic recovery ...
 (Feb. 6: The Senate votes on a Democratic economic stimulus plan, which would give more help to the unemployed, veterans and senior citizens than the version President Bush wants. Forced to choose between Bush and the unemployed/veterans/elderly, McCain flew back to Washington and -- skipped the vote.)
 Or torture ...
 (Feb. 13: The Senate considers a bill, vehemently opposed by the White House, which would prohibit C.I.A. interrogators from using tactics like waterboarding on detainees. McCain, whose ringing denunciation of waterboarding was the highlight of the Republican debates, votes -- no. He says his own Detainee Treatment Act already bans use of physical force during interrogations. This would be the law that Bush, in one of his famous signing statements, said the president did not have to follow.)
 Perhaps all this is just a momentary lapse, caused by McCain's need to keep a lid on the Republican right while Mike Huckabee is still in the race. True, Huckabee appears to be hopelessly, impossibly, behind. However, his consultants are said to be working on a new and promising strategy that involves triggering an earthquake along the San Andreas fault, causing the West Coast to sink into the sea, dramatically reducing McCain's current delegate count.
 McCain's inconsistency is actually nothing new. We saw a lot of it during the Bush tax debates. McCain opposed the tax cuts as unwise and unfair, and then opposed getting rid of them under the theory that it would be a shock to the upper-income people who benefited from them and never noticed they were scheduled to expire. McCain seems to have developed a kind of right-to-life theory of economics under which any tax cut that comes into being has to remain on the books for all eternity.
 The senator from Arizona is clearly unhappy about the possibility of having to run against Barack Obama, who he has disliked ever since Obama had the temerity to present himself as a campaign finance reformer without McCain's permission. And the fact that the 46-year-old Obama keeps referring to the 71-year-old McCain as a military hero, in tones that suggest the conflict in question was the Spanish Civil War, doesn't help.
 If McCain wants to retaliate, he might consider this week's hearings of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which called into question the entire basis of Obama's candidacy.
 You may remember that the committee, in its unrelenting pursuit of government reform, has been devoting its time to the critical issue of whether or not Roger Clemens took steroids. After all the questioning was over, the Democrats felt Clemens was a liar and the committee chairman called Brian McNamee, his weaselly ex-trainer, ''very credible.'' Meanwhile, the Republicans on the committee said McNamee was an unreliable drug dealer and their leader suggested Clemens was the victim of a ''lynching.''
 Now Obama's big selling point is his promise to get rid of mindless partisanship on heavy issues like health care. His signature pledge is to put the health care negotiations on C-Span so the lawmakers would feel that they're under public scrutiny and thus be compelled to work together for the common good.
 Do you wonder if this is really going to work when the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was posturing for network news and still couldn't even agree on whether Roger Clemens is a jerk?
 I'm just asking. 
 Correction: Thursday's column underestimated the number of caucusgoers in the state of Washington. While the Republicans are still counting, the Democrats estimated 244,458 attendees at their caucuses. That amounts to more than 7 percent of the state's registered voters.

HEADLINE: Reforming the Mining Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 There are good reasons to support reform of the General Mining Law of 1872, but ''The Power to Say No'' (editorial, Feb. 14) doesn't identify them. 
 We support reform measures that would achieve a fair return to the public, generate funds to clean up abandoned mine lands, and provide the legal and regulatory certainty needed to attract investment in domestic mineral projects.
 The increase in uranium mining claims you cite simply reflects the increased demand for fuels vital to the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States. 
 The reforms we support in the mining law would enable the United States to provide more metals and minerals, such as uranium, that are needed for our growing economy. 
 Absent mining law reform, the United States is destined to become increasingly reliant for its minerals and metals on foreign countries that may have little, if any, of the environmental protections we enjoy.

HEADLINE: Indian Point: Safety Must Come First

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Close Indian Point? It Could Be Costly'' (Westchester and the Region, Feb. 10) describes a study that paints an overly pessimistic picture of the economic and energy impact of closing the Indian Point nuclear facility. The study's outcome is not surprising, considering that the facility's managing company, Entergy, is a member of one of the sponsoring organizations. 
 In June 2006, the National Academy of Sciences completed its study, ''Alternatives to the Indian Point Energy Center for Meeting New York Electric Power Needs.'' The study concluded that Indian Point could be closed without compromising reliability and with modest impact on energy cost. 
 Meeting our energy needs in the long term will require alternative energy research and production, conservation, and improvements in New York's power infrastructure. We can and should meet this challenge. 
 For the 20 million people who live within a 50-mile radius of the plant, Indian Point is a public safety concern. Entergy has failed to adhere to established safety standards, for which it has been fined and cited numerous times. 
 No amount of energy capacity could outweigh the risk that a poorly managed nuclear facility poses to our region.

HEADLINE: A Delicate Market

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
KIRK HENCKELS, the bow-tie-wearing broker serving the rich and would-be rich on the Upper East Side, offered a sobering thought in his latest report on the luxury Manhattan market.
 ''It is a remarkably precarious time to be writing an analysis of the Manhattan luxury real estate market, '' he wrote.
 On the one hand, 2007 was a year of record prices and they show no sign of abating in 2008; on the other, there were fears that recession, the mortgage mess and falling prices in the rest of the country would dampen the Manhattan market. Rarely, he said, has there been such a clear-cut division in the economy between ''that was then'' and ''this is now.'' 
 But brokers can rarely shake their optimism for long, and the report prepared by Mr. Henckels, the director of the private brokerage division at Stribling & Associates, noted in glittering detail apartments and houses that sold for $20 million or more in 2007 and beyond. While there may be thoughts of a downturn, there is the reality of a shrinking inventory of trophy apartments, he said. ''There is a shortage of unaffordable housing,'' he said in an interview. ''The inexorable march of money goes on, at least for now.''
 Mr. Henckels found that so far this year, 13 co-ops worth $20 million or more had closed or were in contract, compared with only 11 completed sales in that price range for all of last year. 
 After excluding co-op conversions, he found only six prewar co-ops available for $20 million or more. The list includes the $70 million tower apartment atop the Pierre Hotel, at Fifth Avenue and 61st Street, on the market for more than two years.
 Some would-be buyers have a bleaker view of the market. Daniel Alpert, the managing director of Westwood Capital, which specializes in real estate investment banking, sold his Manhattan co-op and hasn't bought anything since. 
 Mr. Alpert argues that the disparity between the cost to rent an apartment in Manhattan and the cost to buy and maintain one is too high and cannot continue forever. He worries that a tightening of mortgage standards and future job cuts on Wall Street will drive away buyers of $1 million to $3 million apartments and eventually cause prices to sag across the market.
 But many recent buyers of the most expensive apartments have been bankers and hedge fund managers. 
 Records filed last week show that Raymond C. Mikulich, until recently a managing director of Lehman Brothers and a head of its real estate private equity group, paid $17.9 million for a four-bedroom apartment earlier this month at 15 Central Park West.
 In January, Ronald N. Beck, a managing director and portfolio manager at Oaktree Capital Management, a hedge fund, paid $19 million for a duplex penthouse with two 43-foot-wide terraces at the Beresford, at Central Park West and 81st Street. It was one of four rarely sold penthouses atop one of the most celebrated buildings on Central Park West.
 The seller was Nari Hira, an Indian magazine mogul and movie producer, who created a leading Bollywood news and gossip magazine, Stardust. The listing, with Maria and Joanna Pashby of the Corcoran Group, started out at $28 million last June.
 Among co-ops, condos and town houses that sold for $5 million or more last year, average prices rose, according to Mr. Henckels's report. For the $5 million co-ops alone, however, the total value sold -- $1.29 billion -- fell 6.5 percent from the year before. He ascribed the decline to a shortage of inventory.

A Farewell to Paper?
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Pushing Paper Out the Door'' (Metrics, Feb. 10), which described how homes could now essentially function with little if any paper: 
 It is depressing to contemplate the look of the paperless home as depicted: The bookshelves are empty. No newspaper or magazine lies on the coffee table. Is the ''electronic bartender'' with 500 drink recipes the last link with civilization? 
 Give me an office with dog-eared books of a lifetime, sheet music on the piano by the window, old maps and older paintings on the wall, a stack of books and journals next to my comfortable couch -- and a computer, scanner, printer, digital camera, boxes of hard drives, and the rest of the paperless universe in the corner where they belong.
 Harm de Blij
 Boca Grande, Fla., Feb. 11
 The writer is a professor of geography at Michigan State University in East Lansing.
 To the Editor: 
 The article provided an excellent look on the move to digitization, but the elephant in the room is a compatibility conundrum that has been with us since days of the first computer. 
 Books printed hundreds of years ago are accessible without any special equipment. Contrast this with millions of files on obsolete diskettes and tape cartridges. 
 One might presume that the technology revolution of the late 20th century has increased our ability to preserve our history and cultural artifacts. In actuality, we have failed. 
 Moving all of our papers to digital form without a plan to ensure accessibility not only five years from now but also 100 years and beyond is not making information more accessible but risking that it will become less accessible. Jonathan B. Spira

HEADLINE: The Forensic Humanitarian

BYLINE: By JIM GILES. 
Jim Giles is a freelance writer who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
International human rights work attracts activists and lawyers, diplomats and retired politicians. One of the most admired figures in the field, however, is a ponytailed statistics guru from Silicon Valley named Patrick Ball, who has spent nearly two decades fashioning a career for himself at the intersection of mathematics and murder. You could call him a forensic humanitarian.
 To understand Ball's accomplishments, you might start with the problem of counting rattlesnakes. For some time, a retired biology professor from Skidmore College named William Brown has gone hiking in the Adirondacks every summer with the aim of surveying timber rattlesnakes. When Brown finds a rattlesnake, he flips the animal over and checks its underside. If it's one he hasn't seen before, he'll mark it by removing a rectangle of skin from its underbelly. Each new snake is added to a list and returned to the wild. It is a good start. But to help guide conservation efforts, Brown needs a more complete census. To compile that, he has to answer an odd question: how many snakes has he not counted? 
 A statistical sleight of hand provides the answer. If the snake population is large, Brown will rarely see the same one twice. But if he catches the same animals repeatedly, chances are he is plucking them from a small group. Brown records the numbers of different snakes he finds and the frequency with which the same animals reappear. Plug those figures into the appropriate formula and out comes an estimate of the number of snakes he has missed.
 In other words, it's not just what you've counted that matters, but what you haven't counted, and there are ways to count what you haven't counted. Biologists have fine-tuned the implications of this point. But, at least in the field of human rights, Ball has made it his own. In the trial of Slobodan Milosevic, for instance, international prosecutors made use of the death tolls Ball had put together by comparing records from exhumations, human rights reports and other sources. When Ball and colleagues took on another project, a study of the violence that gripped Peru during the 1980s and 1990s, they started with a Truth and Reconciliation Commission report that listed 24,000 deaths. After examining the overlap with other sources, including government data, they put the true number of victims at nearly 70,000.
 From his base at Benetech, a literacy and human rights organization in Palo Alto, Calif., Ball now has his methodological lens trained on Colombia. On the face of it, the country's crime figures look good for President Alvaro Uribe. The paramilitary groups that earned Colombia its violent reputation began to demobilize in 2004. Since then, homicide data suggest that the country is a safer place to live -- and Uribe has become one of Latin America's most popular leaders, even though critics charge that he has given the former militia leaders too much immunity and too much influence. In some regions, the murder rate has dropped by almost half. Both media reports and police records show substantial declines -- surely the number of murders must be going down?
 Ball isn't so sure. By looking at several years' worth of police and media records, as well as at other sources, he is working up an estimate of the number of murders that fail to make it on to any of the lists. When he sees less overlap from year to year, it is likely that a greater number of deaths are failing to appear in any of the ledgers.
 Ball's analysis is several months away from completion. But on the basis of data from just a few regions, he says it appears that the overlap between media and police reports is diminishing. Ball notes that there could be several explanations for this decline. One possible explanation is that both lists are missing more and more deaths, perhaps because murders are increasingly taking place in remote areas. If so, homicide rates may not be improving. It is too early to know if this phenomenon applies to the whole country, stresses Ball, but it seems that ''the demobilization process is not affecting homicide rates.''
 One person who is likely to object is Michael Spagat, an economist at Royal Holloway, a university near London, who also studies Colombia and who has previously clashed with Ball. Spagat says that the trends in the data are too clear to be overturned by Ball's analysis: ''He will have a mountain to climb to convince any reasonable person.''
 Still, Ball is undaunted. While prepared for attacks, his confidence in his methods is strong. In their Peru study, he and two colleagues wrote, ''Statistical methodology has parted the veil of indifference and ignorance, and the true state of affairs . . . has begun to emerge.''

HEADLINE: Being Poor in a 'Charge It' Society

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''You Are What You Spend,'' by W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm (Op-Ed, Feb. 10), argues that growing income disparities in this country don't mean very much. Consumption offers a better ''measurement of financial well-being,'' the writers say, and it ''indicates that the gap between rich and poor is far less than most assume.''
 Equating consumer spending with well-being, however, ignores elements of long-term well-being like investing for retirement, saving for college education, or building wealth through home ownership. 
 Over the long term, you cannot spend more than you earn, unless the assets you own have appreciated. The rich have more assets, and they have appreciated in recent decades. The poor do not; they have more debt, and have been harder hit by the subprime crisis.
 It's still not easy living on a low income in this country, and the disparities between rich and poor are significant and increasing. 
 Michael Kiparsky Eric Hallstein Berkeley, Calif., Feb. 10, 2008
 To the Editor:
 What a disappointment it was to read two members of our economic elite telling us: Don't worry. Be happy. The poor are like us, just with less money.
 Prosperity is not a color television, a cellphone and a VCR, and for many of us prosperity is not its own end but a means toward well-being. 
 Well-being is the certainty that you can provide your children with a quality education, which W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm's chart shows many can't purchase. Well-being is the security of having a good roof over your head in a safe, clean neighborhood. And it is knowing that if your children become ill, you have the income to help them pull through.
 I am so tired of our economists (and often, our newspapers) saying that the good life and the good society are defined by consumption (or its flip side, G.D.P.) and that the path to happiness is simply more of it. 
 Keith M. Wilson Charleston, Ill., Feb. 10, 2008
 To the Editor:
 W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm seems to equate having a lot of stuff -- refrigerators, stoves, cellphones, cars, color TVs, DVD players and the like -- with a ''lifting'' of the standard of living. 
 I disagree. The advantages of an increase in household consumption are far outweighed by the disadvantages. Does owning a car really shorten our workday, giving us more time to read, exercise or sleep? 
 As for globalization as currently practiced, it has undermined the financial autonomy and social cohesiveness of communities both here and abroad.
 And you call this the good life?
 Karin J. Lauria Marlborough, Mass., Feb. 10, 2008
 To the Editor:
 W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm say Americans in the lowest fifth for income are able to spend almost double their income because they have other sources of money -- like bank accounts and proceeds from home sales. The major reason that poor Americans are able to outspend their income is that they borrow heavily.
 Credit-card, loan and other debt is enormous among those who cannot afford to buy everything our consumerist society convinces them they need (or even what they really need). 
 This debt burden clearly calls into question the writers' assertion that ''consumption is a better measure of financial health than income.''
 Rosalyn Benjamin Darling Indiana, Pa., Feb. 10, 2008
 The writer is a professor of sociology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
 To the Editor:
 I agree that United States income inequality is not as problematic as many claim it to be. However, homes form the core of Americans' assets. Higher-income individuals are more likely to be homeowners. Those making less either rent and give money away every month, or pay high mortgages resulting from modest down payments.
 Overall purchasing power matters, but it is also important to analyze the relative burden of a major regular expenditure on a household's budget. Then it becomes clear that America's free market turns out to be freer for those who are fortunate to benefit from higher incomes. 
 Sebastian Wisniewski Redwood City, Calif., Feb. 11, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Decades of social science research make it clear that spending is not the whole story. Assets and debts also matter a great deal for family well-being and intergenerational mobility. They are the resources families draw on to send children to college, to help with the down payment on a first home, and to make ends meet when times are tough. 
 Without assets, poor families may be able to get by, but they will have real trouble ever getting ahead. Instead of dismissing inequality, we ought to focus on helping poor families to acquire assets and open up opportunities. 
 Equality isn't a DVD player in every household; it's an equal shot for all American children.

HEADLINE: Serious Steaks, At Breathtaking Prices

BYLINE: By ALICE GABRIEL

 BODY:
WITH the recent rise of glass-clad towers and high-end boites, the once-modest city of White Plains seems to be doing its best to impersonate Las Vegas, the land that not a single celebrity chef forgot. Developers and restaurateurs, including Rick Laakkonen at Antipasti and Anthony Goncalves at 42, are betting that suburbanites in search of fine dining will snub Manhattan and sink into a banquette closer to home. At the red-hot center of this big push is BLT Steak, a brand from Laurent Tourondel, sleekly ensconced on the ground floor of the new Ritz-Carlton on Renaissance Place. 
 On two nights in late January, we pulled up under the porte-cochere and noted a fleet of new-model luxury cars, including two silver Bentleys and a dazzling white Rolls, parked strategically along the drive. Was it ungenerous of me to think that they had been planted there as props? BLT plays right along with the fantasy that recession is being held at bay. At the end of a particularly rocky week for the stock market, a capacity crowd was eager to peruse a menu that included a densely marbled $92 American wagyu rib-eye and a $45 plate of snowy Dover sole. 
 With six locations nationwide, and more in the works, BLT Steak -- the BLT stand for Bistro Laurent Tourondel -- is fast spreading, like an exotic species that easily secures a niche where it sees an opening. It's a modern steakhouse (don't look for red velvet swags or big cigars) that flirts with a French-bistro aesthetic (slender frites stand upright in paper-lined cones). 
 With BLT Steak, Mr. Tourondel, who staked his first claim at the highly regarded Cello in Manhattan, is mining a vein that might be called relaxed luxe dining. But despite its gorgeous, blond-maple veneers and breathtaking prices, BLT Steak in White Plains still has the by-the-numbers feel of a franchise. On two visits, our waiters led with the same lines and were careful not to stray far from the script. 
 The food at BLT Steak is both serious and populist. Jesse Davis, the chef de cuisine, is a White Plains native and a veteran of Windows on the World and Porter House in New York. The menu is handed down from corporate headquarters, but a dozen daily specials allow Mr. Davis to show his stuff. 
 The meal began with brandy-splashed chicken liver pate and moved on to wonderful, cartoonish popovers, their dark crusts lacquered with Gruyere. We took a deep breath and turned to appetizers. Signature tuna tartare squared on a base of cubed avocado was set in a pool of deeply chilled soy-lime dressing and served with crisp potato gaufrettes. Curried cauliflower soup was smoothed with creme fraiche. A salad of beets, Gorgonzola, julienned apples and frisee had a light touch, and spinach tossed with Maytag blue cheese, mushrooms and a rich bacon vinaigrette made a robust starter. A crab cake was mushy, and heavily smoked double-cut bacon tasted like something a cowboy might wash down with strong coffee. 
 The steaks, of course, are the main attraction, and some leave a mighty big carbon hoof print. Imported Kobe beef is $26 an ounce, and American wagyu commands big prices too. We stuck with corn-fed U.S.D.A. prime certified Black Angus steaks finished with simple herb butter. (For an extra charge, diners can add one of eight sauces, from bearnaise to barbecue.) A 16-ounce New York strip ordered medium rare was flat-out rare; returned to the flames, it came back perfectly seared, succulent and satisfying. Giant, juicy and salted almost to a fault, a 24-ounce 28-day dry-aged T-bone was beautifully charred and nicely cooked. The steaks were served in handsome cast-iron pans. 
 We also tried two braised meats: good, rich short ribs; and a tender, tomatoey lamb shank (served with dull potatoes a la bordelaise). Two double-cut lamb chops were unevenly cooked and poorly trimmed. 
 For those who like to dine a little lower on the food chain, there is an excellent, brittle-skinned roasted chicken seasoned with lemony bread crumbs and rosemary. And my favorite entree was not from the feedlot but from the sea: fresh, delicate Dover sole, precisely boned and napped with a classic brown butter and caper sauce that had an almost candied quality.
 The supplemental cost of sides quickly fattens the tab. French fries, creamed spinach, grilled asparagus and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms were all very good. A cake of hash browns was undercooked at the center; braised carrots were over-soft; and light gnocchi seasoned with nutmeg were buried under a clumsy thatch of Parmesan. 
 The wine list is serious, and seriously expensive. The young, enthusiastic sommelier steered us to a charming Domaine Berthet-Rayne Cotes du Rhone ($48) when we asked for a wine under $50. On another night, we enjoyed the crisp 2005 Chateau Carbonnieux Blanc ($72) as an aperitif, and the 2003 Chateau Faugeres Saint-Emilion ($87) with its ripe blackberry flavors. 
 Estimable desserts included a gossamer crepe souffle, puckery lemon-cassis meringue pie, warm chocolate tart, and a trio of profiteroles filled with hazelnut ice cream. Among the domestic cheeses were fine specimens of blue-veined Humboldt Fog from Cypress Grove Chevre and the full-flavored Red Hawk triple cream from Cowgirl Creamery.

HEADLINE: Who's That Kid Staging Sondheim?

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
WHEN people think of Broadway special effects, the first things that probably come to mind are big, lumbering spectacles like the chandelier in ''Phantom of the Opera.'' Such elements are designed to drop jaws, stop shows and above all draw attention. But they don't always draw good reviews. 
 Sam Buntrock, the 32-year-old British director making his Broadway debut with the revival of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' wants to rehabilitate the artistic reputation of special effects. In his intimate production, live actors talk to projections, scenery darkens as day turns into night, and animation seamlessly blends into the background.
 ''Sometimes the job is to make the effects invisible,'' Mr. Buntrock said, sitting downstairs at Studio 54, where the show, presented by Roundabout Theater Company, is in previews. Some onstage technology ''has been much maligned, but I feel what we're doing serves the piece,'' he said. ''It's not an add-on.'' 
 ''Sunday in the Park,'' which has one of the most beloved Sondheim scores, first opened on Broadway in 1984, starring Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin. Broken into two interlocking parts, the first of which tells the story, largely imagined, of how the Parisian painter Georges Seurat (played by Daniel Evans in the current revival) created his pointillist classic ''Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,'' while ignoring the woman he loves, Dot (Jenna Russell). The second act fast-forwards a century to the 1980s when another artist named George (also played by Evans) presents a new multimedia conceptual art piece. 
 In this new version, thanks to 3-D animation, the painting, currently the crown jewel of the Art Institute of Chicago, slowly comes together onstage. A sketch emerges, then color is added, and the rest gradually comes into focus, piece by piece. 
 ''By showing the progression, you get more into the mind of the artist,'' Mr. Sondheim said in an interview. ''The play is about perception, and here we see the work as George perceives it.''
 Mr. Buntrock is an unlikely Broadway director. For one thing, there's his age. ''He looks about 18,'' said Mr. Sondheim, who also said he was shocked when he first met him at London's tiny Menier Chocolate Factory theater, where the show first ran three years ago before it transferred to the West End. ''I thought, 'Come on -- don't give me that.' ''
 But it's not just Mr. Buntrock's youth that's unusual. He has a democratic sensibility that includes a love of opera and popcorn movies. And while he has directed many shows, until around five years ago he was better known as an animator. He suggests that his experience in both animation and live performance worked to his benefit in ''Sunday in the Park.'' ''I have a foot in both worlds,'' he said, looking down modestly, ''which gives me an advantage in integrating the animation.''
 Mr. Buntrock, who was wearing blue jeans and a form-fitting gray shirt, has a low-key, casual style that seems more like that of an earnest graduate student than a theater director. He has had a stutter since he was 7 and confesses that sometimes he uses it to buy time while considering what to say. But even after he settles on something, he often reconsiders. ''It was a dangerous thing -- actually, it's not really dangerous,'' he said about an element of his set design, before stopping himself with a laugh. ''It's not like someone's going to get killed.''
 Even at his age Mr. Buntrock has had a long relationship with Mr. Sondheim's work. A revival of ''Into the Woods'' in 1990 inspired him to become a theater director, and years later, while a student, he staged his first show, a low-tech production of ''Assassins.'' He then cut his teeth as an assistant director at the Donmar Warehouse in the late 1990s during the celebrated tenure of Sam Mendes. There he worked with directors like David Leveaux and John Crowley, and seemed to be making the right kind of connections.
 ''There was a lot of smoke being blown around me because I was an assistant at the Donmar, and that was seen as a springboard,'' he said. But things didn't take off as planned. ''I couldn't get anything up and running. I wasn't very good at selling myself. I was much shyer in those days. My stammer was much worse.''
 At something of a loss, Mr. Buntrock, the son of an advertising man, poured his energies into animation, working for television and corporate clients, which was also much more lucrative than being an unemployed theater director. It was also something that he has always been interested in. ''I knew early on the difference between Saturday morning cartoons and feature-film standards,'' Mr. Buntrock said.
 He continued to direct occasionally for the stage, but mostly in solo shows and sketch comedy. He worked successfully with a satirical troupe called Club Seals that incorporated fairly raw and rudimentary special effects. But Mr. Buntrock grew increasingly concerned that he was frittering away his chances at a theater career.
 The turning point came in 2003 after a cancer scare (''I'm fine now'') and a bout with alcoholism. (He's been sober five years.) ''It was a very, very bad year,'' he said. But by the end he had emerged with the crucial idea to mix his interests in animation and theater in a production of one of the few great Sondheim shows that hadn't been given a Broadway revival. Inspiration hit after revisiting the score of ''Sunday in the Park,'' a musical about, among other things, an artist's anxiety about wasting his talent.
 ''If you've been through a bad year, and you hear that score, it hurts, but in a good way,'' Mr. Buntrock said. ''It makes you feel that what you've been feeling is connected to something.''
 The intimate show was an instant hit, receiving rave reviews. In its move to Broadway, the budget naturally has grown bigger, and so have the expectations. Is anything different? ''It's more showbiz,'' Mr. Buntrock says, adding with the crooked smile of someone who seems a bit embarrassed by the term. ''I mean that in the best sense.''

HEADLINE: First-Time Jitters

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
IF there is a bright spot in New York City's uncertain real estate market, it is that over the last several months, some first-time buyers have found it easier to buy apartments. 
 With mortgage rates low and prices steady, some of these buyers are getting apartments at the most favorable prices and terms in years. 
 ''I haven't seen a better time to be a first-time buyer in about a decade,'' said Sarah Burke, vice president for sales and marketing at the Developers Group, a sales, marketing and brokerage firm based in Brooklyn. ''First-time buyers have time to get their ducks in a row. A year ago, there were a lot of people who all wanted the same apartment. You have time now to really review the contract with an attorney. You have time to ask questions. You don't need to decide on the spot.''
 But as attractive as mortgage rates are, getting approval for one is becoming much more difficult. Based in part on reports across the country that even some borrowers with strong credit are in danger of defaulting on loans, lenders are scrutinizing first-time buyers' credit and employment histories. 
 ''First-time home buyers don't have track records,'' said Melissa Cohn, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. ''Banks are scrutinizing the first-time home buyers more heavily to make sure that they can make the payments.'' 
 Still, in New York, while such attention has delayed and even jeopardized some closings, sales are strong for studio and one-bedroom apartments, typically first-time buyers' entry into the market. 
 Jonathan Miller, the executive vice president and director of research at Radar Logic, a real estate research company, said that such apartments make up more than half of the Manhattan sales market. In the fourth quarter of 2007, 55 percent of the 2,518 apartments sold in Manhattan were studios and one-bedrooms.
 That, in turn, is good news for many sellers, who are happy to find purchasers not obliged to sell their own home before buying a new one. 
 Conversely, first-time buyers who run into snags and delay closings can hold up the sellers. ''It plays a very important role in the health of the real estate market,'' Mr. Miller said. If first-time buyers are ''having a hard time, then all segments are having a hard time.''
 Greg Kochanov, 27, an agent for Halstead Property in the Bronx, found an apartment in Riverdale, his first real estate purchase, and also discovered just how much credit scores matter, especially when they dip below 700. (Credit scores range from 500 to 850; scores of 700 or more make it easier to get a mortgage.)
 He set his sights on a 600-square-foot studio for sale for $105,000 at 2500 Johnson Avenue. He knew that the apartment, an estate sale, needed extensive work. But he expected the value to rise drastically after he fixed it up. It's in a desirable co-op building within walking distance of shopping and a Metro-North station. The building has amenities like a gym and swimming pool, and the maintenance is a low $550 a month. 
 In July, Mr. Kochanov reached a deal to pay $100,000 for the apartment and put down a $20,000 deposit. He wasn't concerned about passing the co-op board interview because he had another $33,000 in savings, which would demonstrate that he could afford his monthly payments even if he lost his job.
 In August, he applied for a mortgage. With a credit score slightly higher than 700, he was accepted within three weeks. But then his mortgage broker told him that the lender had gone out of business and that the process would have to start over. By then, his credit score had dipped below 700. 
 Mr. Kochanov said his score had dropped because he had opened one credit-card account, had closed a second account and had had multiple credit checks because he had applied for a mortgage and had rented a new apartment. (He hadn't planned on buying and thought he would rent so that he could save more money to buy. But then he found a deal.) 
 He finally received a conditional mortgage commitment on Sept. 25.
 By November, he was approved by the co-op board and was ready to close. But then his lender decided not to give him a mortgage because of his credit score. He had until Dec. 10 to find a mortgage with another bank, or he risked losing his $20,000 down payment. ''I really thought I lost the deal,'' Mr. Kochanov said.
 Three days before his deadline, he got a mortgage and closed. But Brian Cohen, the sales supervisor with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage who made the loan, said it wasn't easy because of Mr. Kochanov's credit score.
 ''A while ago, with his credit score, it would have been fine,'' he said. 
 Now Mr. Kochanov won't show apartments to first-time buyers until he knows that their credit scores are over 700 -- he is too concerned they won't get mortgages. 
 ''The best thing for a buyer right now is to know where they stand,'' he said. ''Because it's just going to waste everybody's time.''
 But even first-time buyers with credit scores well over 700 are coming to expect changing demands from lenders. 
 Ashley and Stefan Miller signed a contract on Jan. 28 for a $630,000 two-bedroom condo at the Langston at 68 Bradhurst Avenue in Hamilton Heights. Ms. Miller, 27, is a science teacher at the Horace Mann School in Riverdale in the Bronx, and Mr. Miller, 29, is a law student at New York University. 
 In the four years since the Millers first met at Yale, where he was working on a Ph.D. in chemistry and she was working on a master's degree, they have been saving to buy an apartment. They haven't taken vacations, and after they were married last year, they didn't go on a honeymoon. 
 They have lived on Ms. Miller's paychecks and saved what Mr. Miller made as a summer associate working on patent cases at the law firm of Hunton & Williams in New York and his part-time work there during the school year. They thought that with $65,000 in savings and good credit scores, they should be able to find a deal in a slowing market.
 They soon discovered that Sid Whelan of Halstead Property, the broker for the Langston, was willing to negotiate. They persuaded him to cut the asking price by $35,000, and because they were buying a model apartment, they asked him to throw in $8,000 in furniture, including a leather sofa, a coffee table and a wall unit. They also delayed their closing until May when Mr. Miller expects to graduate from law school and their student housing will end. That way, they will avoid overlapping mortgage and rental payments.
 ''When we first started to look, we did not think things would go so smoothly,'' Ms. Miller said. ''We were thinking of getting a one-bedroom at this price.''
 Now the couple fear that the bank may change its mind at the last minute and ask them to have more savings on hand after closing. The first place they looked for a mortgage was at Chase, but they were concerned about some of the terms. 
 A spokesman for Chase, Thomas Kelly, said the bank typically prefers borrowers to have a cushion equal to six months of mortgage payments after closing. Chase also wants borrowers who are starting a new job to begin work no later than the date their first mortgage payment is due. So the couple started looking around for a mortgage elsewhere. 
 Several months before closing, the Millers borrowed the equivalent of six months of mortgage payments from their parents, promising to pay them back after the deal closed. They ultimately chose a mortgage from Wells Fargo, which so far has not asked about the savings they will have on hand after closing. In any case, they're holding onto their parents' cash until after closing to make sure that the lender doesn't change its mind.
 Some first-time buyers with less financial wherewithal have been able to overcome their credit and employment histories. 
 For Douglas Diaz, 34, the problem was that he had only $20,000 for a down payment on a $427,500 one-bedroom condo at 555 Washington Avenue in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. The building is a 94-year-old former Catholic school, and he had wanted to live there for a decade. He jumped at the opportunity to own an apartment that had a balcony with 180-degree views, gargoyles and stone railings.
 Mr. Diaz, who had taught architecture and urban design at Columbia and design at Parsons, left academia last spring to work in online advertising. He was able to qualify for a mortgage with HSBC although his credit score was less than 700. 
 He got the loan as part of a program with HSBC that lends in certain ZIP codes with large minority populations. While he had the income to cover the monthly mortgage payments, his down payment was lower than most lenders would require, according to his mortgage broker, Peter Grabel.
 ''If someone like Doug walked into 10 banks, nine of them would not have been able to do the loans on terms like this,'' said Mr. Grabel, who works as a private mortgage banker and broker for Indymac Bank in White Plains. ''There would have been more lenders who would have done the loan six months ago.''
 Mr. Diaz's agent, Michelle Kadushin of Prudential Douglas Elliman, persuaded the seller to accept his offer. She argued that Brooklyn had a lot of apartments for sale in a slowing market and emphasized that Mr. Diaz's offer was close to the $435,000 asking price. 
 But the sellers were hesitant. They continued to hold open houses for two or three weeks after he made his offer. They did not take the apartment off the market until he had signed a contract and had given them a $20,000 check. 
 Mr. Diaz, a trained architect, says he thinks the building will hold its value because of its distinctive design.
 He sent an e-mail message to Mr. Grabel detailing all his expenses to make sure that he wasn't stretching himself too thin. Mr. Grabel reassured him.
 ''I don't know, a year ago, if I would have been as comfortable doing this,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''This caution has let me sit down and ask a lot of questions about what I can really afford.''
 Even with blue-ribbon employment and credit histories, delays can be a problem. 
 Barbara Nikonorow and Antoine Vivas, both 39, went to contract last spring on a co-op at 616 West 137th Street. The four-bedroom apartment cost only $435,000 because it is in a Housing Development Fund Corporation building that has income limits for buyers. 
 The couple put down 20 percent and agreed with the seller to delay closing until the fall, because both parties were planning to travel over the summer. Ms. Nikonorow, who works as a producer for Sesame Workshop's international productions, and Mr. Vivas, who works as a filmmaker in Russia, Venezuela and the United States, didn't worry about getting a mortgage because their credit scores were well over 700.
 But by the fall, the credit crisis was in full swing and banks had tightened all of their documentation requirements. Commerce Bank asked Mr. Vivas to provide translated letters confirming his income from the Russian production companies with which he was working.
 Then, days before closing on the apartment in October, Ms. Nikonorow's mortgage broker told her in an e-mail message that she had to take an online course and quiz on the responsibilities of homeownership before receiving a mortgage. The bank said that borrowers need to take the course if they are borrowing more than 80 percent of a home's value. 
 Ms. Nikonorow, who was working full time and caring for their two sons while her husband was traveling on a film shoot, said it took her two weekends to finish the course, delaying the closing. 
 She also said that while she found the course helpful, she wishes she had been told earlier that she would have to take it. ''We thought we were finished with the whole process,'' she said.
 David Flaherty, a spokesman for Commerce Bank, said that the bank had always required first-time buyers with mortgages of more than 80 percent of the home's value to take the course. 
 Still, the couple's agent, Helene Leskin of Citi Habitats, said that she had not had a client take such a course and that her colleagues said that only buyers with troubled credit were typically required to take these courses, especially before the credit crunch. 
 ''Mortgages were given to people without verifying employment a year ago,'' Ms. Leskin said. She believes that if the couple had closed earlier, ''it would have been a little bit different.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 17 about difficulties that some first-time buyers have experienced in getting mortgages misstated the range of the credit scores that are used in part to determine mortgage rates. They range from 300 to 850, not from 500 to 850.

'Free Lunch'
 To the Editor:
 Jonathan Chait's review of my book ''Free Lunch'' (Feb. 3) ignores its central thesis and neglects to disclose that he wrote a competing book.
 He writes that I embrace litigiousness to solve societal problems. In fact, I describe litigation as ''scary and nasty'' and show ways to reduce lawsuits. My solution is for taxpayers to cover the full costs of Congress, ending legalized bribery. 
 Chait writes that I regard corporations as ''inherently malevolent,'' which is ridiculous given that I am chairman of the board of a small corporation with big ambitions. He says I regard deregulation as ''evil,'' when I wrote that deregulation is a fantasy and I show new regulations that thwart market capitalism, drive up prices and hinder competition. The only things I call ''evil,'' citing the Bible, are policies that take from the many to give to the rich.
 Chait twists words I use to describe the shared values of those Democrats and Republicans who favor people over corporations to make them appear as my views, not a description of theirs.
 Chait misleadingly connects me to a faction of Democrats and calls me a left-wing populist, even though I am a registered Republican, a matter of public record that is posted all over the Internet, and without mentioning that classic conservative values drawn from Adam Smith, Andrew Mellon and the Bible are invoked throughout ''Free Lunch.''
 ''Free Lunch'' is full of news, hard facts and plain-English explanations of how market capitalism has been perverted. Chait did an excellent job of one thing -- hiding what ''Free Lunch'' actually says from readers of The New York Times Book Review.

 Jonathan Chait replies:
 I did not consider my own very different book to be ''competing,'' but if Johnston wants me to mention it, I'll happily oblige. I am the author of ''The Big Con: The True Story of How Washington Got Hoodwinked and Hijacked by Crackpot Economics,'' available in bookstores everywhere.
 That Johnston can deny that he embraces litigiousness is bizarre. He depicts trial lawyers as heroes and wrote that every American has dreamed of fighting a case all the way to the Supreme Court.
 Johnston's quibble with ''evil'' is wordplay.
 It is beyond clear that the views Johnston ascribed to ''peoplists'' are his own. It is equally clear that Johnston's views reside on the political left, despite his finding agreeable quotes from Adam Smith, Andrew Mellon and the Bible. I'm relieved that he does not dispute my characterization of his viewpoint as Naderite, because Nader's campaign is currently offering copies of ''Free Lunch'' to its donors.
 To the Editor:
 Reviewing ''Free Lunch,'' Chait writes that ''the government's taxation disproportionately falls on the rich, and its spending disproportionately benefits the nonrich.'' This is untrue. According to the dictionary, ''disproportionate'' denotes ''an absence of due relation or proportion.'' Used correctly, the word means ''out of proper proportion'' rather than simply ''in something other than a one-to-one relation.'' It is a normative word; it implies, inescapably, a judgment about what is ''due'' or ''proper.''
 As Johnston and others have shown, the effective tax rate across all income levels is nearly flat -- so widely do the rich shirk their tax obligations and so light are those obligations to begin with. Anyone who believes in progressive taxation -- or ordinary fairness -- must conclude that Chait has it exactly backward: the government's taxation disproportionately falls on the nonrich, and its spending disproportionately benefits the rich.

 In his review of ''Alfred Kazin: A Biography'' (Jan. 27), Brian Morton takes me to task for stating that Kazin ''insists on being alone with his writers -- one-on-one, writer-to-writer, taking their measure according to his lights, his experiences, his prejudices.'' Morton asks, ''What the hell should he be doing?'' and wonders whether I am ''embarrassed'' by Kazin's personal response to writers. In fact, I repeatedly insist that Kazin's best criticism reflects a deep personal engagement with writers, that he was most convincing, most ''riveting,'' when dealing with ''the distinctively personal-creative interests'' of writers, or as he liked to put it, ''the mind behind each book.'' I am at a loss to understand how Morton could think I was embarrassed by this quality.

 To the Editor:
 Please let J. R. Moehringer know that if William Vollmann isn't available for that beer, I'll gladly take him up on the offer. Moehringer's writing in his review of ''Riding Toward Everywhere'' (Jan. 27) made me absolutely swoon.

HEADLINE: Gatsby's Green Light Beckons A New Generation of Strivers

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Jinzhao Wang, 14, who immigrated two years ago from China, has never seen anything like the huge mansions that loomed over Long Island Sound in glamorous 1920s New York. But F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, ''The Great Gatsby,'' with its themes of possibility and aspiration, speaks to her. 
 She is inspired by the green light at the end of the dock, which for Jay Gatsby, the self-made millionaire from North Dakota, symbolizes the upper-class woman he longs for. ''Green color always represents hope,'' Jinzhao said. 
 ''My green light?'' said Jinzhao, who has been studying ''Gatsby'' in her sophomore English class at the Boston Latin School. ''My green light is Harvard.'' 
 Some educators say the best way to engage racially and ethnically diverse students in reading is with books that mirror their lives and culture. But others say that while a variety of literary voices is important, ''Gatsby'' -- still required reading at half the high schools in the country -- resonates powerfully among urban adolescents, many of them first- and second-generation immigrants, who are striving to ascend in 21st-century America. 
 ''They all understand what it is to strive for something,'' said Susan Moran, who is the director of the English program at Boston Latin and who has been teaching ''Gatsby'' for 32 years, starting at South Boston High School, ''to want to be someone you're not, to want to achieve something that's just beyond reach, whether it's professional success or wealth or idealized love -- or a 4.0 or admission to Harvard.''
 The novel had fallen into near obscurity by the time Fitzgerald died in 1940, said Charles Scribner III, whose great-grandfather signed the author with the family publishing company in 1919. It was revived in the 1950s and '60s when Mr. Scribner's father, Charles Scribner Jr., started publishing a paperback version and a student edition for colleges and high schools. 
 Its popularity soared after Robert Redford played Gatsby in the movie in 1974. In more recent years, a musical version made its debut at the New York Metropolitan Opera and the novel has been turned into a hip hop movie, ''G,'' set in the Hamptons. The book now sells more than half a million copies a year, with high schools and colleges making up the biggest share of the market, Mr. Scribner said.
 Jinzhao's teacher, Meredith Elliott, and other teachers at Boston Latin and other urban schools, say their students see in ''Gatsby'' glimmers of their own evolving identities and dreams. The students talk about the youthful characters -- Gatsby; Daisy Buchanan, the married woman he loves; Tom, Daisy's husband and a onetime Yale football star; and the narrator, Nick Carraway -- as if they were classmates or celebrities. 
 ''I see Tom as this really mean jock,'' said Vimin To, a 15-year-old Boston Latin sophomore who is in Kay Moon's American literature class. ''When he was in high school, he was king of the hill. He had it all. He was higher than everyone, even the teachers.'' 
 As for Daisy, in Vimin's view: ''She's turned into an empty person. Like Paris Hilton.'' 
 Vimin's father works in a restaurant -- ''not very glamorous,'' Vimin said -- and came to the United States as a refugee from Vietnam. Vimin relates to the story of Gatsby's rise from the backwoods of North Dakota to New York. ''It's a very inspirational tale, especially when you're from a background such as Mr. Gatsby,'' he said. 
 His version of Gatsby's dream: ''My goal is to make my parents proud of me. I've always been told to succeed, to take advantage of the opportunities they've given me -- just to be financially stable, to be able to support your family.''
 At the nearby Fenway School, some of Fran Farrell's seniors, who read ''Gatsby'' this year as part of their study of the American dream, found different lessons in Gatsby's life and violent death. 
 ''I think this American dream is an interpretation of a white poor man's dream,'' Nicole Done, 17, whose family is from the Dominican Republic, said during a lively class discussion. ''For me the American dream is working hard for something you want. It's not about having money. My dream is to get an education that I can't get in the Dominican Republic, to live comfortably.''
 Several of her classmates disagreed. ''The American dream has a lot to do with money,'' said Harkeem Steed, 17, who compared Gatsby to his hero, Jay-Z. 
 ''Everything in this life is about money,'' said Melanie Nunez, whose family is from the Dominican Republic. ''How are you going to get to college?'' 
 These teachers take pains to present the book with a great deal of social and historical context, and they say it crystallizes for many students questions about both the materialism of Gatsby's dream and the possibility of attaining their own versions of the dream, especially in today's highly stratified economy. 
 ''Here's Gatsby out of nowhere in this mansion, having these lavish parties and really and truly fulfilling the American dream, and that's very compelling for them,'' Ms. Moran said. ''But it's a cautionary tale, too.
 ''The culture sells the American dream so hard and so relentlessly, but they're wary, and they should be,'' she continued. ''One reason students appreciate the book is that there is a level of honesty that they value. They need these honest stories to perhaps balance what is otherwise presented as this shining possibility for everyone.''
 During a recent discussion with several other students in Ms. Moon's class, Will Murphy, 16, whose father works two jobs as a firefighter and an E.M.T., was relating Gatsby's accumulation of enormous wealth to his own chances of hitting it big in today's economy. ''Getting rich seems so far out of the picture,'' said Will, who has a part-time job scooping ice cream. ''Everybody thinks about it, but the older you get, the less possible it seems.'' 
 ''In other countries, people say, 'Oh, if you go to America, everything is going to be better,' '' Will went on. ''It's better, but it's not as good as you think it will be. You won't instantly become rich.'' 
 One of Will's classmates, Ashley Waters, 16, who helps her father with his antique consignment business, agreed. ''The American dream is possible, but it's just really hard,'' she said. ''Everything is so expensive -- the price of college, housing. Look at the price of gas. The economy is going down.'' 
 Shauna Deleon, 16, whose family is from Jamaica, nodded. ''The American dream is not open to everyone,'' she said. ''There are certain pathways, certain gateways.'' 
 For Shauna's parents, as for the parents of her classmates, one of those gateways is the four-century-old Boston Latin, with its rigorous entrance exams and alumni who include five signers of the Declaration of Independence. 
 As a sophomore working to meet the school's demands, Shauna sometimes feels as if her mother's green light is her. ''She puts all her hopes in me,'' said Shauna, who talks about becoming a thoracic surgeon. ''I have all this weight and responsibility. Sometimes I can't live up to it.'' 
 A couple weeks later, Ms. Moon and Ms. Elliott wrapped up ''Gatsby'' and, with ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' ''The Joy Luck Club'' and ''Ethan Frome'' also behind them, moved on to the next novel on the sophomore list: ''Their Eyes Were Watching God'' by Zora Neale Hurston. 
 Jinzhao Wang, meanwhile, has been reflecting more deeply about the meaning of the green light. ''I'm not an American citizen, so when I apply to college I will be competing with all the top students in Asia,'' said Jinzhao, whose parents are teachers and who lives in the Allston neighborhood, across the river from Cambridge and the red brick buildings of Harvard. ''I have to set an even higher standard.'' 
 Here, too, she had found inspiration in ''Gatsby.'' ''The Dutch settlers went all the way across the ocean to this new land -- America,'' Jinzhao said, referring to Nick's bittersweet reflections that end the book. ''America appears to the Dutch settlers as Daisy appears to Gatsby. Gatsby's hopes and dreams are American ideals. His effort is the real ideal of the American dream.'' 
 ''I really want to go to Harvard,'' she said. ''But if I don't get into Harvard, I will not die, right?'' 
 ''The journey toward the dream is the most important thing,'' she said. 
 And, she added, ''There is a green light beyond the green light.'' For her that green light is China, where she hopes to use a Harvard education to help the country develop even faster.

 Cockfighting: Culture,
 Or Just Plain Cruelty?
 To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''A Question of Culture,'' Feb. 18: I do not condone the suffering that the roosters endure, but having lived in the Dominican Republic for almost four years, I can appreciate cockfighting as part of the culture. 
 It seems that as Americans, we are being extremely hypocritical in our criticism of cockfighting. We have no problem consuming extraordinary amounts of meat in the United States, the majority of which comes from animals raised under cruel conditions, yet somehow we believe that cockfighting is morally wrong. Maybe we should examine our own behaviors before judging those of citizens of developing countries.
 Joanna Mauer
 Hyattsville, Md.
 To the Sports Editor:
 As much as cockfighting seems to rule the land, the Dominican economy depends much more on tourists. The insistence on practicing a sport that offends so many will ultimately cost them thousands of tourists like me, who have no desire to put money in the pocket of the Dominican Republic.
 In a nation where 40 percent live below the poverty line, a decline in tourism could be catastrophic. Keeping the cruel tradition of cockfighting alive will ultimately hurt the Dominican people as much as the roosters they breed, train and throw into the ring. Stacy Gueraseva
 Brooklyn
 To the Sports Editor:
 Cockfighting is unethical, inhumane and as cruel as neglecting and abusing an innocent child. Culture? Please. I think it is time for all human beings to become the compassionate, caring people that we are meant to be. Believe it or not, all animals can feel pain. Jennifer Weekley
 Decatur, Ill.
 China on Their Minds
 To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''Wary of Food, U.S. Olympians Plan a Big Delivery to China,'' Feb. 9: I am a American, born in the Midwest, who has lived and worked in China since 2003. But after reading all the articles in the United States news media, you would be surprised that I am alive. 
 I have eaten food in China for years with no sickness. I have taken medicine made in China and have rid myself of illness. The water here has quenched my thirst and not made me sick. 
 China is not some backwoods country. No government or society is perfect, but China is not so far off the mark.
 William Staats
 Beijing
 To the Sports Editor:
 How interesting that such care and concern is being focused on the food Olympic athletes will ingest while in Beijing. Our government does not allow labeling that reveals the country of origin for food additives. (Remember that melamine was added in China to make pet food appear to have more protein.)
 Unless the United States Olympic Committee is backing up trucks to Whole Foods or other organic markets, all the money and effort it is investing to ensure that nutritious food is shipped may be in vain. The provisions may arrive in the Olympic Village containing ingredients that have crossed the ocean twice. Barb Purkey

HEADLINE: Arcane Market Is Next to Face Big Credit Test

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Few Americans have heard of credit default swaps, arcane financial instruments invented by Wall Street about a decade ago. But if the economy keeps slowing, credit default swaps, like subprime mortgages, may become a household term.
 Credit default swaps form a large but obscure market that will be put to its first big test as a looming economic downturn strains companies' finances. Like a homeowner's policy that insures against a flood or fire, these instruments are intended to cover losses to banks and bondholders when companies fail to pay their debts. 
 The market for these securities is enormous. Since 2000, it has ballooned from $900 billion to more than $45.5 trillion -- roughly twice the size of the entire United States stock market.
 No one knows how troubled the credit swaps market is, because, like the now-distressed market for subprime mortgage securities, it is unregulated. But because swaps have proliferated so rapidly, experts say that a hiccup in this market could set off a chain reaction of losses at financial institutions, making it even harder for borrowers to get loans that grease economic activity. 
 It is entirely possible that this market can withstand a big jump in corporate defaults, if it comes. But an inkling of trouble emerged in a recent report from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal banking regulator. It warned that a significant increase in trading in swaps during the third quarter of last year ''put a strain on processing systems'' used by banks to handle these trades and make sure they match up.
 And last week, the American International Group said that it had incorrectly valued some of the swaps it had written and that sharp declines in some of these instruments had translated to $3.6 billion more in losses than the company had previously estimated. Its stock dropped 12 percent on the news but edged up in the days after.
 A.I.G. says it expects to file its year-end financial statements on time by the end of this month with appropriate valuations.
 Placing accurate values on these contracts is just one of the uncertainties facing the big banks, insurance companies and hedge funds that create and trade these instruments.
 In a credit default swap, two parties enter a private contract in which the buyer of protection agrees to pay the seller premiums over a set period of time; the seller pays only if a particular credit crisis occurs, like a default. These instruments can be sold, on either end of the contract, by the insurer or the insured.
 But during the credit market upheaval in August, 14 percent of trades in these contracts were unconfirmed, meaning one of the parties in the resale transaction was unidentified in trade documents and remained unknown 30 days later. In December, that number stood at 13 percent. Because these trades are unregulated, there is no requirement that all parties to a contract be told when it is sold. 
 As investors who have purchased such swaps try to cash them in, they may have trouble tracking down who is supposed to pay their claims. 
 ''This is just a giant insurance industry that is underregulated and not very well reserved for and does not have very good standards as a result,'' said Michael A. J. Farrell, chief executive of Annaly Capital Management in New York. ''I think unregulated markets that overshadow, in terms of size, the regulated ones are a real question mark.''
 Because these contracts are sold and resold among financial institutions, an original buyer may not know that a new, potentially weaker entity has taken over the obligation to pay a claim. 
 In late 2005, at the urging of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, market participants agreed to advise their trading partners in a swap when they assigned contracts to others. But it is unclear how closely participants adhere to this practice.
 It would be as if homeowners, facing losses after a hurricane, could not identify the insurance companies to pay on their claims. Or, if they could, they discovered that their insurer had transferred the policy to another company that could not cover the claim.
 Credit default swaps were invented by major banks in the mid-1990s as a way to offset risk in their lending or bond portfolios. At the outset, each contract was different, volume in the market was small and participants knew whom they were dealing with. 
 Years of a healthy economy and few corporate defaults led many banks to write more credit insurance, finding it a low-risk way to earn income because failures were few. Speculators have also flooded into the credit insurance market recently because these securities make it easier to bet on the health of a company than using corporate bonds.
 Both factors have resulted in a market of credit swaps that now far exceeds the face value of corporate bonds underlying it.Commercial banks are among the biggest participants -- at the end of the third quarter of 2007, the top 25 banks held credit default swaps, both as insurers and insured, worth $14 trillion, the currency office said, up $2 trillion from the previous quarter.
 JPMorgan Chase, with $7.8 trillion, is the largest player; Citibank and Bank of America are behind it with $3 trillion and $1.6 trillion respectively.
 But many speculators, particularly hedge funds, have flocked to these instruments to bet on a company failure easily. Before the insurance was developed, such a bet would require selling short a corporation's bond and going into the market to borrow it to supply to the buyer.
 The market's popularity raises the possibility that undercapitalized participants could have trouble paying their obligations.
 ''The theme had been that derivatives are an instrument that helps diversify risk and stabilize risk-taking,'' said Henry Kaufman, the economist at Henry Kaufman & Company in New York and an authority on the ways of Wall Street. ''My own view of that has always been highly questionable -- those instruments also encourage significant risk-taking and looking at risk modestly rather than incisively.''
 Officials at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade group, say they are confident that the market will stand up, even under stress.
 ''During the volatility we have seen in the last eight months, credit default swaps continue to trade, unlike other parts of the credit market that have shut down,'' said Robert G. Pickel, chief executive of the association. ''Even if we have a series of credit events at the same time, we have the processes in place to enable the market to deliver.''
 Such credit problems have been rare recently. The default rate among high-yield junk bonds fell to 0.9 percent in December, a record low.
 But financial history is rife with examples of market breakdowns that followed the creation of complex securities. Financial innovation often gets ahead of the mechanics necessary to track trades or regulators' ability to monitor the market for safety and soundness.
 The market for default insurance, like the subprime mortgage securities market, is a product of good economic times and has boomed in recent years. In 2000, $900 billion of credit insurance contracts changed hands. Since then, the face value of the contracts outstanding has doubled every year as new contracts have been written. In the first six months of 2007, the figure rose 75 percent; the market now dwarfs the value of United States Treasuries outstanding.
 Roughly one-third of the credit default swaps provided insurance against a default by a specific corporate debt issuer in 2006, according to the British Bankers' Association. Around 30 percent of the contracts were written against indexes representing baskets of debt from numerous issuers.
 But 16 percent were created to protect holders of collateralized debt obligations, complex pools of bonds that have recently experienced problems because of mortgage holdings.
 There is no exchange where these insurance contracts trade, and their prices are not reported to the public. Because of this, institutions typically value them based on computer models rather than prices set by the market.
 Neither are the participants overseen by regulators verifying that the parties to the transactions can meet their obligations.
 The potential for problems in sizing up the financial health of buyers of these securities leads to questions about how these insurance contracts are being valued on banks' books. A bank that has bought protection to cover its corporate bond exposure thinks it is hedged and therefore does not write off paper losses it may incur on those bond holdings. If the party who sold the insurance cannot pay on its claim in the event of a default, however, the bank's losses would have to be reflected on its books.
 Investors are already reeling from the recognition that major banks inaccurately estimated losses from the mortgage debacle. If further write-downs emerge as a result of hedges that did not work, investor confidence could take another dive.
 To be sure, the $45 trillion in credit default swaps is not an exact reflection of what would be lost or won if all the underlying securities defaulted. That figure is impossible to pinpoint since the amounts that are recovered in default situations vary.
 But one of the challenges facing participants in the credit default swap market is that the market value amount of the contracts outstanding far exceeds the $5.7 trillion of the corporate bonds whose defaults the swaps were created to protect against.
 To the uninitiated trying to understand this complex market, its size might initially seem a comfort, as if there were far more insurance covering the bonds than could ever be needed. But because each contract must be settled between buyer and seller if a default occurs, this imbalance can present a problem.
 Typically, settling the agreements has required the delivery of defaulted bonds if the insurance buyer wants to be fully covered. If the insurance contracts exceed the bonds that are available for delivery, problems arise.
 For example, when Delphi, the auto parts maker, filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, the credit default swaps on the company's debt exceeded the value of underlying bonds tenfold. Buyers of credit insurance scrambled to buy the bonds, driving up their price to around 70 cents on the dollar, a startlingly high value for defaulted debt.
 Market participants worked out an auction system where settlements of Delphi contracts could be made even if the bonds could not be physically delivered. This arrangement was done at just over 36 cents on the dollar; so buyers of protection on Delphi who did not have the bonds received $366.25 for every $1,000 in coverage they had bought. Had they been valuing their Delphi insurance coverage at $1,000 per bond, they would have had to write off that position by $633.75 per $1,000 bond.
 That is why the valuation of these contracts is of such concern to some participants.
 As with other securities that trade privately and by appointment, assigning values to credit default swaps is highly subjective. So some on Wall Street wonder how much of the paper gains generated in these instruments by firms and hedge funds last year will turn out to be illusory when they try to cash them in.
 ''The insurance business is very difficult to quantify risk in,'' said Mr. Farrell of Annaly Capital Management. ''You have to really read the contract to make sure you are covered. That is going to be the test of the market this year. As defaults kick in and as these events unfold, you are going to find out who has managed this well.''
 And who hasn't.

HEADLINE: In Hotel Design, He's Mr. Prolific

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
IN his SoHo office, the architect Gene Kaufman is presenting drawings of his latest buildings.
 ''This one is for Marriott in Chelsea,'' he said, pointing to a rendering of a slender, gray tower. ''This is a Sheraton on Canal Street. This one's a Doubletree in the financial district ...'' 
 Mr. Kaufman is just getting warmed up.
 Many architects would be happy to design a single hotel in Manhattan; his firm, Gene Kaufman Architect, is designing 36 of them. Nearly all are for national brands that are trying to establish beachheads in the city. 
 On one block near Times Square -- 39th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues -- Mr. Kaufman, 50, has five hotels under construction. 
 Three of the hotels will share a single, 36-story building on the north side of the street. When it is completed, it will contain a Holiday Inn Express, a Candlewood Suites and a Hampton Inn. Each will have its own signs and lobby, and guest rooms that are outfitted in its signature style. 
 ''But,'' Mr. Kaufman said, ''we have found there are huge economies in building it, structurally, as one building.''
 The Holiday Inn Express will be covered in red and black brick (alternating in three-story stripes); the Hampton Inn, in white and black brick; and the Candlewood Suites, in silvery metal. The effect of putting three different facades on a building just 110 feet wide may be jarring. But it is economics, not aesthetics, that is driving the projects. 
 As Mr. Kaufman explained it, the three-in-one approach will help the eventual owner -- in this case, Gemini Real Estate Advisors -- improve the building's occupancy rate. That's because three reservation systems, not just one, will be helping to fill the building's 600 or so rooms.
 Mr. Kaufman has designed another trio of hotels just a block away, on 40th Street. ''It's becoming a hotel district,'' he said, while showing off designs for adjacent Four Points by Sheraton, Fairfield Inn and Staybridge Suites hotels, each more than 30 stories tall. 
 The chains, which are striving to maintain customer loyalty, want to be able to offer hotels in as many locations as possible. Building several small hotels in different neighborhoods, instead of a single large hotel, helps them achieve that.
 The developer of most of Mr. Kaufman's projects is the McSam Hotel Group, which is based in Great Neck, N.Y. Its chief operating officer, Gary Wisinski, said Mr. Kaufman ''has a wonderful and deep knowledge of Manhattan, and is well respected at the Buildings Department.''
 McSam is developing some 30 hotels in Manhattan, Mr. Wisinski said, and Mr. Kaufman is the architect ''for 90 percent of them.''
 Bill Ryall, a partner in Ryall Porter Architects in Manhattan, said that in a city filled with talented architects, ''it is a sadly missed opportunity that most of these new hotels are designed by just one architect.''
 But Mr. Wisinski said he and his colleagues at McSam were pleased with Mr. Kaufman's designs. ''We look at all of them like our children,'' he said. ''I know some people would like us to build the Plaza. But we're not. We're building mid-price-point lodging facilities.'' Rooms in the hotels, he said, will command $240 to $350 a night, depending on the time of year. 
 Mr. Kaufman's first hotel, in 2003, was a Hampton Inn on West 24th Street in Chelsea. Until five years ago, the chain had more than 1,000 hotels nationwide, but not a single location in Manhattan. The 24th Street property is now one of the highest-performing Hampton Inns in the country, according to Charmaine Easie-Samuels, a spokeswoman for the chain, which is owned by Hilton Hotels. Since then, Mr. Kaufman has designed four more Hampton Inns in Manhattan. 
 What he brings to the table, he said, is the ability to maximize the number of hotel rooms on a given site. Recently, he said, a client showed him another architect's plans for a hotel in Lower Manhattan; Mr. Kaufman was able to alter the plans to squeeze in 25 percent more rooms. In the current market, a mid-range Manhattan hotel room -- typically 250 square feet -- is worth $400,000 to $500,000 to the developer, he said. 
 ''If you get one more room for floor, and you have 20 or 30 floors,'' he said, you may be adding $10 million or $15 million in value.
 But maximizing the number of rooms, he said, involves more than just making them smaller. He said buildings could be organized in ways that eliminate ''uninhabitable space.''
 For hoteliers, Mr. Kaufman provides entree into the sui generis Manhattan market. ''The prototype hotel, for almost any chain, is a low-rise building with a parking lot and swimming pool,'' he said. ''We have to adapt that to Manhattan, but still meet all their standards.'' 
 The chains control every detail, he said, ''down to what kind of breakfast they serve.''
 ''If you don't meet their standards,'' he added, ''you can't put their name on the door.'' 
 Mr. Kaufman found his niche in 1999, when Sam Chang, the founder of McSam, asked him to design a hotel for a narrow site on Pearl Street in the financial district. As Mr. Kaufman recalled it, ''Sam said, 'I'm doing you a big favor,' and he was right'' -- by allowing Mr. Kaufman to get in on the ground floor of a hotel boom that almost no one was predicting.
 ''Until then,'' Mr. Kaufman said, ''the prevailing wisdom was New York City did not need more hotel rooms.'' 
 Mr. Kaufman now has 35 employees, including architects from Russia, Argentina, Colombia, Lebanon, Turkey, Nigeria, Algeria, Albania and Sri Lanka. His wife, Terry Eder-Kaufman, a lawyer, helps run the business. The couple live with their 12-year-old daughter, Maya, in an 1861 brownstone in Greenwich Village, which Mr. Kaufman has renovated in stages. (When he bought it, in 1993, he said, ''We had very, very little money.'') 
 A Queens native and a graduate of Cornell's architecture school, he worked for Rafael Vinoly before starting his firm in 1986 at the age of 28 -- which is young for an architect to go off on his own. 
 ''Even though it may not have been the prudent thing to do from a business point of view, it was something that I felt I had to try,'' he said. ''And 22 years later, I'm still trying.''
 Mr. Kaufman conceded that it's hard to make compelling architecture out of a hotel containing hundreds of identical rooms. ''You can end up with a facade that's very repetitive,'' he said. But he described his buildings as positive additions to the urban fabric. Many of the sites, including two-thirds of the 39th Street property, were previously parking lots, he pointed out. 
 Not all of his projects are chain hotels. The 45-room Duane Street Hotel, near City Hall, is being operated independently. And he is designing apartment buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn. 
 In the case of a six-story apartment building in Williamsburg, Mr. Kaufman chose a shape based on the Villa Savoye, the house outside Paris by Le Corbusier.
 Part of the facade was going to be covered in a mint-colored tile. ''But we didn't get the tile we picked,'' he said, citing cost overruns.
 When it comes to getting things built the way he envisions them, he said, ''people don't know how difficult that is.''

HEADLINE: It's an Election, Not a Revolution

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
IT has become common wisdom that the battle for the presidency is all about the economy. Voters are being told that the country's economic health depends on pulling the right lever in the polling booth. 
 This election is certainly important. But based on the historical record, it isn't likely to result in a major swing in economic policy. Fundamentally, democracy is not a finely tuned mechanism that can be used to direct economic policy as a lever might lift a pulley. The connection between what voters want, or think they want, and what ultimately happens in the economy, is far less direct.
 Voters may be concerned about the economy, but there is little evidence that the electorate, as a whole, really wants to engage in close consideration of economics. The current campaign season is a case in point. 
 On the Democratic side, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama arguably represent the best thinking in their party. Yet voters seem to be making their judgment on the basis of image and style, not substance. Mrs. Clinton has won some state primaries by pulling in votes from Latinos, Asians and single women, while Mr. Obama does better among well-educated voters, the young and African-Americans. Former Senator John Edwards, perhaps the biggest ''policy wonk'' among the original Democratic candidates, never generated much voter support. He was often viewed as the guy with the $400 haircut, rather than as a leading advocate of the redistribution of economic wealth. If we look at opinion polls and actual voting patterns, the Democratic electorate has not been giving very definite economic instructions or making very specific demands.
 On the Republican side, the situation is no better. The candidates have generally sought to cloak themselves in the mantle of Ronald Reagan, emphasizing his conservative principles, particularly his disdain for big government. But they might have stressed how President Reagan improved funding for the Social Security system or how he engineered what was then the largest tax increase in American history. In fact, the economic policies of his administration and that of Bill Clinton were marked by more continuity than change -- and it is no accident that both administrations were happy to work with Alan Greenspan.
 The economic debate is likely to be even less useful in the general election than in the primaries; general election campaigns tend to rely more heavily on the tactics of attack and misrepresentation. And for all the talk about the rising influence of independent voters, independents tend not to be as well informed as the partisans. Many studies have shown that voters who enter the election campaign with very particular views tend to be the ones who take the time and trouble to become well informed. 
 The classic response to such worries is simply to exhort voters to do better and to care more. No one can oppose such calls, but we would be wiser to recognize the limits of elections. 
 To put it simply, the public this year will probably not vote itself into a much better or even much different economic policy. To be sure, the next president -- whoever he or she may be -- may well extend health care coverage to more Americans. But most of the country's economic problems won't be solved at the voting booth. It is already too late to stop an economic downturn. Health care costs will keep rising, no matter who becomes president or which party controls Congress. China is now a bigger carbon polluter than the United States, so don't expect a tax or cap-and-trade rules to solve global warming, even if American measures are very stringent -- and they probably won't be, because higher home heating bills are not a vote winner. A Democratic president may propose more spending on social services, but most of the federal budget is on automatic pilot. Furthermore, even if a Republican president wanted to cut back on such mandates, the bulk of them are here to stay. 
 Yes, the election does matter. Even small differences on economic issues affect millions of Americans. But the record of the Bush administration should prove sobering to all those who expect the American political economy to turn around in the next four years. 
 Many conservative and libertarian economists supported President Bush, thinking they would be getting policy drawn from the work of Milton Friedman and Martin Feldstein, two respected market-oriented economists. Instead, in economics, the Bush years have brought an increase in domestic government spending, and some poorly-thought-out privatization plans. For all the talk of an extreme right-wing revolution, government transfer programs like Social Security and Medicare have continued to grow. And despite big mistakes involving the Iraq war, Mr.Bush wasn't punished by voters in 2004.
 Of course, an administration can make big economic changes. The New Deal brought about a revolution in economic policy -- but those were special circumstances. The United States was in a very deep depression, and the concept of economic planning was sweeping the world. That period is an exception; it does not reflect the general tendency of the American political system, which usually operates by checks and balances. Shifts in economic policy are usually quite moderate.
 The reality is that democracy is a very blunt instrument, and in today's environment we are choosing between ways of muddling through. We may hear that the election is about different visions for America's future, but the pitches may be more akin to selling different brands of soap.
 We hear so many superficial messages precisely because most American voters have neither the knowledge nor the commitment to evaluate the pronouncements of politicians on economic issues. It is no accident that the most influential political science book of the last year has been ''The Myth of the Rational Voter,'' by Bryan Caplan. The book shows that many voters are ill-informed or even irrational; many economic issues are complex, and each voter knows that he or she will not determine the final outcome. 
 Rather than being cynics, we should be realists. Democracy is reasonably good at some things: pushing scoundrels out of office, checking their worst excesses by requiring openness, and simply giving large numbers of people the feeling of having a voice. Democracy is not nearly as good at others: holding politicians accountable for their economic promises or translating the preferences of intellectuals into public policy.
 THAT might sound pessimistic, but it's not. Many Americans will be living longer, finding new sources of learning and recreation, creating more rewarding jobs, striking up new loves and friendships, and, yes, earning more money. Just don't expect most of these gains to come out of the voting booth or, for that matter, Washington.
 And if you're still worrying about how to vote, I have two pieces of advice. First, spend your time studying foreign policy, where the president has more direct power, and the choice of a candidate makes a much bigger difference. Second, stop worrying and get back to work.

HEADLINE: Players on a Bus Ride to Sad Reality

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
 The bus rolled away from a well-fortified hotel amid anytown sights, filled with everyday N.B.A. sounds. Up near the front, Chris Paul picked at a cardboard tray of takeout fried chicken, sharing with Amare Stoudemire the way a good point guard should, when Kobe Bryant walked by, eyeing the midafternoon cuisine, shaking his head.
 ''I remember when I used to be able to eat that stuff and still play 48 minutes,'' said Bryant, the specter of a 30th birthday six months away. 
 Traffic on Canal Street had slowed to a Vegas striplike crawl, announcing the start of another All-Star Weekend. Buildings all around were festooned with posters and the likenesses of players, at least until the bus picked up speed, the skyscrapers gave way to low-slung buildings and finally, in a parking lot alongside a ramp to Interstate 10, to a tent encampment of the homeless.
 Paul, the sharp-eyed rising young star of the hometown Hornets, nudged Stoudemire to take a look at the real New Orleans, not far from downtown and the annual revelry of pro basketball's rich and famous.
 ''This is the community we need to come back,'' Paul said as the bus entered an even more sobering area, New Orleans East, past clusters of unsightly abandoned houses, on to the narrow Wilson Avenue, coming to a halt beside three postage-stamp-home construction sites.
 Paul stepped off the bus and was welcomed back by Habitat for Humanity officials and volunteers. ''I come to help out, do a little bit, just show up,'' he said. 
 It rained on what the N.B.A. called its All-Star Day of Service, not a downpour, but enough to muddy sites, if not dampen spirits. Stoudemire of the Phoenix Suns was along, and Paul Pierce of the Celtics, with his coach, Doc Rivers. Buses with other players, members of the news media and an estimated 2,500 volunteers fanned out around the city in a well-coordinated N.B.A. public-relations makeup call after last year's Las Vegas debacle.
 Handguns, not nail guns, were part of the overriding story at All-Star Weekend in 2007, and even if it was an N.F.L. player, Pacman Jones, who helped instigate the worst of the incidents, it was the N.B.A.'s party, and its choice of site became an alleged reflection of an unflattering hedonism. While hardly a no-risk environment, New Orleans presented the league with the chance to literally build up its image, fix up and feed with an I-Had-a-Hammer photo-op weekend.
 ''A better stage for people to see the positive things the players are doing,'' said Bryant, who left the precision work to others to protect a torn pinkie ligament, hauled some wood and was the camera magnet one would expect the best player in the world to be.
 In Los Angeles, the spotlight always follows Bryant, the Lakers and the N.B.A. Here, the Byron Scott-coached and Paul-led Hornets, returned from their post-Katrina two-year residency in Oklahoma City, have the best record in the Western Conference. But they are ranked 29th in attendance, out of 30 teams, in a city that was not exactly the Mecca of pro basketball before it became an American tragedy.
 David Stern, the N.B.A.'s globally minded commissioner, mused on the long-range possibility of a division in Western Europe during his state of the league address Saturday night. But forget Paris, what about all those struggling domestic markets in Seattle, Memphis, Charlotte and elsewhere? 
 Nowhere, however, is there a moral quandary like the one the Hornets are facing. Can they wait for New Orleans to become whole, economically viable as an N.B.A. market? How much would abandonment undo the good will the league has established through its philanthropy wing, N.B.A. Cares, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity, and by bringing All-Star Weekend here?
 A year after Vegas, you could say the N.B.A. needed New Orleans as much as New Orleans needed the economic benefits of the dunk-and-pony show. Image isn't everything, but for a league often and sometimes unfairly put in the position of explaining itself, it's a crucial thing. So the players performed their afternoon of community service, the cameras recorded almost every nail struck, and if there was any cynicism regarding the staged nature of it all, Doug Stephens asked that it not be expressed around him.
 ''Two and a half years after Katrina, this is not top of the mind and front-page news anymore,'' said Stephens, the Northeast regional development director for Habitat for Humanity. ''Besides the volunteers, the financial support, these players bring media attention.''
 On the bus back to the city, Rivers said he had seen tears brought to the eyes of one of the future owners of the Wilson Avenue homes after the players arrived. He can understand the emotional devastation of property loss in a way most cannot, having had a home in San Antonio burn down 11 years ago. His family photo albums and videos were spared when R. C. Buford, now the Spurs' general manager, happened to pass by the blaze and rushed in to save them.
 ''When it happens to you,'' Rivers said, ''one act of kindness can mean so much.''

HEADLINE: Someone to Speak For Borrowers in Trouble

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
AS she leafed through her client's mortgage papers, the housing loan counselor just shook her head.
 The numbers and interest rates and payment schedules formed such a familiar, dispiriting picture. The 32-year-old man who was sitting across the desk from her said he had been persuaded to take out an adjustable rate mortgage called an option ARM when he bought his home, the first he has owned. The terms of the loan put him in danger of joining millions of people dragged under by the mortgage crisis that has washed through towns and cities across the country.
 But this client, a waiter, had not yet fallen behind on his payments, so there was still time to help him.
 The loan counselor, Judy Brzuskiewicz of New Jersey Citizen Action, a nonprofit advocacy group in Newark, picked up the phone to call the lender, Countrywide Financial, and told the representative that her client still had good credit and needed the 9 percent interest rate on his mortgage lowered, maybe to 6 percent. Politely but insistently, she said the adjustable rate needed to be frozen. 
 ''I'm counting on you,'' she told the representative, who told her that he fielded calls like hers all day long. 
 Day after day, Ms. Brzuskiewicz and counselors like her across the country keep making the same calls, trying to stand between homeowners who say they took out loans they did not comprehend, or could not afford, and foreclosure.
 More than 1.6 million borrowers nationwide defaulted on mortgages last year. A Federal Reserve Bank of New York study of 75 percent of the subprime loans held by homeowners in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut found that as of late last year 9.9 percent of those examined were in foreclosure, or about 12,147 of 123,200.
 The study reviewed 3,356 subprime loans in Bridgeport and found that 334, or 10 percent were in foreclosure. In New Haven, 8.6 percent or 186 of 2,151 subprime loans studied were in foreclosure and in Waterbury, 9.8 percent or 140 of the 1,434 loans studied were in foreclosure.
 The housing counselors are overwhelmed. 
 In Bridgeport, a city that in 2006 had some of the highest subprime lending rates in the state, Julissa Soto, a housing counselor with Acorn, a housing advocacy group, said that demand was so high that the organization recently trained its 21-year-old administrative assistant as a counselor. 
 ''We're totally bombarded,'' said Ms. Soto, who is 25. 
 The homeowners reach out when they are at wits' end, and almost beyond help. ''They're frantic, and they don't know what to do,'' Ms. Soto said. 
 This month, she counseled a family with problems that are becoming more and more typical, requiring that the counselors act both as therapists and financial advisers. A Bridgeport police officer and his wife, a schoolteacher, had taken out a mortgage with an adjustable rate, and their monthly payments now totaled more than $3,000. ''He had perfect credit,'' Ms. Soto said of the officer. ''Their car got repossessed. He feels ashamed that he can't provide for his family.''
 Ms. Soto is trying to negotiate with the lender, Wells Fargo, to freeze the interest rate on the couple's mortgage, but they are already two months behind.
 Last week, the Bush administration worked out a plan with some major mortgage lenders that would allow some homeowners facing foreclosure to delay losing their homes for 30 days. Although the lenders are not required to do so, they can use the 30-day window to agree to more affordable mortgage terms. Borrowers who are at least three months behind on their mortgage payments can apply.
 As the mortgage picture darkens, the housing counselors have seen their roles shift and take on new importance. Where once they mainly counseled first-time home buyers and brokered affordable mortgages, they now take calls from increasing numbers of homeowners in crisis. The counselors negotiate with lenders for lower interest rates, propose payment plans, or -- in the worst cases -- are reduced to offering sympathetic words for those on the verge of foreclosure.
 ''The housing counselors are important intermediaries,'' said Ira Rheingold, the executive director of the Boston-based National Association of Consumer Advocates. ''It's almost impossible for a normal human being to interact with a lender.''
 John Mechem, a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association, acknowledged that lenders were the ''last people'' delinquent borrowers wanted to speak with. 
 ''Our lenders lose between $20,000 and $40,000 for each foreclosure,'' he said. ''There is a real value in having third-party counselors.''
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development accredits more than 2,300 housing counseling agencies across the country and about 200 around the region, providing services like assistance for renters and workshops on predatory lending. But consumer advocates say the counselors are overburdened and always short on cash.
 That could be starting to change. In December, as part of the latest Congressional appropriations bill, lawmakers approved $180 million in new money for counseling and foreclosure prevention, an amount consumer advocates said was unprecedented and underscored the depth of the housing market problem. 
 Ms. Soto, who works primarily with borrowers in Bridgeport, said that sometimes the pressure on families boils over as the counselors watch. One woman came to Ms. Soto after realizing that her husband, who had left her, had also fallen behind on their mortgage. The two visited together and nearly came to blows. 
 ''It was like a soap opera,'' Ms. Soto said.
 She said that another client, an elderly woman who fell behind on her high-interest mortgage, refused to leave her house, fearing the authorities would put padlocks on the door if she went out.
 ''We went to visit her,'' Ms. Soto said. ''She was completely depressed, and the place was a mess. She had just stopped keeping up the house.''
 In the rush to buy a home, borrowers often overlook the red flags in their mortgage papers. Annette Thomas Allen, a housing counselor with the Burlington County Community Action Program in southern New Jersey, said a flood of homeowners were coming into her office now, worried about future adjustments to their interest rates.
 Ms. Allen is trying to help Donea and Cheryl Fish keep the four-bedroom home they bought two years ago. Their mortgage payments have already climbed well past what they say they can pay, and last week, they received their first foreclosure notice.
 ''The mortgage was confusing, and there are a lot of things I should have questioned,'' said Mr. Fish, who works as a mechanic. ''I was just happy to get a house.'' 
 Mrs. Fish said her own attempts to negotiate with the lender, Saxon Home Mortgage, have gone nowhere. She said she was relying on Ms. Allen. ''I'm scared,'' she added. 
 The 32-year-old man in Newark said he found Ms. Brzuskiewicz only after friends told him he should get advice on his loan.
 He said he had bought a two-family home, in Bloomfield. But even though he had been able to keep a tenant, his mortgage contained perilous traps -- a large ''balloon payment'' at the end of the loan, along with a penalty for early prepayment. Ms. Brzuskiewicz tried to explain the details to him. 
 After they had finished speaking with the Countrywide Financial representative, the man left, saying he did not believe the bank would be able to help him. Ms. Brzuskiewicz said they would wait to see some sort of an agreement in writing. She worked till 9 that night, writing the appeal on his behalf.

A Statesman Without Borders
 In his excellent article on Bernard Kouchner, James Traub (Feb. 3) attributes the aphorism ''pessimism of the intelligence, optimism of the will'' to Antonio Gramsci. This beautiful phrase actually comes from Romain Rolland, the French Nobel Prize-winning novelist, playwright and intellectual. Gramsci borrowed the line as the motto of his newspaper, L'Ordine Nuovo, appreciating its condensation of the revolutionary socialist process and the role of the radical intellectual. Kouchner is more Rollandist than Gramscian, especially given his critique of authoritarianism and blindness of the left.
 Romain Rolland and Bernard Kouchner have a great deal in common, including a lifelong engagement with human rights issues, a cosmopolitan internationalism, a profound sensitivity to misery in the developing world and a strong emotional as well as intellectual resistance to human suffering and forms of injustice. He, too, was a man without borders, who was intensely critical of all nationalisms, including French cultural nationalism. 
 DAVID JAMES FISHER
 Los Angeles
 James Traub notes that after ''halfheartedly supporting Segolene Royal,'' Bernard Kouchner ''threw himself into a campaign to become the head of the World Health Organization. This, too, failed. Kouchner was at sixes and sevens. Then President Sarkozy called.''
 Any port in a storm? If the Front National had by some miracle won the election and Jean-Marie Le Pen had summoned Kouchner to join his cabinet, might he just conceivably have said yes too? After all, if you like George W. Bush, what's really not to like about Le Pen?

 Back-Room Choices
 As an example of how fluid the nominating process has become, Matt Bai (Feb. 3) cites the failure of the Culinary Workers Union to deliver its members to Barack Obama in Nevada. ''Even union workers,'' Bai writes, ''once considered a monolithic bloc, no longer blindly follow their leaders' dictates.''
 Out of curiosity, I leafed back through the ''labor'' entry I'd written for ''The Encyclopedia of American Political History,'' and this is what I found for the 1984 campaign. Although Walter Mondale was labor's choice, Gary Hart got 30 percent of the union vote in the primaries, Jesse Jackson got 20 percent and in the general election, Reagan got 47 percent. 
 This last was a special cause for chagrin, to be sure, but it also bespoke the fact that there was not then, nor ever had been, a ''monolithic bloc'' of voters under labor's command. It was precisely because voting preference trumped union loyalty for American workers that the movement never developed a European-style labor politics.

 Much About History
 I must take issue with the Ethicist's response (Feb. 3) to the professor writing about a doctoral candidate in history who subscribes to the so-called ''young earth'' theory. 
 To suggest that a person who subscribes to a belief that has no basis in science (or, some would suggest, in biblical scholarship) should not be held accountable for a disregard of the scholarly nature of research simply because her ignorance is unrelated to her chosen field of study is to degrade the entire nature of the academic enterprise. A Ph.D. ought to indicate that the one who earns it possesses both a keen intellect and the discipline and desire to focus that intellect on whatever scholarly endeavor she undertakes.
 THE REV. MARK A. JENKINS 
 Garden City, Mich.
 While I don't disagree with the Ethicist that the M.A. student holds an archaic viewpoint about the time frame of creation, I find myself irritated by his characterizations of her belief as ''young-earth nonsense'' and ''young-earth nuttiness.'' The Ethicist admonishes the history professor for a judgmental attitude (''you should judge her on her scholarship, not her spiritual life''). Yet doesn't he, in effect, put down the student by calling her ideas stupid and nutty?

 Old-School Economics
 Christopher Caldwell (Jan. 27) argues that because America now possesses a ''new economy,'' with more security guards than machinists, presidential candidates who express concern over our ailing manufacturing sector are engaged in ''folkloric'' pandering. The true folklore, however, is the perception that our new economy represents progress. Middle-class Americans borrow to maintain their standard of living, as well-paid manufacturing jobs, like machinists, are replaced by lower-paid ''new economy'' jobs, like security guards. Masters of the new economy on Wall Street make millions on financial alchemy that ultimately weakens our economy further. One hopes that our next president will recognize that ''choreographers, blackjack dealers and security guards'' can never form the ''backbone'' of a strong economy and take steps to revive America's industrial base.

 Clean Look
 Rob Walker's article (Consumed, Feb. 3) on Tide's iconic design gives a brief but revealing look at the culture of overthinking that inundates the marketing community. Consultants with fancy titles and advanced degrees are ready to offer complex answers to even the simplest questions. For example, Walker quotes a Ph.D. in art history who describes Tide's logo as ''almost a baroque composition'' full of ''great dynamic tension.''
 In the case of Tide's logo, the experts missed one simple point -- longevity -- that is at least as responsible for its iconic status as its semiotic underpinnings.
 Tide has been around a very long time. Its logo is a classic in large part because consumers are so familiar with it. TED MANGER

HEADLINE: For Israel, Gaza Offers A Range of Risky Choices

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Israel hoped that by pulling its settlers and troops from Gaza in 2005, it would also leave behind responsibility for the Gazans. With help from the West and some Arab nations, Israelis thought, the Palestinian Authority could begin to create a prosperous state, as if the continuing Israeli occupation of the West Bank were somehow irrelevant.
 It was a case of wishful thinking. As rockets continue to fall on Israeli towns and Israeli politicians call for harsh retaliation, the country faces an acute quandary in Gaza. Israel is trying to contain a new form of polity: a nonsovereign, semioccupied semistate controlled by Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union and is officially committed to the destruction of the country obligated to provide it with fuel, electricity, water and food. 
 Israeli politicians are demanding the assassination of Hamas leaders and a major military incursion to stop the rockets. Yet Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have been preaching patience.
 But now, with the Winograd report into the failures of Mr. Olmert's war against Hezbollah safely behind him, a government information campaign is trying to justify a major military operation in Gaza. Israeli officials argue that Hamas is becoming Hezbollah, a sophisticated military organization threatening regional stability.
 Since June, when Hamas forces routed Fatah in Gaza, the territory has become ''Hamastan,'' said Haim Ramon, a vice prime minister and a close ally of Mr. Olmert. 
 ''This is not a terrorist group hiding in a state,'' Mr. Ramon said. ''They are the state, and they are a terrorist organization that refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist.'' 
 Gaza, however, is not a state, but part of an occupied Palestinian entity, which is Israel's problem.
 Mr. Ramon supports peace talks with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and a simultaneous ''war against Hamastan,'' as he put it. ''No society in the world provides fuel and electricity to a country rocketing it,'' he said, although Israeli cuts in supplies to Gaza have already brought fierce criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups about ''collective punishment'' of civilians and even cautions from Washington. 
 The foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, took diplomats to the Gaza border on Wednesday and warned them that ''the situation in the region is unbearable, and the threat of terror from Gaza is growing larger from year to year.'' The problem is not simply the rockets, she said, ''but also the strengthening of the terror organizations.'' She added, ''Israel must act to reduce these threats.''
 Fine, but how, exactly? Shlomo Brom, a retired general at the Institute for National Security Studies, says that none of the military options are especially attractive. To stop rockets, as the army learned in Lebanon, Israel must occupy the launching zones.
 But the range of the rockets is improving. ''That means seizing most of Gaza,'' Mr. Brom said, ''and no one in Israel other than the fringe right has the appetite to reoccupy the Gaza Strip.'' The Israeli Army would win easily, Mr. Brom said, ''but it takes a long time, and for what? To regain rule over 1.5 million Palestinians? What's the exit strategy?''
 Such an operation could make it impossible for Mr. Abbas, of Fatah, to continue peace talks with Israel, no matter how much he would like to see Hamas weakened or removed from power in Gaza.
 Other military options include intensifying current operations against Hamas, but that would not stop the rockets. Ground operations with limited goals -- making sure Ashkelon is out of range, for example -- could mean retaking northern Gaza and a wide swath next to the Gaza-Egypt border to diminish weapons smuggling.
 Killing Hamas leaders could also deter attacks, but might have unexpected consequences, like a new campaign of suicide bombings.
 Amos Oz, Israel's most famous writer, warned, ''Israel must not fall into the trap that Hamas is laying for us and march into Gaza.'' He added: ''The occupying force will not have a single quiet day. Nor will Sderot,'' an Israeli town that is often the target of Palestinian rockets. 
 There is another option, he noted, which would be to negotiate the cease-fire with Hamas that its leaders have been proposing. Diplomats say that Egypt, stung by the border crisis, is working on an ambitious package -- an exchange of prisoners, including Cpl. Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured in Gaza in June 2006, and possibly the jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti; a long-term cease-fire in Gaza; and reopening the Gaza-Egypt border.
 Israel is likely to be cautious. Completing a deal with Hamas would further undermine Mr. Abbas, when Israeli and Western policy is to strengthen him and weaken Hamas. 
 A long-term cease-fire might bring quiet to Sderot, but it would also allow Hamas to regroup, rearm, continue to improve its military capacities and strengthen its political and security hold over Gaza.
 Still, as Bernard Avishai, author of ''The Hebrew Republic,'' points out, Israel has a cease-fire with Hezbollah, just as rejectionist as Hamas, coupled with a disengagement of forces. ''You have to stop the cycle of violence,'' he said. ''Israel can't win a war in Gaza, but it can't lose a Gazan peace.''
 A former national security adviser, Giora Eiland, wants to use the threat of harsh military and economic sanctions not to defeat Hamas, but to persuade it to stop the rocket fire -- or else. Mr. Eiland proposes a deal: cease-fire, prisoner exchange, normal fuel and electricity supplies, and a reopened, monitored Egyptian border.
 If Hamas refuses, he proposes a very hard stick: the bombing of Gaza's ministries, police stations and infrastructure; a halt in the supply of goods, fuel and electricity; and the economic separation of Gaza from the West Bank.
 It is an unlikely solution, given the international outcry that would follow. A better answer might be a rapid peace treaty creating a Palestinian state, supported by the Arab League and isolating Hamas, with international troops helping to patrol the borders. 
 But because Israel and Hamas have little interest in a final settlement now, that seems like more wishful thinking.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a news analysis article on Sunday about Israel's quandary in deciding what to do about the control of Gaza by the militant Islamic group Hamas misidentified the location where an Israeli soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, was captured in June 2006. It was in Israel, not Gaza. (He was later taken to Gaza.)

HEADLINE: A Smiling, Fidgeting McCain, Learning to Rein Himself In

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
So this is what it looks like when the maverick becomes The Man.
 Senator John McCain was sitting in the front of his fancy-pants front-runner's plane, trying to get comfortable. He fidgeted, occasionally lapsing into un-McCainlike blandness: ''There is a process in place that will formalize the methodology,'' he said in describing how his free-form campaign style will assume the discipline expected of a probable Republican standard-bearer.
 The position is unnatural to Mr. McCain, who has typically floundered when not playing the insurgent role. But now he is in the midst of an at-times awkward transition -- from being one of the most disruptive figures in his party to someone playing it safer, not to mention trying to make nice with Republicans he clearly despises and who feel similarly about him. 
 ''I'm trying to unify the party,'' he says a lot these days, as if reminding himself. He is trying to remain ''Johnny B. Goode'' (the song blares over a loudspeaker at some McCain rallies), giving relatively cautious answers and trying to rein in his pugnacity, if not his wisecracks. 
 On a flight from Burlington, Vt., to Warwick, R.I., on Thursday, Mr. McCain volunteered that Brooke Buchanan, his spokeswoman who was seated nearby and rolling her eyes, ''has a lot of her money hidden in the Cayman Islands'' and that she earned it by ''dealing drugs.'' Previously, Mr. McCain has identified Ms. Buchanan as ''Pat Buchanan's illegitimate daughter,'' ''bipolar,'' ''a drunk,'' ''someone with a lot of boyfriends'' and ''just out of Betty Ford.'' 
 It is only a matter of time before some viewer, listener or reader complains -- recovering addicts, for example, mental illness sufferers, or, for that matter, Pat Buchanan himself. 
 One of the trademarks of Mr. McCain's rebel image has been his inability to cloak his emotions, especially anger. He has been prone to volcanic blowups over the years. And while he would hardly be the first president with a temper, Mr. McCain has been ever vigilant of late about resisting provocation.
 He mentioned his recent appearance in Washington before the Conservative Political Action Conference. (No adoring audience, the conventiongoers favored Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, in a straw poll, even though Mr. Romney had quit the race.) 
 ''They booed me when I brought up immigration,'' Mr. McCain said. ''And, automatically, I just smiled.'' 
 He repeated himself -- ''Smile! Smile!'' -- as if recreating an internal exercise that ensured this triumph of self-possession.
 Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who backed Mr. Romney in this year's race, said Mr. McCain, of Arizona, deserved credit for having gone through the entire campaign ''under stressful conditions'' without any memorable outbursts. 
 ''Does he have a capacity to control it?'' asked Mr. Santorum, referring to Mr. McCain's detonations. ''Over the course of the campaign, I think he has managed to. But I think it is a legitimate cause for concern.''
 The more famous McCain outbursts have been widely recalled in recent months, in part courtesy of the Romney campaign, which circulated a ''Top 10 List'' of Mr. McCain's explosions.
 The perception that he struggles to control his anger makes Mr. McCain angry. ''I know I sound a little bit defensive,'' he said. ''But for the last 10 years, I've had very little significant disagreement with my colleagues, certainly not personal ones.''
 That's not exactly true: fellow senators and staff members cite more recent dust-ups involving profanities, red-faced exchanges and quick-trigger reactions. Still, only one entry on Mr. McCain's Greatest Fits list occurred in the last year. He complains that people keep invoking ''a problem I had with Chuck Grassley,'' referring to the debate in which he shouted unprintable profanities at his Republican colleague from Iowa. ''It was 12, 14 years ago,'' Mr. McCain said. (It was, in fact, 16.)
 Part of being ''presidential'' and ''uniting the party'' involves grinning and bearing a wide variety of grievances -- in Mr. McCain's case, from anti-immigration activists, right-wing talk show hosts and the many lawmakers and lobbyists Mr. McCain has crossed, undermined, annoyed and overshadowed over the years.
 In addition to winning over his adversaries, Mr. McCain, 71, confronts many obstacles these days, all formidable. He faces well-financed and determined -- if not unified -- Democrats, questions about his age, and mounting fears about the economy (not his strong suit, he admits).
 But Mr. McCain's chief encumbrance might be himself, namely, his historic inability to play the role of go-along-get-along leader. His flirtation with being the front-runner early last year resulted in near disaster. He has charmed the news media with his quippy and accessible style, and made his political name as a party renegade. 
 Being on top with a growing staff, greater scrutiny and all the ''best behavior'' that demands does not necessary play to his strengths. ''If he tries to be someone else, that's a prescription for disaster,'' said Bob Stevenson, a Republican strategist who was an aide to Bill Frist, the former Senate majority leader. 
 ''But once you become the nominee of the party,'' Mr. Stevenson said, ''you begin a transition into a different role, and that transition might be steeper for John McCain than some previous nominees.''
 It is with some satisfaction -- and irony -- that Mr. McCain cataloged the list of longtime Republican adversaries who have lined up in the last week to support him. ''John Cornyn endorsed me,'' Mr. McCain boasted in the interview, referring to the Republican senator from Texas at whom he directed a well-publicized string of profanities in a meeting last year.
 So did Ted Stevens, Mr. McCain said, referring to the longtime senator from Alaska whose enmity for Mr. McCain -- and vice versa -- is well known. ''It was pretty short,'' Mr. McCain said of the Stevens endorsement.
 ''Thad Cochran endorsed me, too,'' Mr. McCain marveled, referring to a very brief statement from the Republican senator from Mississippi who recently told The Boston Globe that the thought of Mr. McCain as president ''sends a cold chill down my spine.'' 
 Mr. Cochran, who declined to comment for this article, went on to call his longtime colleague ''erratic,'' ''hotheaded'' and someone who ''loses his temper'' and ''worries me.''
 Mr. McCain said he encountered Mr. Cochran on the Senate floor on Wednesday and the two exchanged a pro forma hug. There was no mention of Mr. Cochran's criticisms. ''What's the point?'' Mr. McCain said. The point -- or one point -- is that an earlier version of Mr. McCain might have approached Mr. Cochran with less gracious intent. 
 In the course of a day on the stump, he demonstrated repeatedly that the Old McCain was being retooled on the fly. As his bus wound through Boston on Thursday, Mr. McCain began to tell the gathered-around reporters a sweet story about Senator Edward M. Kennedy. It is an anecdote he has told publicly many times -- about how Mr. Kennedy arranged an elaborate birthday celebration for Mr. McCain's son Jimmy when he turned 11. 
 But Mr. McCain knows that public appreciation for Ted Kennedy is not the best way to win over the Republican base, so he prefaced the story with a request thatit not be attributed to him. (Although he has told the story on the record many times.) 
 Mr. McCain was stretched out on a velour-covered seat, holding court. He was on his way to put a happy face on a pained encounter -- an endorsement by Mr. Romney, a man whom Mr. McCain's campaign had not long ago derided as a phony, flailing flip-flopper. 
 Reporters tried to incite Mr. McCain into a wisecrack. One asked if Mr. Romney had ''flip-flopped'' on his view of Mr. McCain. Mr. McCain grinned tightly, and spoke of how grateful he was for Mr. Romney's support.
 Upon arriving at Mr. Romney's soon-to-close headquarters, Mr. McCain stood dutifully for a photo op. The onetime adversaries gripped and grinned behind a lectern, standing about as far away as two people shaking hands possibly can.
 Mr. McCain stood to the side while his taller, tanner and better-rested former rival called him ''a true American hero.'' 
 In turn, the front-runner praised Mr. Romney for running a ''hard, intensive, fine, honorable'' campaign. ''I respect him enormously,'' Mr. McCain said, looking solemn, before catching himself and flashing an autopilot smile.

HEADLINE: Political Baseball on Capitol Hill

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 I am gratified that Representative Henry A. Waxman regrets shaming a man struggling to save a legacy, and shamelessly thanking an ex-cop whose excuse for selling illegal drugs was that he did what others wanted. Even if they are equal before the law, they are not equal in real life.
 The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform should reimburse the American people for this episode of ''Survivor: Capitol Hill.'' Americans are dying in war, losing their homes and their jobs, and the nation's leadership natters on about Roger Clemens's buttocks? Congress needs performance-enhancing drugs. 
 Mary Lee Grisanti
 Stamford, Conn.
 To the Sports Editor:
 Shame on you, Roger Clemens (and your high-priced lawyers) for wasting the valuable time of our Congress. You not only did not convince us of your innocence, but also stole our taxes in defending your own arrogant ego. Those four hours might have been better spent on more universally pressing issues.
 And shame on Representative Henry A. Waxman for entertaining Roger Clemens's ridiculous request to testify. At least Waxman conceded his error. Courtney Taylor
 Medford, N.J.
 To the Sports Editor:
 We all know how much Washington is divided along partisan lines. But who would have thought that partisanship would invade the Congressional hearings into whether a baseball player had taken performance-enhancing drugs? 
 It is easy enough to see why the Democrats would fail to believe Roger Clemens. The best available evidence implicates Clemens, and he did nothing credible to refute that testimony when he had the chance. He also has strong motivation, if guilty, to lie; the Hall of Fame and his reputation are at stake.
 So why are the Republicans lining up behind him? Is it because Clemens is from Texas? Is he a contributor to the Republican Party? Is it a matter of economic class, rallying behind the millionaire Clemens?
 Or is it something even more elemental, and sadly emblematic of the sorry state of our political life. Are the Republicans and the Democrats on opposite sides in this case simply because they always have to disagree? Val C. Hart
 Cumberland, Me.
 To the Sports Editor:
 I find it distressing that Democrats and Republicans cannot investigate steroid and human growth hormone use in professional sports without taking sides. This is a relatively straightforward issue.
 How much confidence can any of us have that our elected officials will work together on the most pressing issues facing our nation: the war in Iraq, health care, the economy and education? I am not optimistic, regardless of who wins the election in November. Karla Stuempfle Msall
 Chicago 
 To the Sports Editor:
 Representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican, described the questioning of Roger Clemens by a Congressional panel as a lynching. The term lynching originated from the actions of an 18th-century citizen of Davis's home state, Charles Lynch, and came to refer to mob executions, predominantly of African-Americans.
 A congressman should know better than to compare the aggressive questioning of a skilled athlete who has nothing more than his reputation at stake with the sordid history of mob torture and murder that left thousands of innocent victims dead. The Golf Channel anchor Kelly Tilghman recently apologized after inappropriately using the word lynch, and Davis ought to as well.
 Joel Howell, M.D. 
 Ann Arbor, Mich.
 To the Sports Editor:
 When Roger Clemens, facing a hearing before a House committee, visits the individual members of that committee before giving his testimony, isn't this tantamount to jury tampering? Janet Prince
 Hamden, Conn.
 To the Sports Editor:
 Murray Chass batted 1.000 when he criticized the adolescent, star-struck behavior of 19 members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform who welcomed Roger Clemens to give private previews of his testimony at the Congressional hearing. One issue not mentioned was the monetary value of the photographs taken and autographs gathered, which can only increase as time goes on, regardless of the outcome of these hearings. Muriel Neufeld 
 Great Neck, N.Y.
 To the Sports Editor:
 Not being a sports fan, I can easily snort over the Congressional hearings on Clemens's truthfulness or lack thereof. But don't our elected officials -- and by extension, we as a nation -- have better things to do? This waste of time at taxpayer expense, not to mention attention and energy, has gone on far too long.
 What can voters and taxpayers do to reverse this madness? I am open to suggestions.
 Daphna Gregg-Gibson

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Starts to Turn Its Face to the Sun

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CAN Silicon Valley become a world leader in cheap and ubiquitous solar panels for the masses?
 Given the valley's tremendous success in recent years with such down-to-earth products as search engines and music players, tackling solar power might seem improbable. Yet some of the valley's best brains are captivated by the challenge, and they hope to put the development of solar technologies onto a faster track. 
 There is, after all, a precedent for how the valley tries to approach such tasks, and it's embodied in Moore's Law, the maxim made famous by the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. Moore's Law refers to rapid improvements in computer chips -- which would be accompanied by declining prices. 
 A link between Moore's Law and solar technology reflects the engineering reality that computer chips and solar cells have a lot in common. 
 ''A solar cell is just a big specialized chip, so everything we've learned about making chips applies,'' says Paul Saffo, an associate engineering professor at Stanford and a longtime observer of Silicon Valley. 
 Financial opportunity also drives innovators to exploit the solar field. ''This is the biggest market Silicon Valley has ever looked at,'' says T. J. Rogers, the chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor, which is part-owner of the SunPower Corporation, a maker of solar cells in San Jose, Calif. 
 Mr. Rogers, who is also chairman of SunPower, says the global market for new energy sources will ultimately be larger than the computer chip market. 
 ''For entrepreneurs, energy is going to be cool for the next 30 years,'' he says.
 Optimism about creating a ''Solar Valley'' in the geographic shadow of computing all-stars like Intel, Apple and Google is widespread among some solar evangelists. 
 ''The solar industry today is like the late 1970s when mainframe computers dominated, and then Steve Jobs and I.B.M. came out with personal computers,'' says R. Martin Roscheisen, the chief executive of Nanosolar, a solar company in San Jose, Calif.
 Nanosolar shipped its first ''thin film'' solar panels in December, and the company says it ultimately wants to produce panels that are both more efficient in converting sunlight into electricity and less expensive than today's versions. Dramatic improvements in computer chips over many years turned the PC and the cellphone into powerful, inexpensive appliances -- and the foundation of giant industries. Solar enterprises are hoping for the same outcome. 
 To be sure, Silicon Valley's love affair with solar could be short-lived.
 ''We've seen a lot of pipe dreams in the industry over the years, a lot of wild claims never came through,'' says Lisa Frantzis, a specialist in renewable energy at Navigant Consulting in Burlington, Mass. 
 Another brake on the pace of solar innovation might be consumer behavior. It often can be hard to get consumers to change their habits, and homeowners may be slow to swap out expensive water heaters for newfangled solar solutions. Reliability is also an issue: while current solar technologies have proved relatively durable, it's unknown how resilient the next generation of solar will be.
 ''We need technologies that can survive on a rooftop for 20 years,'' says Barry Cinnamon, chief executive of Akeena Solar Inc. of Los Gatos, Calif., a designer and installer of solar systems. 
 Affordable solar development is also still dependent on government subsidies.
 ''Mass adoption requires technological innovations that dramatically lower costs,'' says Peter Rive, the chief operations officer of SolarCity in Foster City, Calif., a system designer and installer.
 So what does the valley bring to the mix? Expertise in miniaturization and a passion for novelty among its entrepreneurs.
 ''There are suddenly a lot of new ideas coming into this field,'' says Paul Alivisatos, a professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, who also has his own solar start-up. 
 One novel approach is called ''solar thermal,'' which uses large mirrors to generate steam to run conventional turbines that generate electricity. 
 In 2006, Vinod Khosla, a veteran venture capitalist best known as a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, discovered an obscure Australian company, Ausra, pursuing solar thermal. He persuaded the management of Ausra to move to Silicon Valley and helped it raise money. 
 Ausra recently signed a deal with PG&E, the big California utility company, to supply a large solar plant. ''The best work in solar is happening in Silicon Valley,'' Mr. Khosla says.
 Another exciting area is thin-film solar, in which cells are created in roughly the same way that memory is created on dense storage devices like hard-disk drives -- allowing the nascent industry to tap into the valley's expertise. 
 At Nanosolar, for instance, some of those in top management come directly from Seagate Technology and I.B.M., two traditional titans in computer storage.
 The promise of Solar Valley has investors opening their wallets as never before. But some worry that promising technologies of today must be renewed, and quickly, if the logic of Moore's Law is to define solar. 
 ''There's a lot of money being thrown at the problem and that's healthy; it gives it a real chance of succeeding,'' Mr. Alivisatos says. ''But so much of our effort is going into short-term victories that I worry our pipeline will go dry in 10 years.'' 
 The fear of a solar bubble is legitimate, but after years of stagnation, entrepreneurs say the recent developments in the field are welcome. Long ignored by the most celebrated entrepreneurs in the land and now embraced as one of the next big things, solar energy may gain traction because of a simpler rule than Moore's Law: where there's a will, there's a way.

CHASING THE FLAME 
 Sergio Vieira de Mello and the Fight to Save the World. 
 By Samantha Power. 
 Illustrated. 622 pp. The Penguin Press. $32.95. 
 On Aug. 19, 2003, a Kamash truck pulled into the alley behind the Canal Hotel in Baghdad and a bomb detonated, crumpling a corner of the United Nations' mission in Iraq. Inside the building was Sergio Vieira de Mello, a Brazilian-born United Nations official who had previously served in Vietnam, Lebanon, Cyprus, Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo and East Timor. More than anyone else at the United Nations, he embodied the organization's idealism, as well as its limitations. Vieira de Mello was pinned under the rubble and hung on for several hours before dying. The ineffectual efforts of American forces to save him were a harbinger of the larger American failure in Iraq. 
 Samantha Power, whose earlier book, '''A Problem From Hell': America and the Age of Genocide,'' won a Pulitzer Prize, has written a comprehensive biography of Vieira de Mello that explains how his personal evolution paralleled that of the United Nations and how his contradictions and failures were rooted in those of the institution he so loyally served. Vieira de Mello was born in 1948. The son of a Brazilian diplomat, he was a prototypical global cosmopolitan who grew up in Europe and, as a student, manned the barricades during the evenements of 1968 in Paris while studying Marxist philosophy. The young Vieira de Mello was instinctively anti-American and cringed when he heard an American accent. After earning his degree, he found work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, traveling to southern Sudan, Mozambique and Vietnam, and passionately embracing the United Nations and international law as the embodiments of global justice. 
 But the organization's approach was fraught with internal contradictions that were rudely exposed in the genocidal crises of the mid-1990s. Before the end of the cold war, its peacekeeping operations involved interspersing lightly armed international troops to separate combatants who had signed peace deals and providing humanitarian assistance. The United Nations racked up some successes in places like Namibia, El Salvador and Mozambique, where security conditions were not terribly demanding.
 After 1991, however, the number of peacekeeping initiatives exploded, painfully revealing the United Nations' limitations. Its ethic of strict political neutrality between warring parties ended up favoring aggressors like the Serbs in Bosnia and Kosovo. Moreover, the peacekeepers' restrictive rules of engagement prohibited them from firing their weapons, even in self-defense. This led to disgraceful episodes like the one in Rwanda in 1994 when Belgian peacekeepers abandoned the Tutsis to rampaging Hutu militias.
 The fact of the matter is that some conflicts simply cannot be solved without resort to power: the Bosnian war ended only when the Croatian Army and NATO air power attacked Serbian forces, while ethnic cleansing against the Albanians in Kosovo was stopped only through NATO bombing of Serbia itself. But the United Nations -- and Vieira de Mello as its representative -- was so fixated on its traditional role as neutral arbiter that it actively sought to prevent the use of air power by NATO. Without being able to deploy force to fix the underlying cause of conflict, even the best-intentioned humanitarian interventions often had the perverse effect of prolonging conflict. 
 Samantha Power argues that Vieira de Mello underwent a personal evolution that tracked the United Nations' experiences. In his early days he carried the United Nations habit of being nonjudgmental to an extreme: he dined with the bloody Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary; he cultivated a friendship with Slobodan Milosevic (which earned him the nickname ''Serbio''). ''Chasing the Flame'' is critical of Vieira de Mello for, in the words of one of his colleagues, ''siding with power'' when he helped organize forced returns of refugees to Vietnam and Rwanda. But the book is not entirely convincing in its claim that by the end of the 1990s, Vieira de Mello had concluded that the United Nations needed to shift from peacekeeping to peace enforcement as part of a new, global ''responsibility to protect.'' If he believed such a thing, he never articulated the view or disavowed the earlier United Nations posture as fundamentally broken, as Kofi Annan was eventually to do. 
 When the Bush administration came into office in 2001, it took what it regarded as the lessons of the 1990s a little too much to heart. No longer would the United States be tied down by the political correctness of multilateral organizations; instead, it would act first and seek international legitimation later. The Iraq war was the direct result. 
 Vieira de Mello's ill-fated mission to Baghdad was a particularly bitter pill for the United Nations to swallow. It was no secret that the organization's staff almost universally opposed the invasion, and yet Kofi Annan insisted on sending a large team to Baghdad to prove that the United Nations was still relevant. Once in Iraq, Vieira de Mello found his mission distrusted and marginalized by L. Paul Bremer's Coalition Provisional Authority, a fact that did not prevent Al Qaeda in Iraq from making the United Nations one of its first civilian targets. Sadly, the United States could have greatly profited from the nation-building expertise of a man like Vieira de Mello. 
 In the wake of the Iraq debacle, the idea that strong countries like the United States should use their power to defend human rights or promote democracy around the world has become widely discredited. From an overmilitarized foreign policy, we are in danger of going to the opposite extreme, forgetting the lessons of the 1990s that hard power is sometimes needed to resolve political conflicts, and that we do not yet have an adequate set of international institutions to deploy it legitimately and effectively. 
 ''Chasing the Flame'' argues, as Vieira de Mello himself once did, that the United Nations is often unfairly blamed for failures to protect the vulnerable or deter aggression, when the real failure is that of the great powers standing behind it. Those powers are seldom willing to give it sufficient resources, attention and boots on the ground to accomplish the ambitious mandates they set for it. At present, the United Nations is involved in eight separate peacekeeping operations in Africa alone; failure in a high-profile case like Darfur (which seems likely) will once again discredit the organization. Power (who has been a foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama) makes the case for powerful countries like the United States putting much greater effort into making the institution work. 
 In the end, the book does not make a persuasive case that the United Nations will ever be able to evolve into an organization that can deploy adequate amounts of hard power or take sides in contentious political disputes. Its weaknesses as a bureaucracy and its political constraints make it very unlikely that the United States and other powerful countries will ever delegate to it direct control over their soldiers or trust it with large sums of money. But surely the life and death of Sergio Vieira de Mello is a good place to begin a serious debate about the proper way to manage world order in the future.

HEADLINE: Obama Adding Detail to His Oratory

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: EAU CLAIRE, Wis. 

 BODY:
If he does say so himself, Senator Barack Obama delivers a fine political speech.
 ''Don't be fooled by this talk about speeches versus solutions,'' Mr. Obama told a crowd of Wisconsin voters. ''It's true, I give a good speech. What do I do? Nothing wrong with that.''
 To that confident strain of self-assessment, the audience roared with approval. 
 A shrug of the shoulders and a few deadpanned retorts, some of which stop just shy of mocking his rival, is the latest approach Mr. Obama has taken to respond to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's criticism that his words offer more poetry than substance. 
 Yet as he traveled across Wisconsin last week, Mr. Obama seemed to have let loose a little more of his inner-wonk, which his strategists had once urged him to keep on the shelf. 
 Even as he was dismissing Mrs. Clinton's criticism, he appeared to be taking it at least mildly to heart -- a suggestion that as a line of attack, she might be on to something.
 Suddenly, he was injecting a few more specifics into his campaign speeches. Giant rallies that had sustained his candidacy through a coast-to-coast series of contests on Feb. 5, notable for their rhetorical flourishes and big applause lines, were supplemented with policy speeches and town-hall-style meetings, complete with the question-and-answer sessions he abandoned as he roared out of Iowa and into New Hampshire. (In hindsight, he conceded as he reviewed a defeat to Mrs. Clinton, that was a mistake.)
 By every indication, this was not a random change in the Obama style. The senator decided to clue in his audience to the shift on a recent morning in Janesville, Wis., where he presented an economic proposal to create seven million jobs over the next decade.
 ''Today, I want to take it down a notch,'' said Mr. Obama, of Illinois, standing on the floor of a General Motors plant. ''This is going to be a speech that is a little more detailed. It's going to be a little bit longer, with not too many applause lines.''
 After raising more money, winning more states and garnering more votes than Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama has demonstrated a new air of certainty. But advisers said despite his questionable flares of confidence -- acknowledging to audiences, for example, that he believed he did in fact give a good speech -- he was mindful of being too sure of himself at this unfinished moment in the Democratic nomination fight. And clearly the criticisms by Mrs. Clinton -- and, not incidentally, by Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee -- that Mr. Obama is a candidate with more flash than substance are being taken as something of a warning shot.
 Before Mrs. Clinton arrived Saturday evening in Wisconsin, appearing at the same state Democratic Party dinner in Milwaukee as Mr. Obama, she spent days criticizing her rival while campaigning in Ohio, where the primary is March 4. In city after city, she warned voters about politicians who offered oratory steeped with big promises but ultimately did not deliver.
 ''Speeches don't put food on the table,'' said Mrs. Clinton, of New York. ''Speeches don't fill up your tank, or fill your prescription, or do anything about that stack of bills that keeps you up at night.''
 The long-distance message -- ''My opponent gives speeches; I offer solutions'' -- clearly was heard here in Wisconsin. Barely hours after Mrs. Clinton introduced the line in Ohio, Mr. Obama had woven the words into his speech as a new punch line. (By contrast, he did not acknowledge the criticism from Mr. McCain, who said Mr. Obama's speeches had been ''singularly lacking in specifics.'')
 Here in Eau Claire on Saturday, as Mr. Obama spoke to more than 3,000 people, he devoted several minutes to addressing Mrs. Clinton's criticism. The response, advisers said, was designed to crystallize support among those who had already made up their minds in the race and were choosing Mr. Obama.
 Why else would a candidate repeat the attack lines used against him? Except, of course, it allowed him to address the criticism at campaign stops in Oshkosh, Green Bay and Eau Claire. 
 ''Part of what I think Senator Clinton doesn't seem to understand,'' Mr. Obama said, ''is that the way you get things done is not just having a bunch of bullet points and position papers. Every candidate has them.''
 Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and respected on Capitol Hill as being among the small share of lawmakers intricately familiar with the federal budget. Mr. Obey said he was more than comfortable with Mr. Obama's grasp of substance.
 ''If I weren't, I wouldn't have endorsed him,'' Mr. Obey said Saturday. ''You can't make much headway on substance until you have somebody who can break through the rancorous atmosphere, build new alliances and cut through old barriers.''
 Still, even as Mr. Obama dismissed the criticism, there were adjustments under way in his strategy to maintain his advantages in Wisconsin. 
 After taking Valentine's Day off the campaign trail, Mr. Obama also had intended to stay at home in Chicago on Sunday. With the prospect of the race tightening here, he suddenly added a campaign stop to his itinerary. He was heading to a town-hall-style meeting in Kaukauna, located in the Fox River Valley, a politically crucial area rich with Democratic and independent voters.
 He was scheduled to deliver a speech. And take questions from voters.

HEADLINE: How the Stimulus Plan Will Help

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
THE early verdict on the federal economic stimulus plan signed on Wednesday by President Bush is that it will offer mortgage borrowers some relief but less help than industry executives expected when the House of Representatives passed the initial version in January. 
 While the final plan vastly raises the size of a mortgage that a borrower can take out without its being categorized as a jumbo loan, the new limit could be lower than initially proposed. 
 Although the new limit will help reduce interest rates for those with bigger mortgages, it will apply only to loans taken out from July 1 to the end of 2008; the limit amount will depend on where the borrower lives. In the New York City area, the jumbo-loan limit will probably shift from the current $417,000 to about $600,000.
 To determine the new limit, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will multiply the median sales price for the area by 125 percent. The National Association of Realtors says the area's median is now $476,100. HUD could use a different source or a combination of sources to determine its median figure. In any case, the agency said it would announce its decision next month. 
 Jumbo loans often bear higher interest rates -- one percentage point is not unusual. Many mortgage officials had assumed that similar interest-rate differences would apply to loans near the new jumbo loan threshold, but now they believe that a graduated rate structure may be created.
 An executive at Freddie Mac, one of the two government-sponsored companies that buy up mortgages and sell them to investors, said earlier this month that Freddie Mac would probably create a new quasi-jumbo-loan category for mortgages of $417,000 or more. This category would carry interest rates higher than those on loans below $417,000 but lower than those for the new jumbo category. 
 One mortgage investor whose company buys billions in mortgage-backed bonds said he expected rates for the quasi-jumbo category to be one-quarter to three-eighths of a percentage point higher. 
 Holders of bigger mortgages tend to refinance their loans more quickly than those with smaller mortgages, he explained, so those loans are less attractive to investors because of their shorter duration. So investors demand higher returns on them. 
 Freddie Mac's proposed policy diminishes some of the initial optimism that the stimulus package will energize the slumping housing market. ''There's a lot of second thoughts going on about whether this is really going to help us,'' said Rick Wolkenberg, president of G&M Wolkenberg Inc., a mortgage bank in Oceanside, on Long Island. ''It's wait and see.''
 Given the new realities of the loan limits, mortgage industry executives said borrowers in the New York City region might benefit more from another provision in the economic stimulus package -- namely, an increase in loans that qualify for insurance from the Federal Housing Administration. Limits on F.H.A.-insured loans will rise to around $600,000 or more, depending on which formula HUD chooses next month.
 Among their favorable terms, these mortgages carry interest rates consistent with the most competitive mortgages. But F.H.A.-insured loans require borrowers to buy mortgage insurance, which is tax deductible but can add $100 or more to a monthly loan payment.
 Brian J. Chapelle, a partner in Potomac Partners in Washington, a consulting firm to the mortgage industry, said that F.H.A. loans have been largely ignored in the New York area because house prices have outstripped the loan limits.
 He predicted that would now change. ''Especially around New York,'' Mr. Chapelle said, ''once people realize this, there's going to be a flood of interest in F.H.A. loans.''

HEADLINE: The Grand Old White Party Confronts Obama

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE curse continues. Regardless of party, it's hara-kiri for a politician to step into the shadow of even a mediocre speech by Barack Obama. 
 Senator Obama's televised victory oration celebrating his Chesapeake primary trifecta on Tuesday night was a mechanical rehash. No matter. When the networks cut from the 17,000-plus Obama fans cheering at a Wisconsin arena to John McCain's victory tableau before a few hundred spectators in the Old Town district of Alexandria, Va., it was a rerun of what happened to Hillary Clinton the night she lost Iowa. Senator McCain, backed by a collection of sallow-faced old Beltway pols, played the past to Mr. Obama's here and now. Mr. McCain looked like a loser even though he, unlike Senator Clinton, had actually won.
 But he has it even worse than Mrs. Clinton. What distinguished his posse from Mr. Obama's throng was not just its age but its demographic monotony: all white and nearly all male. Such has been the inescapable Republican brand throughout this campaign, ever since David Letterman memorably pegged its lineup of presidential contenders last spring as ''guys waiting to tee off at a restricted country club.'' 
 For Mr. McCain, this albatross may be harder to shake than George W. Bush and Iraq, particularly in a faceoff with Mr. Obama. When Mr. McCain jokingly invoked the Obama slogan ''I am fired up and ready to go'' in his speech Tuesday night, it was as cringe-inducing as the white covers of R & B songs in the 1950s -- or Mitt Romney's stab at communing with his inner hip-hop on Martin Luther King's birthday. Trapped in an archaic black-and-white newsreel, the G.O.P. looks more like a nostalgic relic than a national political party in contemporary America. A cultural sea change has passed it by. 
 The 2008 primary campaign has been so fast and furious that we haven't paused to register just how spectacular that change is. All the fretful debate about whether voters would turn out for a candidate who is a black or a woman seems a century ago. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama vanquished the Democratic field, including a presidential-looking Southern white man with an enthusiastic following, John Edwards. What was only months ago an exotic political experiment is now almost ho-hum. 
 Given that the American story has been so inextricable from the struggle over race, the Obama triumph has been the bigger surprise to many. Perhaps because I came of age in the racially divided Washington public schools of the 1960s and had one of my first newspaper jobs in Richmond in the early 1970s, I almost had to pinch myself when Mr. Obama took 52 percent of Virginia's white vote last week. The Old Dominion continues to astonish those who remember it when.
 Here's one of my memories. In 1970, Linwood Holton, the state's first Republican governor since Reconstruction and a Richard Nixon supporter, responded to court-ordered busing by voluntarily placing his own children in largely black Richmond public schools. For this symbolic gesture, he was marginalized by his own party, which was hellbent on pursuing the emergent Strom Thurmond-patented Southern strategy of exploiting white racism for political gain. After Mr. Holton, Virginia restored to office the previous governor, Mills Godwin, a champion of the state's ''massive resistance'' to desegregation. 
 Today Anne Holton, the young daughter sent by her father to a black school in Richmond, is the first lady of Virginia, the wife of the Democratic governor, Tim Kaine. Mr. Kaine's early endorsement of Mr. Obama was a potent factor in his remarkable 28-point landslide on Tuesday.
 For all the changes in Virginia and elsewhere, vestiges of the Southern strategy persist in some Republican quarters. Mr. McCain, however, has been a victim, rather than a practitioner, of the old racial gamesmanship. In his brutal 2000 South Carolina primary battle against Mr. Bush and Karl Rove, Mr. McCain's adopted Bangladeshi daughter was the target of a smear campaign. He was also pilloried for accurately describing the Confederate flag as a ''symbol of racism and slavery.'' (Sadly, he started to bend this straight talk the very next day.) He is still paying for correctly describing Jerry Falwell, once an ardent segregationist, and Pat Robertson, a longtime defender of South African apartheid, as ''agents of intolerance.'' And of course Mr. McCain remains public enemy No. 1 to some in his party for resisting nativist overkill on illegal immigration.
 Though Mr. Bush ran for president on ''compassionate conservatism,'' he diversified only his party's window dressing: a 2000 Republican National Convention that had more African-Americans onstage than on the floor and the incessant photo-ops with black schoolchildren to sell No Child Left Behind. There are no black Republicans in the House or the Senate to stand with the party's 2008 nominee. Exit polls tell us that African-Americans voting in this year's G.O.P. primaries account for at most 2 to 4 percent of its electorate even in states with largeblackpopulations. 
 Mr. Obama's ascension hardly means that racism is kaput in America, or that the country is ''postracial'' or ''transcending race.'' But it's impossible to deny that another barrier has been surmounted. Bill Clinton's attempt to minimize Mr. Obama as a niche candidate in South Carolina by comparing him to Jesse Jackson looks more ludicrous by the day. Even when winning five Southern states (Virginia included) on Super Tuesday in 1988, Mr. Jackson received only 7 to 10 percent of white votes, depending on the exit poll.
 Whatever the potency of his political skills and message, Mr. Obama is also riding a demographic wave. The authors of the new book ''Millennial Makeover,'' Morley Winograd and Michael D. Hais, point out that the so-called millennial generation (dating from 1982) is the largest in American history, boomers included, and that roughly 40 percent of it is African-American, Latino, Asian or racially mixed. One in five millennials has an immigrant parent. It's this generation that is fueling the excitement and some of the record turnout of the Democratic primary campaign, and not just for Mr. Obama.
 Even by the low standards of his party, Mr. McCain has underperformed at reaching millennials in the thriving culture where they live. His campaign's effort to create a MySpace-like Web site flopped. His most-viewed appearances on YouTube are not viral videos extolling him or replaying his best speeches but are instead sendups of his most reckless foreign-policy improvisations -- his threat to stay in Iraq for 100 years and his jokey warning (sung to the tune of the Beach Boys' version of ''Barbara Ann'') that he will bomb Iran. In the vast arena of the Internet he has been shrunk to Grumpy Old White Guy, the G.O.P. brand incarnate.
 The theory of the McCain candidacy is that his ''maverick'' image will bring independents (approaching a third of all voters) to the rescue. But a New York Times-CBS News poll last month found that independents have even a lower opinion of Mr. Bush, the war, the surge and the economy than the total electorate and skew slightly younger. Though the independents in this survey went 44 percent to 32 percent for Mr. Bush over John Kerry in 2004, they now prefer a Democratic presidential candidate over a Republican by 44 percent to 27 percent.
 Mr. McCain could get lucky, especially if Mrs. Clinton gets the Democratic nomination and unites the G.O.P., and definitely if she tosses her party into civil war by grabbing ghost delegates from Michigan and Florida. But those odds are dwindling. More likely, the Republican Party will face Mr. Obama with a candidate who reeks even more of the past and less of change than Mrs. Clinton does. I was startled to hear last week from a friend in California, a staunch anti-Clinton Republican businessman, that he was wavering. Though he regards Mr. McCain as a hero, he wrote me: ''I am tired of fighting the Vietnam war. I have drifted toward Obama.'' 
 Similarly, Mark McKinnon, the Bush media maven who has played a comparable role for Mr. McCain in this campaign, reaffirmed to Evan Smith of Texas Monthly weeks ago that he would not work for his own candidate in a race with Mr. Obama. Elaborating to NPR last week, Mr. McKinnon said that while he is ''100 percent'' for Mr. McCain and disagrees with Mr. Obama ''on very fundamental issues,'' he likes Mr. Obama and what he's doing for the country enough to stay on the sidelines rather than fire off attack ads.
 As some Republicans drift away in a McCain-Obama race, who fills the vacuum? Among the white guys flanking Mr. McCain at his victory celebration on Tuesday, revealingly enough, was the once-golden George Allen, the Virginia Republican who lost his Senate seat and presidential hopes in 2006 after being caught on YouTube calling a young Indian-American Democratic campaign worker ''macaca.'' 
 In that incident, Mr. Allen added insult to injury by also telling the young man, ''Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.'' As election results confirmed both in 2006 and last week, it is Mr. Allen who is the foreigner in 21st century America, Mr. Allen who is in the minority in the real world of Virginia. A national rout in 2008 just may be that Republican Party's last stand.

HEADLINE: Early Rally Offsets Economic Worries

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Despite a decline on Thursday and Friday over worries about the economy, the stock market gained ground last week.
 A rally early in the week offset a drop that began on Thursday as Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave Congress a relatively gloomy picture of the economy. On Friday, the Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer confidence fell in February to its lowest level since 1992, adding to a pattern of economic weakness and driving down share prices. 
 Boeing's 7.4 percent gain for the week was the best performance among the Dow industrials, while the American International Group's drop of 9 percent was the worst.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 166.08 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 12,348.21. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 18.70 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 1,349.99. The Nasdaq composite index rose 16.95 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,321.80. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.77 percent, from 3.64 percent the previous week.

HEADLINE: Where the Heads No Longer Roll

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
-- OF all the clubs in the world, the Club of 100 in France may be the most exclusive. Its ranks include leaders in business, politics and law, but it's the admission policy that really makes the Club des Cent, as it is known here, truly remarkable: only when an existing member dies is space made for a new one.
 Officially, the club, now 96 years old, is devoted strictly to gastronomy, and when the group gathers Thursdays for lunch at legendary Paris restaurants like Maxim's, politics and business are not on the menu. Claude Bebear, the chairman of AXA, the French insurance giant, and a club member for more than two decades, says that there is ''an atmosphere of real friendship; we are very close.''
 The same is true of the French business establishment. A close-knit brotherhood -- it's nearly all male -- that shares school ties, board memberships and rituals like hunting and wine-tasting, the French business elite is a surprisingly small coterie in a nation of more than 60 million people. 
 But in the wake of a $7 billion loss attributed to a rogue trader at one of the nation's leading banks, Societe Generale, France's modern-day aristocracy finds itself in the one place it never wants to be: the spotlight.
 While the trader, Jerome Kerviel, now jailed, wasn't a graduate of a top school or a member of an elite group like the Club des Cent, Societe Generale's embattled chief executive, Daniel Bouton, is both. And the fact that Mr. Bouton and other top managers of the bank have kept their posts since the scandal erupted nearly a month ago has unleashed criticism here that the French elite is an ancien regime -- playing by old rules (largely its own) and quick to shift blame to protect itself.
 ''Is there a tendency in France for the elites to be made in the same mold and close ranks?'' asks Bernard-Henri Levy, the French philosopher and social observer. ''Yes, it's an old French disease.'' 
 In the United States, Britain or Germany, Mr. Levy adds, ''Daniel Bouton would not only have been relieved of his job, but he'd be in a judge's office being questioned.''
 Indeed, the controversy comes at a time of broader tension in both French business and politics, with a new generation fighting for power against an entrenched old guard, says Stephane Fouks, executive co-chairman of Euro RSCG, one of the largest marketing and communications firms in France.
 ''At the moment, French capitalism is in a crisis, and it's creating momentum for a change,'' Mr. Fouks says. Within the traditional establishment, he says, ''everybody was friends, very diplomatic, and it was a club where at the end of the day, it was always better to find an arrangement.''
 Members of the elite make no secret of the rules of the game. ''When you are part of a small group, it is difficult to have an attitude of antagonism toward someone else in the group,'' says Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former president of France. ''In a bigger group, there is less interference of personal considerations.''
 Mr. Bouton was not available for comment. But Philippe Citerne, Societe Generale's co-chief executive and a member of its board of directors, said establishment connections have nothing to do with the fact that Mr. Bouton is staying on.
 ''The board of directors twice unanimously confirmed its confidence in Mr. Bouton,'' he said. ''There's no way we could deliver services to 27 million customers in 82 countries if we were a small French club.''
 AT least half of France's 40 largest companies are run by graduates of just two schools, the Ecole Polytechnique, which trains the country's top engineers, and ENA, the national school of administration. That's especially remarkable given that the two schools together produce only about 600 graduates a year, compared with a graduating class of 1,700 at Harvard.
 ''They behave like blood relations,'' says Ghislaine Ottenheimer, a journalist and author who has written extensively about the French elite. ''There is a sense of impunity because there is no sanction in the family.''
 Nevertheless, l'affaire Kerviel and especially the fate of Mr. Bouton -- even President Nicolas Sarkozy has suggested that Mr. Bouton should step down -- have shaken the French establishment to its core and encouraged those, like Ms. Ottenheimer, who favor change. 
 ''The old system is dying; this is its last gasp,'' she says. ''Bouton is part of a generation that will soon have to hand control of French capitalism to a more diverse elite.''
 Perhaps. But it doesn't appear that Mr. Bouton is facing an imminent slice of the guillotine -- unlike American executives at Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, who were forced to step down last fall after their banks suffered huge losses from the subprime mortgage crisis.
 While some analysts and business people expect Mr. Bouton to step down within a year, if not sooner, Mr. Bebear of AXA says French chief executives have more staying power than their counterparts in the United States. 
 ''In France the board does not fire a C.E.O. as easily as in the U.S.,'' Mr. Bebear says. ''We think the C.E.O. is responsible, but to suddenly fire the C.E.O. is not the best way to improve things.''
 Mr. Bebear, who acquired broad experience in the United States with AXA's purchase of well-known American companies like Equitable Life Insurance and Mutual of New York, also says that ''sometimes, I feel like the C.E.O. is a scapegoat in your country.''
 To reach Mr. Bebear's office, visitors walk through an ultramodern glass atrium off of one of Paris's most fashionable streets, the Avenue Matignon, and enter a private mansion built in 1767. The high-tech hustle and bustle of the atrium quickly fades as they pass through the grand salon, which features a Louis XVI crystal chandelier, gilt-edged mirrors, and red and green chairs and settees.
 Mr. Bebear's office is similarly resplendent, and appropriately enough, he sits at a desk carved in the era of Louis XIV, the Sun King. The regal status accorded celebrated American executives like John F. Welch Jr., the former chief of General Electric, pales in comparison to the standing enjoyed by the titans of French finance and industry.
 ''The C.E.O. of a French company is more of a monarch than in the United States,'' Mr. Bebear says. Expanding on that theme, he compares the French chief executive to Voltaire's enlightened king, or monarque eclaire. Within France itself, Mr. Bebear, 72, is considered to be as much a kingmaker as a king. 
 ''The press sometimes calls him the godfather of French capitalism. He is emblematic,'' says Philippe Favre, president of Invest in France, a government agency that encourages foreign companies to do business in France. 
 While Mr. Bebear built AXA in the 1980s and 1990s through bold acquisitions, the power he now wields derives from the corporate boards on which he serves and the close friendships he has made through organizations like the Club des Cent -- as well as hunting parties for which he is host at his estate near Orleans. And like other members of the establishment, he finds many close associates drawn into the Societe Generale affair, one way or another.
 For example, Jean-Martin Folz, the member of the Societe Generale board who is heading up the company's internal investigation of the losses, is also a board member at AXA. Mr. Bebear, meanwhile, serves on the board of BNP Paribas, which is the biggest bank in France and is rumored to be preparing a bid for Societe Generale. And the chairman of BNP Paribas, Michel Pebereau, is also an AXA board member. All three men also attended the same school, the Ecole Polytechnique.
 ''It is a small universe,'' acknowledges Jean-Rene Fourtou, the chairman of Vivendi, the French entertainment giant, who is a close friend of Mr. Bebear and is an AXA board member.
 Mr. Fourtou, who is also an Ecole Polytechnique graduate and a Club des Cent member, recalls that Mr. Bebear played a role in persuading him to take over as chief executive of Vivendi in 2002 after the company fell into deep financial distress after a dot-com-era acquisition spree.
 ''Initially, I refused to take the job,'' Mr. Fourtou says. But over dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel George V, Mr. Bebear and Mr. Giscard d'Estaing (another Ecole Polytechnique alum) eventually persuaded him to lead Vivendi. He quickly turned around the company, making it one of France's biggest business success stories of recent years. 
 ''They said I had to go,'' he recalls of the push he received to run Vivendi. ''I felt obliged.''
 As for the current crisis at Societe Generale, Mr. Fourtou says he doesn't think Mr. Bouton should step down right away. But he says he takes that stance not because he is an acquaintance of Mr. Bouton, or because of their intersections at the Club des Cent or any other establishment ties. 
 ''If you change the C.E.O. immediately, you add confusion to a problem which is localized,'' he says. He also says he thinks that Societe Generale's support for Mr. Bouton makes sense: ''The board took the right decision, and not because of networks.''
 WHILE dining and discoursing at Michelin-starred restaurants might seem the epitome of aristocratic living -- at each lunch, one Club des Cent member, designated the week's ''Brigadier,'' makes a presentation about the selection of food and wine while another critiques the meal -- many members come from relatively humble backgrounds.
 Mr. Fourtou, for example, was raised in the Basque region of Spain by his grandfather, who did not attend college, and he briefly ran a newspaper and book kiosk on the side to help support his wife's family after graduation from the Ecole Polytechnique. 
 ''I grew up not rich, not poor,'' Mr. Fourtou says. ''My father was a professor of mathematics.'' Similarly, Mr. Bebear's parents were teachers in the Dordogne region in southwest France.
 Rather than a rigid class system, it was Mr. Fourtou's and Mr. Bebear's admission into the Ecole Polytechnique that assured their place in the elite. And that is one of the great ironies of the French establishment: while it enjoys the privileges associated with the elites of the United States, entry is, if anything, much more rigorously meritocratic, based on exams and ever-narrowing selection from an early age. 
 Indeed, getting into Harvard, which accepted 9 percent of its applicants last year, is a breeze compared with getting into the Ecole Polytechnique. 
 Out of 130,000 students who focus on math and science in French high schools each year, roughly 15 percent do well enough on their exams to qualify for the two- to three-year preparation course required by the elite universities. Of those who make it through that, 5,000 apply to Ecole Polytechnique, which is commonly called simply ''X,'' and just 400 are admitted from France.
 Admission is based strictly on exam grades; there isn't even an essay requirement or interview. And there are no legacy admissions, sports scholarships or other American-style shortcuts for getting into X. 
 ''You can be the president's nephew and it won't help you get in,'' says Bernard Oppetit, a 1978 graduate of X who later worked for BNP Paribas before starting Centaurus Capital, a London investment fund with $4 billion under management. 
 The Ecole Polytechnique was founded in 1794, during the French Revolution, to train the country's military engineers, and it officially remains under the umbrella of the French ministry of defense. Not only is the school free, but students also receive a stipend from the government to cover their expenses.
 ''We call it l'elitisme democratique,'' says Pierre Tapie, dean of Essec, a leading French business school. ''These are places where you meet extraordinary people who are there because they worked hard and are among the most brilliant of a generation.''
 Although the school teaches high-end fare like physics, engineering, and computer sciences, its broader goal is to create a leadership cadre that shares an ordered, prioritized view of the world, says Xavier Michel, the president of the Ecole Polytechnique and an active-duty general in the French armed forces. 
 In France, this is known as the Cartesian system, after the mathematician and philosopher Rene Descartes, and Mr. Michel says the school encourages its students ''to modelize'' the world. And when they eventually become chief executives, he says, ''they understand what are the capabilities of their companies. They understand what they can do and what they can't do.''
 Until, of course, models run off the rails -- as they so often do in the business and financial worlds, regardless of what country devises them.
 Mr. Kerviel's $7 billion loss couldn't be predicted by any model, even one designed by Descartes himself. And this is one reason the story of Societe Generale has been such a shock to the French establishment, which prides itself on the predictability and order that Mr. Michel instills in his students. 
 At the same time, among the French masses, the very different fates of Mr. Kerviel and Mr. Bouton reinforce skepticism of the free-market values increasingly espoused by the business establishment as well as the country's most prominent political and economic maverick, President Sarkozy.
 ''It is certainly a shock,'' says Pierre Gadonneix, an Ecole Polytechnique graduate who is chief executive of EDF, the country's biggest power company. ''The population is upset with the management of the bank as a whole. I'm convinced the market economy is a way to create value, but not all the French are convinced.''
 For all the recent criticism of the business establishment in France -- or the predictions that its power will soon weaken -- it has proved to be a remarkably durable institution.
 Although a female candidate, Segolene Royal, came within three percentage points of being elected president of France last year, women account for only 7 percent of board members of French companies, according to a recent study by Korn/Ferry International, the recruiting and consulting firm.
 Rigid as it appears to outsiders, the system has its benefits, according to Olivier Le Fournier, a professor at the Lille School of Management. In particular, he cites the success of large French companies outside France, noting that CAC 40 companies, the Gallic equivalent of the Dow 30, typically generate more than two-thirds of their revenue abroad. 
 ''The elite is more concentrated than in the U.S.,'' he says. ''But there is the solidarity of a common approach. I think it's positive. It's a good way for our companies to work together at the international level.'' 
 France has always been known for luxury goods and fashion, but in recent years less glamorous industrial companies like Airbus and Total have been able to hold their own against American competitors like Boeing and Exxon Mobil. The hotel chain Accor, meanwhile, has successfully expanded into the United States as the owner of Motel 6, a brand that's anything but haute.
 And while the pace of change might seem glacial, academic and business leaders say that there are some notable differences between the elite of today and those of 20 years ago. 
 For example, much as 53-year-old President Sarkozy replaced Jacques Chirac, who retired at 74, younger executives are increasingly taking the helm of the biggest companies, according to Mr. Favre of Invest in France. Over the lastfive years, he estimates, the average age of a CAC 40 C.E.O. has dropped by about a decade, with business leaders now typically in their early 50s.
 AT the same time, fewer top executives are going from Ecole Polytechnique or ENA to high-level government jobs and then moving to the top ranks of private companies, a practice the French call ''parachutage.''
 Mr. Bouton, 57, ''was a pure product of that approach,'' says Mr. Favre, having joined Societe Generale in 1991 after nearly two decades at the finance ministry and an education at ENA. The Grande Ecoles, the top universities, are still the incubators of the elite, says Mr. Favre, himself an ENA graduate, but today's aspiring chief executives are more likely to join a private company in their mid-20s and work their way up.
 If Mr. Bouton is pushed from his pedestal, though, it's likely that his replacement will have followed a similar trajectory to the top and be someone well acquainted with the members and the rituals of the establishment. 
 ''The pool is simply smaller in France; there is not as much choice as in London or New York,'' says Mr. Giscard d'Estaing.

HEADLINE: She's Got Grand Plans for the Future of the Islip Airport

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER. 
E-mail: lijournal@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Ronkonkoma 

 BODY:
TERESA RIZZUTO has flown into Long Island Islip MacArthur Airport only once, but she plans to turn it into a major transportation hub.
Ms. Rizzuto, 46, of Hauppauge, became the airport's new commissioner for aviation and transportation on Feb. 6, replacing Al Werner, who retired after holding the post for more than 30 years. 
 ''I will be flying out of here now,'' Ms. Rizzuto said on a recent morning, strolling through a nearly empty concourse and greeting a few of the 105 employees of the airport, which is owned by the Town of Islip. 
 She hopes others start using MacArthur, too, as an alternative to larger, busier airports in the metropolitan area. Her new job, at a salary of $115,000, includes marketing the airport, which has eight gates and where tarmac congestion is nonexistent and lines at security are short.
 ''We have to look at how we can entice people to come in and fly,'' she said. ''We have a lot to offer.'' 
 Of the 36 flights daily from the suburban airport, nearly all are on Southwest Airlines, according to Philip Nolan, Islip town supervisor, including seven flights to its Baltimore hub, four to Chicago, three to Fort Lauderdale and one to Las Vegas. US Airways flies twice daily from Islip to Boston and Philadelphia; Delta offers two flights a day to Atlanta. 
 ''I want to do a smart growth,'' Ms. Rizzuto said. She is hoping to increase the number of carriers, flights and destinations while reaching out to the airport's neighbors. 
 Ms. Rizzuto got her start in aviation in 1992 as a baggage handler for United at Kennedy Airport. Working the midnight shift, she hauled 70-pound bags of mail and crawled into the bellies of 757s to stack, balance and nest luggage. 
 ''I needed a job,'' recalled Ms. Rizzuto, who was the single mother of a young son at the time. ''Survival of the fittest and you do it.''
 She quickly moved into supervisory positions at Kennedy and within seven years was general manager at Newark Liberty International Airport, in charge of 700 employees. 
 Four years ago, faced with relocation to Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, where she was on special assignment as hub manager overseeing 1,600 employees, she opted to stay closer to home while her son, Peter John Graziano, now 21, finished high school. 
 She joined her brother's orthotics and surgical supply business in Freeport but ultimately returned to the aviation business.
 ''It is a passion,'' Ms. Rizzuto said. ''You can't let it go.''
 While her previous jobs focused on customer service, not cultivating business, she won the top slot at MacArthur after a three-month nationwide search, Mr. Nolan said. 
 She is taking the helm after a scandal that followed the 2004 expansion of the $50 million Southwest terminal, which was built without state approvals and in violation of fire and safety codes. Work is expected to be done this spring to fix cracked concrete at the airport, according to Mr. Nolan. 
 Mr. Nolan said that with Ms. Rizzuto's airport leadership experience, she has the ability to transform MacArthur into an economic engine and transportation center. 
 The airport can accommodate 80 flights a day, Mr. Nolan said, potentially including international carriers like Ryanair, which he said recently indicated interest in flying to MacArthur from Britain. 
 Last year 2.3 million passengers flew through MacArthur, up from 2.2 million in 2006. As the F.A.A. moves to reduce congestion at Newark and Kennedy airports, Mr. Nolan hopes more flights will be shifted to Islip.
 ''We don't think it has been fully exploited,'' Mr. Nolan said. 
 While money made at the airport must by law stay at the airport, the economic stimulus for the surrounding area is potentially great, he said. He cited a recent mini-boom in the Veterans Highway corridor by the airport; between 2002 and 2006, 100 commercial and industrial buildings were built and $187 million in private investment flowed in, said Catherine Green, a town spokeswoman. 
 Following recommendations from a task force report in September commissioned by Mr. Nolan, Ms. Rizzuto will also work on building up the 45 acres on the west side of the airport where aging hangars house corporate jets, charter airlines, maintenance facilities and general aviation. The report also suggested landing fees, a taxi concession and cellular antenna leases to increase revenues. 
 The airport has an annual budget of nearly $9 million, Ms. Green said. Its net profit in 2006, the most recent data available, was about $300,000; in 2005 it was about $530,000. Among the variables affecting the bottom line, Mr. Nolan said, are the price of oil and the number of flights. 
 The airport, on 1,310 acres, has nearly twice as much space as La Guardia. It is a $5, two-mile shuttle ride from the Ronkonkoma train station, with ample parking close to the terminal. The trip from Ronkonkoma to Penn Station in New York on the Long Island Rail Road is about an hour and 20 minutes. 
 ''This really can be a vital airport,'' Ms. Rizzuto said. ''It is so convenient. You don't have to wait on the tarmac as you do at the other airports. You are always first in line here.''

HEADLINE: Role Reversal: Saving the V-8 by Turning It Inside Out

BYLINE: By DON SHERMAN

 BODY:
LAST December, after President Bush signed a 35-mile-a-gallon-fuel economy standard into law, General Motors quickly shelved a new V-8 it was designing to replace Cadillac's long-serving Northstar engine. The timing of these developments prompted a flurry of obituaries for V-8 engines, a breed with a reputation for speed, power -- and lately, environmental insolence.
 But as Mark Twain might have put it, reports of the V-8's death were greatly exaggerated. 
For instance, G.M. unveiled two new supercharged V-8s a few weeks later at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. These high-horsepower engines, which go on sale later this year, were of course planned long before the new mileage law moved through Congress and will be used only in low-volume models like the Chevrolet Corvette and the Cadillac CTS-V.
 But evidence of a new generation of mainstream V-8s, engineered for smaller vehicles and tighter emissions standards, was not far away. Next to BMW's show exhibit for the 2009 X6 was a display case with a new 400-horsepower twin-turbo V-8 that will be available in the sloped-roof wagon that the company calls a sport activity coupe. And last summer, G.M. showed the press a 4.5-liter diesel V-8 that it says will play a big role in powering the company's future pickups, S.U.V.'s and, almost certainly, passenger cars.
 Show visitors who studied BMW's display and had read about G.M.'s latest Duramax diesels may have noticed that the engines, despite having been fathered by engineering teams on different continents, shared an important design innovation: each V-8 had essentially been turned inside out. 
 Rather than the traditional layout of positioning the engines' exhaust plumbing on the outside of the V, their hot-air passages, turbochargers and even catalytic converters were placed at the valley between the banks of cylinders. The air intake systems, displaced from their usual spot at the center of the engine, had been relocated toward the outboard side of the cylinder heads. 
 Why this unusual placement, a design seen briefly in Ford Indianapolis 500 V8s but a significant departure for passenger vehicles?
 Modern V-8s were originally configured with their fuel delivery systems nestled in the valley between the cylinder banks, a layout that made it possible for one carburetor to feed all eight cylinders. Now that fuel injectors, which can be positioned directly at the individual cylinders, have replaced carburetors, it is possible to move the exhaust passages into the middle of the V. 
 There are several benefits. Turbocharger installation is simplified, and the loss of exhaust heat is reduced, helping the catalytic converter reach operating temperature more quickly. 
 The reversed layout is also more compact, making it easier to fit a V-8 in the smaller vehicles that the new fuel-economy rules will encourage. ''Repackaging components and using advanced design and simulation software allowed us to minimize the size and weight of our new Duramax V-8,'' said Charles Freese, executive director for diesel engineering at G.M.
 While the latest BMW and G.M. V-8s share this key innovation, they differ in most other respects. BMW chose twin turbos for quick throttle response; G.M. will use a single turbocharger equipped with a variable-vane inlet to achieve that goal. On BMW's engine, the angle between the cylinder banks is a classic 90-degree design; the G.M. Duramax adopted a 72-degree V-angle to make the engine narrower. The German engine has an aluminum block for weight savings, in contrast to the high-strength cast iron G.M. selected to withstand a diesel's higher operating pressures.
 Two years ago, journalists were offered test drives in a Buick Rainier powered by an early version of the diesel V-8. During my stint, I noticed that the usual diesel clatter was absent; walking in front of the vehicle, the only sound I could hear was the smooth whir of cooling fans. 
 With more than 500 pound-feet of torque and just more than 300 horsepower, the acceleration -- even with a couple of passengers on board -- felt like a commercial jet on a take-off roll. It was the first time I had experienced diesel-engine efficiency married to gasoline-engine poise and performance. Recent rumors that this engine could power a special green edition of the next Corvette may not be exaggerated.
 While the new fuel-economy standards put pressure on all automakers to improve efficiency, drivers will continue to shop for V-8 power, even from V-6 engines. Ford's solution, called EcoBoost, combines turbocharging with direct fuel injection and is designed to produce smaller engines that improve mileage -- a claimed 10 percent to 30 percent -- with minimal performance loss. EcoBoost V-8s, code named Boss, will follow for truck and high-performance applications.
 Hyundai and Kia also advanced new V-8s from the drawing boards to their 2009 lineups. The 4.6-liter Tau V-8 that will power Hyundai's Genesis flagship and Kia's eight-passenger Borrego S.U.V. drew little attention in Detroit, even though it bristled with the latest camshaft, valve timing and variable-intake features.
 Interestingly, Cadillac was the first to series-produce a V-8 engine, in 1915. Countless refinements by various automakers made the V-8 the engine of choice for everything from svelte Formula One racers to hulking S.U.V.'s. But with the fall from grace of Cadillac's signature Northstar V-8, it seems clear that future power plants will take a different course to achieve 35 m.p.g. by 2020 when the new fuel-economy standards are fully in place. 

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: Diesel V-8 for 2010 G.M. trucks. CHART: BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO A WORKHORSE ENGINE: Stricter emissions and fuel-economy standards are expected to reduce the availability of big V-8 engines, but recent innovations could result in smaller, more efficient turbocharged V-8s that are just as powerful as traditional engines. New designs by BMW and General Motors reverse the conventional layout by moving the exhaust passages to the center of the engine and the fuel system to the outside of the engine's V. One result is a more compact engine, and switching the positions of these components also simplifies the turbocharger installation.

HEADLINE: Minority Rules

BYLINE: By MELINE TOUMANI. 
Meline Toumani has written about Turkey for n+1, The Boston Globe and other publications. A 2007 journalism fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, she is writing a book on national identity.

 BODY:
Walking through the Sur district of Diyarbakir with Abdullah Demirbas was like taking an old-fashioned mayoral stroll. As the day got under way in one of the largest cities in southeastern Turkey, Demirbas passed through the narrow stone alleys, and one by one, shopkeepers stepped outside and waved. In return, Demirbas patted his chest and called out loud greetings. He stopped to compliment a cafe owner's new door frames, asked a trio of women if they were satisfied with the trash collection and teased some kids about getting to school on time. Demirbas addressed most of the locals in Kurdish, his native language, but every now and then he switched to Turkish. When I asked him why, he said he has known all his constituents long enough to remember which language each speaks. 
 Neither my question nor his answer was idle. Demirbas was in a legal ordeal when we spoke last summer because he had been using Kurdish in his capacity as the mayor of Sur, Diyarbakir's central district, an ancient neighborhood ringed by several miles of high basalt walls. For printing a children's book and tourist brochures in Kurdish, according to a report by the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party, Demirbas was accused of misusing municipal resources. For giving a blessing in Kurdish while officiating at a wedding ceremony, he was accused of misusing his position. And for proposing that his district should employ Kurdish-speaking phone operators and print public-health pamphlets in Kurdish, he was accused (and later acquitted) of aiding a terrorist organization -- the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K. 
 The fact that a reference to terrorism should find its way into the reported accusations against Demirbas, a 41-year-old schoolteacher-turned-politician, might seem bizarrely beside the point, given the scale of the conflict between Turks and Kurds. The fighting between P.K.K. guerrillas and Turkish soldiers has raged in various forms for nearly 30 years and since 2004 has alternated between short-lived cease-fires and sporadic attacks. After 12 Turkish soldiers were killed in a devastating assault in October last year, the military began a series of airstrikes against P.K.K. camps in northern Iraq. These came after months of diplomatic wrangling in which Turkey criticized American and Iraqi leaders for not supporting its fight against the P.K.K., and the Bush administration begged Turkey not to destabilize the one part of Iraq that was fairly functional. This would seem to be far more serious than a dispute over the language of a children's book.
 But the battle that Demirbas entered, waged entirely on paper and in courtrooms, is closely related to the violence. For the past two years, politicians all over southeastern Turkey, along with human rights advocates, journalists and other public figures, have been sued for instances of Kurdish-language usage so minor that they are often a matter of a few words: sending a greeting card with the words ''happy new year'' in Kurdish, for example, or saying ''my dear sisters'' in a speech at a political rally. Such lawsuits have become so common that in some cases the accused is simply fined for using the letters W, X or Q -- present in the Kurdish but not the Turkish alphabet -- in an official capacity. In cases involving elected politicians, like Demirbas, the language usage is sometimes considered disloyalty and can carry a prison sentence. 
 This miniaturist culture war and the fighting in the mountains are related because they both reflect the inability of Turkish society to integrate Kurds -- about 20 percent of the country's total population and the majority in the southeast -- in a way that doesn't insist on assimilation down to the last W, X or Q. For decades, Turkish law has not allowed acknowledgment of Kurds as a distinct ethnic group; from 1983 to 1991 it was even illegal to speak Kurdish in public. Until 2002, broadcasting in Kurdish was essentially banned, and only in 2003 could parents give their children Kurdish names (except, again, for names using W, X or Q). But even these small advances suggest that while the military fight has been a stalemate, the deeper cultural conflict can, with relative ease, be resolved. Such at least is the vision of Abdullah Demirbas. His may not be the effort that makes headlines, but it is probably the one that matters most.
 In his huge, wood-paneled office, filled with leather couches and elegant tables, Demirbas held up a picture frame that he keeps on his desk. ''I look at these photos every day,'' he told me. His office was buzzing with aides, television news and ringing phones, but he seemed calm and focused. The frame holds two photographs: a black-and-white picture of Musa Anter, a Kurdish writer and activist who was killed in 1992, and a school portrait, in color, of a 12-year-old boy, Ugur Kaymaz, who was killed alongside his father by the Turkish police in 2004 on the grounds that they were terrorists. 
 In Turkish media coverage of P.K.K. attacks, there is little discussion of Kurdish civilians being killed by Turkish soldiers -- still less about why a child growing up in the southeast might be driven to sympathize with the P.K.K. The young victim in Demirbas's picture frame, Kaymaz, played a role in another of the lawsuits against the mayor. Directly across the street from the entrance to the Sur district office building, Demirbas erected a sculpture: an abstract and striking figure made of stone, with its arms curved up into the air. The statue has 13 small, identical round holes carved into it; these represent the 13 bullets with which Ugur Kaymaz was killed. The words on the statue are paragraphs from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, in Turkish. For erecting such a memorial Demirbas was accused of ''misuse of municipal office and resources'' once again. 
 Children have a special place in Demirbas's work. He served as the head of the Diyarbakir teachers' union for 18 years -- he was fired for criticizing the nationalist school curriculum -- and as mayor championed children's festivals, libraries, music groups and the free distribution of children's activity books in Kurdish, Turkish and Assyrian. He was likely to take the opportunity to explain why the Turkish primary-school experience is a particularly sensitive issue for Kurds. Most Kurdish children in poor, rural areas start school without knowing how to speak Turkish. Demirbas told me that on his first day of school, at age 6, his teacher lifted him up by the earlobes because he did not know how to say ''my teacher'' in Turkish. ''I am 41 years old,'' Demirbas says. ''But I can never forget that teacher and that school.'' 
 Demirbas's colleague Osman Baydemir is six years younger but has similar stories. A lawyer by profession, Baydemir is mayor of the greater Diyarbakir municipality, which encompasses Sur and 31 other districts. Baydemir faces more than 50 investigations and also risks prison for a long list of cultural offenses. Baydemir, too, started school without a word of Turkish. He recounted to me the informal ''web of espionage'' that characterized his childhood years: in his Kurdish village near Diyarbakir, a few children kept track of which kids spoke Kurdish in the village and reported the names to their teachers, who levied punishments accordingly. Baydemir, who has published health brochures and a book of baby names in Kurdish, among other materials, said that in meetings with the public in this part of the country, if politicians don't speak Kurdish most people do not understand them: ''If we carry out a public-service campaign in Turkish only, there are limited results.''
 But the use of Kurdish is not simply a matter of linguistic comprehension. Sometimes it is a form of diplomacy. One of the most aggressive legal investigations against Baydemir concerned a series of public statements he made in Kurdish in March 2006. In a battle that month between P.K.K. militants and Turkish soldiers, 14 Kurds had been killed. Diyarbakir exploded in mass demonstrations that ultimately became violent. Baydemir begged the crowd -- in Turkish -- to settle down, to refuse further violence, to go home and rest. The crowd chanted P.K.K. slogans, like ''Teeth to teeth, blood to blood, we are with you Ocalan,'' referring to Abdullah Ocalan, the head of the P.K.K. whom Baydemir, as a lawyer, had defended after his capture in 1999. Desperate to subdue the crowd, Baydemir switched to Kurdish. ''You claimed your identity,'' he told them. ''With burnt hearts, you claimed your people and your pain. We are also with you. Be sure of this. But for the sake of peace, for the sake of your success, we have to listen to each other under the leadership of the party'' -- the Democratic Society Party, or D.T.P., Turkey's only legal ''pro-Kurdish'' party. ''We fear,'' he went on, ''that this mobilization from now on will harm our nation and our people. From now on, we all will go back to our homes quietly.'' Sixteen people were killed in the rioting that subsequently spread across the southeast and into Istanbul. The mandate -- the ordeal -- of a mayor in a Kurdish town was clear: a kind of internal mediation of the highest order, the challenge of connecting to the hearts of the Kurdish population while governing according to the laws of the state. 
 Nearly all of the prominent Kurdish politicians accused of language violations are members of the D.T.P. But the latest front in the party's legal battles is not crimes against the alphabet but the status of the D.T.P. itself. On Nov. 16, Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, chief prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Appeals, applied to the Constitutional Court to ban the D.T.P., arguing that it is merely a suit-and-tie-clad front for the P.K.K. ''The party in question has become a base for activities which aim at the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,'' the prosecutor wrote in his statement. 
 This move to ban the pro-Kurdish party, likely to last several months in court, is in some ways less surprising than the fact that the D.T.P. made it to Parliament at all. In the past several years, at least four Kurdish parties have been banned or forced to dissolve in Turkey, always under the accusation of supporting the P.K.K. and threatening Turkey's unity. But the D.T.P. has been different. In last July's elections, it became the first Kurdish party to have a strong presence in Parliament in more than a decade. It did so by running its candidates as independents in order to get around a 10-percent minimum (of the total vote) that a party would need to achieve in order to actually win seats. Supporters saw its victory as a chance to address Kurdish issues in Turkey through democratic means. D.T.P. members took great pains to assert their desire to work within the law, to give voice to the economic, social and cultural concerns of their constituents and to bridge the deep chasms between their group and Turkey's old guard, which is represented by the Republican People's Party and the Nationalist Action Party.
 But from the new Parliament's opening session in August, the D.T.P.'s presence set in motion a circus of hostile and even juvenile behavior. At the helm of Parliament, the neo-Islamist Justice and Development Party has been the most neutral. But throughout the late summer and fall, Turkish society was captivated by play-by-play scrutiny of who would shake whose hand and who would be invited to whose parties. Some representatives of nationalist and secularist camps took to calling their D.T.P. colleagues ''separatists.''
 Since D.T.P. members first entered Parliament, they have been urged by everybody from the prime minister to the European Union to the United States to condemn the P.K.K. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the leaders of other parties have stated repeatedly that until the D.T.P. does so, it will not be trusted. D.T.P. leaders have attempted to distance themselves from the P.K.K. without directly condemning the group: in public statements, they constantly reiterate that they are against separatism, do not want to divide the Turkish state and oppose all violence. In the autumn, D.T.P. leaders began calling fallen Turkish soldiers ''martyrs,'' as the military and the rest of Turkey's establishment have always done. But that wasn't nearly enough after an early-October attack killed 13 -- the worst strike by the P.K.K. in years. Turkish television channels broadcast continuous gut-wrenching footage of soldiers' mothers collapsing over coffins and uniformed officers comforting them. An intense climate of national mourning set in, along with a focus on national security that Kurdish activists feared would obliterate any hope for cultural reforms.
 Aysel Tugluk, a young female leader of the D.T.P. and a one-time member of Ocalan's defense team, sounded exhausted when she spoke at a conference in Istanbul later that month. She started her talk with a long string of condolences for all those who died, then went on to say: ''If you force the D.T.P. to condemn the P.K.K., you deny us the possibility to take initiative in a way that could turn out to be effective.'' But she added that if Kurdish cultural demands were met, the D.T.P. would be able to condemn ''any force that deploys violence'' and that the most important step right now would be for Kurds to be allowed to express themselves in their native language. ''After 30 years, we still have violence,'' Tugluk said, ''so I think we should stop and ask, What was our mistake? The P.K.K. has to be taken into account from a sociological point of view; it is the result of the nonsolution to the Kurdish issue: we have to focus on the origins of that issue.'' Ayhan Aktar, a sociologist at Istanbul's Bilgi University, described the situation to me more bluntly: ''If the D.T.P. condemns the P.K.K., they won't ever be able to go to Diyarbakir again; they will get beaten up on the street by some hotheads when they set foot in town.'' 
 Dilek Kurban, an analyst at Tesev, the research institute that was a sponsor of the event at which Tugluk spoke in October, told me that the personal element should not be discounted: ''Every family in the southeast has someone in prison or in the mountains.'' (''In the mountains'' is a euphemism for fighting on behalf of the P.K.K.) ''For them,'' she continued, ''the condemnation seems like a betrayal of their own sons and daughters, who, in their opinion, have paid too high a price for their national liberation. If those people are integrated into social life and civic life, I wonder how much of this problem will remain. But when there is still a conflict, both sides cling to their symbols: the Turkish flag or the photos of Ocalan.'' 
 After the October crisis, harassment of Kurdish politicians only worsened. In December, a military court arrested the 35-year-old D.T.P. chairman, Nurettin Demirtas, on charges of forging medical documents to avoid military service. (Among politically minded, university-educated Kurds and Turks alike, it is common to evade military service.) Demirtas is now in a military jail awaiting word on a possible five-year prison sentence. Meanwhile, a photo began to circulate of a woman, dressed in a P.K.K. uniform, standing outside a camp in northern Iraq. The largest Turkish daily, Hurriyet, along with many other media organizations, reported that it was the D.T.P. legislator Fatma Kurtulan, leading to an official investigation. (When reporters asked Kurtulan to explain herself, she said, ''You know perfectly well I'm not the person in that photo.'') In December, the Turkish chief of staff, Gen. Yasar Buyukanit, made a statement that showed what some in the military thought of the D.T.P.'s July election gains. ''The P.K.K. is in the Parliament,'' the general said, a charge repeated throughout the Turkish media.
 But the most dubious moment in this legal battle came last month, when the chief prosecutor for Turkey's capital city, Ankara, filed a case against Ahmet Turk, a D.T.P. deputy (and former party president), for ''insulting the military.'' The reason for the accusation was emblematic: last August, when the military held a reception celebrating Turkish Victory Day, it refused to invite D.T.P. legislators. The D.T.P.'s Turk (who is Kurdish, despite his last name) made a statement admonishing the military for excluding his party, saying, ''Now it is clear who is engaging in separatism.'' As a result, he stands to face a two-year sentence for insulting the military by accusing it of being separatist.
 When I asked Demirbas how he feels about the P.K.K. and the prospect of a separate state, his voice grew softer both in tone and in volume. ''I am against separation,'' he says, ''but it's difficult to convince people of this. I am not working for the Kurds; I am working for all people. Democracy means that when you want something for yourself, you also want it for others.'' 
 It was Demirbas's interest in others that led me to seek him out. I had heard from a friend in Istanbul that the mayor of the central neighborhood of Diyarbakir had published a map of the city in Armenian. One hundred fifty years ago, Armenians and other Christians made up about half of Diyarbakir's population, but as an ethnic Armenian myself, I was astonished that a mayor in a Turkish town had done something to acknowledge this history. Most old Armenian sites in Turkey are either abandoned altogether or labeled with signs and explanations that offer roundabout explanations without ever mentioning that a particular site was Armenian. (Even the much-lauded official renovation of an Armenian church in Van relied on the geographical term ''Anatolian.'') In Turkey, the ''Armenian question'' -- whether the massacre of the Ottoman Armenian population during World War I was a state campaign -- is at least as taboo as the Kurdish issue. 
 When Demirbas learned of my ethnic background, he took out a stack of about a hundred tourist brochures describing Diyarbakir, printed in Armenian, and handed them to me. ''Please give these to Armenians in the United States,'' he said. He also showed me the same brochure in Assyrian, Arabic, Russian and Turkish. ''Why is it,'' he asked by way of example, ''that tourists who visit Topkapi Palace in Istanbul can get an audio listening guide in English, French, Spanish, German or Italian, but when I publish a small tourist brochure in Armenian, as a welcoming gesture to Armenian tourists who want to visit their ancestral home, I am accused of committing a crime?'' (The brochures are among the many projects for which Demirbas has been accused of misusing municipal resources.) We spent the rest of the afternoon touring an area that Demirbas calls ''the Streets of Culture Project.'' Tucked among a cluster of alleyways in his district, several ancient structures remind visitors of the Armenians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Jews and other groups who once populated a neighborhood that is still known locally as the infidel quarter. Demirbas calls it the ''Armenian quarter,'' at least while talking to me, and has drafted a proposal to undertake a major renovation of the area and its monuments. 
 ''So many civilizations lived in the Sur district over millennia,'' he says. ''Kurds, Arabs, Armenians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Nestorians, Jews, Turks, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Alevi, Yezidi, traces of Sabihi'' -- occasionally he lengthens his list by repeating groups he has already named -- ''all these different beliefs coexisted in the Sur district of Diyarbakir. The more we lose this multicultural side of ourselves, the more we become one another's enemies.'' 
 Listening to him, I felt sure that he meant it, but also sure that he knew he was undermining the nationalist foundations of the Turkish Republic. At first, I wondered if he was using Diyarbakir's other ethnicities to somehow soften the blow of his support of Kurdish cultural rights. But supporting the Armenian issue would hardly win him friends in Turkey, at least not friends with power. I was told that his emphasis on multiculturalism was not so much strategic as it was part of a natural long-term shift in the dynamics of Kurdish identity in Turkey. According to Hisyar Ozsoy, a scholar of Kurdish origin at the University of Texas who was as an adviser to Baydemir, Kurdish politics has been moving ''from war and struggle to themes of multiculturalism,'' and ''when you talk to Abdullah Demirbas, you hear him saying that 'this is just a kind of richness; we are very much innocent here.' This is not the kind of political actor who was operating effectively in Diyarbakir during the 1990s.'' Multiculturalism, according to Ozsoy, also helps Kurds gain legitimacy in the eyes of outsiders, especially Europeans: ''There is always this foreign gaze on Kurds. They're looking at us like'' -- he mimics a baby voice -- '' 'Oh, these poor guys, they just want to speak in Kurdish and sing songs and dance, and then we can come and enjoy the richness of these cultures.' '' In democratic societies, such an attitude might properly be criticized as condescending, Ozsoy says, but in the Turkish system, it becomes a critical force in legitimizing ethnic identity. 
 The European Union has been consistently supportive of Kurdish cultural rights, and Demirbas's case has held the attention of E.U. observers since 2006, when he traveled to Strasbourg to talk about using multiple languages in municipal affairs. For presenting a paper, ''Municipal Services and Local Governments in Light of Multilingualism,'' Demirbas was sued by the Turkish minister of the interior on the grounds of ''making propaganda to promote the aims of the terrorist organization P.K.K.'' 
 An E.U. delegation made regular visits to Diyarbakir to monitor Demirbas's case, among others, and in a September report on local democracy in Turkey, it harshly criticized the legal actions against the mayor and his colleagues and called on Turkey to sign the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. 
 But the huge distance between such conventions and Turkish official policy was obvious when the delegation members described how officials at the Ministry of the Interior in Ankara justified the language lawsuits. The Turkish officials argued that the distinction between Kurdish and other languages was that Kurdish was only an ''ethnic'' language. The Europeans were not impressed with this reasoning. They wrote that the laws under which Demirbas, his district council and countless other politicians throughout the southeast had been accused were ''so flawed as to be unsustainable.'' 
 Unfortunately, European support of minority rights in Turkey has its own hazards: for many Turks, it brings to mind the period when European nations sought to undermine the Ottoman empire's strength by pitting different ethnic groups against one another and against the Ottomans. The eventual collapse of the empire and the trauma of dismemberment were in many ways the foundation for Turkish nationalism, as Mustafa Kemal Ataturk sought to empower his new nation with a strong Turkish identity. 
 These days, each instance of criticism from European observers gets an angry response from mainstream Turks. According to the latest polls, only half of the population says it wants to join Europe, down from 70 percent a few years ago. Turks with the highest education levels were disproportionately more likely to oppose closer E.U. ties. 
 Even some of the most sympathetic analysts of the Kurdish problem believe that Demirbas and Baydemir have been needlessly provocative in their initiatives. One analyst with a major human rights organization said that the mayors should know better than to work blatantly outside of the system. ''The Kurdish people are suffering because their leaders are not realistic about what Turkey can accept right now,'' she said. This refrain is repeated by people on all sides of the problem. And perhaps Turkey is not ready for major change, but you wonder how it will ever become so. Demirbas and Baydemir, and to a lesser extent their colleagues all over the southeast, have chosen to forge new fiefs in what may ultimately prove to be a self-destructive campaign, heavily dependent on a European support whose usefulness is itself questionable. 
 The mayors' efforts are as much as anything evidence of desperation. ''In primary school, every day and especially on Fridays, I was supposed to say, 'I am Turkish, and I am righteous and hardworking,' '' Baydemir says, referring to the pledge that schoolchildren make each morning. ''But all those things did not actually turn us into Turks. This system is somehow creating fake personalities. Diversity is the constitutive element of this society; and when there is that perception, then Turkey will be the model democracy.''
 Baydemir can be convincing, but a surprise development in July's parliamentary elections may have weakened calls for multicultural reform like his. To widespread surprise, a significant percentage of Kurds in the southeast did not vote for the Kurdish party. Just over half of the region did, while just under half voted for the ruling Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P. According to Kurban of the Tesev institute, this is evidence that Kurds are looking for more of the economic benefits that the A.K.P. has already delivered. ''If you ask people what is more important to them -- the restoration of historical sites in the Sur district or cash to send their children to school -- which will they choose?'' she asks, referring to the popular cash-transfer program that the ruling party has established, giving poor families stipends for sending their children to school and vaccinating their infants. She adds that the party wisely fielded a number of ethnically Kurdish candidates from the southeast, politicians who are sympathetic to Kurdish cultural rights but are working outside official Kurdish parties. ''The people in the southeast who voted for the A.K.P. didn't vote against Kurds,'' she says, ''they just voted for different Kurds.'' The A.K.P.'s interest in Islamic rights was a significant motivator, since religion is an important part of life for many Kurds in the southeast. Perhaps above all, the A.K.P. was an outsider to the traditional centers of power. It was the underdog, and Kurds responded to the fact that a party that the nationalists hated had a chance to take over.
 The A.K.P. has been kinder to the Kurds than any of the other major parties, but that isn't saying much. The party's commitment to minority rights in general has been spotty and varies significantly from one party leader to another. One of Erdogan's deputy prime ministers, Cemil Cicek, for example, was until recently the justice minister under whom the much-criticized Article 301, which limits freedom of expression, gained traction among nationalist lawyers. He is also the person who in 2005 said that scholars at the country's top universities were ''stabbing the nation in the back'' when they planned a conference on the Armenian issue -- hardly a sign that he is ready to help loosen the grip of Turkish nationalism.
 The revised constitution that the A.K.P. is currently drafting for a 2008 referendum will be the moment of truth for some of these issues, not least for Turkey's faltering European Union bid, but it may well stop at putting a slight polish on existing laws without touching the underlying issues. For example, the use of Kurdish in municipal affairs is not addressed in the early draft, but there is a guarantee that Kurds who wind up in court could have Kurdish-speaking translators. In the meantime, Turkish courts continue to penalize writers, politicians and human rights advocates for all manner of activities: offending the military by criticizing its operations against the P.K.K., offending the memory of Ataturk by writing about his personal life, offending Turkishness itself by discussing the Armenian issue or any number of other taboos. Lawyers working on behalf of those singled out under such laws are blocked at every turn in their investigations and are frequently subject to investigation themselves.
 An extraordinary state investigation, disclosed last month, illustrates both the depth of the problem and the possibility of progress. A retired general, an ultranationalist lawyer and other prominent figures were arrested on accusations of plotting the murder of the novelist Orhan Pamuk and of being responsible for the killing of the Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, whose death a year ago led to huge rallies and counterrallies and transformed the Turkish political scene. The group has also been linked to several other murders and bombings. The handling of this investigation will be the most significant test yet of Turkey's capacity to match promised reforms to action.
 Demirbas was forced out of office in July. He fought the case against him into the winter of last year, through a maze of appeals, accusations of mistrial and further postponements. An Ankara-appointed vice governor moved in to do his job. He recently told me in an e-mail message that he continued to work on his projects ''from a historic house inside the city walls.'' In public statements, meanwhile, Baydemir called his colleague ''the mayor in our hearts,'' and by all accounts the locals still saw him that way. An election to replace him has been delayed indefinitely by Ankara-appointed authorities. Now he is returning to Strasbourg -- where his troubles began in 2006, when he spoke openly about using Kurdish -- to seek a judgment from the European Court of Human Rights. He always put a great deal of faith in outside intervention. He had shown me framed photos of him with these European Parliament members, the op-ed articles that he wrote and tried to publish in foreign newspapers and the giant binders in which he stores the business cards of anybody who comes to see him, no matter how insignificant the visit. 
 ''I mean, my dismissal won't change the fact that there is cultural diversity in this country,'' he told me. ''Like those who judged Galileo and wanted to execute him, that didn't change the fact that the earth was revolving around the sun.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 2, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 17 about multiculturalism in Turkey referred imprecisely to a European delegation that visited the country to monitor the trial of a Turkish mayor who spoke Kurdish in public, and misstated the number of its visits. It represented the Council of Europe Congress, not the European Union, and it made a single visit to Turkey, not frequent visits.

HEADLINE: 'Free Lunch'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Jonathan Chait's review of my book ''Free Lunch'' (Feb. 3) ignores its central thesis and neglects to disclose that he wrote a competing book.
He writes that I embrace litigiousness to solve societal problems. In fact, I describe litigation as ''scary and nasty'' and show ways to reduce lawsuits. My solution is for taxpayers to cover the full costs of Congress, ending legalized bribery.
 Chait writes that I regard corporations as ''inherently malevolent,'' which is ridiculous given that I am chairman of the board of a small corporation with big ambitions. He says I regard deregulation as ''evil,'' when I wrote that deregulation is a fantasy and I show new regulations that thwart market capitalism, drive up prices and hinder competition. The only things I call ''evil,'' citing the Bible, are policies that take from the many to give to the rich. 
 Chait twists words I use to describe the shared values of those Democrats and Republicans who favor people over corporations to make them appear as my views, not a description of theirs.
 Chait misleadingly connects me to a faction of Democrats and calls me a left-wing populist, even though I am a registered Republican, a matter of public record that is posted all over the Internet, and without mentioning that classic conservative values drawn from Adam Smith, Andrew Mellon and the Bible are invoked throughout ''Free Lunch.''
 ''Free Lunch'' is full of news, hard facts and plain-English explanations of how market capitalism has been perverted. Chait did an excellent job of one thing -- hiding what ''Free Lunch'' actually says from readers of The New York Times Book Review.
 David Cay Johnston Rochester
 Jonathan Chait replies:
 I did not consider my own very different book to be ''competing,'' but if Johnston wants me to mention it, I'll happily oblige. I am the author of ''The Big Con: The True Story of How Washington Got Hoodwinked and Hijacked by Crackpot Economics,'' available in bookstores everywhere.
 That Johnston can deny that he embraces litigiousness is bizarre. He depicts trial lawyers as heroes and wrote that every American has dreamed of fighting a case all the way to the Supreme Court.
 Johnston's quibble with ''evil'' is wordplay.
 It is beyond clear that the views Johnston ascribed to ''peoplists'' are his own. It is equally clear that Johnston's views reside on the political left, despite his finding agreeable quotes from Adam Smith, Andrew Mellon and the Bible. I'm relieved that he does not dispute my characterization of his viewpoint as Naderite, because Nader's campaign is currently offering copies of ''Free Lunch'' to its donors.
 To the Editor:
 Reviewing ''Free Lunch,'' Chait writes that ''the government's taxation disproportionately falls on the rich, and its spending disproportionately benefits the nonrich.'' This is untrue. According to the dictionary, ''disproportionate'' denotes ''an absence of due relation or proportion.'' Used correctly, the word means ''out of proper proportion'' rather than simply ''in something other than a one-to-one relation.'' It is a normative word; it implies, inescapably, a judgment about what is ''due'' or ''proper.''
 As Johnston and others have shown, the effective tax rate across all income levels is nearly flat -- so widely do the rich shirk their tax obligations and so light are those obligations to begin with. Anyone who believes in progressive taxation -- or ordinary fairness -- must conclude that Chait has it exactly backward: the government's taxation disproportionately falls on the nonrich, and its spending disproportionately benefits the rich.

HEADLINE: Cockfighting: Culture, Or Just Plain Cruelty?

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''A Question of Culture,'' Feb. 18: I do not condone the suffering that the roosters endure, but having lived in the Dominican Republic for almost four years, I can appreciate cockfighting as part of the culture. 
It seems that as Americans, we are being extremely hypocritical in our criticism of cockfighting. We have no problem consuming extraordinary amounts of meat in the United States, the majority of which comes from animals raised under cruel conditions, yet somehow we believe that cockfighting is morally wrong. Maybe we should examine our own behaviors before judging those of citizens of developing countries.

 As much as cockfighting seems to rule the land, the Dominican economy depends much more on tourists. The insistence on practicing a sport that offends so many will ultimately cost them thousands of tourists like me, who have no desire to put money in the pocket of the Dominican Republic.
 In a nation where 40 percent live below the poverty line, a decline in tourism could be catastrophic. Keeping the cruel tradition of cockfighting alive will ultimately hurt the Dominican people as much as the roosters they breed, train and throw into the ring. Stacy Gueraseva

 To the Sports Editor:
 Cockfighting is unethical, inhumane and as cruel as neglecting and abusing an innocent child. Culture? Please. I think it is time for all human beings to become the compassionate, caring people that we are meant to be. Believe it or not, all animals can feel pain. Jennifer Weekley

HEADLINE: Letters: Old-School Economics

 BODY:
Christopher Caldwell (Jan. 27) argues that because America now possesses a ''new economy,'' with more security guards than machinists, presidential candidates who express concern over our ailing manufacturing sector are engaged in ''folkloric'' pandering. The true folklore, however, is the perception that our new economy represents progress. Middle-class Americans borrow to maintain their standard of living, as well-paid manufacturing jobs, like machinists, are replaced by lower-paid ''new economy'' jobs, like security guards. Masters of the new economy on Wall Street make millions on financial alchemy that ultimately weakens our economy further. One hopes that our next president will recognize that ''choreographers, blackjack dealers and security guards'' can never form the ''backbone'' of a strong economy and take steps to revive America's industrial base.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing's Next Wave

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Outsourcing's Next Wave
 The first wave of offshore outsourcing sent software development and maintenance abroad, mainly to India. The next wave, well under way, is shipping back-office business tasks overseas, like finance, payroll, claims processing and procurement. That's business process outsourcing, or B.P.O., in nerd talk. 
 Just how much of this back-office work can be sent abroad, how quickly, is a matter of some debate. 
 A report presented this week to India's big software and services trade association concludes that the offshore B.P.O. can grow signficantly for years to come. The report, done by Everest Research Institute, an outsourcing advisory firm, said that the market could be $280 billion by 2012. Today, that market is about $28 billion, with the Indian portion at $10.2 billion.
 The bullish case rests largely on the continuing cost savings from using skilled technical workers in India compared with the United States. 
 A software developer in Chicago, says Rod Bourgeois, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company who conducts joint research with Everest, makes about $50 an hour, while in India a developer is paid perhaps $10 an hour. 
 If the wages of the American developer are growing 3 percent a year and the Indian 15 percent a year, the cost advantage will last a long time, he said.
 Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research, is skeptical. He thinks that once the costs of managing and supervising offshore projects are included, the price difference is perhaps 30 percent and falling. The more skill involved in a task -- say, industry and local-market knowledge for procurement -- the less likely the offshore cost advantage. ''There are real signs of the U.S. coming back as a low-cost B.P.O. center,'' he said.

HEADLINE: College Paper Vows to Fight A Takeover By Gannett

BYLINE: By CATE DOTY

 BODY:
J. David McSwane, the student editor of The Rocky Mountain Collegian, was looking forward to a quiet spring semester at the Colorado State University after drawing global attention last fall for a four-word editorial criticizing President Bush. 
 What he got instead was another storm. 
 On the first day of classes in January, Mr. McSwane learned that the university president was meeting with representatives from the local daily, The Fort Collins Coloradoan, which is owned by Gannett, to discuss a potential ''partnership'' with the student newspaper. 
 The Collegian, now worried about its future as an independent student newspaper, is planning to fight any possible takeover by a media company. And Gannett and The Coloradoan have become targets for harsh criticism from college newsrooms and journalism departments across the country, who portray Gannett as a ''dark lord'' that wants to rein in student press freedom.
 ''If The Coloradoan were to take over The Collegian, only Gannett would win,'' The Daily Nebraskan, the campus newspaper at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said in an editorial.
 Gannett dismissed any suggestion that it planned to conquer student journalism.
 ''There is no grand Gannett strategy,'' said Tara Connell, a spokeswoman at its headquarters in McLean, Va. ''Gannett is not looking to buy college newspapers. We look at all sorts of things.''
 Gannett owns two student newspapers in Florida, however -- The Tallahassee Democrat owns The FSView & Florida Flambeau at Florida State and Florida Today owns The Central Florida Future at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Both are for-profit newspapers, although the vast majority of student newspapers, including The Collegian, are nonprofit.
 Media companies find college newspapers attractive properties for several reasons: operating costs are low because student labor is inexpensive, sometimes even free. Advertising is on the rise. And perhaps most important, the newspapers are read -- frequently -- by a young audience with relatively deep pockets. 
 In 2006, MTV acquired Y2M: Youth Media and Marketing Networks, whose subsidiary, College Publisher, is host of Web sites for 450 campus newspapers.
 ''College communities are fairly healthy economic engines. There's a constant influx of students coming in with cash,'' said Kevin Schwartz, the general manager of The Daily Tar Heel, the student newspaper at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ''The underpinnings of a healthy market are found in a state university town.''
 According to Alloy Media and Marketing, which places advertisements in college publications, advertisers spent $30 million on ads in college papers in 2006. Alloy also estimated that advertising in college newspapers increased 15 percent in 2007, from 2006. 
 And as John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst in Silver Spring, Md., noted, college newspapers have a captive audience. A 2006 survey conducted by College Publisher found that 44 percent of undergraduate students read their campus newspaper twice or more a week -- compared with 28 percent who read the local newspaper that often -- and 77 percent read it at least once a month. 
 College print publications are still beating their online counterparts as well -- only 24 percent of respondents said they read the college paper online twice or more a week. (Of national publications, USA Today, Gannett's flagship publication, has the second-highest readership on campuses, behind The New York Times, the survey noted.)
 College newsrooms are also relatively immune to the market pressures of the industry. ''Our primary focus isn't bringing money to stockholders, it's providing opportunities for students,'' said Mr. McSwane, The Collegian editor, who is a junior from Arvada, Colo. ''We don't ever have to worry that someone's going to come down and say, 'Hey, we have to cut our newsroom budget because someone in Kansas isn't making enough money.' ''
 That independence from the bottom line is what keeps student journalism fresh and irreverent, or so holds the common wisdom in college newsrooms, and journalism professors tend to agree. ''If there is free press, it's probably on the college campuses,'' said Donna Rouner, a journalism professor at Colorado State who wrote an op-ed for The Collegian criticizing any deal.
 No proposal has yet been submitted, but an advisory committee composed of students, including a representative from The Collegian, and Colorado State faculty members held its first meeting Thursday to decide whether a deal with Gannett or any other media company was worth pursuing. 
 Blanche Hughes, the vice president for student affairs, who sits on the committee, said its goal was to gauge how the proposal would work for students as well as the university. She said the committee would look for job and education opportunities for students and assurances from any company that made a bid for The Collegian that the quality of the newspaper would be maintained. 
 Mr. Morton said he doubted that Gannett's ownership would change a student newspaper. ''I'm sure Gannett has absolutely no interest in having anything to do with the editorial product,'' he said. 
 But buying student newspapers, Mr. Morton said, made financial sense. ''It's a way of enlarging your footprint,'' he said.
 Mr. Schwartz, the general manager of The Daily Tar Heel, said he thought Gannett was going after young readers. But he said campus newspapers, with their easy availability and focus on community-based journalism, helped to instill the newspaper habit in students.
 ''Let us make them newspaper readers for you,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In a showdown, Kosovo Declares Its Independence

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations, C. J. Chivers from Moscow and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin.

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo 

 BODY:
The province of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on Sunday, sending tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians streaming through the streets to celebrate what they hoped was the end of a long and bloody struggle for national self-determination. 
 Kosovo's bid to be recognized as Europe's newest country -- after a civil war that killed 10,000 people a decade ago and then years of limbo under United Nations rule -- was the latest episode in the dismemberment of the former Yugoslavia, 17 years after its dissolution began.
 It brings to a climax a showdown between the West, which argues that Serbia's brutal subjugation of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority cost it any right to rule the territory, and the Serbian government and its allies in the Kremlin. They counter that Kosovo's independence is a reckless breach of international law that will spur other secessionist movements across the world. 
 As Albanians danced in the streets and fired guns in the air in the capital, Pristina, international reaction was sharply divided, suggesting that the clash between the principles of sovereignty and self-determination was far from resolved. 
 Britain, France and Germany were expected to be the first recognize the new nation as early as Monday, while other nations, fearing separatist movements within their own borders, have said they will refuse. Russia demanded an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to proclaim the declaration ''null and void,'' but the meeting produced no resolution.
 The United States and additional European Union member states were expected to recognize Kosovo's independence in the coming days.
 President Bush, speaking in Tanzania, said the United States would continue to work to prevent violence in Kosovo, while reaching out to Serbia. He said that resolving the conflict in Kosovo was essential to stability in the Balkans and that ''the Serbian people can know that they have a friend in America.''
 In declaring independence, Kosovo's prime minister, Hashim Thaci, a former leader of the guerrilla force that just over 10 years ago began an armed rebellion against Serbian domination, struck a note of reconciliation. Addressing Parliament in both Albanian and Serbian, he pledged to protect the rights of Kosovo's Serbian minority. ''I feel the heartbeat of our ancestors,'' he said. ''We, the leaders of our people, democratically elected, through this declaration proclaim Kosovo an independent and sovereign state.''
 Kosovo, a desperately poor, predominantly Muslim landlocked territory of two million, has been a United Nations protectorate since 1999, policed by 16,000 NATO troops. Its unemployment rate is about 60 percent and average monthly wage is $250. 
 Electricity is so undependable that lights go out in the capital several times a day. Corruption is rife and human trafficking threatens to entrench a lawless state on Europe's doorstep.
 Ethnic Albanians from as far away as the United States poured into Pristina over the weekend, braving freezing temperatures and heavy snow to dance in frenzied jubilation. Beating drums, waving Albanian flags and throwing firecrackers, they chanted: ''Independence! Independence! We are free at last!'' 
 A 100-foot-long birthday cake was installed on Pristina's main boulevard.
 In an outpouring of adulation for the United States, the architect of NATO's 1999 bombing campaign against Serbian forces under President Slobodan Milosevic, revelers unfurled giant American flags, carried posters of former President Bill Clinton and chanted, ''Thank you, U.S.A.'' and ''God bless America.''
 Hundreds of people, many waving Albanian flags, celebrated in Times Square. Revelers in cars drove in circles around the area, leading chants whenever they passed the crowds gathered on the sidewalks.
 That spirit of exaltation contrasted sharply with the despair, anger and disbelief that gripped Serbia and the Serbian enclaves of northern Kosovo. In Belgrade, Serbia's capital, as many as 2,000 angry Serbs converged on the United States Embassy, hurling stones and smashing windows. 
 In the Kosovo Serb stronghold of Mitrovica, a grenade was thrown at a United Nations building, the police said. No one was injured. 
 Vojislav Kostunica, the prime minister of Serbia, which has regarded Kosovo as its heartland since medieval times, vowed that Serbia would never recognize the ''false state.''
 In an address on national television on Sunday, he said Kosovo was propped up unlawfully by the United States and called the declaration a ''humiliation'' for the European Union. The Serbian government has ruled out using military force in response, but was expected to downgrade diplomatic ties with any government that recognized Kosovo. 
 Demonstrations were planned for Monday in Serbian enclaves across Kosovo. Serbs said they were under orders from Belgrade to ignore the independence declaration and remain in Kosovo to keep the northern part of the territory under de facto Serbian control, raising questions about Serbia's long-term aims.
 At the Security Council, Russia argued that the proclamation violated the 1999 resolution that established the United Nations mission in Kosovo. ''Our position is that the declaration should be disregarded by the international community and declared null and void,'' said Vitaly I. Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations.
 But Alejandro D. Wolff, the deputy American ambassador, said, ''In our view, this declaration is logical and consistent and completely in line with'' the 1999 measure.
 Secretary General Ban Ki-moon pleaded with all parties ''to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace, incite violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo or the region.''
 The Security Council agreed to a request by Russia and Serbia to hold an open meeting on Monday that will be addressed by the Serbian president, Boris Tadic.
 Kosovo's declaration followed nearly two years of United Nations-sponsored negotiations between it and Serbia. Those talks failed, as did a Security Council effort in December to resolve Kosovo's future.
 The European Commission, the European Union's executive branch, appealed for calm, while NATO's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, said the alliance would respond ''swiftly and firmly against anyone who might resort to violence.'' 
 Kosovo's sovereignty remains severely circumscribed, making it reliant on the international community. NATO still provides international security, while the European Union has agreed to send an 1,800-strong police and judicial mission to help run the territory after the United Nations leaves.
 Ulrich Wilhelm, the spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said Germany would decide what to do on Monday. 
 Kosovo played a central role in the collapse of the Yugoslav federation built by the Communist strongman Josip Broz Tito, who died in 1980. Albanian nationalism erupted in Kosovo in 1981, leading to bloody clashes.
 In the 1980s, Mr. Milosevic used Serbs' enormous sense of grievance that their ancestral heartland was now dominated by Muslim Albanians to come to power in Serbia. By 1989, he had abolished Kosovo's autonomy, fired tens of thousands of Albanians from their jobs, suppressed Albanian language education and controlled the territory with a heavy police presence.
 Ten years ago, Mr. Milosevic's forces moved against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, killing a guerrilla leader and his family at their compound. As violence escalated, NATO intervened in a 1999 bombing campaign, causing hundreds of thousands of Albanians and Serbs to flee.
 An estimated 10,000 civilians were killed in the 1998-99 conflict, many of them Albanians, while 1,500 Serbs died in revenge killings that followed. 
 For the ethnic Albanians who make up 95 percent of Kosovo's population, independence marks a new beginning. 
 ''Independence is a catharsis,'' said Antoneta Kastrati, 26, an Albanian from Peja, who said her mother and older sister were killed by their Serbian neighbors in 1999. ''Things won't change overnight and we cannot forget the past, but maybe I will feel safe now and my nightmares will finally go away.''
 In Mitrovica, a 70-year-old Serbian engineer who would give only his first name, Svetozar, said: ''I will stay here forever. This will always be Serbia.''
 Kosovo's declaration created immediate ripples in the former Soviet Union, where small, Russian-backed separatist areas -- one in Moldova and two in the republic of Georgia -- have existed since the early 1990s. Two of them -- Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia -- announced their intention to seek recognition as independent states.
 Conversely, several of the European Union's 27 member states -- including Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Slovakia and Romania -- oppose recognizing Kosovo because they fear encouraging secessionist movements within their own borders. 
 In Brussels, officials were drafting a statement for a foreign ministers' meeting on Monday. Senior European Union officials said they expected it to acknowledge Kosovo's independence declaration without explicitly endorsing it.
 The declaration of independence raises the prospects of a new constitution and emblems of nationhood, including a new flag bearing a map of Kosovo topped by six stars.
 But in a sign of how hard it will be to forge the kind of multiethnic, secular identity that foreign powers have urged, the distinctive two-headed eagle of the red and black Albanian flag, reviled by Serbs, was everywhere Sunday, held by revelers, draped on horses, flapping out of car windows and hanging outside homes and storefronts across the territory.

HEADLINE: N.B.A.'s Recovery Work Draws Malone Back Home

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
A severe knee injury pushed Karl Malone out of the N.B.A. four years ago. An injury to his home state helped bring him back.
 Malone, often regarded as one of the game's greatest power forwards, has been largely out of sight since retiring from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2004. But he quietly slipped back into the N.B.A.'s orbit this weekend, pulled by a powerful force. 
 A native of Summerfield, La., who now resides in Ruston (about 300 miles northwest of here), Malone came to New Orleans to join the league's rebuilding efforts during All-Star weekend. Malone brought his own work crew, including friends and his 12-year-old son, Karl Jr., to participate in Friday's Day of Service.
 ''I think it's great, what the N.B.A. is doing,'' Malone said. He added: ''I took my kids and we visited the Ninth Ward. We still have a lot of work to do.''
 Malone knew that even before he made the 30-minute flight here. After Hurricane Katrina devastated the region in August 2005, Malone brought his logging company's equipment to Pascagoula, Miss., to help clear debris. But he said he ran into resistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which told him he was not authorized to do the work.
 He said he was encouraged, however, by the league's commitment to New Orleans, calling All-Star weekend ''a great shot in the arm.'' 
 Malone also said he believed the Hornets could succeed here despite low attendance, a reduced population and a weak economy.
 ''I'll tell you one thing: I'll throw my name in the hat,'' he said. ''If they don't want them here, I'll buy them and keep them here.''
 BRYANT PROTECTING PINKIEKobe Bryant was in the starting lineup for the Western Conference All-Stars on Sunday night, but his main concern was protecting his injured right pinkie, which will need surgery.
 Bryant wanted to sit out the game but was required by the league to make an appearance. He played only the first 2 minutes 52 seconds and did not take a shot. The East won, 134-128.
 Bryant, who tore the ligament Feb. 5, has resisted a push by Lakers officials to have surgery immediately. Recovery will require four to six weeks.
 GARNETT PLANS TO PRACTICEKevin Garnett, who had to sit out the All-Star Game because of an abdominal strain, said he was planning to practice with the Boston Celtics on Monday. He said he hoped to return to the lineup for Tuesday's game at Denver.

HEADLINE: Before Murder, Troubled Quest To Find Mother

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY and AL BAKER; Reporting was contributed by C.J. Hughes, Daryl Khan, Thomas J. Lueck, Colin Moynihan, Fernanda Santos, Maureen Seaberg and Karen Zraick.

 BODY:
In the eight and a half months before his arrest in the fatal stabbing of a Manhattan therapist, a Queens man became so obsessed with his institutionalized mother that his father kept moving her from nursing home to nursing home, a law enforcement official said on Sunday.
 Each time the man, David Tarloff, found her, trouble eventually ensued, with Mr. Tarloff becoming belligerent and threatening the home's workers, according to officials and court records. His father, Leonard Tarloff, in a vain attempt to keep his son from causing havoc, moved Beatrice Tarloff, his 73-year-old ex-wife, into at least three nursing homes.
 But David Tarloff, unemployed and living alone, kept trying to seek her out in the hopes of bringing her home to live with him again, growing increasingly agitated with each thwarted effort. His father told investigators that his son was fixated on his mother, the law enforcement official said, and some neighbors said that Mr. Tarloff seemed lost after she moved away.
 From June 2007 to Feb. 1, Mr. Tarloff's quest was punctuated by three encounters with the police, who took him to three hospitals for psychiatric evaluations. Each time, he was released. 
 Mr. Tarloff, 39, was arrested on Saturday in the killing of the therapist, Kathryn Faughey, 56, and the attack on a psychiatrist, Dr. Kent D. Shinbach, 70, on Tuesday night in the offices they shared on East 79th Street. 
 Mr. Tarloff told investigators that Dr. Shinbach had him committed to a mental health institution 17 years ago, and on Sunday, officials confirmed that Dr. Shinbach had indeed played a role in his commitment. Mr. Tarloff said that he did not intend to attack Dr. Faughey. Instead, Mr. Tarloff said his plan was to rob Dr. Shinbach and then leave the country or go to Hawaii with his ailing mother. Drawn by Dr. Faughey's screams, Dr. Shinbach was slashed after rushing to try to help her and is recovering at his Manhattan home. 
 Leonard Tarloff expressed deep remorse on Sunday for the crimes his oldest son stands accused of committing.
 ''If you can convey our sincere condolences to the families of Dr. Faughey and Dr. Shinbach,'' Leonard Tarloff said, his voice breaking, in a telephone interview from his Staten Island home. ''We hope they can find it in their hearts to forgive my son.''
 Mr. Tarloff's at-times erratic behavior, described by his neighbors and others who had crossed his path, was on display at his appearance on Sunday in Manhattan Criminal Court, where he was charged with second-degree murder in Dr. Faughey's death, and attempted murder and assault and battery in the attack on Dr. Shinbach. 
 During the five-minute hearing, Mr. Tarloff fidgeted and chewed his lip, denigrated his court-appointed lawyer and asked to be taken to a vending machine for snacks. The judge, Acting Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz, adjourned the case and ordered that Mr. Tarloff undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Mr. Tarloff was being held at Bellevue Hospital Center.
 A review of court records by investigators showed that Dr. Shinbach took part in recommending that Mr. Tarloff be institutionalized in 1991, according to law enforcement officials. It was unclear whether Dr. Shinbach was his primary care physician or was part of a team that handled his case. But the doctor had no recollection of ever having encountered Mr. Tarloff before being attacked on Tuesday night, officials said.
 On Sunday, interviews with the police and with Mr. Tarloff's family and neighbors, offered a portrait of an increasingly troubled and depressed man whose actions were deemed serious enough to draw the attention of the authorities, but not grave enough to merit committing him to a psychiatric hospital for any substantial length of time. It was unclear what mental health problems Mr. Tarloff had experienced.
 On June 6, 2007, the police were called to Midway Nursing Home in Queens, where his mother had been admitted, after workers called 911 to say that Mr. Tarloff had arrived at 7:30 a.m., and had threatened to kill everyone there. After arresting Mr. Tarloff, the police took him to Elmhurst Hospital Center for a mental health evaluation. The duration of his stay was unclear, and a hospital spokesman did not return phone calls.
 On Aug. 3, Leonard Tarloff called the police to his home, saying that Mr. Tarloff had stopped taking his medication and was behaving violently. The police found Mr. Tarloff wandering the streets, and took him to Staten Island University Hospital. The duration of his stay there was also unclear, and a hospital spokeswoman, Rochelle Steinhaus, said she could not comment on whether Mr. Tarloff had been admitted.
 On Feb. 1, Mr. Tarloff was arrested at St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, where his mother was a patient, after menacing staff members and attacking a security guard. Mr. Tarloff had violated prearranged hospital visitation rules by trying to get too close to his mother, the authorities said, and lashed out after a guard upbraided him. 
 After his arrest, Mr. Tarloff was taken to a psychiatric unit in the hospital, and was released on his own recognizance the next day, 10 days before Dr. Faughey's murder. His next court appearance in that case was scheduled for Feb. 25.
 Without specific details about the evaluations conducted at the hospitals where Mr. Tarloff was treated, it is difficult to assess the quality of his care. A hospital cannot commit someone against his will unless the patient is deemed a danger to himself or others, and laws limit the amount of time people committed involuntarily can be kept in hospitals.
 And because no centralized system exists to track a person's history in different hospitals around New York City, a hospital would not necessarily know if a patient had been admitted elsewhere for psychiatric reasons, said Dr. Spencer Eth, the medical director of behavioral health services at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan.
 Dr. Eth said most hospital acute care units, where patients considered dangerous are assigned, are short-term facilities. ''In a matter of days or weeks, he'll be discharged again,'' Dr. Eth said. ''That's the so-called revolving door.''
 A state law does allow relatives and others to ask a judge to force patients to receive outpatient treatment or to be involuntarily committed. The statute is known as Kendra's Law, named after Kendra Webdale, who was pushed in front of a subway train by Andrew Goldstein, a schizophrenic patient. Whether such a court order had been sought for Mr. Tarloff's commitment could not be determined. 
 Neighbors and acquaintances said Mr. Tarloff had been deteriorating before their eyes for the last decade or so. 
 Phyllis Zicherman -- a neighbor who lives in the same apartment complex as Mr. Tarloff, on 60th Avenue in Corona, Queens -- said Mr. Tarloff had been a slim, dapper and exceedingly neatly dressed teenager. ''He was always the ladies' man, back then,'' said Ms. Zicherman. ''He was tall and thin, you know, with the tight jeans and always looking good.''
 But after college at Syracuse University, he returned to Queens, and began to change into a depressed, slovenly and overweight man who became despondent when his father moved out and later despaired when his mother was moved to a nursing home. The reason for his mother's placement in a nursing home was not known.
 It was unclear whether Mr. Tarloff finished his degree, and details about the years that followed are sketchy. While State Supreme Court records show that he was institutionalized in 1991, where he was sent, the reason and the duration could not be determined. Mr. Tarloff told investigators that he had used cocaine, but officials could not confirm that.
 He eventually returned to his mother's second-floor two-bedroom apartment. 
 His younger brother, Robert Tarloff, moved out, married and had children, Ms. Zicherman said. But David Tarloff was clearly in a rut. 
 As the years passed, people in his neighborhood said, he became known as the ''crazy guy.'' He would pester neighbors and nearby shopkeepers, asking for money. Sometimes he stole Yoo-hoo chocolate drinks and cat food from B. P. Connection, a convenience store across the street. Sometimes the clerks there gave him a sandwich or a banana, partly out of sympathy, partly because he would sometimes pay them back.
 Lameka Bell, 23, a store clerk, said that while workers were wary of Mr. Tarloff's state of mind, no one was afraid of him. Instead, she described him as a sad figure whose stomach often hung out, with his pants cuffs dragging and his fly unzipped.
 Neighbors said he and his mother often got into screaming matches late at night, but despite that, her absence left him lonely and led him to behave increasingly strangely.
 Bruce Wayne Griffin, 45, who lived down the hall from Mr. Tarloff, said that a strong stench of cat urine often emanated from Mr. Tarloff's apartment. Inside, Mr. Griffin said, the place was sparsely decorated, with little furniture, and covered in grime. 
 But Leonard Tarloff still visited his son. Ms. Bell said she often saw Mr. Tarloff sitting with his father, talking in a sedan in the parking lot in front of her store. Once, she said, Leonard Tarloff came in and paid for the Yoo-hoos and cat food that Ms. Bell said his son had stolen.
 On Sunday, Robert Tarloff told reporters that his family had struggled for years to get his brother the care he needed. He would not elaborate, though, on his brother's mental condition or where he had been hospitalized.
 ''What I want the city to know is that my father and I and our mother all tried our best to keep him in the facility that he was hospitalized in over the many, many years of his illness,'' he said, standing outside his father's home. ''But they kept on releasing him, after we told them what had been going on.
 ''We did the best that we could, asking them to keep him in there,'' Robert Tarloff added. ''They didn't.''

HEADLINE: A Rip-Off by Health Insurers?

 BODY:
Have health insurers been systematically cheating patients and doctors of fair reimbursement for medical services? That is the disturbing possibility raised by an investigation of the industry's arcane procedures for calculating ''reasonable and customary'' rates.
 The investigation, by the New York State attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, and his staff, suggests that these procedures -- used by major insurance companies to determine what they will pay when patients visit a doctor who is not in the company's network -- may be rigged to shortchange the beneficiaries. 
 When patients visit an out-of-network doctor, insurers typically agree to pay 80 percent of the reasonable and customary rate charged by doctors in the same geographic area. The patient is stuck with the rest, and as any patient knows, that rate always seems to fall short of what their own doctor is charging. If the attorney general's investigators are right, we can understand why.
 The numbers are mainly compiled by an obscure company known as Ingenix, which -- as it turns out -- is owned by UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest health insurers. Ingenix collects billing information from UnitedHealth and other health care payers to compile a database that is then used by the insurers to determine out-of-network reimbursement rates.
 This system is an invitation for abuse. UnitedHealth owns the company whose database will affect its costs and profitability, so both have a strong financial interest in keeping reimbursement rates low. Even Ingenix seems unwilling to stand behind its numbers. In licensing its database to insurers, it stresses that the data is ''for informational purposes only'' and does not imply anything about ''reasonable and customary'' charges. Yet that is precisely what the health insurers use the data for, as Ingenix knows, according to investigators.
 Mr. Cuomo and the American Medical Association, which has a long-standing suit filed against Ingenix and various UnitedHealth companies, claim that the data is manipulated. They claim that health insurers and Ingenix disproportionately eliminate high charges, thus skewing the numbers for customary charges downward.
 Mr. Cuomo also says that Ingenix pools the charges for services performed by low-paid nurses and physician assistants with those performed by high-paid doctors. And he says the company fails to account for the patient's condition and type of facility where the service was provided -- factors that can drive up costs. He also contends that Ingenix uses outdated information, which would guarantee that reimbursement rates will always lag behind medical inflation.
 The A.M.A.'s more detailed legal complaint also charges that the database dilutes prices in high-cost locations by combining them with low-cost areas, and includes prices that reflect in-network discounts. 
 The attorney general's investigators did their own survey and concluded that $200 is the fair market rate in New York City and Nassau County for a 15-minute consultation with a doctor for an illness of low to moderate severity. Ingenix, the investigators said, calculated the rate as $77, of which United would pay $62, leaving the patient to pay $138. UnitedHealth disputes those numbers, so the attorney general will need to offer a fuller explanation of how they were derived. 
 Mr. Cuomo has announced his intention to sue UnitedHealth, Ingenix and three other subsidiaries, and has subpoenaed data from 16 other health insurers. Whatever that investigation unearths, it is already clear that the system for calculating ''reasonable and customary'' charges ought to be reformed by making it truly independent and objective. No consumer can reasonably trust numbers generated by a company whose loyalties and financial interests lie with the health insurers.

HEADLINE: After China Ships Out iPhones, Smugglers Make It a Return Trip

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; John Markoff contributed reporting from San Francisco.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Factories here churn out iPhones that are exported to the United States and Europe. Then thousands of them are smuggled right back into China.
 The strange journey of Apple's popular iPhone, to nearly every corner of the world, shows what happens when the world's hottest consumer product defies a company's attempt to slowly introduce it in new markets.
 The iPhone has been swept up in a frenzy of global smuggling and word-of-mouth marketing that leads friends to ask friends, ''While you're in the U.S., would you mind picking up an iPhone for me?''
 These unofficial distribution networks help explain a mystery that analysts who follow Apple have been pondering: why is there a large gap between the number of iPhones that Apple says it sold last year, about 3.7 million, and the 2.3 million that are actually registered on the networks of its wireless partners in the United States and Europe? 
 The answer now seems clear. For months, tourists, small entrepreneurs and smugglers of electronic goods have been buying iPhones in the United States and then shipping them overseas. 
 There the phones' digital locks are broken so they can work on local cellular networks, and they are outfitted with localized software, essentially undermining Apple's effort to introduce the phone with exclusive partnership deals, similar to its primary partnership agreement with AT&T in the United States.
 ''There's no question many of them are ending up abroad,'' said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst who follows Apple for Needham & Company. 
 For Apple, the booming overseas market for iPhones is both a sign of its marketing prowess and a blow to a business model that could be coming undone, costing the company as much as $1 billion over the next three years, according to some analysts.
 But those economic realities do not play into the mind of Daniel Pan, a 22-year-old Web site designer in Shanghai who says a friend recently bought an iPhone for him in the United States. 
 He and other people here often pay $450 to $600 to get a phone that sells for $400 in the United States. But they are happy.
 ''This is even better than I thought it would be,'' he said, toying with his iPhone at an upscale coffee shop. ''This is definitely one of the great inventions of this century.''
 Mr. Pan is among the new breed of young professionals in China who can afford to buy the latest gadgets and the coolest Western brands. IPhones are widely available at electronic stores in big cities, and many stores offer unlocking services for imported phones. 
 Chinese sellers of iPhones say they typically get the phones from suppliers who buy them in the United States, then have them shipped or brought to China by airline passengers. 
 Often, they say, the phones are given to members of Chinese tourist groups or Chinese airline flight attendants, who are typically paid a commission of about $30 for every phone they deliver.
 Although unlocking the phone violates Apple's purchase agreement, it does not appear to violate any laws here, though many stores may be avoiding import duties.
 Considering China's penchant for smuggling and counterfeiting high-quality goods, the huge number of iPhones being sold here is not surprising, particularly given the popularity of the Apple brand in China.
 Indeed, within months of the release of the iPhone in the United States last June, iPhone knockoffs, or iClones as some have called them, were selling here for as little as $125. But most people opt for the real thing.
 ''A lot of people here want to get an iPhone,'' says Conlyn Chan, 31, a lawyer who was born in Taiwan and now lives in Shanghai. ''I know a guy who went back to the States and bought 20 iPhones. He even gave one to his driver.''
 Negotiations between Apple and China Mobile, the world's biggest mobile-phone service operator with more than 350 million subscribers, broke down last month, stalling the official release of the iPhone in China. Long before that, however, there was a thriving gray market.
 ''I love all of Apple's products,'' said a 27-year-old Beijing engineer named Chen Chen who found his iPhone through a bulletin board Web site. ''I bought mine for $625 last October, and the seller helped me unlock it. Reading and sending Chinese messages is no problem.''
 An iPhone purchased in Shanghai or Beijing typically costs about $555. To unlock the phone and add Chinese language software costs an additional $25. 
 For Apple, the sale of iPhones to people who ship them to China is a source of revenue. But the company is still losing out, because its exclusive deals with phone service providers bring in revenue after the phone is sold. If the phones were activated in the United States, Apple would receive as much as $120 a year per user from AT&T, analysts say. 
 But there are forces working against that. Programmers around the world collaborate on and share programs that unlock the iPhone, racing to put out new versions when Apple updates its defenses.
 While Apple has not strongly condemned unlocking, it has warned consumers that this violates the purchase agreement and can cause problems with software updates.
 Some analysts say abandoning the locked phone system and allowing buyers to sign up with any carrier they choose, in any country, could spur sales.
 ''The model is threatened,'' Mr. Wolf, the analyst, said. But ''if they sold the phone unlocked with no exclusive carrier, demand could be much higher.''
 An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the proliferation of iPhones in China. When asked about the number of unlocked iPhones during a conference call with analysts last month, Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief operating officer, said it was ''significant in the quarter, but we're unsure how to reliably estimate the number.''
 The copycat models are another possible threat to Apple. Not long after the iPhone was released, research and development teams in China were taking it apart, trying to copy or steal the design and software for use in knockoffs.
 Some people who have used the clones say they are sophisticated and have many functions that mimic the iPhone.
 In Shanghai, television advertisements market the Ai Feng, a phone with a name that sounds like iPhone but in Chinese translates roughly as the Crazy Love. That phone sells for about $125. 
 Some of the sellers of the copycats admit the phones are a scam.
 ''It's a fake iPhone, but it looks nearly the same,'' said a man who answered the phone last week at the Shenzhen Sunshine Trade Company, in southern China's biggest electronics manufacturing area. ''We manufacture it by ourselves. We have our own R. &D. group and manufacturing plant. Most of our products are for export.''
 Most people here seem to want the glory that comes with showing off a real iPhone to friends.
 ''My friends envy me a lot,'' says Mr. Pan, the Web designer. ''They say, ''Wow, you can get an iPhone.' ''

HEADLINE: Tax Scandal in Germany Fans Complaints of Inequity

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and MARK LANDLER; Nicholas Kulish contributed reporting from Berlin.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
For wealthy Germans, many of whom have long hidden their money outside the country to avoid its high taxes, this has been a weekend of high anxiety. For their fellow citizens, it has been a riveting spectacle, dominating the public discussion for days.
 Prosecutors are investigating hundreds of people, including several who are household names in Germany, on suspicion that they evaded taxes by steering money to Liechtenstein, a postage-stamp principality known for its striking Alpine scenery and discreet banks.
 The fast-spreading scandal has already brought down one of Germany's most powerful business figures, Klaus Zumwinkel, who resigned Friday as the chief executive of the German postal service after the police raided his home. He is suspected of evading $1.46 million in taxes.
 The scandal bears the hallmarks of a Robert Ludlum novel, with a mysterious informant who was paid by German intelligence to turn over a data disc containing evidence of tax fraud on a vast scale. 
 The ripples are extending far beyond Germany's moneyed elite, inflaming the suspicions many ordinary Germans have long felt toward well-paid corporate bosses and the free market in general.
 A leftist party that campaigns against the excesses of business has made notable inroads in recent German state elections, raising hurdles for the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is viewed as pro-business but has been sharply critical of the suspected tax evasion.
 Evidence that Germany's rich tucked away their cash in Liechtenstein and other tax havens is creating a new narrative in German politics: the betrayal of the elites, who have spent the last decade calling for a painful reform of the welfare state, even as they apparently avoided paying their fair share.
 ''The political implications of this are going to be great,'' said John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany who is a banker here. ''In the U.S., we send people off to prison and say 'good riddance,' but it doesn't actually shake people's belief in the system. Here, it does.''
 German authorities say they began unraveling the scandal in 2006, when a person, whose identity has not been disclosed, approached the country's Federal Intelligence Service, its equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency, offering a CD-ROM with data on German clients of a bank in Liechtenstein.
 After checking out a sample of the information on the CD, the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, authorized a payment of about 5 million euros ($7.3 million) for the information.
 By late last year, the material had passed through the tax agency in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, officials said, and landed on the desk of a special financial crimes group in Bochum, a gritty industrial city.
 There, the investigators recognized a kind of tax dodge they knew existed but could seldom document.
 Liechtenstein, a tiny German-speaking principality wedged between Switzerland and Austria, has strict banking secrecy laws and grants favorable treatment to foundations. Many are filled with cash spirited out of Germany through various means, some as crude as stuffing a suitcase with cash and driving across the border. Smugglers are arrested regularly.
 Foundations are taxed in the low single digits and are permitted to disburse money to their founders and to founders' family members. The foundations are also permitted to open bank accounts in their own names outside the principality, which gives the owners access abroad to their cash.
 Any effort to trace the owners of the foundations runs up against Liechtenstein's tough banking secrecy laws.
 Data from the LGT Group, a Liechtenstein bank with a subsidiary that specializes in foundations, appears to have formed the basis of the German investigation. The bank, which is owned by the royal family of Liechtenstein, has said it cannot confirm its part in the investigation.
 But on Friday, the bank said that the German scandal might be linked to data stolen by a disgruntled employee in 2002, and it conceded that it was not sure how many clients had been exposed. ''The scope of the presumed data transfer cannot be determined,'' LGT said.
 In Bochum, the prosecutors had enough information to obtain 13 search warrants against three people, Mr. Zumwinkel among them. With television cameras in tow, they arrived at his villa in an affluent suburb of Cologne on the morning of Feb. 14 and carted away boxes of documents.
 Prosecutors announced that they had obtained an arrest warrant for Mr. Zumwinkel but did not execute it after he agreed to cooperate with them and posted a large bond.
 The warrant outlined a typical Liechtenstein tax fraud, according to the German magazine Focus and the paper Bild am Sonntag: a foundation with the mailing address of Mr. Zumwinkel's Italian vacation home, filled with 12 million euros ($17.5 million) that he obtained by selling 10 family businesses.
 Mr. Zumwinkel, who helped transform Deutsche Post, the German postal service, from a stodgy state bureaucracy into a publicly listed logistics and freight-delivery powerhouse, initially tried to cling to his job. But after pressure from Chancellor Merkel and others, he stepped down.
 The prosecutors announced that they had evidence against ''several hundred'' other German tax evaders, and an official said there would be additional raids in the coming week. Mr. Steinbruck, the finance minister, urged suspects to surrender to avoid jail time.
 ''The authorities are telling people even destroying documents will do them no good,'' said Rudolf Schwenger, a former tax investigator in Frankfurt. ''The best they can do is turn themselves in and get away with only a financial penalty.''
 This latest scandal has echoes of one several years ago, in which an anonymous whistle-blower gave Bochum prosecutors a CD with names of 200 Germans who worked with a Liechtenstein citizen to hide money. The man, Herbert Batliner, who also worked with the financier Marc Rich, was a pioneer in the use of the foundation as a tax dodge.
 The German Tax Union, an advocacy group, estimates that Germany loses 30 billion euros ($43.8 billion) a year to tax evasion. The government tried to recoup some of that with a 15-month tax amnesty program that ended in mid-2005. But it brought in only a fifth of the 5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) that the finance ministry had hoped for when it took the controversial step.
 Spiriting money across the border is a deeply rooted tradition in Germany. During and after World War II, many wealthy Germans stashed assets in Switzerland to escape the political turmoil here -- first under the Nazi regime, then under the threat of the Soviet army at their border.
 They continued to take suitcases of cash to Liechtenstein, Switzerland and other havens through the postwar economic boom, when tax rates became some of the highest in Europe.
 In 2002, analysts estimated that 300 billion euros ($438 billion) was hidden from tax authorities in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein and Austria. These four nations are more convenient for Germans to visit, and place assets in, than other tax havens, like those in the Caribbean.
 But Austria and Luxembourg are now members of the European Union, making them less attractive. Like Switzerland, Liechtenstein is outside the union and depends on foreign deposits in its banks.
 Several German celebrities have been caught trying to evade taxes. In 2002, the tennis champion Boris Becker was found guilty of claiming residency in Monaco when he was living in Munich.
 The tax scandal comes at a moment when Germany is undergoing what analystsdescribe as a shift to the left politically. Despite rising employment, many Germans are dissatisfied with stagnant wage growth and do not feel that they are sharing in the gains, according to surveys.
 The starkest example of this shift was the surprising strength of the Left Party in recent regional elections. The party, which brings together disaffected Social Democrats, hard-core leftists and former Communists, moved beyond its strongholds in the states that made up the former East Germany to wins seat in the state Parliaments in Lower Saxony and Hesse, for the first time.
 Next Sunday, voters in the city-state of Hamburg go to the polls, and conservatives fear a rout if the public seizes on the election as a chance to vent frustrations about tax evasion and what it seems to symbolize.
 Even a few German business leaders ventured their own harsh words for tax evasion over the weekend.
 ''Not only family entrepreneurs but also the overwhelming majority of business executives is rightly worried in light of the damage that is being inflicted on the entire profession by the misbehavior of a small group,'' the head of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Ludwig Georg Braun, said in an open letter published in the German news media.

HEADLINE: Government To Control Struggling British Bank

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The British government announced on Sunday that it would bring Northern Rock, the struggling mortgage lender, under its control. It was the first nationalization of a bank in more than a decade and a huge blow for the administration of Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
 The government rejected two takeover proposals for the lender, which ran into trouble last year because of a money shortage that followed a subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. The government was forced to shore up the company with about $:55 billion, or $107 billion, in loans and guarantees. 
 ''The government has completed its review of the two detailed proposals received,'' Alistair M. Darling, chancellor of the Exchequer, said at a news conference in London on Sunday. ''But in current market conditions, we do not believe that they deliver sufficient value for money for the taxpayer. The government has therefore decided to bring forward legislation to take Northern Rock into a period of temporary public ownership.''
 The Virgin Group under Richard Branson and the current management of Northern Rock had both submitted takeover proposals to the government's adviser, Goldman Sachs, before a deadline earlier this year. Both suggested repaying the loans partly by issuing new shares. Mr. Darling said on Sunday that neither proposal had met all of the government's objectives of securing financial stability, depositors' money and taxpayers' funds.
 Under the government ownership plan, the taxpayers' outstanding loans to Northern Rock will be repaid in full with interest, Mr. Darling said. The private sector alternatives did not meet this test, he said.
 Northern Rock's trouble began last September when the management revealed it had financing problems and thousands of depositors formed lines in front of its branches to retrieve their money. The government stepped in within days to guarantee deposits, but many lawmakers and analysts criticized the treasury for taking too long to act.
 Mr. Darling defended the government's intervention, saying that if it had ''let this bank fail, there would be a chance that the problems would have spread into the wider British banking system.'' But some shareholders have spoken out against nationalization, saying the government was unlikely to invest further in Northern Rock to pay for any expansion of the business, and may scale down its operations.
 ''I'm shocked and appalled; nationalization is not an option for this,'' a Northern Rock shareholder, Robin Ashby, told the British Broadcasting Corporation. ''This is a very bad day for Britain.''
 Mr. Ashby said he could not rule out the possibility that some shareholders would take legal action against the government. 
 The ruling Labor Party had tried to avoid nationalization, which worsens a situation that is already embarrassing for Mr. Brown. Not only has he prided himself on his economic competence, but the move also recalled the 1970s, when such takeovers led to the decline of the economy and the end of Labor Party control.
 Mr. Darling said on Sunday that Ron Sandler, a former chief executive of Lloyds of London, would take over as executive chairman of the bank. He said the bank should be returned to shareholder ownership as soon as possible. Mr. Sandler will travel to Northern Rock's headquarters in Newcastle, in northeast England, on Monday to meet with staff members and unions.
 Neither Mr. Sandler nor Mr. Darling commented on possible job cuts at the bank. Northern Rock is the largest employer and one of the biggest mortgage lenders in the region.
 The chancellor plans to introduce legislation on Monday to bring the lender under government control. The bank will continue to operate normally, and deposits will continue to be secured.
 Northern Rock shareholders are to receive some compensation for their investments, set by a government panel, but are likely to walk away with little as a result of nationalization, some analysts have said. Northern Rock shares lost 87 percent of their value over the last six months.
 The government has been under pressure to resolve Northern Rock's problems before a deadline later this year set by the European Union, which would have regarded the emergency loans as state aid. Mr. Brown and Mr. Darling have said that nationalization was their least preferred option.

HEADLINE: Huckabee Takes a Break And Heads to the Islands

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands 

 BODY:
Mike Huckabee left voters behind in the snow in Wisconsin over the weekend and headed to this getaway resort island. 
 Mr. Huckabee stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, where he gave the keynote address on Saturday night for the premier social event on the island, the annual black-tie Young Caymanian Leadership Foundation's awards banquet, which recognizes role models for young people here.
 The unusual detour in the middle of a campaign, on the weekend before the Wisconsin presidential primary, had raised many questions: Is it appropriate to take a speaking fee while running for president? Is it appropriate to pick up cash in an offshore tax haven when routinely criticizing that haven for putting a burden on the American economy? Was this detour more or less an admission that he was not serious about his campaign? 
 Before his speech, Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, met with reporters, popping into a hotel salon in his tuxedo. He had gone running earlier -- seven miles in a humid 85 degrees -- and his face was scorched, except where his sunglasses protected his eyes. 
 Mr. Huckabee said the matter was simple: He came here because he needed the money.
 Yet, when asked how much he received, he suggested that he did not know.
 ''The speakers' bureau does it, and I sign a contract, they send it,'' Mr. Huckabee said. ''I could know it if I dig through my files.'' 
 He added, ''There are a lot of different ways in which the expenses and different parts of it are accounted for before I ever get mine; there's a commission.'' Then he added, ''It's not nearly as much as a senator makes in a year.''
 Jackie Hansen, director of the Young Caymanian Leadership Foundation, declined to reveal the fee. Ms. Hansen said that it was ''not extraordinary'' and that other speakers over the years had received more.
 Mr. Huckabee turned the occasion into an opportunity to point out that his chief rival for the Republican presidential nomination, John McCain of Arizona, and the two Democrats seeking their party's nomination are senators and that unlike them, he did not receive a taxpayer-financed salary while campaigning.
 ''No taxpayers pay for me to have health insurance, to pay my mortgage, to pay my bills,'' Mr. Huckabee said. ''And so to me, it's not just absurd, it's beyond absurd -- it's insulting -- to think that there's something nefarious about my being here when nobody has raised the question about sitting U.S. senators taking their full paycheck and enjoying all the magnificent perks they get from the U.S. taxpayers.''
 Indeed, as Mr. Huckabee likes to tell his audiences, he rose up from a hardscrabble youth in Hope, Ark. His parents were children of the Depression. They were so afraid of debt that they waited to buy their house until they could pay with cash. 
 Mr. Huckabee himself has never been rich, drawing a $74,000 salary as governor, though when he left office, he bought a house in Little Rock for $525,000. On his most recent federal financial disclosure form, for 2006, he valued his assets at between $318,000 and $895,000. He earned nearly $150,000 in book royalties and made approximately $50,000 in speaking honorariums that year. His highest speaking fee was $17,000. 
 ''We still clip coupons, we still tithe,'' his wife, Janet Huckabee, said in a recent interview. ''Just today I called home to check the heat because the bill seemed extraordinarily high for someone who's not there.'' 
 Mr. Huckabee has a reputation for a certain amount of showmanship and self-promotion. So he used his moment before reporters here to deliver his basic campaign messages and to point out that Mr. McCain, too, was off the trail this weekend ''doing absolutely nothing'' and had been off two days last week. (Mr. McCain's spokeswoman said he was spending time with his family at home.)
 Mr. Huckabee was then off to address the 500 patrons in the Ritz's grand ballroom, with a motivational speech that lasted barely 20 minutes. He told a frequent campaign parable about learning to ride a bobsled and being told to steer into the next curve as soon as it appeared. He drew a life lesson from this advice, which was not to worry about the past and to plan ahead. ''Plan your work, work your plan,'' he said. ''If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.''
 Later, the crowd gathered around him for pictures and autographs, even though most of them do not vote in American elections. (The Cayman Islands are a British overseas territory, but there are some Americans here who vote by absentee ballot.)
 ''He's one of the most interesting people, and every time I listen to one of his speeches, he makes me laugh,'' said Kristin Dilbert, 24, a commercial banker.
 Ms. Dilbert said everyone she knew was following the primaries. ''It's a big deal,'' she said, ''a presidential candidate here in the Cayman Islands.''
 Ms. Hansen, the head of the foundation, said the board picked Mr. Huckabee to speak in part because several years ago he had spoken at her Baptist church here, and they became friendly. When the foundation started in 2000, he agreed to be the first speaker, at no charge. 
 ''I felt this was the year to bring him back,'' Ms. Hansen said. ''He really does exemplify our message.''
 ''And now,'' she added, ''he's getting all this attention.''
 Indeed he is. Perhaps the getaway brought him even more.

HEADLINE: Chavez Backs Off Threats To Halt Oil Exports to U.S.

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday that Venezuela was not planning to halt oil exports to the United States. The statement may ease fears in energy markets over fallout from Venezuela's legal battle with Exxon Mobil over compensation for the nationalization of a large oil project. 
 Mr. Chavez's conciliatory tone stands in contrast to recent comments made by him and other officials here in which they threatened to stop exporting oil to the United States. They said the Bush administration and Exxon Mobil were conspiring to wreak economic havoc in Venezuela. 
 ''We do not have plans to stop sending oil to the United States,'' Mr. Chavez said during his weekly television program. Venezuela supplies about 1.25 million barrels of crude oil a day to the United States, ranking as the country's third-largest supplier of oil after Canada and Saudi Arabia, according to the Department of Energy in Washington. 
 Mr. Chavez explained that Venezuela would halt the oil exports if the United States attacked. Claims by Mr. Chavez that the Bush administration is preparing an invasion of Venezuela, with the objective of gaining control of its oil reserves, have been a staple of his political rhetoric for several years. 
 While seemingly a reversal, Mr. Chavez's latest comments reflect the devilish complexity of efforts to undo an oil relationship with the United States that goes back nearly a century. For instance, Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company, announced last week that it would suspend commercial relations with Exxon. 
 But the move seemed to be meant more for consumption within Mr. Chavez's political movement here, which faces growing discontent over corruption charges and food shortages. In fact, the decision applies only to day-to-day sales of oil to Exxon, not to established contracts. 
 And though Exxon is regularly described on state television here as an enemy of Venezuela, Exxon and Petroleos de Venezuela still jointly own a refinery outside New Orleans that was specifically built to handle Venezuelan oil, which is high in impurities like sulfur. 
 Few countries outside the United States have such refineries designed to process Venezuela's oil, making a redirection of the country's petroleum exports problematic. Despite a deterioration of political ties with Washington, oil exports to the United States remain Venezuela's largest single source of export revenue. 
 Exxon has adopted the most aggressive approach of any major international oil company in dealing with Venezuela, choosing to shut down much of its Venezuelan operations last year. Most other companies ceded control of projects to Mr. Chavez, becoming minority partners and paying higher taxes. 
 Signaling that his efforts to exert greater control over the oil industry are not over, Mr. Chavez also spoke Sunday of the possibility of raising taxes on foreign oil companies by enacting a windfall profits tax. International companies like Chevron, BP and StatoilHydro of Norway continue to operate in Venezuela.

HEADLINE: Rebukes Are Swift for the Chief of Deutsche Post

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
The German political elite has wasted no time in dissociating itself from Klaus Zumwinkel, the chief executive of Deutsche Post, who is suspected of using a foundation in Liechtenstein to evade taxes. 
 Mr. Zumwinkel, who turned the formerly state-owned Deutsche Post into the world's largest logistics concern, has been widely respected for turning debt-ridden and poorly run companies, like the giant mail-order retailer Quelle, into highly successful ones. 
 But Chancellor Angela Merkel, in particular, was quick to denounce Mr. Zumwinkel, 64, when it became clear last week that prosecutors had started a criminal investigation into allegations that he dodged the equivalent of $1.5 million in taxes. 
 ''This goes beyond anything I could have imagined,'' she said, adding that his resignation from the board of Deutsche Post ''was an unavoidable step considering what has happened.'' 
 Peer Steinbruck, the Social Democrat who is finance minister, said the investigation into Mr. Zumwinkel's tax affairs was damaging the already shaky state of public confidence. ''The moral damage is considerable,'' he told reporters. 
 Politicians of both parties also called this weekend for tougher sentences for tax fraud after the German media reported that, according to investigators, as many as 1,000 investors are also suspected of having foundations in Liechtenstein to escape taxes in Germany. 
 This tax scandal, one of the biggest ever to hit Germany, comes at a particularly fragile time when politicians have been accusing private company managers of being too well paid and lacking in social responsibility. The Social Democrats in particular, but also Ms. Merkel's conservatives, have tried to exploit this issue recently. 
 Mr. Zumwinkel's annual salary was 4 million euros ($5.9 million) last year, small when compared with the 13.2 million euros earned by the Deutsche Bank chairman, Josef Ackermann, or the 60 million euros paid to Wendelin Wiedeking, chief of Porsche. 
 But Mr. Zumwinkel also enjoys perks like a healthy pension plan and share options. It is too early to say whether those will be affected by his resignation. 
 He came in for criticism last December when he sold 200,000 shares, worth 2.24 million euros, just after Deutsche Post's share price jumped on an agreement by the company to introduce a minimum wage. 
 He later apologized for his actions. But Mr. Zumwinkel, who studied economics at the Wharton School in Philadelphia in the 1970s, set out his own ideas about a market economy in comments he made several years ago. 
 ''You cannot organize a market economy according to purely moral principles. It will go bankrupt,'' he said three years ago in an interview with Bild am Sonntag, a mass circulation newspaper. 
 ''The international market knows no morality.''

HEADLINE: Midlife Suicide Rises, Puzzling Researchers

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Shannon Neal can instantly tell you the best night of her life: Tuesday, Dec. 23, 2003, the Hinsdale Academy debutante ball. Her father, Steven Neal, a 54-year-old political columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, was in his tux, white gloves and tie. ''My dad walked me down and took a little bow,'' she said, and then the two of them goofed it up on the dance floor as they laughed and laughed. 
 A few weeks later, Mr. Neal parked his car in his garage, turned on the motor and waited until carbon monoxide filled the enclosed space and took his breath, and his life, away.
 Later, his wife, Susan, would recall that he had just finished a new book, his seventh, and that ''it took a lot out of him.'' His medication was also taking a toll, putting him in the hospital overnight with worries about his heart. 
 Still, those who knew him were blindsided. ''If I had just 30 seconds with him now,'' Ms. Neal said of her father, ''I would want all these answers.''
 Mr. Neal is part of an unusually large increase in suicides among middle-aged Americans in recent years. Just why thousands of men and women have crossed the line between enduring life's burdens and surrendering to them is a painful question for their loved ones. But for officials, it is a surprising and baffling public health mystery.
 A new five-year analysis of the nation's death rates recently released by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the suicide rate among 45-to-54-year-olds increased nearly 20 percent from 1999 to 2004, the latest year studied, far outpacing changes in nearly every other age group. (All figures are adjusted for population.) 
 For women 45 to 54, the rate leapt 31 percent. ''That is certainly a break from trends of the past,'' said Ann Haas, the research director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.
 By contrast, the suicide rate for 15-to-19-year-olds increased less than 2 percent during that five-year period -- and decreased among people 65 and older. 
 The question is why. What happened in 1999 that caused the suicide rate to suddenly rise primarily for those in midlife? For health experts, it is like discovering the wreckage of a plane crash without finding the black box that recorded flight data just before the aircraft went down.
 Experts say that the poignancy of a young death and higher suicide rates among the very old in the past have drawn the vast majority of news attention and prevention resources. For example, $82 million was devoted to youth suicide prevention programs in 2004, after the 21-year-old son of Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, killed himself. Suicide in middle age, by comparison, is often seen as coming at the end of a long downhill slide, a problem of alcoholics and addicts, society's losers.
 ''There's a social-bias issue here,'' said Dr. Eric C. Caine, co-director at the Center for the Study of Prevention of Suicide at the University of Rochester Medical Center, explaining why suicide in the middle years of life had not been extensively studied before.
 There is a ''national support system for those under 19, and those 65 and older,'' Dr. Caine added, but not for people in between, even though ''the bulk of the burden from suicide is in the middle years of life.'' 
 Of the more than 32,000 people who committed suicide in 2004, 14,607 were 40 to 64 years old (6,906 of those were 45 to 54); 5,198 were over 65; 2,434 were under 21 years old.
 Complicating any analysis is the nature of suicide itself. It cannot be diagnosed through a simple X-ray or blood test. Official statistics include the method of suicide -- a gun, for instance, or a drug overdose -- but they do not say whether the victim was an addict or a first-time drug user. And although an unusual event might cause the suicide rate to spike, like in Thailand after Asia's economic collapse in 1997, suicide much more frequently punctuates a long series of troubles -- mental illness, substance abuse, unemployment, failed romances.
 Without a ''psychological autopsy'' into someone's mental health, Dr. Caine said, ''we're kind of in the dark.'' 
 The lack of concrete research has given rise to all kinds of theories, including a sudden drop in the use of hormone-replacement therapy by menopausal women after health warnings in 2002, higher rates of depression among baby boomers or a simple statistical fluke. 
 At the moment, the prime suspect is the skyrocketing use -- and abuse -- of prescription drugs. During the same five-year period included in the study, there was a staggering increase in the total number of drug overdoses, both intentional and accidental, like the one that recently killed the 28-year-old actor Heath Ledger. Illicit drugs also increase risky behaviors, C.D.C. officials point out, noting that users' rates of suicide can be 15 to 25 times as great as the general population.
 Jeffrey Smith, a vigorous fisherman and hunter, began ordering prescription drugs like Ambien and Viagra over the Internet when he was in his late 40s and the prospect of growing older began to gnaw at him, said his daughter, Michelle Ray Smith, who appears on the television soap ''Guiding Light.'' Five days before his 50th birthday, he sat in his S.U.V. in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., letting carbon monoxide fill his car.
 Linda Cronin was 43 and working in a gym when she gulped down a lethal dose of prescription drugs in her Denver apartment in 2006, after battling eating disorders and depression for years. 
 Looking at the puzzling 28.8 percent rise in the suicide rate among women ages 50 to 54, Andrew C. Leon, a professor of biostatistics in psychiatry at Cornell, suggested that a drop in the use of hormone replacement therapy after 2002 might be implicated. It may be that without the therapy, more women fell into depression, Dr. Leon said, but he cautioned this was just speculation.
 Despite the sharp rise in suicide among middle-aged women, the total number who died is still relatively small: 834 in the 50-to-54-year-old category in 2004. Over all, four of five people who commit suicide are men. (For men 45 to 54, the five-year rate increase was 15.6 percent.)
 Veterans are another vulnerable group. Some surveys show they account for one in five suicides, said Dr. Ira Katz, who oversees mental health programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That is why the agency joined the national toll-free suicide hot line last August.
 In the last five years, Dr. Katz said, the agency has noticed that the highest suicide rates have been among middle-aged men and women. Those most affected are not returning from Iraq or Afghanistan, he said, but those who served in Vietnam or right after, when the draft ended and the all-volunteer force began. ''The current generation of older people seems to be at lesser risk for depression throughout their lifetimes'' than the middle-aged, he said.
 That observation seems to match what Myrna M. Weissman, the chief of the department in Clinical-Genetic Epidemiology at New York State Psychiatric Institute, concluded was a susceptibility to depression among the affluent and healthy baby boom generation two decades ago, in a 1989 study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. One possible reason she offered was the growing pressures of modern life, like the changing shape of families and more frequent moves away from friends and relatives that have frayed social support networks.
 More recently, reports of a study that spanned 80 countries found that around the world, middle-aged people were unhappier than those in any other age group, but that conclusion has been challenged by other research, which found that among Americans, middle age is the happiest time of life.
 Indeed, statistics can sometimes be as confusing as they are enlightening. Shifts in how deaths are tallied make it difficult to compare rates before and after 1999, C.D.C. officials said. Epidemiologists also emphasize that at least another five years of data on suicide are needed before any firm conclusions can be reached about a trend.
 The confusion over the evidence reflects the confusion and mystery at the heart of suicide itself.
 Ms. Cronin explained in a note that she had struggled with an inexplicable gloom that would leave her cowering tearfully in a closet as early as age 9. After attempting suicide before, she had checked into a residential treatment program not long before she died, but after a month, her insurance ran out. Her parents had offered to continue the payments, but her sister, Kelly Gifford, said Ms. Cronin did not want to burden them. 
 Ms. Gifford added, ''I think she just got sick of trying to get better.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Much of Europe Recognize Kosovo, Which Also Draws Expected Rejection

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH and C. J. CHIVERS; Nicholas Kulish reported from Berlin, and C. J. Chivers from Moscow. Reporting was contributed by Stephen Castle from Brussels, Graham Bowley from New York, Warren Hoge from the United Nations and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Kosovo won the recognition of the United States and its biggest Western European allies on Monday, while earning rebukes and rejections from Serbia, Russia and a disparate mix of states the world over who face their own separatist movements at home.
 One day after the tiny Balkan province declared its independence, the world had its chance to choose sides. While some countries had made their decisions months in advance, that did not diminish the drama of whether a newly birthed nation would be welcomed into the fold or rejected.
 Major European powers, including France, Germany and Britain, along with the United States, officially recognized Kosovo, even as officials took pains to point out that it should not serve as an invitation or precedent for other groups hoping to declare independence. That is because one of the biggest unknowns remains whether Kosovo's declaration could rekindle conflicts elsewhere, including in ethnically divided Bosnia.
 As a result, the reverberations were felt from Russian-backed enclaves in Georgia to the Taiwan Strait. Spain, a member of the European Union and one of the countries with soldiers in the NATO force in Kosovo, refused its recognition. Yet Turkey, despite its history of conflict with Kurdish separatists, chose to support Kosovo's independence. 
 In a letter to Kosovo's president, Fatmir Sejdiu, President Bush wrote: ''On behalf of the American people, I hereby recognize Kosovo as an independent and sovereign state. I congratulate you and Kosovo's citizens for having taken this important step in your democratic and national development.''
 In an apparently conciliatory gesture, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in her own statement, ''The United States takes this opportunity to reaffirm our friendship with Serbia, an ally during two world wars.''
 But Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica of Serbia, which has regarded Kosovo as its heartland since medieval times, vowed that Serbia would never recognize the ''false state.'' Mr. Kostunica recalled Serbia's ambassador to Washington, news agencies reported. The State Department had no comment on those reports on Monday evening. 
 At the United Nations, Boris Tadic, Serbia's president, told the Security Council that the declaration of independence ''annuls international law, tramples upon justice and enthrones injustice.'' He asked that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon direct the United Nations mission chief in Kosovo to declare the action ''null and void'' and to dissolve the Kosovo Assembly, which adopted the declaration on Sunday.
 Addressing the Council before Mr. Tadic spoke, Mr. Ban said the United Nations administration, approved by the Council in 1999, would continue to run Kosovo until a formal transition could be arranged.
 European foreign ministers meeting in Brussels appeared to reach a minimal common position, acknowledging that Kosovo had declared independence and allowing those nations that wanted to recognize it formally to do so.
 Bernard Kouchner, France's foreign minister, said the declaration was ''a victory for common sense,'' and pointed to what he hoped would be future reconciliation between Serbia and Kosovo. ''I don't know at what date, in which year, but Kosovo and Serbia will be together in the European Union,'' he said.
 However, the foreign minister of Spain, Miguel Angel Moratinos, told reporters that the declaration did not respect international law and that Spain would not recognize Kosovo. ''The government of Spain will not recognize the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by the Assembly of Kosovo,'' Reuters quoted him as saying.
 Among European Union members, Cyprus, Romania and Slovakia have also been reluctant to recognize Kosovo.
 Diplomatic recognition is more than just a popularity contest for Kosovo, a desperately poor, predominantly Muslim landlocked territory of two million people. It needs the help and support of international institutions if it expects to improve its dire economic condition. A United Nations protectorate since 1999, it is policed by 16,000 NATO troops and has an unemployment rate of around 60 percent and an average monthly wage of $250.
 ''We will be working with the government to try to help it politically as well as economically,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, in a conference call with reporters on Monday, pointing out that the United States gave $77 million in aid to Kosovo in 2007 and would raise that amount to roughly $335 million in 2008.
 Mr. Burns, who said he had consulted by phone with European counterparts after the meeting of European Union foreign ministers, said there would be a donor conference in Europe in the coming months to encourage additional aid, and hoped there could be debt relief for Kosovo as well as strong regional trade opportunities.
 Russia, which opposes Kosovo's independence, demanded an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Sunday to proclaim the declaration ''null and void,'' but the meeting produced no resolution. The Security Council agreed to a request by Russia and Serbia to hold the open meeting on Monday that Mr. Tadic addressed.
 Mr. Burns said he did not foresee trouble with Russia. ''I do not expect any kind of crisis with Russia over this,'' he said. ''I expect Russia to be supportive of stability in this region.''
 But in Moscow, the upper and lower houses of Parliament released a joint statement signaling an intention to recognize at least two Russian-backed separatist areas in the former Soviet Union -- Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both in Georgia.
 Abkhazia and South Ossetia have announced their intention to seek recognition as independent states. Russia has already granted citizenship to most residents of both enclaves and had hinted that it might recognize their independence if Western countries recognized Kosovo.
 ''The right of nations to self-determination cannot justify recognition of Kosovo's independence along with the simultaneous refusal to discuss similar acts by other self-proclaimed states, which have obtained de facto independence exclusively by themselves,'' the Russian Parliament's statement read.
 Georgia disputes the claim that the regions have obtained independence by themselves. The areas broke from Georgia after brief wars in the 1990s, and have survived with Russian support.
 Eduard Kokoity, the Ossetian president, said Monday that the two breakaway regions would submit a request for recognition to the Russian Parliament by the end of the month, the Interfax news agency reported.
 But experts and officials said they did not expect simmering conflicts to break out into significant violence as a result of Kosovo's declaration. ''These are emotional reactions that I think are transitory and can be contained,'' said Peter Semneby, the European Union's special representative for the South Caucasus, in a telephone interview from Georgia. ''It's very much in the interest of major actors to try to contain them.''
 On the other side of the world, China, Indonesia and Sri Lanka also criticized Kosovo's declaration of independence, while Taiwan and Australia welcomed it, as Kosovo's move appeared to be a litmus test of attitudes in Asia toward secession.
 The Beijing government, which has threatened military action if Taiwan declares formal independence, voiced ''grave concern'' over Kosovo's action.
 ''China is deeply worried about its severe and negative impact on peace and stability of the Balkan region and the goal of establishing a multiethnic society in Kosovo,'' said Liu Jianchao, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.

HEADLINE: In Southern California, a Cotton Industry Fades

BYLINE: By REBECCA CATHCART

DATELINE: BRAWLEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
When a cotton gin is running, it smells like hay, twigs and ''freshly washed sheets,'' said Wally Leimgruber, a former cotton farmer. But as is often the case, the gin at the Planters Ginning Company here was silent as Mr. Leimgruber walked the dusty floor one recent afternoon.
 Three piles of fleece-covered cotton seeds sat 20 feet high outside, right where they had fallen a month earlier, spit from pipes connected to the gin. 
 ''It's sad,'' said Mr. Leimgruber, 54, an Imperial County supervisor who as a child picked cotton beside his Swiss grandfather in nearby family fields. ''It's like a cemetery to me.'' 
 Planters is the last of seven gins that once served the Imperial Valley here in Southern California. But it will close this year as the number of farmers growing cotton continues to shrink. 
 Last year, the gin processed cotton from three farmers only who grew less than 300 acres, said Bobby Reed, a gin worker. In the late 1970s, 120,000 acres of cotton were grown in the Imperial Valley, about a quarter of its farm land.
 Pest infestations in recent decades caused a decline in cotton acreage, and the decline accelerated as fuel costs soared and urban centers like San Diego, about 90 miles to the west, pushed for a larger share of the state's stretched water supply. Cotton is a water intensive crop, and the fields here are irrigated by canals that draw from the Colorado River, the source of drinking water for much of Southern California.
 ''Once you begin to reduce acreage and gins close, you lose the infrastructure and it makes it harder to come back,'' said Mark Bagby, director of communications for Calcot, a cotton cooperative. 
 In the past five years, cotton acreage across California has shrunk by almost half, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Farmers are turning to alfalfa hay, corn and wheat, commodities that require less irrigation and have been dipped in gold by the competing demands for biofuel and cattle feed. 
 While the new crops make economic sense, it has been a reluctant transition for two generations of farmers who had cut their teeth on cotton.
 ''Cotton is ingrained in me,'' said Mike Cox, 54, whose family grew cotton in the Imperial Valley for more than five decades, ending with his last crop in 2004. ''It's the first crop that I really knew.'' 
 Mr. Cox learned from his father how to anticipate the whims of a crop that needs precisely timed doses of water and fertilizer. His skills were honed in the long season of planting, weeding, watching and waiting for the bolls -- the so-called fruit of the cotton plant -- to swell with lint.
 ''There's something about cotton,'' he said. ''It's a showy crop.'' 
 People on the road can look at farmers' cotton plants and assess their skill. Wheat or sugar beets, Mr. Cox said, show only subtle changes in color and height. But a cotton plant reveals its mood in the number and spacing of its branches and the placement of its flowers. 
 ''A cotton plant tells you out loud, 'Hey, I'm happy,' '' he said. '''I'm being cared for.' Or, 'I'm not doing too well.' It shows its emotions on its sleeve.'' 
 Dorothy Dahm, 76, remembers the beauty of the cotton flower. She and her husband, Eugene, 83, grew about 80 acres of cotton in the Imperial Valley every year from 1952 to 2005, when it got too expensive to continue.
 The Dahms could stand on the green carpet in their living room here and, looking out the window, see acres of cotton flowers in a field turn from purple to yellow to white over the course of a season. 
 ''We used to take the flowers,'' Mrs. Dahm said, ''spray them and put them into arrangements inside if we had parties.''
 The Dahms, like most California farmers, grew cotton varieties like Acala and Pima. Both varieties do well in the climate here and are prized for their long, fine grain and high tensile strength. Growers sold their lint to high-end buyers, usually in Japan and other Asian countries, for use in luxury towels, expensive sheets and polo shirts. But the growth of textile mills in countries like China and India and improvements in mill technology mean buyers now look to lower quality -- and less expensive -- lint and rely on mills to make up the difference.
 At his home, Mr. Cox pointed to a photograph of himself standing shoulder deep in thin, dark branches brimming with cotton. The white puffs swallow his blue jacket like a fog. He is smiling and holding a branch heavy with lint bolls. ''I miss it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Lending Tightens, Education Could Suffer

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Major commercial education companies are scrambling to ensure a steady stream of college-level students despite the credit squeeze, with some preparing to offer student loans themselves.
 The move shows how dependent this sector of education is on student loans and how vulnerable the industry could become if credit woes continue to make it harder for lenders to raise capital. 
 Commercial colleges largely offer practical education in fields like business, computers, health care and culinary arts, often catering to low-income students and students already in the work place. 
 Seeking to reassure investors, Corinthian Colleges Inc., one of the nation's largest chains, recently said it was exploring ''alternatives to help students fund their educational programs,'' including expanding its own lending program and finding new lenders. 
 The Career Education Corporation, another large chain, has announced a similar effort. 
 ITT Educational Services Inc. recently announced a deal with three major banks to preserve students loans through the rest of the year.
 And Universal Technical Institute Inc., which offers programs in fields like automotive, diesel and motorcycle repair, said it could lose tuition revenue if students default on subprime loans from an outside lender. About 3 percent of the company's revenue now comes from such loans.
 The credit concerns come on top of other changes disrupting the student loan industry. 
 Congress has moved to reduce subsidy payments to student lenders making federally guaranteed loans. Investors have shown little interest in buying securities backed by student loans, leading a Michigan state agency to suspend a private loan program for students.
 And loan companies -- most particularly Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender -- are tightening standards for private loans for students who have poor credit or attend institutions with low graduation rates. Private loans are not guaranteed by the federal government and can carry rates as high as credit cards. 
 ''It's akin to death by a thousand cuts,'' said Gary Santo, a managing director at Fitch Ratings in New York who follows the student loan business. 
 So far, problems have yet to be felt by most students. But some in the lending industry have begun to warn that there may be fewer borrowing options, even for traditional students, in the fall, at least for private loans, which students turn to when they have exhausted federal borrowing and grant aid. 
 Members of Congress in letters to the Bush administration Friday also raised concerns.
 ''A crisis is looming in which students and families may not have access to student loans,'' said Ben Kiser, a spokesman for Nelnet, a large lender based in Lincoln, Neb. 
 Financial aid administrators at some nonprofit colleges countered that they see no imminent crisis and said not only that many companies offer federally backed loans but that the federal government is a lender itself, through its direct loan program. 
 They said lenders, which fought hard against changes in the student loan program, have been too quick to say cuts in subsidies will reduce availability of loans.
 ''They cried wolf a lot,'' said Eileen K. O'Leary, assistant vice president for finance at Stonehill College in Easton, Mass., and a past chairwoman of the National Direct Student Loan Coalition, an alliance of colleges that participate in the direct loan program that was intended to make borrowing less costly by having the government provide loans directly to students. 
 ''Will there be wholesale students not going to school?'' she asked, ''No, because federal money is still there.''
 In some ways this should be a boom time for commercial colleges, with rising unemployment sending people back to school and falling interest rates translating, in theory, into cheaper student loans. But lenders, fearful of bad credit, are not cutting rates and have said they may not lend at all to students seen as high risks. 
 That makes commercial career colleges particularly vulnerable because they often draw low-income students with spotty education histories and they often charge considerably more than public two-year colleges. 
 ''The for-profits typically have higher priced programs,'' acknowledged Kimberly J. McWaters, president and chief executive of Universal Technical Institute.
 The limits on federal borrowing mean students often must turn to private loans.
 ''We've got to be innovative and work together with students to give them access to cheaper money,'' Ms. McWaters said. ''Most of us have balance sheets that allow us to do so.''
 Still, lending to students is a risk for commercial institutions because such a step exposes them to losses from defaults. While executives at the companies say they have the assets to back or make loans, they also acknowledge the risk. 
 In a regulatory filing last month, Corinthian warned investors that ''increasing the amount our new students pay in cash and instituting stricter underwriting guidelines may slow our rate of enrollment growth. In addition, expanding our own lending program and guaranteeing third-party lenders against default may increase bad debt from current levels and decrease liquidity.''
 Investors are showing concerns about the sector. Since November shares of Career Education have fallen by about 50 percent, to close at $17.33 on Friday, when the company also announced that it was closing two colleges and seven campuses of its Gibbs division, including the Katharine Gibbs School in New York, after failing to find a buyer for those operations.
 Shares of Corinthian, which traded for more than $17 in December, closed Friday at $7.72. Shares of ITT Educational closed at $70.85 Friday, but were more than $130 in November. Universal Technical Institute shares have fallen by about a third since November, closing Friday at $15.31. 
 Many commercial educational programs are privately held and have not disclosed the impact that tightened credit markets may have on their business or what steps they are taking to make sure that students continue to enroll.
 ''The publicly traded schools are actually the best of the bunch,'' said Trace A. Urdan, senior research analyst at Signal Hill Capital Group, which does not own shares in companies covered by its research.
 Not everyone believes that retrenchment in commercial education would be bad. ''High-risk borrowers with low academic achievement who are pursuing post-secondary training should not go to expensive, low-quality proprietary schools,'' said Michael Dannenberg, director for education policy at the New America Foundation in Washington. ''They would be better off going to community colleges, which are lower cost and open enrollment, for the most part.'' 
 Not all commercial institutions are equally at risk. Some charge tuition low enough that it can be covered just by federal loans and so will be better able to ride out a credit crunch. Capella University, for example, got less than 1 percent of its revenue from private loans in 2007; the University of Phoenix, one of the biggest players in the industry, gets just 4 percent.
 ''We are not really seeing any impact on our business,'' said Stephen G. Shank, chief executive of Capella.

HEADLINE: Opponents Organize Against State's Plan to Scrap Javits Center Expansion

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Spitzer administration's decision to scrap a long-promised expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and sell some of its property to plug gaps in the state budget has prompted opposition from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other city officials, state legislators, trade show producers and tourism executives.
 It has also revealed deep fault lines within the coalition that in 2006 hailed a since-defunct $1.8 billion proposed expansion as critical to the city's tourism industry and the creation of 20,000 jobs and tens of millions of dollars a year in economic benefits for New York. 
 In January, the Spitzer administration announced that it would renovate the convention center on 11th Avenue between 34th and 38th Streets and add only a sliver of new exhibit and meeting space. State officials also said they would sell the block between 39th and 40th Streets, eliminating any possibility of future expansion. 
 Trade show producers, who argue that the state's $1.6 billion proposal would cripple the industry, have been lobbying for an alternative that would create additional space for the Auto Show and other public exhibitions. Some city officials also suggest that more meeting space and a conference center would be appropriate. 
 United States Senator Charles E. Schumer and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, favor a much bigger and better Javits, but state officials contend that it would cost too much. The Hotel Association of New York, once an ardent advocate of expansion, is officially neutral. 
 Nearly all of those views will be contending at the March 5 board meeting of the Javits Development Corporation. The board, whose members are appointed by the state and the city, has not met for more than four months and has never discussed the latest plan.
 A debate over the wisdom of making heavy public investments in convention centers also weaves through the dispute. Although convention centers often lose money, proponents argue that the spending of tens of thousands of visitors on hotels, restaurants, bars, museums and Broadway shows more than makes up the difference.
 Some economists contend that cities across the country that have built new centers or expanded existing ones during a decade-long boom have created a national glut of exhibit and meeting space.
 ''The reality is that the convention and trade show market is a buyer's market,'' said Heywood Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas at San Antonio and the author of a 2005 Brookings Institution report on the convention industry. ''Cities that have expanded like Atlanta and Orlando quite often find that they've gotten no new business in the wake of those expansions.''
 New York may be a more attractive destination than Orlando, Cleveland or Sacramento, but, critics say, it will never compete with convention cities where hotel rooms are cheaper and more plentiful. Land is too expensive in New York to justify the costs of a big horizontal conventional hall.
 The Spitzer administration, which had said that it wanted to build a ''thoroughbred'' of a convention center, did not dismiss the economic benefits of the Javits Center, but said that a cost-benefit analysis does not justify a large investment. The state rejected the 2006 expansion plan, which they said would have cost $3 billion, not the $1.8 billion originally estimated, as well as a larger $5 billion proposal.
 ''Javits is an important economic engine for the city and the state,'' said Patrick J. Foye, co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and the state's top official overseeing the Javits Center. ''But frankly, it's less important here than in other cities.''
 Even without the expansion, hotels in Manhattan have enjoyed record occupancy rates in each of the past three years. Manhattan hotels were effectively sold out on 250 nights in 2007, said John Fox, a principal at PKF Consulting, a hotel advisory group. And the average room rate hit $303.99, compared with $133.07 in Chicago and $106.72 in Orlando.
 ''We're never going to be a true convention city like Las Vegas and Chicago,'' said Michael J. Stengel, the general manager for New York City's Marriott hotels.
 The hotel industry has also resisted an increase in the hotel tax to finance the expansion beyond the current $1.50 a night per room.
 But Jonathan M. Tisch, chief executive of Loews Hotels and, until last week, chairman of the city's convention and visitors bureau, disagreed with those who play down the role of trade shows in the city's economy.
 ''That may be a fool's argument,'' he said. ''We don't know what's going to happen down the road. There may be a recession. We need to ensure that demand continues way into the future.'' 
 Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, which sponsors the Javits Center's largest public exhibit, the Auto Show, described the center as the most successful convention hall in the country. ''The New York Auto Show alone brings in almost $200 million in economic benefits during its two-week run,'' he said. 
 Mr. Schienberg and Mr. Tisch oppose the state's plan to sell the Javits Center's northern block, between 39th and 40th Streets, as shortsighted. Mayor Bloomberg has also come out against the sale, as has Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester.
 The state is proposing to sell two parcels owned by the Javits Center, a block between 33rd and 34th Streets, which is used today for trucks and trailers, and the northern parcel, for as much as $900 million.
 A coalition of trade show producers and movers known as Friends of Javits has taken its case to state legislators, arguing that the current $1.6 billion design is poorly laid out and will almost certainly lead to a 30 percent increase in productions costs, forcing some shows to move to other cities.
 ''If the governor's plan goes through, the trade show business as we know it in New York will wither and shrink,'' said John O'Connell, chief operating office of Freeman, a general contractor that moves most of the shows in and out of Javits Center.
 Mr. O'Connell; Ken McAvoy, senior vice president of Reed Exhibitions; and Jeff Little, president of George Little Management, which produces trade shows, say that a larger exhibition hall would be an economic blessing. They have proposed a privately built hall on Javits land.
 Robert C. Lieber, the deputy mayor for economic development, said the city told state officials that they should develop a long-term plan for the trade show business before selling any land. He said that in the coming decades, new office towers will rise on the West Side, creating a need for conference and meeting space. The city and the state also could consider erecting an exhibit hall in Queens, although few experts believe it could be built for less than $3 billion.
 In the meantime, Assemblyman Brodsky said, the Spitzer administration needed legislative approval before it can sell the Javits Center block. State Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican, plans to hold a public hearing on the matter on Feb. 28. 
 ''The concerns that have been raised with respect to the Javits land sales are natural and understandable,'' Mr. Foye said. ''We are making a case to the Legislature, the mayor and Speaker Quinn that these are the appropriate things to do with these valuable pieces of land.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Banks Confront a String of Write-Downs

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Wall Street banks are bracing for another wave of multibillion-dollar losses as the crisis that began with subprime mortgages spreads through the credit markets.
 In recent weeks one part of the debt market after another has buckled. High-risk loans used to finance corporate buyouts have plummeted in value. Securities backed by commercial real estate mortgages and student loans have fallen sharply. Even auction-rate securities, arcane investments usually considered as safe as cash, have stumbled.
 The breadth and scale of the declines mean more pain for major banks, which have already written off more than $120 billion of losses stemming from bad mortgage-related investments. 
 The deepening losses might make banks even more reluctant to make the loans needed to prod the slowing American economy. They also could force some banks to raise more capital to bolster their weakened finances.
 The losses keep piling up. Leading brokerage firms are likely to write down the value of $200 billion of loans they have made to corporate clients by $10 billion to $14 billion during the first quarter of this year, Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer, wrote in a research report last week. 
 Those institutions and global banks could suffer an additional $20 billion in losses this year on commercial mortgage-backed securities and other debt instruments tied to commercial mortgages, according to Goldman Sachs, which predicts commercial property prices will decline by as much as 26 percent.
 Analysts at UBS go further, predicting the world's largest banks could ultimately take $123 billion to $203 billion of additional write-downs on subprime-related securities, structured investment vehicles, leveraged loans and commercial mortgage lending. The higher estimate assumes that the troubled bond insurance companies fail, a possibility that, for now, is relatively remote. 
 Such dire predictions underscore how the turmoil in the credit markets is hurting Wall Street even as the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates. Already, once-proud institutions like Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and UBS have gone hat in hand to Middle Eastern and Asian investors to raise capital. ''You don't have a recovery until you have the financial system stabilized,'' Ms. Whitney said. ''As the banks are trying to recover they will not lend. They are all about self-preservation at this time.'' 
 One of the latest areas to come under pressure is the leveraged loan market. In recent weeks the market for these corporate loans plummeted, driven by fear that banks have too many loans to manage. Prices have fallen as low as 88 cents on the dollar, levels not seen since 2002, when default rates were more than 8 percent. Loans to some companies, like Univision Communications and Claire's Stores, are trading in the high 70s, analysts say. 
 ''Price declines of this magnitude -- over 10 points -- were not supposed to happen in the leveraged loan market,'' Bank of America credit analysts wrote in a report on Feb. 11. 
 When banks make loans, they hold them until they can sell the debt to institutional investors like hedge funds and mutual funds. But lately the market for this debt has seized up and many banks have been unable to unload the loans. As the value of this debt declines, lenders must recognize as a loss the difference in the value at which they made loans and the prices of similar debt in the secondary, or resale, market. 
 ''This correction feels a lot deeper and wider and more prolonged than what we have seen historically,'' said one senior Wall Street executive who was not authorized to speak to the media. 
 Many analysts say the financial health of many companies has not deteriorated as much as loan prices suggest. 
 ''People don't know what's out there, they haven't sorted out what's good and what's bad, so they are throwing all credit assets out,'' said Meredith Coffey, director of analysis at the Reuters Loan Pricing Corporation. Median loan prices were lower than those in 2002 when defaults peaked, even though very few defaults have actually occurred. 
 There has also been a marked deterioration in the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, which are commercial mortgages packaged into bonds. 
 To some, the troubles plaguing commercial mortgage securities seem a logical extension of the turmoil in the residential real estate market. But some strategists argue that the commercial real estate market is not as vulnerable as the housing market. The pressure to package loans that was so evident in the residential market never materialized in the commercial market, these analysts say. 
 Also, commercial loans tend to be made at fixed, rather than adjustable, rates, and are not usually refinanced for long periods of time. 
 Nevertheless, the cost of insuring a basket of commercial mortgage-backed securities has soared. Last October, for example, it cost $39,000 to insure a $10 million basket of top rated 2007 commercial mortgages (super senior AAA, in Wall Street language) against default. 
 Today that price has increased to $214,000. For triple-B-rated commercial mortgage backed securities, those which are riskier, the cost of protection during the same time has soared from $672,000 to $1.5 million. 
 The deterioration of the CMBX, the benchmark index that tracks the cost of such credit protection, ''started off as a fundamental repricing and then it escalated into something much more than that,'' said Neil Barve, a research analyst at Lehman Brothers. ''We think there is some downside in a challenging macroeconomic environment, but not nearly what has been priced in.'' 
 Goldman Sachs seems to disagree, with analysts predicting commercial real estate loan losses to total $180 billion, with banks and brokers bearing $80 billion of that in total and about $20 billion this year. 
 Current index figures suggest that the banks will face significant pain. Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, calculated that Lehman Brothers has the highest exposure to commercial real estate-backed securities, with $39.5 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley, with $31.5 billion. (These numbers do not include hedges that the banks may have but do not disclose). 
 To be sure, a crisis on Wall Street also spells opportunities for patient bargain hunters. After all, markets that were trading at all-time highs have been reduced to rubble, suggesting that those willing to search for value will find it. 
 And last week, some hedge funds began to wade into the troubled loan market. But prices do not yet reflect any widespread rallies, and Wall Street still has to absorb losses reflected in these markets. 
 ''The fourth quarter was terrible, but you had strong investment banking revenues,'' Mr. Hintz said. ''Now you've had a bad December, a worse January and an even worse February.''

HEADLINE: As the Wheels of the Economy Turn

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Totally Spent,'' by Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, Feb. 13):
 One of Mr. Reich's prescriptions for economic recovery is using tax policy to redistribute income. But this relies on buoying the economy through a return to high levels of consumer spending.
 Yes, increase tax rates on the wealthy to pre-Bush days and return some of it to those in lower income brackets. But we should devote a substantial portion to investment in public goods -- like transportation (especially railroads), education, research and development of alternative energy sources, and other infrastructure improvements. 
 This would yield far more significant benefits to the poor, the middle class and the rich, in current and future generations, than would the production and consumption of more consumer trinkets.
 Alan Meisel Pittsburgh, Feb. 13, 2008
 The writer is a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
 To the Editor:
 Very few people would disagree with the idea that a tax credit in the low-income brackets, offset by tax increases at the top, would increase American buying power. But is putting cash into the hands of the American consumer really what we should be doing right now?
 The cheap consumer goods that pour out of factories in China and elsewhere foul the atmosphere at their point of origin and then clog our own landfills. Walk down any supermarket or big-box aisle and tell me why America needs 30 or more brands of shampoo. Our frenetic lifestyles and short attention spans have made us into aimless consumer addicts who are continually looking for the next big fix. 
 Even the poorest of us often have more stuff than we know what to do with, and nobody seems to be the happier for it. 
 This twisted version of the American dream requires that we just work harder to earn more money to buy more. 
 America has the clout to lead the rest of the world in stopping this meaningless cycle of manufacture, consumption and environmental degradation. If, as Mr. Reich suggests, the treadmill is slowing down, then instead of speeding it up again, let's all step off.
 Carol Haskill San Francisco, Feb. 13, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Someone finally gets it! We keep telling children that a college education will be the answer to their financial woes because then they can get a better-paying job. But the answer for our economy is that those who work full time be able to support themselves and have insurance.
 Who would wash dishes, sell shoes or work on farms if everyone had a college education? Not everyone should get a college education. But we all should have a decent-paying job and enough time left in the day to play with our children, help them with homework and spend an hour with our spouse.
 Competition has made our country great, but anything taken to the extreme can be dangerous. Competition is all about being No. 1. That attitude leads sports figures to taking steroids and businesses to squeeze workers as hard as they can. 
 Competition without humanity is even more dangerous than the socialism Republicans are so afraid of. We need to find a middle ground.
 Anne Krick Wheaton, Ill., Feb. 13, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Robert B. Reich may be correct in noting that we're ''sliding into recession, or worse,'' but his suggested fixes don't add up.
 Mr. Reich notes the importance of giving ''middle- and lower-income Americans more buying power.'' While that's helpful, Mr. Reich then decries ''trade protection'' because ''most routine jobs are being automated anyway.'' 
 In fact, manufacturing jobs pay extremely well and create other well-paying jobs through a multiplier effect. Furthermore, manufacturing jobs are not ''automated,'' and instead require the training to operate high-tech computerized machinery. 
 Manufacturing workers are paid well precisely because of these skills. What's needed is to create good-paying jobs, and one avenue is to strengthen American manufacturing. 
 We should enforce existing United States trade law to tackle the illegal, protectionist tactics of countries like China, which use currency manipulation in violation of world trade law to undercut honest American manufacturers.
 Scott Paul Director, Alliance, for American Manufacturing Washington, Feb. 13, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I agree that the earned-income tax credit should be increased to raise the incomes of the working class. The increase will do little, however, for those who cannot find work as the economy slows. It is important, therefore, to modify our welfare laws. 
 President Bill Clinton (and President Jimmy Carter before him) wanted to guarantee jobs to welfare recipients. Congress, unfortunately, passed only the conservative part of his legislation. Requiring work became law. Providing employment -- the compassionate part of his proposal -- did not. 
 Since reform, welfare rolls have declined by half, but the percentage of the poor has increased slightly. 
 The number of public jobs required to meet a guarantee would automatically expand during bad times and shrink during recoveries as private employment became more available. 
 Thus, the economy would become more stable as public employment offset changes in the number of private jobs.
 Arnold Packer Baltimore, Feb. 13, 2008
 The writer was assistant secretary of labor during the Carter administration.
 To the Editor:
 Robert B. Reich is right about the imminent economic faltering of the lower and middle classes, but he should also sympathize with the upper class, because pretty soon there will be nothing left to trickle up.
 Glenn Alan Cheney Hanover, Conn., Feb. 13, 2008

HEADLINE: China's Inflation Rose to 7.1% in January

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose 7.1 percent in China last month, the largest increase in more than a decade.
 The steep increase in prices, announced on Tuesday morning by the Chinese government's National Bureau of Statistics, is the latest warning sign that China has been transformed from a moderating influence on global prices to a source of inflationary pressure. 
 Yu Yongding, the influential director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and until 2006 a member of the monetary policy committee of China's central bank, said that high inflation in January meant that the Chinese government was likely to continue pursuing austerity policies. 
 To fight inflation, China is likely to allow its currency to ''appreciate continuously'' so as to hold down the cost of imports, despite signs that economic slowdowns in the United States and elsewhere may cool demand for Chinese exports, Mr. Yu said.
 ''Inflation is the No. 1 enemy for China,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It's affordable for us to sacrifice a little on the growth side to bring inflation under control.''
 Chinese exporters are trying to pass on their rising costs to overseas customers, which could contribute to inflation in the United States and Europe.
 ''Our company is faced with rising labor costs and raw material costs,'' said Michelle Yin, a sales manager for the Shanghai Yongqiu Compressor Company, which makes walk-in coolers and freezers and exports to the United States and Europe. ''Depending on the margin we get from individual customers, we have been able to pass on all or part of the cost increase. For new customers, we typically have to set prices more aggressively to get their business.''
 Food prices led the increase again in January, climbing 18.2 percent. Economists had expected a sharp increase, partly because last year's harvest was poor for many crops and partly because snowstorms began to hurt food production and distribution in late January.
 But inflationary pressures now seem to be accelerating and spreading more broadly across the Chinese economy. Consumer prices jumped 1.2 percent just from December to January. And nonfood prices were up 1.5 percent from a year earlier in January.
 The consumer price inflation figures released on Tuesday morning came after a separate release of statistics on Monday showing that Chinese producer prices, measured when goods leave a factory, rose 6.1 percent in January from a year earlier. Chinese economists attributed the increase mainly to higher prices for fuel and other raw materials.
 But price increases are also spreading to services, where prices were up 2.6 percent, a sign that labor costs are also starting to climb.
 Yu Song and Hong Liang, two Goldman Sachs economists, warned in a research note that most of the effects of the Chinese snowstorms in late January and early February did not show up in the January data. They said that inflation in February was ''likely to be much higher than 7 percent, and might even get close to double-digit levels.''
 The two Goldman Sachs economists and Stephen Green, the chief China economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said that the Chinese government would continue to pursue austerity policies aimed at controlling inflation. 
 Mr. Green predicted that Chinese authorities would raise interest rates four times in the second and third quarters of this year and said that another increase was ''imminent'' in the proportion of assets that banks are required to hold as reserves, which limits lending.
 Consumer price inflation in January was the highest since September 1996, when Chinese inflation was still declining after running at well over 20 percent in the mid-1990s.
 Food prices increased sharply despite the government's imposition of complex price controls on Jan. 15 on many foods, including pork, eggs, flour and cooking oil. 
 The government still has in place a separate ban, imposed on Sept. 19, on price increases in a long list of government-regulated industries, from airlines to electric utilities.
 Some economists have suggested that prices may be rising even faster in China than government statistics indicate, because industries subject to price controls may be concealing the true extent of their price increases. The government also faces the dilemma that leaving price controls in place could erode incentives for farmers and others to produce more goods, while lifting price controls could result in even higher inflation.

HEADLINE: Shares in Europe Advance Amid Talk of Bank Investments

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
European stocks rose on Monday on speculation about a new investment in the banking sector. Asian markets were mixed, and United States markets were closed for Washington's Birthday. 
 Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 rose 2.75 percent, to 5,946.6, while the DAX index in Germany gained 1.98 percent, to 6,967.55. In France, the CAC 40 advanced 1.89 percent, to 4,861.80.
 ''It seems to be a combination of factors,'' said Keith Bowman, a broker at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. ''There was press speculation over the weekend that banks reporting this week may raise their dividends, and possibly sovereign investment funds will increase their investments.''
 In an interview with Bloomberg News on Sunday, the prime minister of Qatar said it was buying shares in the Credit Suisse Group and planned to spend as much as $15 billion on European and American bank stocks over the next year. 
 In Asia, Japanese stocks inched higher and Hong Kong shares sank amid concerns about further tightening measures in mainland China.
 Australian shares also fell, led by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group after the lender said it expected earnings this fiscal year to be crimped by fallout from the global credit squeeze.
 But Chinese stocks jumped after its securities regulator granted approval to two new equity funds and the wealth management operations of nine mutual funds.
 In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 12.84 points, or 0.09 percent, to 13,635.40, as traders bought steel issues in the hope that rising demand in emerging markets would offset higher prices. Nippon Steel rose 3.2 percent and JFE Holdings added 6.3 percent.
 Toshiba jumped 5.7 percent on reports that it would withdraw from its struggling HD DVD business. Investors cheered the likely decision as easing the potential for losses. Rival Sony, which supports Blu-ray disc technology, rose 1 percent.
 Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng index dropped 1.61 percent, to 23,759.25 points. It had gained 6.8 percent over the previous four sessions.
 Analysts said traders were cautious because of continued concerns about the American economy. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.23 percent on Friday.
 ''Most investors are taking a wait-and-see stance, given the sluggish trading volume,'' said Castor Pang, a strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial.
 The market expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again at its next meeting in March. Hong Kong banks tend to follow United States rate cuts because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the American one.
 Investors were turning their focus to China, which was expected to release January consumer price data on Tuesday. Analysts expect that prices have risen 7 percent, which would be an 11-year high. They are worried that signs of surging inflation will cause another round of tightening measures by Beijing.
 But on the Chinese mainland, investors were enthusiastic over a report on Monday from the state-run China Securities Journal that nine domestic mutual fund companies had received regulatory approvals to begin wealth management operations.
 The benchmark Shanghai composite index gained 1.58 percent, to 4,568.15.

HEADLINE: Defender in the Case of a Slain 7-Year-Old Girl Has His Admirers: Other Lawyers

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN; Annie Correal contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Returning to his law office the other day after yet another Sisyphean court session, Jeffrey T. Schwartz found a letter that, impressively, contained neither threats nor insults.
 ''It takes tremendous courage to provide truly zealous representation on behalf of a client who has been demonized, vilified and convicted in the press and the public's mind before he has even been indicted,'' read the letter, from Edward Donlon, also a defense lawyer. For every anonymous attacker, Mr. Donlon wrote, ''there are 10 of us who are covering your back and are inspired by the job you are doing.''
 Inspiring might not be how many people would describe Mr. Schwartz's advocacy for the man accused of killing 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown, which has, so far, included calling Nixzmary a ''little Houdini''; speaking up for the nutritional value of cat food; joking about his own prodigious consumption of yogurt, the snack that the emaciated girl was said to have stolen from the refrigerator shortly before she died; and asking for a mistrial about once a week. 
 Whatever it takes to acquit Nixzmary's stepfather, Cesar Rodriguez, of one of the more notorious child murders in the city's recent history, Mr. Schwartz says he is morally and professionally obligated to try it, if it is legal. In Mr. Schwartz's ethical universe, the decision to represent Mr. Rodriguez has the air of a sacred mission.
 ''I did this because it was the right thing to do,'' he said as he sat in a spacious red-curtained office on Lower Broadway filled with the expected framed newspaper clippings, plus an assortment of antique weapons: guns, knives, Balinese bows, hand grenades. 
 ''Throughout the course of my career, I thought that I would never take this type of case -- child abuse or child murder. But I started questioning that about myself. You can't call yourself a true criminal defense lawyer if you start handpicking the types of cases that you take.''
 The state panel that assigns counsel for indigent defendants reached out to many lawyers when Mr. Rodriguez was arrested in January 2006. Mr. Schwartz, the panel said, was the first to raise his hand. (He is making $75 an hour on this case, about one-tenth his fee for private clients.)
 Mr. Schwartz, 45, a tall, boyish Brooklyn native who makes no bones about his love of the limelight, became a defense lawyer in 1993 after graduating from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University and paying his dues in the homicide bureau of the Queens district attorney's office. 
 He has done a few trials that were covered in the press, and in 2006, he was one of the half-dozen lawyers vying to represent Darryl Littlejohn, the bouncer accused of murdering a college student named Imette St. Guillen. 
 But the Cesar Rodriguez trial, now grinding into its sixth week in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, seems like the challenge of a lifetime.
 Mr. Rodriguez -- who has taken responsibility for tying Nixzmary to a chair with duct tape and twine and bungee cord, pounding her with his hands, throwing her to the ground and covering her tiny body with dozens of bruises -- is not just charged with delivering the blow that killed Nixzmary. He is also charged with helping Nixzmary's mother, Nixzaliz Santiago, kill the girl (Ms. Santiago will be tried later). So Mr. Schwartz must plant in the jury's mind a reasonable doubt that Mr. Rodriguez even intentionally contributed to the circumstances that caused Nixzmary's death.
 It looks like a job for some sort of legal Superman, and to show that he fits the bill, Mr. Schwartz proudly displays on his office wall a blue-and-red T-shirt with a big S on it, a gift from a grateful client. Beneath the S appear the words ''Super'' and ''man,'' the latter preceded by a synonym for cattle dung. 
 So what does a Superman of sorts do? He works: Mr. Schwartz, who is divorced and has an 18-year-old daughter, claims to rise in his Manhattan apartment each morning before 3 a.m. and work straight through till night. 
 He leaves no stone unturned in the search for helpful witnesses. A retired medical examiner has been attending the Rodriguez trial. Mr. Schwartz struck up a conversation with him in the men's room. Now, Mr. Schwartz says, the doctor will testify about inconsistencies in the prosecution's medical evidence.
 And he neither pulls punches nor apologizes. The Houdini remark, a reference to Nixzmary's ability to slip the bonds that held her to the chair, was, Mr. Schwartz said, intended as a homage -- Houdini ''was a hero and was a celebrity for his ability to escape'' -- and to give the jury some sense of the challenges facing Mr. Rodriguez, an unemployed security guard, as he tried to maintain order in a chaotic household.
 Mr. Schwartz's withering cross-examination of the family's upstairs neighbor, a mild woman whom prosecutors say Nixzmary's family went to for help after the girl had already been dead for hours, was necessary, he said, because ''she started straying from testimony she'd given five times before in an attempt to make my client look worse.''
 As for Mr. Rodriguez himself, Mr. Schwartz called him ''one of the best clients I ever had.'' He has been, Mr. Schwartz said, ''a total gentleman. He apologized to me when he found out I was getting nasty phone calls.'' 
 Mr. Schwartz has also spent many hours sparring with his counterpart, the lead prosecutor, Ama Dwimoh. 
 Two weeks ago, when prosecutors trotted out a pink Tinkerbell backpack, found in the family's apartment, that had not been on the list of their planned exhibits, Mr. Schwartz complained to the judge, L. Priscilla Hall, that he was being sandbagged. 
 Ms. Dwimoh, as if on cue, picked up a folder from her table. ''If he wants to talk about sandbag, the papers that I have here,'' she said, are ''just pornography that was found all through the apartment.''
 ''Judge,'' Mr. Schwartz shot back, ''when I last checked, pornography is not a crime. Maybe the D.A. has some in her apartment.''
 His attempt to clear the courtroom air of prosecutorial sanctimony earned him a quick wrist-slap from Justice Hall. ''Counsel,'' she thundered, ''you are out of order.''
 Ms. Dwimoh declined when asked to comment on how she found Mr. Schwartz as an adversary. Last week, the prosecution rested and Mr. Schwartz began presenting his case. In the days to come, he promises a strong cast of mostly hostile witnesses -- police officers, child welfare officials and the like -- who he says will paint a pattern of sloppy investigative work. 
 ''We want to present a full and fair and accurate picture to the jury,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''That's all we're trying to do.''
 Off-color T-shirts aside, ''I truly believe in truth, justice and the American way,'' Mr. Schwartz said.

HEADLINE: The Global Tobacco Threat

 BODY:
Three years ago, an international treaty took effect that was designed to help developing countries resist aggressive marketing by big tobacco companies. The idea was that if a large number of countries committed themselves to the same tobacco control policies -- including bans on all advertising and promotion -- they would be better able to resist pressure from multinational tobacco companies and their own domestic tobacco sellers. 
 Unfortunately, the governments of low- and middle-income countries have not followed through. With tobacco use declining in wealthier countries, tobacco companies are spending tens of billions of dollars a year on advertising, marketing and sponsorship, much of it to increase sales in these developing countries.
 A new report issued by the World Health Organization, with financial help from Mayor Michael Bloomberg's foundation, offers the first comprehensive analysis of tobacco use and control efforts in 179 countries. It notes that tobacco will kill more people this year than tuberculosis, AIDS and malaria combined. It warns that unless governments do more to slow the epidemic, tobacco could kill a billion people by the end of the century, the vast majority in poor and middle-income countries. 
 There is no great mystery about what needs to be done. The W.H.O. recommends several proven strategies: very high taxes on tobacco products; a total ban on all advertising and promotion; a ban on smoking in all public places and workplaces; large, scary warning pictures on packs; and strong programs to help people quit. 
 Yet few countries are doing any of these things with notable vigor. Not a single country fully implements all of the measures, and not one of the recommended steps covers more than about five percent of the global population. The tobacco companies' vigor to sell is unflagging.
 As part of a strategy to ramp up its sales in the developing world, Philip Morris International is being spun off from the Altria Group so that it can escape the threat of litigation and government regulation in the United States. The international company is also planning a slew of new products aimed at particular countries, including sweet-smelling cigarettes that have more tar and nicotine. 
 It is hard -- no, impossible -- to believe claims by many companies that they are not trying to addict new smokers but are only trying to convert adults who are using inferior local brands. The W.H.O. survey contends that the industry is targeting teenagers and women in developing countries.
 One problem is that many low- and middle-income countries have become addicted to revenues from tobacco taxes, which may lessen their zeal to curb tobacco sales. Such governments need to realize that unless they move now to curb the epidemic, tobacco will cause horrendous health and economic damage.
 The Bush administration, which reluctantly signed the international treaty, has not submitted it to the Senate for ratification. That means that the United States officials will not have a seat at negotiations, begun last week, over a supplementary treaty to combat smuggling, counterfeiting and other illicit trade in tobacco products -- a source of funds for criminal gangs and terrorist groups that could threaten this country's security. The White House needs to stop dithering and present the treaty for ratification.

HEADLINE: Scientists Would Turn Greenhouse Gas Into Gasoline

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
If two scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory are correct, people will still be driving gasoline-powered cars 50 years from now, churning out heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere -- and yet that carbon dioxide will not contribute to global warming.
 The scientists, F. Jeffrey Martin and William L. Kubic Jr., are proposing a concept, which they have patriotically named Green Freedom, for removing carbon dioxide from the air and turning it back into gasoline. 
 The idea is simple. Air would be blown over a liquid solution of potassium carbonate, which would absorb the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide would then be extracted and subjected to chemical reactions that would turn it into fuel: methanol, gasoline or jet fuel.
 This process could transform carbon dioxide from an unwanted, climate-changing pollutant into a vast resource for renewable fuels. The closed cycle -- equal amounts of carbon dioxide emitted and removed -- would mean that cars, trucks and airplanes using the synthetic fuels would no longer be contributing to global warming.
 Although they have not yet built a synthetic fuel factory, or even a small prototype, the scientists say it is all based on existing technology.
 ''Everything in the concept has been built, is operating or has a close cousin that is operating,'' Dr. Martin said.
 The Los Alamos proposal does not violate any laws of physics, and other scientists, like George A. Olah, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist at the University of Southern California, and Klaus Lackner, a professor of geophysics at Columbia University, have independently suggested similar ideas. Dr. Martin said he and Dr. Kubic had worked out their concept in more detail than previous proposals.
 There is, however, a major caveat that explains why no one has built a carbon-dioxide-to-gasoline factory: it requires a great deal of energy. 
 To deal with that problem, the Los Alamos scientists say they have developed a number of innovations, including a new electrochemical process for detaching the carbon dioxide after it has been absorbed into the potassium carbonate solution. The process has been tested in Dr. Kubic's garage, in a simple apparatus that looks like mutant Tupperware. 
 Even with those improvements, providing the energy to produce gasoline on a commercial scale -- say, 750,000 gallons a day -- would require a dedicated power plant, preferably a nuclear one, the scientists say. 
 According to their analysis, their concept, which would cost about $5 billion to build, could produce gasoline at an operating cost of $1.40 a gallon and would turn economically viable when the price at the pump hits $4.60 a gallon, taking into account construction costs and other expenses in getting the gas to the consumer. With some additional technological advances, the break-even price would drop to $3.40 a gallon, they said. 
 A nuclear reactor is not required technologically. The same chemical processes could also be powered by solar panels, for instance, but the economics become far less favorable.
 Dr. Martin and Dr. Kubic will present their Green Freedom concept on Wednesday at the Alternative Energy Now conference in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. They plan a simple demonstration within a year and a larger prototype within a couple of years after that.
 A commercial nuclear-powered gasoline factory would have to jump some high hurdles before it could be built, and thousands of them would be needed to fully replace petroleum, but this part of the global warming problem has no easy solutions.
 In the efforts to reduce humanity's emissions of carbon dioxide, now nearing 30 billion metric tons a year, most of the attention so far has focused on large stationary sources, like power plants where, conceptually at least, one could imagine a shift from fuels that emit carbon dioxide -- coal and natural gas -- to those that do not -- nuclear, solar and wind. Another strategy, known as carbon capture and storage, would continue the use of fossil fuels but trap the carbon dioxide and then pipe it underground where it would not affect the climate.
 But to stabilize carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would require drastic cuts in emissions, and similar solutions do not exist for small, mobile sources of carbon dioxide. Nuclear and solar-powered cars do not seem plausible anytime soon. 
 Three solutions have been offered: hydrogen-powered fuel cells, electric cars and biofuels. Biofuels like ethanol are gasoline substitutes produced from plants like corn, sugar cane or switch grass, and the underlying idea is the same as Green Freedom. Plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, balancing out the carbon dioxide emitted when they are burned. But growing crops for fuel takes up wide swaths of land.
 Hydrogen-powered cars emit no carbon dioxide, but producing hydrogen, by splitting water or some other chemical reaction, requires copious energy, and if that energy comes from coal-fired power plants, then the problem has not been solved. Hydrogen is also harder to store and move than gasoline and would require an overhaul of the world's energy infrastructure. 
 Electric cars also push the carbon dioxide problem to the power plant. And electric cars have typically been limited to a range of tens of miles as opposed to the hundreds of miles that can be driven on a tank of gas.
 Gasoline, it turns out, is an almost ideal fuel (except that it produces 19.4 pounds of carbon dioxide per gallon). It is easily transported, and it generates more energy per volume than most alternatives. If it can be made out of carbon dioxide in the air, the Los Alamos concept may mean there is little reason to switch, after all. The concept can also be adapted for jet fuel; for jetliners, neither hydrogen nor batteries seem plausible alternatives.
 ''This is the only one that I have seen that addresses all of the concerns that are out there right now,'' Dr. Martin said. 
 Other scientists said the Los Alamos proposal perhaps looked promising but could not evaluate it fully because the details had not been published. 
 ''It's definitely worth pursuing,'' said Martin I. Hoffert, a professor of physics at New York University. ''It's not that new an idea. It has a couple of pieces to it that are interesting.''

HEADLINE: With Oil Prices Rising, Wood Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA; Sky Barsch contributed reporting from Orleans, Vt.

DATELINE: NEWPORT, Vt. 

 BODY:
As a child, Brian Cook remembers hurling wood into the big orange boiler his father bought during the oil crisis of the late 1970s, helping feed the fire that provided heat and hot water to his family. 
 Thirty years later, Mr. Cook dragged the boiler out of his childhood home and hooked it up in the house that he and his wife, Jennifer, own to cut their oil bills.
 ''I did not want to pay $3,000 to heat this house,'' Mr. Cook said in his garage here in Vermont's heavily wooded Northeast Kingdom. ''I see a lot more people burning wood this year.'' 
 After years of steep decline, wood heat is back, with people flocking to dealers to buy new wood stoves, wood boilers and stoves that burn pellets made of wood byproducts. Others like Mr. Cook, to the dismay of environmentalists, are dusting off old wood-burning devices that are less efficient and more polluting. 
 ''There's a lot of people buying big stoves, planning on tackling oil head-on,'' said Roy L'Esperance, owner of the Chimney Sweep in Shelburne, Vt., who has seen sales of wood stoves increase nearly 20 percent this year. ''They say, 'I just got a new house and I'm getting killed with oil bills, and propane is just as bad.' '' 
 Nowhere in the nation is wood as beloved as it is here in New England, where winter conjures images of warming up around a potbelly stove. But in the last decade or so, as the price of oil and propane seemed to rise less sharply, devotion to wood stoves waned. 
 In 1993, 3.1 million homes used wood for heat; the number dropped to 2 million in 2001, according to census data provided by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. 
 But now residents like Dina Benoit of Orleans, Vt., are going back. 
 When Ms. Benoit moved into her home in 1994, it had an old wood stove. Tired of hauling logs through the house and feeding it every few hours, Ms. Benoit switched to a propane heater in 1998. The propane, however, got too expensive, and Ms. Benoit returned to wood. ''I didn't want to become dependent on kerosene or an oil supplier,'' said Ms. Benoit, who bought a wood stove and said it cost $600 to heat her house last year. ''It's just so nice to stand next to; it has more of a personality than a regular heater.'' 
 The owners of M and M Forestry and Land Management of Brownington, Vt., say they have been delivering more firewood than ever this year.
 ''Generally, say they burn a cord of wood a year, this year they are already on their second cord,'' one of the owners, Michael Moore, said. ''Some people are planning on burning two or three times more wood than they have in the past.'' 
 Statistics from the last survey about the use of wood for heat, conducted in 2006, are not yet public, but the number of households that report using wood as their primary source of heat is expected to jump sharply, said Marie LaRiviere of the Energy Information Administration. 
 Chris Foster of Maupin's Stoves-n-Spas in The Dalles, Ore., said sales of wood and pellet stoves were up 65 percent in the last year. 
 ''Sales go up because of the economy,'' Mr. Foster said. ''If the economy is good, people go to gas. If the economy is sluggish, people go to wood and pellet stoves.'' 
 Jack Murphy of Winchendon, Mass., has long burned wood in his home, but he was tired of buying and splitting the wood, feeding the stove and cleaning the ash. He switched to a pellet stove last year.
 ''Wood heat is dirty, it's labor intensive, it messes up your yard and your floors when you carry it in the house,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''With pellets, I put them in my truck, and I bring my entire energy for the year home in one trip. I have two month's worth just on my back porch.'' 
 Air pollution is still a major concern, particularly with wood boilers. A 2006 report from the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a nonprofit association of Northeast air quality agencies, found that average particulate emissions from one outdoor wood boiler equaled that of 22 wood stoves, 205 oil furnaces or as many as 8,000 natural gas furnaces.
 The Environmental Protection Agency has set clean-burning performance standards for wood stoves manufactured after 1988, and many communities, including Truckee, Calif., and Dayton, Ohio, have programs that allow owners of older stoves to turn them in and receive rebates or coupons to buy a new wood stove. 
 Sally Markos of the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency in Springfield, Ore., said that air pollution from stoves had gone down since the 1988 regulations took effect, but that it was still a problem. On Jan. 24 the authority asked residents to refrain temporarily from burning wood because tests showed the particulate level to be extremely high. 
 ''The air pollution will get worse on days that people are feeling the economic pinch,'' Ms. Markos said. 
 The E.P.A. developed similar standards for outdoor wood boilers last year, but unlike the stove standards, they are not mandatory. 
 Many counties and towns, however, have banned or restricted the use of wood boilers. Last year Vermont became the first state to set emissions limits on new wood boilers. 
 Air pollution is not the only concern. New Hampshire's state fire marshal, J. William Degnan, said that heating systems were the top cause of fire in the state, and that many local departments were reporting an increase in fires from wood stoves. 
 ''They're seeing a rise in chimney fires,'' Mr. Degnan said. ''Many have fired up stoves they haven't used for years and haven't been maintained. There's creosote in the chimney, and some were improper installations, just a tinderbox waiting to happen.'' 
 Randy Swartz of Orleans, Vt., said he spent months researching safety and prices and would not go back to oil. He spent more than $6,000 last fall to buy a new wood boiler that heats his home and water. 
 Mr. Swartz, the maintenance manager at the Cabot Creamery, said he had to buy heating oil at work, and seeing the price of crude oil rise from $18 a barrel when he started his job a decade ago to almost $100 a barrel now made him want to change his personal energy consumption.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 7, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 19 about a surge in demand for wood stoves misidentified the stove company that employs Chris Foster, who commented on an increase in sales of wood and pellet stoves. He works for Fisher's Hearth and Home in Roseburg, Ore., not Maupin's Stoves-n-Spas in The Dalles, Ore. The owner of Maupin's pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Feb. 25, and this correction was delayed to confirm Mr. Foster's employment.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Losing Middle-Wage Jobs

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley is in danger of creating its own digital divide. 
 The California region is losing its middle-class work force at a significant rate, according to an annual report that tracks the economic, social and environmental health of the region that is the nation's technology heartland.
 The 2008 Index of Silicon Valley -- which this year was sponsored by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a public-private partnership, and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a nonprofit -- found that from 2002 to 2006, middle-wage jobs fell to 46 percent of the work force, from 52 percent. 
 At the same time, while the percentage of higher-end jobs rose slightly -- to 27 percent from 26 -- lower-wage jobs expanded to 27 percent, from 22 percent of the work force. In all, more than 50,000 middle-income jobs have disappeared over the four years measured by the study.
 The vanishing jobs -- defined as those paying $30,000 to $80,000 -- represent workers who had been in the lower part of the white-collar pyramid, including secretaries, clerks and customer support representatives. The picture was blurred, however, by growth in some blue-collar, middle-income professions like electricians and plumbers, and several white-collar areas like computer support technicians.
 The consequence of the shift may undercut some of the basic mechanisms of the Valley economy, according to the authors of the report, by making upward mobility more difficult.
 ''If you lose the middle, it's harder to support the top,'' said Doug Henton, an economist at Collaborative Economics, a research and consulting firm in Mountain View, Calif., that helps prepare the annual report.
 The short-range outlook for the region appears to be more positive, with the overall pace of job gains outpacing the nation's. 
 For example, for the first time since 2001, when the dot-com sector was imploding, median household income rose. Silicon Valley added 28,000 jobs, for an increase of 1.7 percent in 2007. Over all, the region is far more wealthy than the rest of the country, with per capita income 57 percent higher than the national average.
 Despite fears of losses in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the region continues to see a healthy in-flow of talent from outside the United States. More than 17,000 foreign citizens moved to the region last year, reversing a decline since the number peaked in 2001 at above 30,000.
 Forty-eight percent of the households of the region speak a language other than English in the home.
 Reflecting the changing boundaries of what is defined as Silicon Valley, this year the authors of the report added all of San Mateo County's work force. It was the first change to the definition of the region by the study, which was first published in 1995. By moving the northern border of the Valley past the San Francisco airport, the area now reflects more of the biotechnology orientation of companies like Genentech. The region does not include San Francisco.
 Venture capital investment continued to climb at a healthy clip during 2007, rising by 11 percent. Sixty-two percent of the so-called clean tech venture investment for California was invested in Silicon Valley during the year.
 The Valley continues to stand apart because it is a center of technical innovation, said Russell Hancock, president of Joint Venture. But he also said it was unlikely that the region would be unaffected by a recession or the subprime mortgage crisis.
 Still, the researchers behind the study said the Valley was distinguished by the flexibility of its economy and its ability to adapt to changing conditions.
 ''What we're talking about is a Valley that continues to reinvent itself, and it's not in any one sector,'' Mr. Henton said.
 One notable category in which the region lags behind its international competitors is home broadband networks. Only 51 percent of the region has access to broadband Internet -- defined as more than 200 kilobits per second. In contrast, 65 percent of the households in Japan and 94 percent in South Korea are wired to at least that speed.

HEADLINE: PAKISTANI VOTERS DEAL MUSHARRAF CRUSHING DEFEAT

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL and JANE PERLEZ; Carlotta Gall reported from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Jane Perlez from Lahore. David Rohde contributed reporting from Peshawar, and Salman Masood from Rawalpindi..

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Pakistanis dealt a crushing defeat to President Pervez Musharraf in parliamentary elections on Monday, in what government and opposition politicians said was a firm rejection of his policies since 2001 and those of his close ally, the United States. 
 Almost all the leading figures in the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, the party that has governed for the last five years under Mr. Musharraf, lost their seats, including the leader of the party, the former speaker of Parliament and six ministers. 
 Official results are expected Tuesday, but early returns indicated that the vote would usher in a prime minister from one of the opposition parties, and opened the prospect of a Parliament that would move to undo many of Mr. Musharraf's policies and that may even try to remove him. 
 Early results showed equal gains for the Pakistan Peoples Party, whose leader, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated on Dec. 27, and the Pakistan Muslim League-N, the faction led by Nawaz Sharif, like Ms. Bhutto a former prime minister. Each party may be in a position to form the next government. 
 The results were interpreted here as a repudiation of Mr. Musharraf as well as the Bush administration, which has staunchly backed him for more than six years as its best bet in the campaign against the Islamic militants in Pakistan. American officials will have little choice now but to seek alternative allies from among the new political forces emerging from the vote. 
 Politicians and party workers from Mr. Musharraf's party said the vote was a protest against government policies and the rise in terrorism here, in particular against Mr. Musharraf's heavy-handed way of dealing with militancy and his use of the army against tribesmen in the border areas, and against militants in a siege at the Red Mosque here in the capital last summer that left more than 100 people dead. 
 Others said Mr. Musharraf's dismissal last year of the Supreme Court chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who remains under house arrest, was deeply unpopular with the voters. 
 Mr. Musharraf, who stepped down as army chief last November after being re-elected to another five-year term as president, has seen his standing plummet as the country has faced a determined insurgency by the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and a deteriorating economy.
 By association, his party suffered badly. The two main opposition parties -- the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-N -- surged into the gap. 
 By early Monday night, crowds of Sharif supporters had already begun celebrating as they paraded through the streets of Rawalpindi, the garrison town just outside the capital, Islamabad. Riding on motorbikes and clinging to the backs of minivans, they played music and waved the green flags of Mr. Sharif's party decorated with the party symbol, a tiger.
 From unofficial results the private news channel, Aaj Television, forecast that the Pakistan Peoples Party would win 110 seats in the 272-seat National Assembly, with Mr. Sharif's party taking 100 seats.
 Mr. Musharraf's party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, was crushed, holding on to just 20 to 30 seats. Early results released by the state news agency, The Associated Press of Pakistan, also showed the Pakistan Peoples Party to be leading in the number of seats won.
 The Election Commission of Pakistan declared the elections free and fair and said the polling passed relatively peacefully, despite some irregularities and scattered violence. Ten people were killed and 70 injured around the country, including one candidate who was shot in Lahore on the night before the vote, Pakistani news channels reported. 
 Fearful of violence and deterred by confusion at polling stations, voters did not turn out in large numbers. Yet fears from opposition parties that the government would try to rig the elections did not materialize, as the early losses showed.
 Official results were not expected until Tuesday morning, but all the parties were already coming to terms with the anti-Musharraf trend in the voting. 
 At the headquarters of Sheik Rashid Ahmed, the minister of railways and a close friend of the president, his supporters sat gloomily in chairs under an awning, listening to the cheers of their opponents. ''Q is finished,'' said Tahir Khan, 21, one of the party workers, referring to the pro-Musharraf party. 
 The party workers said Mr. Ahmed, who was among the ministers who lost their seats, was popular but had suffered from the overwhelming protest vote against Mr. Musharraf and his governing faction. 
 The results opened a host of new challenges for the Bush administration, which has been criticized in Congress and by Pakistan analysts for relying too heavily on Mr. Musharraf. Even as Mr. Musharraf's standing plummeted and the insurgency gained strength, senior Bush administration officials praised Mr. Musharraf as a valued partner in the effort against terrorism. 
 With Mr. Musharraf as both president and head of the Pakistani military -- a post he relinquished last November -- the administration poured about $1 billion a year in military assistance into Pakistan after 9/11. 
 After Mr. Musharraf stepped down from the army, the Bush administration still gave him unequivocal support. Last month, the assistant secretary of state for South Asia, Richard A. Boucher, told Congress he considered the Pakistani leader indispensable to American interests. 
 Such fidelity to Mr. Musharraf often raised the hackles of Pakistanis, and the newspapers here were filled with editorials that expressed despair about Washington's close relationship with the unpopular leader. 
 Many educated Pakistanis said they were irritated that the Bush administration chose to ignore Mr. Musharraf's dismissal in November of the Supreme Court chief justice. 
 The big swing against the Pakistan Muslim League-Q party that supported Mr. Musharraf appeared to bear out the position of the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, who has been a critic of the administration's Pakistan policy. 
 On his arrival on Sunday to observe the elections, Mr. Biden said: ''I don't buy into the argument that Musharraf is the only one. We have to have more than just a Musharraf policy.''
 As a starting point for a new policy, Mr. Biden said the United States needed to show Pakistanis that Washington was interested in more than the campaign against terrorism. He suggested that economic development aid be tripled to $1.5 billion annually. 
 But Washington could take some comfort in the losses of the Islamic religious parties in the North-West Frontier Province that abut the tribal areas where the Taliban and Al Qaeda have carved out bases.
 The greatest blow for Mr. Musharraf came in the strong wave of support in Punjab Province, the country's most populous, for Mr. Sharif, who has been a bitter rival since his government was overthrown by Mr. Musharraf in a military coup in 1999 and he was arrested and sent into exile. 
 He returned last November, and although banned from running for Parliament himself, he has campaigned for his party on an openly anti-Musharraf agenda, calling for the president's resignation and for the reinstatement of Mr. Chaudhry and other Supreme Court judges.
 Underscoring the reversal for Mr. Musharraf was the downfall of the powerful Chaudhry family of Punjab Province, who had underwritten his political career by creating the Pakistan Muslim League-Q party for him. 
 ''The myth is broken; it was a huge wave against Musharraf,'' said Athar Minallah, a lawyer involved in the anti-Musharraf lawyers' movement. ''Right across the board his party was defeated, in the urban and rural areas. The margins are so big they couldn't have rigged it even if they tried.'' 
 A few hours after the size of the defeat became clear, the government eased up on the restrictions against Aitzaz Ahsan, the leader of the lawyers' movement that has opposed the president. Mr. Ahsan, who has been under house arrest since last November, when Mr. Musharraf imposed emergency rule for six weeks, found the phones in his house were suddenly reconnected.
 ''Musharraf should be preparing a C-130 for Turkey,'' Mr. Ahsan said, referring to Mr. Musharraf's statements that he might retire to Turkey, where he spent part of his childhood. 
 Two politicians close to Mr. Musharraf have said in the past week that the president was well aware of the drift in the country against him and they suggested that he would not remain in office if the new government was in direct opposition to him. ''He does not have the fire in the belly for another fight,'' said one member of his party. He added that Mr. Musharraf was building a house for himself in Islamabad and would be ready soon to move.

HEADLINE: In Search of a Real Urban Policy

 BODY:
By now, many Americans have heard the presidential candidates talk about issues close to the heart of rural America. They fell all over themselves to praise ethanol in Iowa and condemn nuclear storage in Nevada. But as important as rural problems are, they're not nearly as big as the task of helping the nation's struggling cities -- where most Americans live or work. The cities have been the hardest hit as federal policies have failed or gone missing in education, housing, health care, jobs, transportation and environment, to name a few. Yet urban issues have gotten scant attention in this campaign.
 It's not a new problem. For more than a generation, presidential aspirants have mostly resisted acknowledging the importance of the cities' well being. Blame the front-loading of the primary season with rural states, or electoral and legislative systems that give disproportionate weight to sparsely populated states. Whatever the reason, it is shortsighted. According to Bruce Katz, co-author of a Brookings Institution study promoting investment in metropolitan areas, the largest 100 cities and their surrounding communities are home to 65 percent of the nation's population and account for about 75 percent of the country's gross domestic product. 
 Continue to ignore the plight of urban schools, and soon about half of New York City's one million schoolchildren won't graduate from high school. Continue to neglect infrastructure, and face the prospect of more Katrina-like disasters where large numbers of people live or more collapsed bridges that carry thousands of commuters, as happened last summer in Minneapolis. Let brownfields remain polluted, and risk health problems and hurt the potential for job-creating development. Keep encouraging fossil-fueled transportation, and cities will choke on gridlock, and so will businesses and jobs.
 Voters deserve to hear a lot more from the presidential candidates -- in position papers, public speeches and debates -- about how they intend to help the cities. Will they, for example, continue President Bush's efforts to shortchange passenger rail, while China makes huge investments in transportation and its population centers? 
 Senator John McCain, who leads the Republican nominating race, does not dwell in his speeches on the cities. It's not surprising since the largest ones historically vote Democratic, but that is no excuse for not being as expansive about education and health care as he is on his Web site in describing his plan to stimulate the economy by cutting taxes -- a bad idea that will not work.
 The Democrats, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, have unveiled pieces of an urban agenda. Each has pledged to fight poverty by increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps millions of working families and has not been increased in 15 years. They would each ensure increases in the minimum wage. Mr. Obama would peg it to the cost of living; Mrs. Clinton would increase it every time members of Congress get a raise. Both would spend on job training and placement, and both have plans to expand health insurance.
 There are not huge areas of domestic disagreement between the Democrats, but neither, so far, are offering anything like a comprehensive vision for urban America. The opening issues pages on the official Web sites for both candidates give rural issues a special category. ''Urban policy'' does not get a billing. 
 It's not like there is no leadership on these issues, it's just not coming from Washington or the presidential candidates. In fact, they might take note with some concern that the national leader on handgun control and a range of other urban issues -- from environment to public health -- is Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York, who has presidential aspirations of his own.
 Like other mayors and governors, Mr. Bloomberg has been forced to step into the yawning gaps left by a feckless federal government. He has sued out-of-town gun dealers in an effort to combat violent crimes; advocated congestion pricing and green buildings and mandated hybrid taxis to help the environment; and banned smoking in public places to fight cancer. Without much spending, he is changing things for the better.
 Of course, that is just one city, and it does not change the sad truth that states and cities have been forced to assume more fiscal obligations from Washington while getting fewer of their citizens' tax dollars. There can be no substitute for national leadership. The president must provide it, and Americans deserve to know how the candidates would step up to the challenge.

HEADLINE: For Publisher In Los Angeles, Cuts and Worse

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The Hollywood Walk of Fame consists of more than 2,000 terrazzo-and-brass stars embedded in the sidewalk, bearing names from eminent to obscure (Strongheart the dog, anyone?). The walk attracts tourists, but most locals step over -- make that drive past -- without noticing.
 When The Los Angeles Times received a star last year, it was met at the paper with shrugs, eye rolls and grumbling about money ill-spent (the local chamber of commerce charges $25,000 for the honor). But it meant something to the new publisher, David D. Hiller, who enthusiastically attended the installation and told editors that the newspaper should cover it. They protested that the idea amounted to using a news-free stunt for unseemly self-congratulation, and Mr. Hiller deferred to their judgment.
 ''You know what? I did get a kick out of it, and I thought it was great for the paper, and I thought it was fun,'' Mr. Hiller said about the Walk of Fame ceremony. ''And if that makes me star-struck, then I'm guilty as charged.'' 
 Mr. Hiller never had much chance of getting the benefit of the doubt at The Times, one of a handful of newspapers with a claim to national standing: its daily circulation of almost 800,000 is the fourth-largest circulation of any American newspaper and the largest in the West, and it dominates the second-biggest market in the country, after New York.
 But The Times has also been battered by years of flagging revenue, management turnover and newsroom cutbacks. 
 The paper's owner, the Tribune Company of Chicago, sent Mr. Hiller to California in late 2006 to impose some discipline, fiscal and otherwise. He took the place of a popular publisher and promptly fired a popular top editor, both of them forced out for refusing to carry out the latest round of staff cuts ordered by Tribune. 
 Last week, after a very bumpy 16 months, he hired a new editor, Russ Stanton. He also has a new boss, Samuel Zell, a real estate billionaire who took the Tribune Company private in December, saying that he was giving more autonomy to Mr. Hiller and other chiefs of Tribune properties.
 But with the company scraping to meet heavy debt payments, Mr. Hiller faces the daunting task of showing his new bosses that he can turn around a paper hit by an industrywide contraction, a California real estate slump and internal dissension. 
 Within The Times, however, many employees dismiss Mr. Hiller, 53, as a star-struck outsider, a meddler in the newsroom who does not understand journalism or Los Angeles. 
 The Walk of Fame episode became emblematic of the view at The Times of Mr. Hiller and Tribune generally, and it was cited repeatedly in interviews with current and former business executives, editors and reporters, nearly all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared retribution for speaking out. 
 He does not entirely disagree with the criticism of the old Tribune Company or even of him, though he says much of it is overstated. 
 ''What we have to do is get beyond the history,'' Mr. Hiller said in an interview on Friday. ''And I'm really confident that we're doing that. This is no longer about Chicago versus L.A. This is about how does The L.A. Times change.''
 His first major act of the new Tribune era came last month, when he ousted yet another top editor, James E. O'Shea, who had gradually won the trust of his staff and, like his predecessors, refused to make more newsroom cuts. The newsroom has about 870 employees, down from a high of about 1,200, and Mr. Hiller says he expects to lower that number by 40 to 50 this year.
 ''If I had my way and if business were great, I wouldn't cut anybody in the newsroom, or in most other departments,'' he said, adding that he believes in the public service mission of newspapers. ''We are stretched to the max trying to cover the complexity of our region the way we'd like to.''
 The turmoil continued Monday, when John Montorio, one of two managing editors -- the second-highest newsroom position -- announced that he would leave the paper this month. 
 Mr. Montorio, who oversees the feature sections, said that Mr. Stanton ''has just decided to take the features department in a new direction, that he wanted a new leader. And that is the right of every new leader, to choose his own team.''
 Tribune does not report each property's performance, but through November, the company said that 2007 newspaper ad revenue had fallen 8.5 percent (compared with about 7 percent in the entire industry) and that Los Angeles had among the sharpest declines in retail and classified ads. Mr. Hiller said he expected another drop in 2008.
 A person who had been shown the numbers said The Times had earnings of $240 million in 2006 and $192 million in 2007 (before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation), and projected about $150 million this year before the announced cuts -- figures that Mr. Hiller said were roughly accurate. 
 Former executives say that the paper had an operating profit margin above 20 percent until two or three years ago and that it is in the midteens now. Some executives within Tribune said the company wants The Times to match last year's cash flow, a tall order in this economic climate.
 Mr. O'Shea has argued that focused newsroom investments, like a successful fashion section that was started last year, can generate more ad revenue. Mr. Hiller agrees that some of those ideas work, but he has also said that The Times cannot spend its way to profits and that Mr. O'Shea and his predecessor, Dean Baquet, had trouble accepting financial reality.
 Mr. Hiller's relationships with his top editors have been worsened by less-than-straight shooting, according to several people at the paper -- fed, they said, by his aversion to direct confrontation. Mr. Hiller said that Mr. O'Shea left by mutual agreement; Mr. O'Shea, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has said that he was fired, and after Mr. Hiller had already talked to others about dismissing him.
 When he arrived in October 2006, Mr. Hiller said that he wanted to work with Mr. Baquet and that he did not have in mind specific numbers of jobs to cut. Some high-ranking officials at The Times say that he told them privately then that he did have specific targets, and a month into the job, he fired Mr. Baquet.
 ''It was a constant treadmill of cuts, and nobody ever said: 'Let's catch our breath. Let's figure out some sort of long-term plan,' '' said Mr. Baquet, who is now an assistant managing editor and the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times. ''When you tried to have a conversation about where you're going strategically, the answer was always, 'Let's just get past this next round of cuts.' ''
 Several other top editors and some business-side executives -- some still at the paper, some not -- voiced the same complaint.
 ''I think that's been true in the past,'' Mr. Hiller said. ''We have spent the last six months putting together a long-range plan of just that sort,'' though the plan is not complete. ''I totally agree,'' he said. ''If you can't paint that picture, you can't take people there.''
 But his statements and actions, like firing Mr. O'Shea, strongly suggest that the friction between him and his fractious paper will continue. Even Mr. Stanton, the new editor Mr. Hiller appointed, said in an address to the newsroom on Thursday that he was ''hopping mad'' about the seemingly endless cuts, and that they had to stop.
 Top Times executives have discussed letting marketing executives control the monthly Sunday magazine, rather than leaving it to editors, though Mr. Hiller says no decisions about that have been made. The idea touches on the traditional tension in journalism, between profiting as a business and making independent judgments about what information to deliver, without concern for advertisers' interests.
 Mr. Hiller has sent notes to reporters suggesting or assessing articles, to the frustration of editors who see it as inappropriate. 
 Last Friday, Mr. Hiller put Jack D. Klunder, a well-regarded executive who joined The Times long before Tribune took over, in charge of the paper's business operations. And he announced that the widely criticized chief of ad sales, a Tribune veteran sent from Chicago, would leave. 
 Colleagues doubt that Mr. Hiller could have made such moves under the old Tribune regime that promoted its own and mistrusted Times veterans. 
 The paradox of Mr. Hiller's position is that, by all accounts, he is outgoing and wants to be well-liked. Within the company, he has been called ''the class president'' and ''the cheerleader.''
 A Harvard-educated lawyer, Mr. Hiller joined the Tribune Company 20 years ago. He oversaw its Internet operations from 2000 to 2004, then served as publisher of The Chicago Tribune for two years.
 For years, as newspaper Web sites became deeper, richer and more complex, Tribune's sites fell behind, limiting their ability to draw readers and advertisers. Just last week, the Times Web site added the ability to put hyperlinks in its articles, something other major papers have had for as long as a decade.
 But The Times's site has improved significantly since he arrived, adding video and dozens of blogs. It had 5.7 million unique United States visitors in January, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, fifth among newspaper sites, behind The New York Times (20.5 million), USA Today (12.3 million), The Washington Post (9.9 million) and The Wall Street Journal (7 million). 
 Mr. Hiller revels in the publisher's traditional role (much diminished at most papers) as a prominent civic figure, meeting with elected officials and serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations. 
 His duty and the paper's is to be ''a very visible citizen in the community,'' he said. ''I'm a booster of things that are good in Los Angeles.''
 Mr. Hiller clearly has a fondness for show business and enjoys life in his adopted home. Last year, he used the newsroom's allotment of tickets to attend the Oscars. When The Times had a 125th birthday party, he took the microphone and sang ''Hello, Dolly'' and ''Baby, It's Cold Outside'' to several hundred employees.
 He said, ''I'm hoping the Dodgers or the Angels are going to invite me to sing the national anthem this year.''

HEADLINE: Slain Editor Heads List Of Polk Award Winners

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
A California editor slain as he investigated a business now linked to his murder, and reporters who exposed brutalities in Myanmar and Iraq, an environmental disaster in China and corruption in America were among winners of 14 George Polk Awards for 2007 announced Monday by Long Island University.
 Eight awards went to reporters of The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the McClatchy newspapers and The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss.; to the staffs of The Chicago Tribune and The Charlotte Observer, and to an ABC News team for work in the tradition of George W. Polk, a CBS correspondent killed in 1948 covering the civil war in Greece. 
 Five other Polk awards went to writers whose work appeared in The Nation and Institutional Investor magazines, to the editor of the political blog Talking Points Memo, to the author of a best-selling book on the military contractor Blackwater and to John McPhee, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author whose work has appeared in The New Yorker since 1965 and who was honored for career achievement.
 The journalist cited posthumously for local reporting, Chauncey W. Bailey Jr., 57, the editor of The Oakland Post, a weekly for black readers, was gunned down on Aug. 2 during his investigation of Your Black Muslim Bakery, a business the police called a front for a criminal organization, which has been linked to kidnappings, rapes and killings, including Mr. Bailey's.
 The police said seven men were arrested, a bakery worker confessed to the murder and the organization went out of business. The Committee to Protect Journalists said Mr. Bailey was the first journalist apparently picked as a target for killing in this country since 1993, though others have died in the line of duty.
 Leila Fadel, the Baghdad bureau chief for McClatchy, won the foreign reporting Polk for wide-ranging articles from Iraq on families in ethnically torn neighborhoods, on killers and victims and on an endlessly changing military and political struggle.
 Two Washington Post reporters, Barton Gellman and Jo Becker (now of The New York Times), won the Polk for political reporting for a four-part series on Vice President Dick Cheney's behind-the-scenes role as an architect of White House policies on interrogation techniques, which some critics call torture, on the conduct of military tribunals and on other issues.
 Charles Duhigg of The New York Times won the Polk for medical reporting for coverage of unethical practices involving investor-owned nursing homes, long-term care insurers and allied businesses. His articles gave details on how ownership changes compromised levels of care, raised questions about denials of insurance claims and prompted Congressional investigations and proposed regulatory changes.
 Shai Oster of The Wall Street Journal won the environmental award for disclosing the consequences of China's $22 billion Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, which is devastating villages and causing landslides and other unforeseen events. China, as a result, acknowledged a need to relocate four million people, besides more than a million who had already been displaced.
 From ''ABC World News With Charles Gibson,'' the senior foreign correspondent Jim Sciutto, the producer Angus Hines and the cameraman-producer Tom Murphy won the television Polk for reports from Myanmar, formerly Burma, where they penetrated a news blackout by posing as tourists and exposed covert arrests and murders in a government crackdown on demonstrating students and Buddhist monks. 
 The Chicago Tribune won the consumer reporting award for accounts of deaths and injuries among children exposed to lead-tainted toys, defective cribs and other dangerous products in a series, reported in China and America, that led to product recalls and import changes.
 The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina won the economic reporting award for disclosing a high rate of housing foreclosures that presaged the subprime mortgage crisis and prompted investigations and regulatory reforms. 
 The Polk for legal reporting went to Joshua Micah Marshall, editor and publisher of Talking Points Memo, for leading the news media in coverage of the Bush administration's politically motivated dismissals of United States attorneys.
 Joshua Kors, a freelance, won the magazine reporting award for articles in The Nation exposing misdiagnoses by military doctors that cheated wounded Iraq veterans of disability and medical benefits by claiming they had pre-existing ''personality disorders.'' After an uproar, President Bush signed a law requiring investigations of all discharges based on such diagnoses. 
 The award for financial reporting went to Edward Chancellor for an article in Institutional Investor that sounded an alarm months before the crisis in financial markets over subprime mortgages and lightly regulated hedge funds.
 Jerry Mitchell of The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson won the state reporting award for coverage of lapses by the Mississippi State Health Department, including unreported outbreaks of tuberculosis, syphilis infections and a soaring infant mortality rate, the nation's highest. The state's leading health officer and a board that oversees the agency were fired. Mr. Mitchell won the 2005 Polk for justice reporting. 
 Jeremy Scahill won the Polk book award for ''Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army'' (Nation Books), which described killings, human rights violations and other misconduct by the company that provides private security for American diplomats in Iraq. Mr. Scahill shared the 1998 Polk for radio reporting.
 Cited for career achievement, Mr. McPhee, 77, the author of dozens of books, was hailed as a pioneer of creative nonfiction who has left an indelible mark on American journalism.
 The Polk Awards will be presented at a lunch at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan on April 17. Established in 1949, the awards are administered by Long Island University. Winners are selected by a jury of faculty members and alumni from entries submitted by journalists and news organizations and by a panel of journalism teachers, editors and reporters, including some former Polk recipients.

HEADLINE: Rice, in Nairobi, Offers Incentives to End Violence

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Kennedy Abwao contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice held pointed talks with the leaders of Kenya's rival political factions on Monday, and said afterward that while their differences were ''not unbridgeable,'' the two sides must move much faster to accept a power-sharing deal that would lead to a coalition government.
 ''The time for a political settlement was yesterday,'' Ms. Rice said at a news conference at the home of the American ambassador here. 
 Ms. Rice seemed to be aiming her sharpest comments at the Kenyan government, which has widely been viewed as the obstacle to a genuine power-sharing agreement between the government and the opposition. Kenyan government officials responded by saying that they agreed a solution needed to be found as soon as possible, but sounded increasingly prickly about outside intervention. 
 ''We will not bow down to dictation,'' Martha Karua, the minister of justice and constitutional affairs, said in an interview Monday night, after sitting in on a two-hour meeting between Ms. Rice and President Mwai Kibaki. ''We can listen to all our friends. We can engage with them. But the decision ultimately will be ours.''
 Ms. Karua's comments underscored the delicate task the Bush administration faces in wading into the crisis in Kenya, which erupted after a disputed presidential election in December and has cost more than 1,000 lives. With Mr. Bush already in Africa on a five-country tour to promote his foreign aid agenda, he had little choice but to make a high-profile show of concern for Kenya and announced before he left Washington that he would send Ms. Rice.
 Ms. Rice knew going in that she would have to tread gingerly, and it seemed on Monday that she was bringing carrots, not sticks. As she was flying from Tanzania to Nairobi over the Serengeti, the famous game-studded plains, she insisted that she did not intend to dictate a solution and that she would instead use her meetings to dangle the prospect of additional economic help for Kenya if the rival factions could reach a compromise.
 ''When Kenya resolves this political conflict,'' she said, ''they are going to find a very supportive United States in terms of additional work on reconstruction and reconciliation support.'' 
 Power-sharing will have to be genuine, Ms. Rice said. Both sides must have ''responsibilities and authorities that matter,'' she said. ''It can't be simply the illusion of power sharing. It has to be real.''
 Ms. Rice said she did not want to talk about threats, sanctions or provisions that might punish Kenya's leading politicians, who have been bitterly at odds since the election. 
 Hundreds of thousands have been displaced in fighting that has followed ethnic lines, segregating many areas of the country into ethnically homogenous zones. Many Kenyans believe that the only solution is for the government and opposition to share power.
 Ms. Rice's promises of more help for Kenya, which already receives more than half a billion dollars of annual American aid, fit in with President Bush's approach of rewarding countries who embrace democracy and American-approved development programs. Though the president is trying to cement his legacy as a friend of Africa with this week's trip, he has been criticized for not traveling to Africa's hot spots, like Congo, Sudan and now Kenya.
 Supporters of Mr. Kibaki and the top opposition leader, Raila Odinga, who lost the election amid evidence of widespread vote rigging, have battled across the country. The election dispute has stirred deep grievances over land and economic inequality that have dogged Kenya since independence in 1963.
 On Monday, Ms. Rice shuttled back and forth across Nairobi, meeting with Mr. Kibaki, Mr. Odinga and Kenyan business leaders. The country's economy, until recently one of the strongest in Africa, has been brought to its knees by the turbulence and violence. 
 Ms. Rice also talked with Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, who has spent the past four weeks in Kenya trying to broker a truce, and told him where she thought there were potential ''points of agreement'' between the parties.
 The opposition has proposed a number of power-sharing possibilities, including having Mr. Kibaki remain the president, head of state and commander-in-chief of the military while Mr. Odinga becomes prime minister and is in charge of domestic affairs. 
 But members of Mr. Kibaki's team have forcefully rejected that, saying they will give the opposition some cabinet posts but that the Kenyan Constitution does not allow power to be divided the way the opposition is suggesting. The fear is that unless the government gives the opposition a meaningful role in ruling the country, opposition supporters will revert to violence and Kenya will join the growing club of failed states in Africa.
 Mr. Odinga has said the prime minister post is the bare minimum he would accept.
 ''Beyond that, we will be out of government,'' he said in an interview Sunday night. He also said that Mr. Kibaki was not the stumbling block but that the problem was a small clique of ''hard-liners'' around Mr. Kibaki.
 ''I'm sure he's willing for a power-sharing arrangement that would give him a decent way out to get our country out of this mess,'' Mr. Odinga said.
 Mr. Odinga gave a gloomy prognosis, saying that the negotiations would most likely fail and that Kenya would soon be ungovernable.
 ''The moment it is announced that the talks collapsed, I am sure there will be an eruption countrywide,'' he said. ''It will be chaos.''
 The government has dismissed those threats and accused opposition leaders, including Mr. Odinga, of inciting their supporters to kill people of Mr. Kibaki's ethnicity. Mr. Odinga has denied that and blamed the government for failing to protect Kenyans.
 On Monday, Ms. Rice said that the back-and-forth had to end and that it was not just the American government that thought this. 
 ''What I hear is the impatience and insistence of Kenyans that this is resolved,'' she said. ''It is Kenyans who are insisting that its leaders and political class find a solution.''

HEADLINE: No Polo Pony, but Penney's New Label Is Pure Ralph Lauren Americana

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WHAT do you get when the J. C. Penney Company and the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation team up to sell an extensive new line of clothing and home furnishings? A branding mash-up that some might call Polo Penney.
 Actually, the new brand, arriving at Penney next week after a year of planning, is grandly named American Living. Penney is describing the campaign to herald the arrival -- on TV, in print, online, in movie theaters, through the mail and in stores -- as the largest for any brand introduced since its founding in 1902.
 Although the 40 categories of American Living merchandise are being supplied by Polo Ralph Lauren -- the first time the company is creating a brand for another retailer -- they will not bear the Ralph Lauren name nor any sub-brand like Chaps, Lauren Home, Polo or RLX.
 ''We really think the American Living brand can stand on its own,'' said Michael Boylson, chief marketing officer at Penney in Plano, Tex., because ''customers told us it really fills a void we had in our assortment.'' 
 Besides, ''if it had the Lauren name on it,'' he added, ''I think it would create some confusion.''
 Some corporate-identity consultants wonder whether the mash-up of two such disparate brands will mush up their images in the minds of consumers.
 ''It's an attempt to borrow equity from the Ralph Lauren brand, the absolute gold standard in fashion brands,'' said Robert K. Passikoff, president at Brand Keys, a research company in New York that studies brand and customer loyalty.
 ''Are people willing to believe it?'' Mr. Passikoff asked rhetorically. ''It's a great idea, but you're likely better off putting something like that into a Macy's.''
 Mr. Passikoff likened the project to recent, failed efforts by Wal-Mart Stores to elevate its image by selling more stylish and expensive clothing, which was advertised in unlikely places.
 ''May I remind you that Wal-Mart ran ad pages in Vogue?'' Mr. Passikoff said. ''The ads were lovely, but no one would buy the clothing.''
 Mr. Boylson said he thought that American Living's presence in Penney retail outlets -- 600 stores, catalogs and two Web sites, jcp.com and americanliving.com -- will ''cast a halo effect on the total J. C. Penney brand, like Sephora.''
 His reference was to the successful opening of shops inside Penney stores by Sephora, the chain owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton that sells expensive cosmetics and fragrances. 
 The American Living products will cost about 15 percent more than the highest-priced private labels now sold by Penney under brands like Concepts by Claiborne, Joneswear and Liz & Co.
 For instance, a men's V-neck sweater will be $65; a woman's madras plaid skirt, $70; a girl's poplin dress, $42; and a comforter set for a queen-size bed, $335.
 ''It's at the higher end of the price points we carry,'' Mr. Boylson acknowledged, ''but with American Living you can have great style, great quality, at an affordable price'' -- more Penney, in other words, than Polo Ralph Lauren.
 The logo for the new line is an eagle and a flag rather than the Polo brand's horse. But the symbol is unmistakably from Laurenland, an upscale suburb or beach community of chukkers, clambakes and khaki.
 ''It evokes an Americana lifestyle,'' Mr. Boylson said, ''with a very strong point of view.'' 
 The campaign combines aspects of Penney's Main Street marketing approach -- like its annual sponsorship of the Academy Awards broadcast on ABC -- with the refined, Aryan-from-Darien style that has long characterized the Lauren brand.
 The American Living ads closely resemble the familiar campaigns for Ralph Lauren that present picture-perfect preppies in all-American settings like July Fourth parades, small-town picnics and golf courses. There are patrician families, shirtless hunks, dreamy couples and tow-headed children.
 The similarities are no accident: The American Living ads are produced by the Global Brand Concepts division of Polo Ralph Lauren, under the aegis of David Lauren.
 The photographer and director for the ads is Bruce Weber, whose work has been featured in campaigns for Ralph Lauren as well as other upscale brands like Calvin Klein and Abercrombie & Fitch.
 Asked whether he feared consumers might mix up the American Living campaign with the others because they all have the trademark Weber touch, Mr. Boylson replied, ''How could it be anything but a plus?''
 When the executives at Global Brand Concepts showed him the ads, Mr. Boylson said, ''My jaw hit the table.''
 ''And their comment was, 'That's why you pay Bruce Weber,' '' he added, laughing.
 Mr. Boylson declined to discuss the campaign's costs or the Penney revenue goal for American Living. He described the brand as ''a billion-dollar idea,'' but did not mean to suggest that was a sales goal.
 Penney has two private-label brands, Arizona and St. John's Bay, with annual revenue of more than $1 billion each. The trade publication DNR reported last week that American Living's apparel, linens, bedding, footwear and accessories could reach that level in five years.
 The campaign for American Living will start during two big awards shows. First, there will be commercials on Thursday during the Univision broadcast of ''Premio lo Nuestro a la Musica Latina'' (Lo Nuestro Latin Music Awards).
 Three nights later, Penney will run four commercials -- one 60-second spot and three 30s -- during the ABC presentation of the 80th Academy Awards. Estimates are that ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, is charging $1.8 million for each 30 seconds of commercial time during the show.
 The Weber spots depict Laurenland sights like young men playing Frisbee, a high school marching band, a handsome carpenter, an older couple dancing, skateboarders, girls in ballet tutus and the streets of a small town at night. 
 The commercials end with an announcer declaring: ''Introducing American Living for families and home. Only at J. C. Penney.'' The Penney logo appears on screen along with the theme, ''Every day matters,'' from the general Penney brand campaign created by Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 Saatchi & Saatchi has no role in the American Living campaign, which is created entirely by Global Brand Concepts. ''It's not uncommon for someone our size to have many agencies,'' Mr. Boylson said.
 Penney will be the official retail sponsor of the Academy Awards for the seventh year in a row. Other Oscar advertisers include American Express, Coca-Cola, General Motors, L'Oreal, MasterCard, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. 
 It may seem puzzling that Penney is spending so much time and money on higher-priced merchandise as the economy turns sluggish and the middle-class shoppers who frequent chains like Penney cut back spending.
 Sales last month at Penney stores open more than a year, an important retail indicator known as same-store sales, fell 1.9 percent compared with the same month of 2007.
 ''There's a certain degree to too-little, too-late in this move,'' Mr. Passikoff said of the American Living introduction, because in Brand Keys surveys consumers say that ''when making decisions about where to go to shop, the range of merchandise available'' is less important than it was a year ago.
 What matters more now are ''convenience, value and the shopping experience,'' he added.
 Mr. Boylson said he thought consumers would respond to American Living despite the economic challenges.
 ''Now more than ever is time to launch something,'' he said, ''to give people a reason to shop J. C. Penney.''
 ''Consumers are still buying newness and fashion,'' Mr. Boylson said, as well as products that are appealingly priced.
 ''American Living may be a step up for us,'' he added, ''but it's at better prices than specialty and better department stores.''
 And for those shoppers who want ''the new and the exciting'' at even lower prices, Penney is ''a promotional department store,'' Mr. Boylson said, ''and we'll promote American Living.''
 The translation from retail-speak: The brand will be on sale from time to time, just like other private-label brands at Penney -- although ''we may not discount it as deeply,'' Mr. Boylson said.

HEADLINE: House Panel Seeks Inquiry Into Contract

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House Small Business Committee has asked for an investigation into how a newly retired Bush administration appointee with no experience in helping small businesses compete for government contracts received money from the Small Business Administration to do exactly that.
 The $1.2 million contract -- 90 percent of the agency's budget to provide advice and training to small disadvantaged businesses or businesses operating in high unemployment areas -- went to the VBP Group, a company based in Paradise Valley, Ariz. 
 The company's owner, Vernon B. Parker, served as assistant secretary for civil rights in the Agriculture Department from April 2003 to January 2006. The post was created by Congress to help address the department's historic discrimination against black farmers. A month after Mr. Parker, a former church pastor who is also a lawyer and a civil rights consultant, left the Agriculture Department, he founded the VBP Group. 
 Certification by the S.B.A. to run one of its programs typically takes two years, unless the owner has prior experience in the area and receives a waiver. The VBP Group was four months old when it was certified. 
 Steven C. Preston, the S.B.A.'s administrator, was questioned about the contract award to Mr. Parker at a hearing of the House Small Business Committee on Feb. 7. 
 The next day, Mr. Preston reported that he had asked the agency's inspector general, Eric Thorson, to look into the matter. ''Based in the information provided by your staff, and some research conducted by my staff, I believe there is sufficient cause for concern over the events surrounding this contractor,'' Mr. Preston wrote to Nydia Velazquez, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the committee.
 Ms. Velazquez said in an e-mail message on Friday that the S.B.A. has long argued that it has had to cut programs because ''the agency just didn't have the funds.''
 She added: ''It seems they only have money for Republican cronies.''
 Mr. Parker, 48, said, in a telephone interview on Friday, that he had legitimately obtained the S.B.A. contract after winning a waiver to become a qualified training provider in June 2006. In addition to serving at the Agriculture Department, Mr. Parker said he had worked at the federal Office of Personnel Management, becoming its general counsel in the early 1990s, according to his official biography.
 ''My role is to teach businesses about civil rights issues and how the government views civil rights,'' he said.
 Mr. Parker, who said in a second phone call that he had been contacted by the inspector general's office, said he was working with James E. Selmon III on the program. Mr. Selmon was associate administrator for the Agriculture Department's Rural Housing Service for two years, starting in 2002.
 Mr. Selmon, 37, said he had been conducting workshops in every state, ''We instruct them on how to get government contracts,'' Mr. Selmon said, by telephone from Houston, where he lives. ''It's everything from cost and pricing to administrative procedures and taxes.''
 Mr. Selmon said he was formerly employed by a Houston computer business and had worked for Unlimited Services Systems Management and Consultants, a firm based in Largo, Md., which provided S.B.A. training for three years, 2004 through 2006. 
 Brenda Campbell, who owns Unlimited Services Systems Management, said she had won a fourth year of the training contract but that it had been rescinded without explanation.
 The S.B.A., citing the inspector general's investigation, said it could not comment on Ms. Campbell's assertion or provide access to the contracting officials involved. The inspector general's office said it would not comment.
 Congressional Democrats and small business groups have long argued for the importance of the training program, which is the only government-financed program that teaches owners of small businesses about the complex procedures and language involved in applying for government contracts. Those contracts are often crucial to the financial well-being of small businesses, particularly minority- and female-owned businesses. Groups like the National Small Business Association say such training is vital, especially in a declining economy.
 ''What we hear is that the reason more of our members don't participate in government contracts is because it's so confusing,'' said Molly Brogan, the association's spokeswoman. ''The program helps them figure out what the lingo means and what they need to do.'' 
 The administration has asked for $1.5 million for the program for the coming fiscal year, which begins in October. Members of the small business committee have urged that the budget be increased to $2 million or more. 
 As recently as 2001, the program awarded $3.2 million to a dozen groups, including well-known names like the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. 
 Ms. Velazquez and the committee's ranking Republican, Steve Chabot of Ohio, have pledged to look ''into the use of funds to ensure the program has qualified business advisers.''

HEADLINE: New Yorker in the White House? Seems Like a Long Shot Now

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For a while, it looked as if every day might become Presidents' Day in New York.
 We were so sure -- some among us, anyway -- that we would have two locals fighting for the big prize in November: the Republican former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the Democratic junior senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton. We even prepared for a threefer in case the present mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, he of ever-evolving party status, jumped into the race because he figured the rest of America couldn't do without him.
 Now, as another Presidents' Day has come and gone, it seems more and more likely that New York will be shut out of the presidential election. Yet again. 
 'Tis our lot to be treated as a place that the political parties tap for campaign cash, not for national talent. Presidential candidates of either major party waste little time campaigning in our navy blue state. They certainly waste no breath on issues of special concern to New York and other cities.
 (Allow us a timeout to note that officially speaking, there is no such thing as Presidents' Day, regardless of what the store advertisements told you. The holiday just passed was Washington's Birthday, observed by Congressional dictate on the third Monday in February. As ever, most New Yorkers honored Washington only by reaching into their pockets for some worn bills bearing his image.)
 It is still possible, of course, that Mrs. Clinton will defeat Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination, which both seek while collecting full salaries for their neglected day jobs. Last week, both skipped an important vote on a Senate bill that would ban waterboarding and other interrogation techniques deemed by many to be torture. 
 By contrast, Senator John McCain, the likely Republican nominee for president, got back to Washington in time to vote against the bill. 
 The fierceness with which some supporters of Mr. Obama attack Mrs. Clinton is a sign that they do not consider her to be politically dead. Some all but describe her as a combination of Lady Macbeth, Ilsa Koch and Cruella De Vil -- the kind of woman who ''pimped out'' her daughter to help her campaign, to use a phrase that earned David Shuster of MSNBC a two-week suspension.
 You just know that if Mr. Shuster had said that Michelle Obama was ''pimped out'' by her husband's campaign, you could measure in microseconds how long it would have taken the Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to throw picket lines outside MSNBC studios.
 As for Mr. Bloomberg, he still has time to jump into the race. His continued willingness to speak out on national issues was demonstrated again the other day when he denounced the federal rebate that taxpayers are about to get as part of an economic stimulus package. Apparently, the mayor feels that only he should be able hand out tax rebates that his budget might not be able to afford.
 Still, the likelihood grows that neither he nor Mrs. Clinton will be able to hang on. Ask the folks who make a living at this sort of thing: professional oddsmakers. Bodoglife.com, a leading online gambling site, makes Mrs. Clinton a 7-3 shot to win the Democratic nomination. Mr. Obama is listed as the 4-15 favorite, meaning that you have to put up $15 to win a mere $4.
 Mr. Bloomberg's chances of winning in November are put at a distant 60-1. He must also contend with a hex that seems to have been cast on City Hall. 
 Mr. Giuliani's flameout is the latest example. No New York mayor has won higher office since John T. Hoffman was elected New York governor in 1868. Even the Chicago Cubs, nearly a full century since their last World Series triumph, have not labored under as enduring a curse.
 So while anything may happen, this isn't shaping up as New York's year. Our next best shot may lie with Gov. Eliot Spitzer. He is said to harbor presidential ambitions. And look how brilliantly he's been going about it.

HEADLINE: Democrats Make Populist Appeals Before Contests

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WAUSAU, Wis. 

 BODY:
Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama intensified their populist appeals on Monday, responding to widespread economic anxiety and pushing the Democratic Party further from the business-friendly posture once championed by Bill Clinton.
 Mrs. Clinton, speaking on the eve of the Wisconsin primary but looking forward to primaries in Ohio and Texas on March 4, issued a 12-page compendium of her economic policies that emphasizes programs aiding families stressed by high oil prices, home foreclosures, costly student loans and soaring health care premiums.
 In public appearances here and in her economic booklet, she took aim at hedge fund managers, oil company profits, drug company subsidies and trade agreements that she says encourage companies to export jobs.
 Mrs. Clinton told an audience that the Wisconsin primary and subsequent contests were ''a chance for all of you here to help take our country back.'' 
 ''We need tax breaks for the middle class, not for the wealthy and the well-connected,'' she said Monday morning at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wis. ''We're going to rein in the special interests and get the $55 billion in giveaways and subsidies they've gotten under Republicans back into your pockets.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton referred to the ''two oilmen in the White House'' and repeated her call for a windfall-profits tax on the oil industry to finance a $50 billion program to develop alternate energy sources and create ''green jobs.''
 Campaigning in Ohio before flying to Wisconsin for an election-eve rally, Mr. Obama said the wealthy had ''made out like bandits'' under the Bush administration and called for an end to tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas. 
 ''In the last year alone,'' Mr. Obama said, ''93 plants have closed in this state. And yet, year after year, politicians in Washington sign trade agreements that are riddled with perks for big corporations but have absolutely no protections for American workers. It's bad for our economy; it's bad for our country.''
 The two candidates' tone was driven in part by the prospect of a recession, which has in recent weeks shifted the focus of the presidential contest from war and terrorism to concerns much closer to home: jobs, foreclosures, energy and health care costs.
 It also reflected the dynamics and calendar of the Democratic race over the next two weeks. Ohio looms particularly large for both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton because it is experiencing many of the troubles afflicting the economy over all. 
 Mrs. Clinton is fighting to hold on to the lower- and middle-income voters and those with a high school education or less, who formed the core of her support in earlier contests but who began to drift away last week in primaries in Virginia and Maryland. This effort is vital to her success against Mr. Obama in Ohio.
 Both are maneuvering to win the endorsement of John Edwards, who dropped out of the presidential race late last month after running on an explicitly populist message. And both are adjusting their public statements to appeal to his slice of the electorate, including union members.
 Associates of Mr. Edwards said it remained an open question whether he would declare his support for one of his former rivals. Mrs. Clinton met with Mr. Edwards earlier this month, and Mr. Obama met with him Sunday.
 ''I think he has a lot of credibility,'' Mr. Obama said Monday, ''and so we would love to have his support.'' 
 Ever since Mr. Clinton's election as president in 1992, the Democratic Party has been divided over how to balance economic policy between initiatives intended to promote economic growth and those intended to help workers. Mr. Clinton entered the White House as a supporter of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council's stance that the party could not be antibusiness, and his signature economic policies were deficit reduction, trade expansion, tax credits to promote work and tighter restrictions on welfare.
 But the ups and downs of the economy since then and two terms of President Bush's policies have shifted the center of gravity within the party. Mrs. Clinton has consistently focused on issues like income inequality in her presidential campaign, has proposed steps to help homeowners hurt by the turmoil in the mortgage markets and has called for a timeout in negotiating new trade deals.
 But she has also sought, often successfully, to win support and campaign contributions from an array of business leaders, including John J. Mack, the chairman of Morgan Stanley and one of the Republican Party's biggest fund-raisers. And she infuriated many liberals last year when she told an audience at the Yearly Kos convention of bloggers that she would continue to take contributions from lobbyists because they ''represent real Americans.'' 
 Mr. Obama has laid out an economic agenda that is broadly similar to Mrs. Clinton's. But until recently, he was the target of criticism from some liberals for not being more outspoken about what they see as the deficiencies in the nation's trade policies. For the last week, though, facing tough battles in the Midwest, Mr. Obama has been emphasizing the economic upheaval that trade deals have brought to communities in Wisconsin and Ohio, and he has sought in particular to put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive over Nafta, the North American trade pact signed into law by Mr. Clinton.
 Still, both candidates appear to be looking for ways to avoid taking positions that would give them problems in the general election or expose them to a business backlash. 
 Before leaving Ohio, Mr. Obama met with workers at a titanium plant near Youngstown, where he renewed his call for corporations to be ''patriot employers,'' creating good jobs with full benefits for American workers. 
 ''Revolutions in communication and technology have made it easier for companies to send jobs wherever labor is cheapest, and that's something that cannot be reversed,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So I'm not going to stand here and say that we can stop every job from going overseas. I don't believe that we can -- or should -- stop free trade.''
 Mrs. Clinton has been critical in her presidential campaign of the way Nafta was carried out, and she has called for an overhaul of the program that helps workers who lose their jobs due to trade and for an end to any tax incentives for companies that move jobs abroad. 
 At an event Monday at a union hall in Wausau, Mrs. Clinton said that other countries had taken advantage of the Bush administration's pro-trade policies.
 ''I'm tired of being played for a patsy,'' Mrs. Clinton said at the hall. ''We have the largest market in the world. It's time we said to the rest of the world, 'If you want to have anything to do with our market, you have to play by our rules.' ''
 Mrs. Clinton also pushed her people-versus-the-powerful message in television advertisements over the weekend in Wisconsin. ''The oil companies, the drug companies have had seven years of a president who stands up for them,'' she says, looking into the camera. ''It's time we had a president who stands up for all of you.''
 At rallies and in door-to-door campaigning in Ohio, Mr. Obama distributed a soft-cover book, ''Keeping America's Promise,'' outlining details of his proposals to provide relief to families hit by the housing crisis, high energy prices and declining wages.
 He delivered a blistering critique of corporations that he said had benefited to the detriment of working families across the United States over the last seven years.
 ''We now have greater income inequality than any time since the Great Depression,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking to reporters after touring the titanium plant. ''For us to want to reverse that so everyone has a stake in the economy, I think is just common sense and good for everybody, including business.''
 A crowd of more than 6,000 people in Youngstown cheered wildly when Mr. Obama responded to criticism from Mrs. Clinton that he delivers speeches, not solutions.
 ''One thing I do have to say about Senator Clinton -- she says speeches don't put food on the table,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Well, you know what? Nafta didn't put food on the table either.''

HEADLINE: In Turkey, Is Tension About Religion? Class? Or Both?

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: ISTANBUL 

 BODY:
When two women in Islamic head scarves were spotted in an Italian restaurant in this city's new shopping mall this month, Gulbin Simitcioglu did a double take. 
 Covered women, long seen as backward peasants from the countryside, ''have started to be everywhere,'' said Ms. Simitcioglu, a sales clerk in an Italian clothing store, and it is making women like her more than a little uncomfortable. ''We are Turkey's image. They are ruining it.''
 As Turkey lurches toward a repeal of a ban on head scarves at universities, the country's secular upper middle class is feeling increasingly threatened. 
 Religious Turks, once the underclass of society here, have become educated and middle class, and are moving into urban spaces that were once the exclusive domain of the elite. Now the repeal of the scarf ban -- pressed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, passed by Parliament and now just awaiting an official signature -- is again setting the groups against each other, unleashing fears that have as much to do with class rivalry as with the growing influence of Islam. 
 While the public debate here typically revolves around Islam and how much space it should have in Turkish society -- a legitimate concern in a country whose population is overwhelmingly Muslim and deeply conservative -- the struggle over power is a glaring, if often unspoken, part of the tension between the groups. Secular women at parties speak disdainfully of covered women and the neighborhoods they populate. Older people shake their heads and cluck their tongues at them. High school boys yell, ''Go back to Iran.''
 Adamantly secular Turks ''don't encounter them as human beings,'' said Atilla Yayla, a Turkish political philosophy professor teaching in England, referring to religious Turks. ''They want them to evaporate, to disappear as fast as possible.''
 That attitude surfaced with the repeal of the ban by Parliament this month.
 One professor declared bluntly that universities should ''close the gates until the administrators of the country come back to their senses.'' Another argued that covered students could cheat by using cellphone headsets under their scarves. The worry, secular Turks said, was that covered women in universities would soon graduate and expect to wear their scarves in civil service jobs, transforming the Turkish state from secular to religious. 
 ''I wasn't sure before but now I am sure,'' said a 32-year-old lawyer in a Starbucks in a fashionable Istanbul neighborhood. ''Their real intent is to bring Shariah.'' 
 Turks who support lifting the ban have drawn analogies with school integration in the United States. In a speech to Parliament, Nursuna Memecan, a deputy from Mr. Erdogan's party, referred to a 1957 photograph of a white girl shouting at a black student entering Little Rock Central High School, highlighting the girl's apology decades later. 
 ''There is a reaction that we may regret,'' Ms. Memecan said. She said fears about growing religiosity were groundless. Observant Turks are not growing in numbers, she said. They have always been there but were not visible in educated society.
 ''We weren't sitting with them on planes,'' she said. ''They didn't go to our restaurants. We have to learn to share the cake with them.''
 Hasan Bulent Kahraman, a professor at Sabanci University in Istanbul, said: ''Cleaning ladies are all in head scarves, and no one says anything. But if a judge wants to cover her head, the problem is triggered.''
 Turkey is different from the United States, secular Turks argue. The fight here is not about skin color, but a religious belief that seeks to impose an ideology, they say. Islam dictates rules for daily life, many of them limiting for women, and secular women argue that Islam's growth in Turkey will inevitably lead to a society that is less free for women. 
 ''To associate the head scarf with freedom sounds a little cynical,'' said Ayse Bugra, a political economist at Bogazici University in Istanbul, ''since it is clearly about limiting the way in which a woman can appear in public.'' Women are ''clearly inferior,'' in Islam, whose rules limit inheritance for women and allow men multiple wives, she argued, pointing out that Turkey's president, Abdullah Gul, at the age of 30, met his wife, Hayrunnisa, when she was just 14.
 ''If you ask her, did she choose freely to wear the head scarf? She'd say 'yes.' What does that mean?'' 
 Turkey is one of the world's most permissive Muslim societies, a result, in part, of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's secular revolution, which began in the 1920s. Only 10 percent of the population was literate at the time, and a secular elite took control of religion and gave women rights. But years passed, and observant Turks became educated and wealthy, without losing their religion, traveling abroad and taking part in politics, forming a new Islamic elite in large Western cities, where they mixed with their secular counterparts.
 But for women in scarves, fancy neighborhoods can be intimidating. Muazzez Yildiz, a 30-year-old candy shop clerk in a pink tunic and polka dot scarf, said she felt, ''inferior, uncomfortable, self-conscious,'' in areas where she is the only woman in a scarf. 
 That is, in part, because covered and uncovered women from past generations did not socialize with one another, said Hediye Kose, 24, as she sliced bread in a bakery. Covered women are now far more integrated into the general society than their mothers, working in the city and even going to university. 
 ''Most of the head scarf women are doing something that their mothers didn't,'' said Nil Mutluer, a lecturer at Kadir Has University in Istanbul. ''There is a change in the society. How do we define what is modern? We need to rethink these terms.''
 Indeed, the strongest reactions to the ban seem to come from older Turks. In a middle class neighborhood on the Asian side of the city, an elderly artist yelled at an older, covered woman in a pharmacy, blaming her -- and her scarf -- for the country's troubles. Ms. Kose said the women who scold her for wearing a scarf tend to be over the age of 60.
 A sizable portion of Turkey's secular society is uncomfortable limiting liberties, including wearing head scarves, but does not trust Mr. Erdogan to work as hard for other communities as he does for the religious one. Turkey does not have a tradition of tolerance, and secular Turks are afraid that religious Turks, now settling deeply into the bureaucracy, will change the laws and wield power to benefit themselves.
 ''An Islamic way of thinking can bring its own authoritarianism,'' said Burhan Senatalar, a professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul. Society has already grown more religious, he argued, pointing out that special state-run religious schools -- strongly supported by Mr. Erdogan's party -- have been allowed to flourish. Mr. Erdogan himself comes from a background of political Islam, and memories of his sharp Islamic talk from the 1990s have left secular Turks deeply suspicious of his motives. 
 Still, the fear of what might occur in the future is not a reason to keep the ban on head scarves, said Yildiray Ogur, an editor at Taraf, a liberal daily newspaper. 
 ''I don't see any real arguments,'' he said. '' 'I'm afraid, so I'm right.' This is the motto'' of the adamantly secular class in Turkey now. He added: ''You are afraid of totalitarianism, but you can support it today in order to prevent it in the future.''
 Meanwhile, universities across Turkey are preparing for the final approval of the ban's repeal, which will go into effect after Mr. Gul signs it into law this week. Faruk Karadogan, the rector of Istanbul Technical University, said he was expecting confusion. 
 ''The problem is not the scarf; it's their way of thinking, their minds,'' he said of observant Turks. ''If you have somebody brainwashed like that, it's very hard to get her back to a way of contemporary thinking.''
 But a few buildings away, Ece Ulgen, 20, a chemistry student whose classmates include covered women (they wear hats or wigs), offered a different view.
 ''I have many friends who wear the head scarf,'' she said. ''I enjoy their friendship. They're clever, smart women. Not like what people say: Unscientific and only interested in religion.''

In large cities like Istanbul, observant Muslims mix with their secular counterparts. A scarf ban at colleges is to be repealed. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CAROLYN DRAKE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Supernova!

BYLINE: CATHERINE HUTCHINGS and ANDREA BROTHMAN


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students review and discuss images of supernova remnants, then research and diagram the formation of supernovas and study why they are important to astronomers' understanding of the universe. 

 BODY:
Overview: In this lesson, students review and discuss images of supernova remnants, then research and diagram the formation of supernovas and study why they are important to astronomers' understanding of the universe. Finally, students will submit further questions they have about supernovas to an "Ask an Astronomer" Web site.
Author(s):
Catherine Hutchings, The New York Times Learning Network
Andrea Brothman, Bank Street College of Education in New York
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour.
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Review and discuss time-elapsed images of supernova remnants.
2. Learn about a new astronomical observatory being established near the South Pole by reading and discussing the article "Long Nights, 90 Below. What More Could Astronomers Want?"
3. Research and diagram the life cycle of stars, including the evolution of supernovas.
4. Use an "Ask an Astronomer" Web sites to find answers to additional questions about supernovas and their implications.
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils/markers
-classroom board
-student journals
-copies of the article "Long Nights, 90 Below. What More Could Astronomers Want?," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080219tuesday.html (one per student)
-time-elapsed images of before and after a supernova for students to view, like the ones found on the Anglo-Australian Observatory Web site (http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/aat050.html), or in NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day Archive, "SN 2005ap: The Brightest Supernova Yet Found" (http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap071016.html)
-materials to diagram the life cycle of a star -research materials on supernovas (books, articles, magazines, Internet access)
Activities / Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do Now: Before to class, prepare time-elapsed images of before and after a supernova for students to view, like the ones found on the Anglo-Australian Observatory Web site (http://www.aao.gov.au/images/captions/aat050.html), or in NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day Archive, "SN 2005ap: The Brightest Supernova Yet Found" (http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap071016.html).
As they enter class, have students review the images and respond to the following prompt, written on the board, in their journals: "What do you notice about the images? What do you think they depict? How do you think astronomers took these pictures? What might they hope to learn from them?"
After a few minutes, review and discuss the images as a class. Discuss students' previous knowledge about stars and the universe. Explain that some astronomers conduct research by using telescopic images to view changes in the universe. Explain that the next activity is to read an article about a new observatory being established near the South Pole and the images that scientists hope it will capture.
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Long Nights, 90 Below. What More Could Astronomers Want?" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080219tuesday.html), focusing on the following questions:
a. How do the geography and weather conditions at Dome Argus make the site "nearly as good as space"?
b. What do astronomers hope to study at Plato?
c. What is the affect of atmospheric turbulence on telescopic images?
d. What does Dr. Carl Pennypacker mean when he says that the scientists' goal is to "grab low-hanging fruit"?
e. Why do you think China is beginning to invest more funds in scientific research like the astronomy station in Antarctica?
f. What might scientists hope to learn by drilling "into the 10,000 feet of ancient ice that sits beneath the Plato observatory"?
g. Why will the "quartet of telescopes known as Cstar" view the same part of the sky through different filters?
h. What is the advantage of taking measurements every 10 seconds for four months to scientists studying supernovas?
i. What effect does Dr. Lifan Wang believe the Plato project may have on the field of stellar astronomy in the United States, and why? j. Why will astronomers be able to use smaller telescopes at Plato and why is this advantageous?
k. What aspects of supernovas are still a mystery, and why?
3. Write the following central question on the board: "What are supernovas, and why are they important?" Remind students that one goal of astronomers at the Plato observatory is to learn more about the explosion of stars, or supernovas. Explain that stars, even though they are not living, follow an observable "life cycle." Supernovas are one stage in the life cycle of some, but not all, stars. Students will be reviewing resources to learn more about the life cycle of stars and the formation of supernovas.
Divide students into small groups and provide each group with the following guidelines and questions (copied into a handout):
TASK:
Use all available resources, including suggested images and interactive features, textbooks, articles and additional online resources, to diagram the sequence of events in the evolution of Type Ia and Type II supernovas.
KEY CONCEPTS:
Diagrams should include the following key concepts through the use of labels, illustrations or text boxes:
-identification and definition of key terms, including nebula, main sequence star, red giant, blue giant, white dwarf, nova, supernova, neutron star and black hole
-explanation of the internal nuclear fusion reactions that occur within stars
-understanding of the relationship between the size of a star's core, its rate of evolution and its ultimate fate
GUIDING QUESTIONS:
-What are the main stages in the life cycle of stars and how do they evolve over time?
-What reactions take place within the core of stars?
-How happens to stars when they "die"? How is their fate determined?
-What are supernovas? How do they form and what is left after the explosion? -How are Type Ia and Type II supernovas similar and different?
-Why are supernovas important to astronomers' understanding of the universe?
Depending on available technology, provide each group with one or more of the following resources on the life cycle of stars as a starting point for discussion and further research:
-Life Cycle of Stars Image, like one available at NASA's Imagine the Universe Web site (http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/teachers/lifecycles/stars.html)
-Access to the Chandra X-ray Observatory Resources "Interactive Guide to Stellar Evolution" (http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/misc/special_features.html) -Access to the "Build Your Own Star" Virtual Experiment, available online at http://www.seed.slb.com/en/scictr/lab/byo_star/byostar.htm. (If using this interactive feature, make sure students understand that a neutron star is formed following a supernova. Students' goal should be to identify how the mass and metals content of stars affect its evolution.)
When students have completed their diagrams, have them display them around the room for the whole class to review. Then, have the class discuss the value of the Plateau Observatory to astronomers' understanding of the universe. Ask students what the value of the scientific research to be conducted at Plato might be, and why. Other questions to ask: Why are supernovas important to scientists' understanding of the expansion of the universe? What further questions do you have about supernovas and how scientists view and analyze data from supernovas? What else do you want to know about the implications of supernovas to our understanding of the expansion of the universe and Big Bang Theory? Record students' questions on the board.
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students select a question from the board for further research. Using one of the "Ask an Astronomer" Web sites (http://www.ucolick.org/~mountain/AAA/http://www.ucolick.org/~mountain/AAA/, http://curious.astro.cornell.edu, http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_kids/AskKids/index.shtml, or http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/qanda.html), students seek an answer to their question by searching previously asked questions. Questions that have not been previously asked should be researched using another site. After reviewing the information given, students write and submit a thoughtful follow-up question seeking clarification on an aspect that is not clear or understood.
In a later class period, have students share answers to questions.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-Should governments continue to fund astronomical research? Why or why not?
-What do you know about telescopes in use by astronomers today?
-How has the study of astronomy changed over the past 1,000 years?
-What evidence do supernovas provide about the expansion of the universe and the existence of dark energy?
-How can astronomers tell when a supernova happened? How can they determine how far away it occurred?
-What is the advantage of collecting images of supernovas as they occur, one objective of the Plato observatory, over viewing remnants of past supernovas only?
-How are we affected by supernovas? What evidence do supernovas provide about the fate of the universe?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in the initial exercise, thoughtful participation and discussion of the article, diagram of a star life cycle and thoughtful creation and submission of further questions to an astronomer for homework.

HEADLINE: Tax Inquiry? Principality Is Offended

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER and MARK LANDLER; Eric Pfanner reported from Vaduz, Liechtenstein, and Mark Landler from Frankfurt. Carter Dougherty contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

DATELINE: VADUZ, Liechtenstein 

 BODY:
It's not exactly the ''mouse that roared,'' though maybe the mouse that resisted. 
 After weathering days of criticism from Germany over a spectacular tax evasion case, Liechtenstein -- sometimes seen as the inspiration for the satirical novel from the 1950s about a tiny Alpine principality that declared war on the United States -- is digging in for what may be a prolonged battle to defend its lucrative tradition of banking secrecy against what it views as attacks from a giant neighbor.
 In a defiant news conference on Tuesday, Liechtenstein's crown prince, Alois, said his country would take legal steps to protect banking clients from German investigators, who have begun a campaign to expose wealthy Germans suspected of hiding money here to avoid paying taxes. 
 Wealth management has been a lucrative business for Liechtenstein, turning it from a rural backwater into a financial center. Its 35,000 citizens have a per-capita income listed as the fourth highest by the World Bank, which does not provide a figure and says the ranking is approximate. 
 ''We are a small country dependent on friendly neighborly relations,'' Crown Prince Alois said in Vaduz, the sleepy capital. ''But we are also a sovereign state and, we hope, do not live in an era when might makes right rather than international law and international agreements.''
 Branded as an uncooperative tax haven by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a 30-nation group that includes most of the richest countries, Liechtenstein tried to seize the moral high ground by focusing on the disclosure that Germany's intelligence service had paid an unnamed informant for stolen banking data.
 ''Such actions would be legally unthinkable in Liechtenstein and many other nations,'' Crown Prince Alois said. ''Here, fiscal interests cannot be placed ahead of the rule of law.'' 
 The criticism of the Berlin government's methods was echoed by lawyers in Germany, with some predicting that the courts would not admit data from a stolen computer disk as trial evidence. ''Of course, we know that secret services pay for information,'' said Eberhard Kempf, a leading defense lawyer. ''But in this case, to pay for stolen data to be used in a legal case is unthinkable.''
 Liechtenstein's royal family spoke out as the government and the financial industry here tried to contain the fallout from the German investigation. Prosecutors in Germany widened their net, with raids on the Munich offices of Dresdner Bank and UBS.
 They also issued an arrest warrant for a brother of Klaus Zumwinkel, the former chief executive of the German postal system, according to German news reports. Mr. Zumwinkel resigned his post last Friday, after becoming the first prominent target of the crackdown. 
 Bankers in Liechtenstein say they have been calling clients to reassure them about the security of their accounts, even as it emerged that the information being used by the German investigators probably stemmed from a data theft six years ago at the LGT Group, a bank owned by the royal family.
 Prosecutors in Liechtenstein said they thought that the data had been stolen by a former employee, who worked at the bank in 2001 and 2002. They did not say whether he passed the information to Germany. People close to the bank identified him as Heinrich Kieber. 
 On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's said it had revised its outlook for LGT to negative from stable because of ''risks to the bank's reputation from an investigation by German fiscal authorities.''
 In Vaduz, residents seemed nonplused by the German, Swiss and Austrian television news crews swarming their tidy streets, and were concerned over the threat to their little country's privileged position.
 The capital, a mixture of farmhouses and marble-and-glass bank blocks, may seem like an unlikely trove of wealth. BMWs are sometimes followed down the main street by tractors pulling loads of manure. 
 As other tax havens have been shut down or persuaded to adopt global standards, Liechtenstein has thrived. Assets at banks based in the country, which uses the Swiss franc as its currency, have risen to about 200 billion Swiss francs ($182.8 billion) from about 67 billion in 1996, according to the banking association.
 And that does not include assets held in foundations like those at the center of the German investigations.
 German officials said they expect these matters to be raised in a meeting Wednesday in Berlin between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Liechtenstein's prime minister, Otmar Hasler.
 Liechtenstein argues that it is moving toward a more cooperative stance. Its representative at the European Union, Prince Nikolaus, said the principality was negotiating an agreement with the authorities in Brussels that would help stem cross-border financial fraud.
 Prince Nikolaus, who is the uncle of Crown Prince Alois, said Liechtenstein is in the process of adopting a new law to make it harder to disguise the owners of foundations. Many foreigners set up foundations in Liechtenstein to shield their money from tax collectors.
 ''We are moving, but of course we don't like to be bullied,'' Prince Nikolaus said in a telephone interview.
 Liechtenstein said it had cooperated with the German authorities in several criminal investigations. 
 ''It's not true that we don't do anything about taxes,'' said Michael Lauber, chief executive of the Liechtenstein Bankers Association. 
 But while bankers and public officials say they are willing to be flexible, they are standing firm on their commitment to secrecy in all but the most unusual cases.
 And while Crown Prince Alois used strong language in responding to the Germans, it is not clear which country is the underdog in the battle over banking secrecy.
 Because Liechtenstein is not a member of the European Union, the leverage that its neighbors can bring to bear is limited. Unlike Switzerland, it has few international companies whose dealings could be penalized by governments seeking to bring it into line on tax matters.
 Bankers here say that may explain why Germany is mounting so public a campaign: It may be trying to frighten its own citizens into pulling their money back into taxable accounts at home.
 LGT has been moving to diversify its business, attracting more onshore business in Germany and Asia to reduce its reliance on money hidden from prying tax authorities.
 An executive close to LGT said that offshore funds from German clients represented less than 10 percent of the bank's roughly 100 billion Swiss francs ($91.4 billion) in Liechtenstein-based assets under management.
 Crown Prince Alois said the German ''media campaign'' against Liechtenstein could backfire because it could cause people here to dig in their heels.
 ''Apparently the German administration,'' he said, ''still does not understand how to deal with countries that understand direct democracy.''

HEADLINE: Housing Slowdown Hits Towns At the Outskirts of Texas Boom

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

DATELINE: LAVON, Tex. 

 BODY:
Once little more than a speed trap 25 miles northeast of Dallas, this town started to boom about a year ago, as turreted stone castlettes and modest brick bungalows began springing up in what had been wheat fields.
 Big Dallas seemed to be knocking on little Lavon's door. Thousands of lots were laid out and hundreds of houses built, as developers tried to meet what seemed to be an insatiable appetite for inexpensive single-family homes. Land values soared, the population hit 2,500, and by November, the city was finally flush enough to afford a full-time police department.
 But that was when the knocking stopped. Banks were no longer giving mortgages to anyone who could fog a mirror. ''For sale'' signs went up and stayed up. Weeds, not houses, sprouted on the scraped-earth plots.
 And now the city government, which had counted on years of growth, is short of money. Plans for a new City Hall have been suspended, street paving jobs have been postponed, and there is even the prospect that programs and personnel will be cut, said J. Michael Jones, the city marshal and chief administrator. 
 ''I say that very quietly,'' Mr. Jones added, ''because I don't want to panic our citizens or our employees.''
 Unlike many other states with housing troubles, Texas as a whole is booming, continuing to attract new residents and create jobs. But across the state's outermost exurbs, formed by waves of new housing, building has ground almost to a halt. 
 These were not towns built on the speculation that soaring home prices would continue forever, like many developments in Florida and on the West Coast. These bedroom communities of bedroom communities were built because land was cheap, jobs were plentiful and mortgage rates were low. But now, in some of the fastest-growing counties in the country, home to places with names like Venus, Ponder and Fate, building permits dropped by as much as 40 percent last year, often on top of declines in late 2006. 
 ''It's slowed down pretty much everywhere,'' said Jimmie C. Honea, chief appraiser for Collin County, which in addition to Lavon includes much bigger towns and cities like McKinney, Plano and Wylie. 
 There are other signs of trouble. Home sales, which had been holding up well across the state last year, started to fall sharply in the fall, and by December they were down almost 20 percent in Austin, Houston and San Antonio, and about 25 percent in Dallas and Fort Worth. 
 And foreclosures, generally high in North Texas, hit record levels this month, according to Foreclosure Listing Service in Addison, a suburb of Dallas. When the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development sent out letters on Feb. 8 offering help to homeowners in areas ''experiencing a disturbing home foreclosure rate,'' Texas was third on the list after California and Florida.
 This weakness is all the more striking because of the state's continuing growth. Texas has been attracting far more new residents than any other state, according to the Census Bureau, which reports that the state's population increased by half a million in the year that ended July 1. Dallas added 65,800 jobs last year, more than any other city in the nation except New York; Houston was No. 3. 
 But even Texas cannot escape the consequences of a housing boom that has gone bust.
 It is faring better than other states with deep economic woes, like Michigan, or those where housing prices soared to speculative levels, like Florida. So far, the price of houses here has remained relatively firm, and is increasing in well-established (and expensive) areas like Highland Park, which abuts Dallas, said James P. Gaines, a research economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. 
 Outside those older areas, however, builders have responded quickly to the slowdown, cutting new construction to the lowest level in a decade and selling their inventories, said Edward L. Wilson Jr., a partner at Residential Strategies Inc., a consulting firm in Dallas. While that may make good business sense, it is bad news for the communities that were banking on growth. 
 The Rev. Clinton R. Bratcher, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Lavon, said that his congregation was providing more emergency financial aid for workers who used to build houses in town. And financial stress is causing more families to seek his help, Mr. Bratcher said. ''Preachers are free and available,'' he said, ''so we do a lot of counseling.''
 Those financial stresses extend to the city government. Building permits, which were projected to provide almost a third of the city's $1.7 million in revenues, recently plunged from 25 to 30 a month to zero or one, said Mr. Jones, the city marshal. 
 Slower growth also affects how much money the city makes on things like trash collection, Mr. Jones said, not to mention property and sales taxes. (Lavon only recently got its first chain store, an everything-for-a-dollar place.) City officials are bracing for a revenue shortfall of several hundred thousand dollars, but if it reaches $500,000, ''it would be devastating,'' Mr. Jones said.
 Driving around Lavon, he described how far the city had come from just a few years ago, when it could not afford to hire anyone to fix its mostly gravel roads and had to hold volunteer ''patching parties.''
 Now most roads are paved. Thanks to developers, Lavon has a police station and trucks for the volunteer fire department, and the first new public school in decades is under construction behind a new subdivision. And Mr. Jones has big dreams -- for a gazebo, for more green space, even for a grocery store to save residents the five-mile drive to the Wal-Mart in Wylie. 
 He also would like to rescue the old City Hall, once a school built by the W.P.A. in 1939; it was closed to the public last year after he fell through the floor. And he wants to get more people hooked up to the sewer system, which now serves only the biggest development, Grand Heritage.
 All that will take more money, and therefore more new residents. Optimism is part of every developer's DNA, of course, but builders express confidence in the future of Grand Heritage. Bowen Family Homes plans to start building again ''real soon,'' said William Hoot, comptroller of the company's Texas operations and a resident of Grand Heritage. 
 And Paul S. Cheng, whose World Land Developers created Grand Heritage, is sticking by his long-term forecast of 5,000 or more new houses, filled with residents attracted by the subdivision's baronial ''amenities center,'' complete with several pools and a splash park.
 But even those who most appreciate Lavon's charms may find it hard to buy there right now, especially if they have to sell a home first. Mr. Jones, the city marshal, said he needed to sell his house in Wylie if he was to achieve another dream, that of living in Grand Heritage.
 ''The slowdown in the housing market,'' he said, ''impacts my ability to move back to Lavon.''

HEADLINE: Making Economics Matter Again

 BODY:
It was only a decade ago that economics seemed to be an old and tired discipline. The field no longer had intellectual giants like John Maynard Keynes or Milton Friedman who were shaping public policy by the sheer force of their ideas. Instead, it was devolving into a technical discipline that was even less comprehensible than it was relevant. 
 Some Wall Street firms had become hesitant to hire Ph.D. economists, and the number of undergraduates majoring in the subject was plummeting. ''A good deal of modern economic theory,'' John Cassidy wrote in an article titled ''The Decline of Economics'' that appeared in The New Yorker in 1996, ''simply doesn't matter much.'' 
 Over the last decade, however, economics has begun to get its groove back. Armed with newly powerful tools for analyzing data, economists have dug into real-world matters and tried to understand human behavior. Economists have again become storytellers, and, again, they matter. 
 They have explained why Americans don't save enough money -- and come up with clever ideas to increase savings. They have discovered that modest increases in the minimum wage don't actually destroy many jobs -- and thus made possible the recent state-by-state push to raise minimum wages. Since the mid-1990s, the number of undergraduates majoring in economics has risen sharply. But there are more than a few economists who believe that the renaissance has come with a big downside. They argue that the new research often consists of cute findings -- which inevitably get covered in the press -- about trivial subjects, like game shows, violent movies or sports gambling. Economics may be popular again, but there still is no one like a modern-day Milton Friedman or John Maynard Keynes.
 So when I recently set out to conduct my second annual survey of economists, I decided to try to uncover the next best thing. In its first incarnation, the survey simply asked for the names of the next generation of stars specializing in the economics of everyday life. This year, though, I went the other way -- toward the big picture -- and asked which economists were managing to do influential work on the crucial questions facing modern society.
 Who, in other words, was using economics to make the world a better place?
 I received dozens of diverse responses, but there was still a runaway winner. The small group of economists who work at the Jameel Poverty Action Lab at M.I.T., led by Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, were mentioned far more often than anyone else. 
 Ms. Duflo, Mr. Banerjee and their colleagues have a simple, if radical, goal. They want to overhaul development aid so that more of it is spent on programs that actually make a difference. And they are trying to do so in a way that skirts the long-running ideological debate between aid groups and their critics.
 ''Surely the most important societal question economics can help answer is why so many people are crushingly poor and what can be done about it,'' David Romer, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said. The macro issues (like how to build a democracy) remain maddeningly complex, Mr. Romer noted. But thanks in part to the poverty lab, we now know much more about how to improve daily life in the world's poorest countries.
 The basic idea behind the lab is to rely on randomized trials -- similar to the ones used in medical research -- to study antipoverty programs. This helps avoid the classic problem with the evaluation of aid programs: it's often impossible to separate cause and effect. If aid workers start supplying textbooks to schools in one town and the students there start doing better, it could be because of the textbooks. Or it could be that the town also happened to hire a new school administrator. 
 In a randomized trial, researchers would choose a set of schools and then separate into them two groups. The groups would be similar in every respect except for the fact that one would receive new textbooks and one wouldn't. With a test like this, as Vinod Thomas, the head of independent evaluation at the World Bank, says, ''You can be much more accurate and much more clear about the effect of a program.''
 The approach can sound cruel, because researchers knowingly deny help to some of the people they're studying. But what, really, is the alternative? It's not as if someone has offered to buy new textbooks for every child in the world. With a randomized study, you at least learn whether your aid money is well spent.
 Ms. Duflo, who's 35, and Mr. Banerjee, 46, came to economics from opposite ends of the intellectual spectrum. She was studying history at the Ecole Normale Superieure, one of the most prestigious colleges in France, when she decided that the more scientific approach of economics offered a better way to address global poverty. He dropped out of the similarly prestigious Indian Statistical Institute after two and a half months of studying math; he found the subject too abstract.
 By 2003, they were both working on development at M.I.T. At the time, randomized trials were becoming more popular in the United States, but they were still fairly rare in the developing world. So along with Sendhil Mullainathan, a colleague, Ms. Duflo and Mr. Banerjee founded the lab. (It's named for the father of an M.I.T. alumnus, who owned the exclusive right to sell Toyotas in Saudi Arabia.) Day to day, the lab is now run by Rachel Glennerster, who came from the International Monetary Fund, and it has become a magnet for some of the world's best development economists, including Marianne Bertrand, Michael Kremer and Edward Miguel.
 Mr. Kremer and two other economists, in fact, did the textbook experiment -- and found that textbooks didn't improve test scores or graduation rates in rural western Kenya. (The students were probably too diverse, in terms of preparation and even language, to be helped by a single curriculum.) On the other hand, another randomized trial in the same part of Kenya found that treating children for intestinal worms did lift school performance. That study has led to an expansion of deworming programs and, as Alan Krueger of Princeton says, is ''probably improving millions of lives.''
 Mr. Banerjee estimates, very conservatively, that $11 billion a year -- out of roughly $100 billion in annual development aid worldwide -- could be spent on programs that have been proved to work. Unfortunately, nowhere near $11 billion is being spent on such programs. ''Right now, we don't have a lot of things that have been taken up by the policy world,'' he said. ''But the policy lag is usually substantial. Now that we have a lot more results, I expect that in the next 10 years we will have a lot more impact.''
 Mr. Banerjee and Ms. Duflo may not be a modern-day Keynes or Friedman. But they have still managed to do something rather profound. They have brought together the best of the new economics and the best of the old. 
 As has been the trend over the last decade, they have plunged into the world around them, refusing to accept the idea that economics is merely an extension of math. Yet no one can accuse them of working on some little problem that doesn't matter.

HEADLINE: Attack Iran, With Words

BYLINE: By REUEL MARC GERECHT. 
Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

 BODY:
Prague
 FOR those who believe -- as I do -- that the clerics who rule Iran must never have an arsenal of nuclear weapons, the United States' course of action ought to be clear: The Bush administration should advocate direct, unconditional talks between Washington and Tehran. Strategically, politically and morally, such meetings will help us think more clearly. Foreign-policy hawks ought to see such discussions as essential preparation for possible military strikes against clerical Iran's nuclear facilities. 
 The consensus among Iran's ruling elite is that a hard-line stance on the nuclear question has paid off: uranium enrichment, the most industrially demanding part of developing nuclear weapons, has rapidly advanced. And, unexpectedly and gratifyingly, the Bush administration's National Intelligence Estimate of November, which found that ''in fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program,'' damaged Western resolve to invoke economy-crippling sanctions, let alone the American threat to use force against Tehran. 
 And perhaps the best news for Iran: the unclassified ''key judgments'' of the intelligence estimate reveal that the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency did not -- and in all probability, still do not -- have human and technical sources inside the inner circles of the Iranian nuclear program. The mullahs, who are quite savvy about American intelligence, having made mincemeat of C.I.A. networks in the past, surely see this. The great American debate about what to do about Iran's nuclear capacity -- a debate that may divide Americans from Europeans more than Iraq -- could well return with a vengeance before next year. It will quickly bedevil the next administration. 
 Negotiations are likely the only way we can confront this threat before it's too late. The administration's current approach isn't working. For selfish and malevolent reasons, China and Russia will not back tough sanctions. Neither likely will the trade-obsessed Germans and the increasingly self-absorbed, America-leery British. Washington and Paris cannot play bad cop alone. We must find a way to restore the resolve of all those parties and hit Iran with a tsunami of sanctions if we are to diminish the victorious esprit in Tehran and the centrifuge production at Natanz. 
 Yet, what has been the response of most American hawks to this mess? Prayer. They are essentially waiting for the clerical regime to do something stupid so that they can galvanize an awareness among Americans that mullahs should not have the bomb. True, the Iranian clerics have often done the wrong thing at the right time, from aiding the bombers of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996 and our African embassies in 1998, to the kidnapping of British sailors and marines last year. It is possible that Tehran, which wants to cause us great harm in Iraq and Afghanistan, could again back a terrorist attack that kills enough Americans to make preventive military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities mandatory. 
 But the Iranians know this. They know they are in the final nuclear stretch: they will likely play it sufficiently cool to make it difficult for the United States to strike them pre-emptively. 
 Thus the best reason to offer to begin talks with Tehran is that the regime will almost certainly refuse any offer to normalize relations. In the late 1990s, President Bill Clinton almost begged Iran's reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, to sit and chat. The mullahs, who knew that Mr. Clinton was playing down Tehran's role in the Khobar Towers bombing, spurned the offer. Since then, Iran's internal politics have become more hard-core. In January, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's clerical overlord, re-rejected the idea, quite popular among average Iranians, that the Islamic Republic should re-establish relations with ''Satan Incarnate.'' 
 If the mullahs don't want to negotiate, fine: making the offer is something that must be checked off before the next president could unleash the Air Force and the Navy. To make the threat of force against clerical Iran again credible, there needs to be a consensus among far more Democrats and Republicans that a nuclear-armed Iran is intolerable. If the White House tried more energetically to find a diplomatic solution to the nuclear threat, if it demonstrated that it had reached out to Iranian ''pragmatists'' and ''moderates,'' and that again no one responded, then the military option would likely become convincing to more Americans. 
 Critics of any discussions might respond that the Iranians might say yes, but to only low-level talks in Switzerland, not in Washington and Tehran. In so doing, the mullahs could bind the United States to meaningless, stalling discussions while the regime perfected uranium enrichment, increased the range and accuracy of its ballistic missiles and advanced its nuclear warhead designs. 
 But so what? Minus the direct talks, this is more or less what is happening now. Would a President John McCain tolerate pointless discussions? Probably not. Would Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton? Perhaps. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton may well prefer to see the clerical regime go nuclear than strike it preventively. But if that is where they would go, their opponents can do little about it. The only thing that could conceivably change their minds would be direct talks on the big issues separating the two countries. The mullahs have a way of driving their foreign interlocutors nuts. Just ask the European negotiators who've had to deal with them. Meeting Iranian leaders is perhaps the best way to turn doves into hawks.
 For far too long, the United States has failed to wage a war of ideas with the Iranian regime over the proposal that scares them the most: the reopening of the American Embassy. Washington has the biggest bully pulpit in the world, and we are faced with a clerical foe that constantly rails against the intrusion of American values into the bloodstream of Iranian society. There are profound social, cultural and political differences among Iran's ruling elites, let alone between that class and ordinary Iranians. Some of these differences could conceivably have a major effect on the progress of Iran's nuclear-weapons program. And the way to make these differences increasingly acute is to apply American soft and hard power. 
 Ayatollah Khamenei needs to be put off balance, as he was in 1997 when Mr. Khatami unexpectedly tapped into a huge groundswell of popular discontent and became president. What we need now is a psychological repeat of 1997: a shock to the clerical system that again opens Iran to serious debate. 
 When dealing with the mullahs, it is always wise to follow the lead of one of Iran's most audacious clerical dissidents, former Interior Minister Abdallah Nuri. In 1999, he mocked the regime for its organic fear of the United States. Is the revolution's Islam so weak, he said, that it cannot sustain the restoration of relations with the United States?
 It would be riveting in Tehran -- and millions of Iranians would watch on satellite TV -- if Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice challenged the regime in this way: Islam is a great faith; the United States has relations with all Muslim nations except the Islamic Republic; we have diplomatic relations with Hugo Chavez and American diplomats in Havana. Why does the Islamic Republic fear us so? Is the regime so fragile? President Khatami repeatedly said that he wanted a ''dialogue of civilizations.'' The UnitedStates should finally say, ''O.K., let's start.'' 
 If the Bush administration were to use this sort of diplomatic jujitsu on the ruling clerics, it could convulse their world. No, this is absolutely no guarantee that Tehran will stop, or even suspend, uranium enrichment. But a new approach would certainly put the United States on offense and Iran on defense. We would, at least, have the unquestioned moral and political high ground. And from there, it would be a lot easier for the next administration, if it must, to stop militarily the mullahs' quest for the bomb.

HEADLINE: Warehouses Nibble on Edge of Giant California Ranch

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: LEBEC, Calif. 

 BODY:
Anyone who has traveled between Los Angeles and San Francisco along Interstate 5 has driven along the western flank of Tejon Ranch, a vast expanse of luminous oak-studded hills that divides the southern and central portions of the state.
 Occupying about 270,000 acres, or 426 square miles, Tejon Ranch, named for the Spanish word for badger, is the largest contiguous parcel of privately owned land in California. More than a century and a half after it was consolidated from four ranches created through Mexican land grants, Tejon is still a working farm and ranch, where cattle graze and wine grapes, almonds, pistachios and walnuts are grown.
 In recent years, however, as executives of the publicly held Tejon Ranch Company have sought to diversify the ranch's economic activity, three giant warehouses have sprouted near the freeway. The largest, with 1.7 million square feet, serves all of Ikea's furniture stores from San Diego to Vancouver.
 The warehouses are part of an industrial complex intended to compete with the distribution centers in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, east of Los Angeles, where foreign-made goods are trucked in from California ports and stored until they are delivered to retailers. 
 The latest addition is a 606,000-square-foot warehouse built in partnership with the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation of New York, a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Estate Company. Completed last week, the warehouse is being marketed to permanent tenants.
 Two residential projects are also in the pipeline. Tejon Mountain Village, a resort with a golf course and 3,400 luxury homes, is to be developed with DMB Associates of Scottsdale, Ariz.
 Farther to the south, in Los Angeles County, where one-fifth of the ranch is situated (the rest is in Kern County), the company is working with a group of home builders to develop a much larger residential project, called Centennial, which will eventually have 23,000 homes. Environmental impact reports on both projects will be submitted this year, ranch executives said.
 The executives say they have no further plans to carve up the ranch for development. And in 2003, they agreed to set aside 100,000 acres of wilderness, an area a little larger than Yosemite Valley, for preservation. ''That was our effort to say, 'We care, we've been good stewards, and we are prepared to make a commitment to conservation,' '' said Joseph E. Drew, a senior vice president.
 But many environmentalists say the agreement does not go far enough to protect a fragile landscape, where several distinct ecological regions converge. They have also raised concerns about air quality, the availability of water and the prospect that Centennial will turn into a bedroom community, extending Los Angeles's unmanageable sprawl to the Tehachapi Mountains.
 According to the Center for Biological Diversity, a Tucson-based group that unsuccessfully tried to block the planned expansion of the industrial park, the ranch is home to about 80 rare or endangered species, including the bald eagle, the California spotted owl and the California condor. Since the mid-1980s, when the condor was on the verge of extinction, the federal government has spent about $40 million to increase its population. 
 The Sierra Club has made conserving as much of Tejon Ranch as possible its top priority for the state, said Bill Corcoran, a senior regional representative. ''There is no other place like this in California,'' he said. ''It offers an unparalleled and irreplaceable connection between the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Ranges and the high desert.''
 What is needed is a conservation plan for the entire ranch, Mr. Corcoran said. ''We don't want to preserve a part of it without understanding the fate of all of it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Drew said it would be too costly to develop a master plan that would satisfy everyone. ''We trying to find a balance as best we can, for a publicly traded private company, to understand and accommodate some of those divergent views about what the future of the ranch should be,'' he said. 
 The ranch's management has the support of the Trust for Public Land, the national environmental group that worked on the 2003 agreement to preserve the 100,000 acres, including a 37,000-acre condor habitat and a 39-mile hiking trail. ''They take their resources seriously,'' said Reed Holderman, executive director of the California office.
 The trust will buy the land from Tejon Ranch for a price not disclosed yet and will subsequently convey it to government agencies and private donors. ''This will be one of the most significant acquisitions in the history of California,'' he said.
 By the time the conservation agreement was struck, the Tejon Industrial Complex was already well under way. In developing the industrial park, Tejon executives sought to take advantage of the ranch's location. It is about 110 miles north of the Port of Los Angeles and 277 miles south of the Port of Oakland, and not adjacent to a residential community, where homeowners might complain about around-the-clock operations, as they do in the so-called Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles.
 Each day, ranch executives say, 20,000 trucks and 79,000 other vehicles pass the ranch. Appropriately enough, one of the first occupants of the complex, in 1999, was a Petro Travel Plaza, where a truck driver can get his laundry done, visit a chiropractor, see a second-run movie, buy clothes or get an oil change.
 In the years since, about 2.3 million square feet of warehouse space has been developed, giving the ranch a foothold in a growing industry. As manufacturing jobs have disappeared, the United States has become increasingly dependent on imported goods, particularly from Asia, raising demand for huge warehouses.
 Driving this business is the need that retailers feel to keep their inventory current, said Barry G. Hibbard, a ranch vice president. ''Most of us take for granted that any product we want is always available,'' he said.
 Ranch officials say that Bakersfield, 38 miles to the northeast, provides a ready source of labor for distribution jobs, which are surprisingly well paying. 
 John Husing, a Redlands, Calif., economist who specializes in industries that move goods, said the pay was roughly comparable to manufacturing wages because of the sophisticated technology used to distribute merchandise. ''Sectors that become quite efficient tend to be sectors that pay better,'' Dr. Husing said. ''It's not a sector that people are dying to get into, you have to pay a little more to get people to do the work.''
 Yet when Ikea opened its warehouse in 2002, 13 people applied for every job, ranch officials said. The furniture retailer has since added 350,000 square feet in another warehouse that it shares with Oneida, a flatware and dish manufacturer, and will temporarily lease 400,000 feet in the new warehouse, Mr. Drew said.
 About one-third of the industrial park is expected to be designated a foreign trade zone. The designation allows manufacturers and distributors to defer duty payment and, in some cases, move the goods directly from the ports to the warehouses, avoiding long and costly delays.
 Mr. Hibbard said Tejon rents are a little cheaper than they are in the Inland Empire, and the road from the Port of Los Angeles is less congested, though the distance is greater. And there is another selling point, too. ''The reality is,'' Mr. Hibbard said, ''if you're trying to put up a one-million-square-foot building, there aren't that many places to do that in California.''

HEADLINE: N.B.A.'s Rules Provide a Payday For the Unretired

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
Keith Van Horn earned $4.3 million on Tuesday, for nothing more than a signature and a flight to New Jersey. Aaron McKie earned $750,000 a few weeks ago for a few pen strokes and a trip to Memphis.
 Retirement from the N.B.A. has never been so profitable. 
 In a league with a salary cap, a luxury tax and a collective bargaining agreement as thick as a bank-vault door, general managers occasionally need extreme measures to make a trade. Two recent blockbuster deals illustrate the point.
 The Dallas Mavericks could not have acquired Jason Kidd on Tuesday without Van Horn's participation as a trading chip sent to the Nets to balance salaries, per N.B.A. rules. Van Horn last played in 2006. The Los Angeles Lakers could not have acquired Pau Gasol from Memphis on Feb. 1 without using McKie -- who was working as a Philadelphia 76ers assistant coach -- in a similar sign-and-trade arrangement.
 McKie has yet to play a minute for the Grizzlies. It would be surprising if Van Horn plays for the Nets before his contract expires in June. They are virtual ghosts on their rosters, appearing in name only. (McKie's official page on NBA.com still shows him in a Lakers jersey.)
 To the general public, it looks like a shell game -- a feat of economic gymnastics that has nothing to do with basketball or the wisdom of a particular trade. And that is essentially an accurate summation.
 ''It's a legitimate method, allowed under the collective bargaining agreement,'' said Mitch Kupchak, the Lakers' general manager. ''It's been done for years. And it's been done recently. So it's not something that just came up.''
 This is all made possible because of the N.B.A.'s arcane rules governing trades. Generally speaking, teams that are already over the salary cap have to balance salaries in a trade -- taking back as much as they send away, give or take 25 percent.
 McKie (a Laker from 2005 to 2007) and Van Horn (a Maverick from 2005 to 2006) became useful under another wrinkle. Neither ever filed retirement papers, and their respective teams never ''renounced'' their rights. That made them eligible to be used in sign-and-trade deals. The rules dictated they had to sign three-year deals, but only the first year is guaranteed, making them more like one-year deals. Or in this case, two-and-a-half-month deals.
 N.B.A. officials were not thrilled with either trade. Before approving the deals, they sought assurances that McKie and Van Horn truly intended to resume their careers. 
 League officials were not available for comment, but Joel Litvin, the N.B.A.'s president of league and basketball operations, addressed the issue Saturday, saying: ''You can't discount players coming back.''
 ''Chris Webber came back midseason. It does happen,'' Litvin said. ''It has to be legit, it has to be a case where a player is really looking to resume his career. He might not expect to succeed in resuming his career. But at some point it doesn't pass the smell test.''
 But the smell test lacks specifics. How much time do McKie and Van Horn have to spend with their new teams before being waived? Do they have to play a game? N.B.A. officials have no easy answers to such questions, and acknowledge these situations are viewed the same way the Supreme Court views obscenity: it knows a salary-cap circumvention when it sees one.
 ''If the guy gets there and 20 seconds later he gets cut, and the guy is 55 years old, that's not going to pass muster,'' Litvin said.
 The league could seek to close the loophole when the current labor deal expires. One possibility: a team's right to a player could be automatically rescinded -- removing the ability to do a sign-and-trade -- after the player has been inactive and unsigned for a year.
 But there is little incentive to draw up new rules. The loophole benefits general managers by giving them another tool to make complicated trades. It benefits players, their agents and the players association by putting more money in players' hands.
 And as one general manager said Tuesday, no one is hurt by the loophole, except maybe the league's lawyers. Litvin verbally cringed at the suggestion of another rule.
 ''We have a C.B.A. that's this thick, that is full of rules designed to address specific issues that come up and loopholes we decided to close,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Driving to the Gold Rush

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MAGUARICHIC, Mexico 

 BODY:
In these mountains, where conquistadors once gouged gold from open veins in the mountainside, the hardened gold miner of film lore is giving way to a new breed of prospector: geologists and engineers, armed with sophisticated equipment and millions of investor dollars. 
 Largely American and Canadian, they toiled for global mining giants for years. But, now that the price of gold is near record highs, they are leaving their companies, raising capital to start their own prospecting start-ups and heading for Mexico. On Tuesday, an ounce of gold hit $929.30, up from $665 a year ago. Back in 1980, oil shock and economic gloom drove the price to $875 an ounce; that would be more than $2,000 today.
 Much of the recent run-up has been caused by economic uncertainty and rising anxiety about the risks of global inflation. 
 ''Gold hit bottom in 2001 at $250 an ounce and it has been going up ever since,'' said Craig Stanley, a gold mining analyst at Desjardins Securities in Toronto. ''That keeps dragging in more people.'' 
 But like any gold rush, he warned, the promise of riches can outshine the real possibilities -- even if more investors are willing to finance start-ups than ever before. 
 ''It is easier to raise more money,'' Mr. Stanley said, ''but it takes a lot of money to go out and find gold.'' 
 With the price of gold likely to continue its climb, mining companies are ramping up gold exploration budgets all over the world. But many countries that hold out the promise of significant new deposits are either politically capricious, like Russia, or dangerous, like Congo. 
 By contrast, Mexico has developed friendly investment rules and a relatively efficient bureaucracy, analysts said. Despite the escalating drug war in much of northern Mexico, miners operate quite safely. And Mexico offers an advantage for North American prospectors that no other country can match: geologists can make the drive down in a few days. 
 Just to start exploring, it takes tens of millions of dollars. The cost of finding and then mining gold has increased about 25 percent in the last year, a result of soaring costs for the energy, steel and cement used in mining. 
 Specialized equipment and qualified personnel are also in short supply. Modern-day exploration requires aerial mapping and sophisticated sensors. 
 Even with the most sophisticated sounding and drilling equipment, only one of every 1,000 exploration projects becomes a working mine, said Peter K. M. Megaw, president of Imdex, a consulting and contracting firm based in Tucson that helps foreign companies exploring in Mexico. 
 ''There's gold everywhere,'' said Francois Auclair, vice president for exploration for Dia Bras Exploration, a small company in Montreal. ''But you need special physical conditions to make your deposit worth something.'' 
 That has not slowed the exploratory drilling taking place here. Across the Sierra Madre, bulldozers flatten farm trails to create roads to remote sites and diamond drill tips bore hundreds of meters into rock, collecting truckloads of cylindrical samples for testing. 
 Even with its long history of mining, this land is relatively underdeveloped. Difficult terrain, Indian raids and political instability made mining a start-and-stop affair. Mexico prohibited foreign mining investment for three decades, relenting only in 1992 as the North American Free Trade Agreement was being negotiated. 
 Now, analysts say, Mexico is one of the most attractive countries in the world for mining -- the 14th-largest producer of gold, up from 18th place in 2006. 
 The new prospectors' chief market for raising seed money for their start-ups is a half-continent away from these mountains where volcanic activity laid rich deposits of gold, silver, zinc and lead as long as 130 million years ago. Most companies raise their first few million to begin mapping and testing claims at the TSX Venture Exchange in Toronto.
 Known in the industry as juniors, they have become the exploration arm of the industry, said Larry Segerstrom, the chief operating officer of Paramount Gold and Silver, a junior based in Ottawa that is exploring in Chihuahua State.
 Mr. Stanley, the analyst, said: ''There are over a thousand junior miners listed. Most of them are a couple of guys with an idea, and they have staked some land somewhere.'' 
 Sometimes they stake their own claims, sometimes they ally themselves with other small companies or individual miners who have old claims but lack their modern equipment and their millions. 
 After spending tens of millions to map and then drill, the juniors may be able to form a joint venture with a bigger company if the results are promising enough. A really big discovery will get the attention of a global mining company.
 As part of its pitch to investors, Paramount Gold and Silver says that the structure of its recent finds are similar to those of another project in Chihuahua State called Palmarejo. The Canadian and Australian owners of Palmarejo sold it last year for $1.1 billion to the American company Coeur d'Alene Mines. 
 Now, Paramount is spending about $1 million a month to explore an area of old mine workings in western Chihuahua for gold and silver. The company raised $24 million from the markets last year to finance the exploration. ''Many mines have several lives,'' said Bill Reed, vice president for exploration. ''As prices and technology change, then they become economical again.'' 
 But it can take years. Minefinders, a small company based in Vancouver, began exploration in 1994 near a mine that had prospered early in the 20th century. Silver and gold production will start at the mine later this year. 
 ''Minefinders rode the gold price all the way to the bottom of the trough and hopefully they will ride it back up,'' said Gregg Bush, vice president for operations at the mine. 
 The company had to build the access roads itself and it took years to negotiate with communal farmers who owned the property. Between cash payments and investments, Minefinders will pay the farmers $17 million. 
 The old-style miners who are still around hope that the new gold rush will wash over them, too. 
 After two decades of prospecting here, Jay Zebrowski, 64, still drives his 1983 Chevrolet Suburban every few months from his home near Denver to check on the abandoned mine he and his geologist brother own here. 
 In a contemporary version of ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' the 1948 classic by the director John Huston, gold has put the Zebrowskis on the edge of ruin. 
 Almost all of the one million or so dollars they have sunk into mining has come from investors who have yet to see a return. Indebted, Mr. Zebrowski has stayed afloat by selling options on a couple of his claims to the small Montreal company, Dia Bras Exploration, and the Mexican mining giant Industrias Penoles. 
 The Zebrowskis' mine, under a hillside just outside the town of Maguarichic, was worked until the 1940s. Called La Poderosa, it looked anything but powerful when they restarted it in the early 1990s. 
 ''We were not coming up with the grades and not hitting the vein,'' Mr. Zebrowski said, meaning they were not striking high-quality gold. Today, much of the mine's underground works are rotting under groundwater. ''We simply ran out of money.'' 
 Looters have carried off part of the processing equipment that turns ore into gold concentrate and a snowstorm last year collapsed the tin roof over the tool shed. 
 The Zebrowski brothers eventually abandoned their mine and began staking claims instead, hoping to cut deals with bigger companies. When the market collapsed in 1997, they had to let many of the claims go, but held on to the best ones, Mr. Zebrowski said. 
 They have mining claims on some 14,000 hectares in northern Mexico, in addition to the mine, which is guarded by a goatherd. 
 Mr. Zebrowski hopes to sell more options on those claims to the companies exploring here. Buying an option would give them the right to prospect for gold, and would pay the Zebrowskis more money if a deposit is developed into a mine. 
 ''We seem to have some good luck now,'' Mr. Zebrowski said. 
 He paused and added, ''Well, at least good luck is all around us.''

HEADLINE: Study Says Education Gap Could Further Limit Poor

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Economic mobility, the chance that children of the poor or middle class will climb up the income ladder, has not changed significantly over the last three decades, a study being released on Wednesday says. 
 The authors of the study, by scholars at the Brookings Institution in Washington and sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts, warned that widening gaps in higher education between rich and poor, whites and minorities, could soon lead to a downturn in opportunities for the poorest families. 
 The researchers found that Hispanic and black Americans were falling behind whites and Asians in earning college degrees, making it harder for them to enter the middle class or higher. 
 ''A growing difference in education levels between income and racial groups, especially in college degrees, implies that mobility will be lower in the future than it is today,'' said Ron Haskins, a former Republican official and welfare expert who wrote the education section of the report. 
 There is some good news. The study highlights the powerful role that college can have in helping people change their station in life. Someone born into a family in the lowest fifth of earners who graduates from college has a 19 percent chance of joining the highest fifth of earners in adulthood and a 62 percent chance of joining the middle class or better. 
 In recent years, 11 percent of children from the poorest families have earned college degrees, compared with 53 percent of children from the top fifth. 
 ''The American dream of opportunity is alive, but frayed,'' said Isabel Sawhill, another author of the report, ''Getting Ahead or Losing Ground: Mobility in America.'' The report is at economicmobility.org
 ''It's still alive for immigrants but badly tattered for African-Americans,'' said Ms. Sawhill, an economist and a budget official in the Clinton administration. ''It's more alive for people in the middle class than for people at the very bottom.'' 
 The report and planned studies constitute the most comprehensive effort to examine intergenerational mobility, said John E. Morton of the Pew Trusts, who is managing the project. It draws heavily on a federally supported survey by the University of Michigan that has followed thousands of families since the late 1960s. 
 A chapter of the report released last fall found startling evidence that a majority of black children born to middle-class parents grew up to have lower incomes and that nearly half of middle-class black children fell into the bottom fifth in adulthood, compared with 16 percent of middle-class white children. 
 The Pew-sponsored studies are continuing with the involvement of research organizations and scholars. Another report expected in the spring by the more conservative Heritage Foundation will focus on explanations for the trends described in the current report. 
 Stuart Butler, vice president for economic studies at the Heritage Foundation, said, ''It does seem in America now that for people at very bottom it's more difficult to move up than we might have thought or might have been true in the past.'' 
 Mr. Butler said experts were likely to disagree about the reasons and, hence, on policies to improve mobility. Conservative scholars are more apt to fault cultural norms and the breakdown of families while liberals put more emphasis on the changing structure of the economy and the need for government to provide safety nets and aid for poor families. 
 ''We may well have an economy that rewards certain traits that are typically passed on from parents to children, the importance of education, optimism, a propensity to work hard, entrepreneurship and so on,'' he said.
 To the extent that the economy rewards those traits, he added, ''you'd expect the incomes of children to track more with that of their parents.'' 
 The small fraction of poor children who earn college degrees are likely to rise well above their parents' status, the study showed. 
 More than half the children born to upper-income parents, those in the top fifth, who finish college remain in that top group. Nearly one in four remains in the top fifth even without completing college.
 Evidence from model programs shows that early childhood education can have lasting benefits, Mr. Haskins said, although the Head Start program is too uneven to produce widespread gains. 
 In addition, he said, studies show that many poor but bright children do not receive good advice about applying for college and scholarships, or do not receive help after starting college. 
 ''If we did more to help them complete college,'' Mr. Haskins said, ''there's no question it would improve mobility.''

HEADLINE: Newest Restaurants Still Reflect Flush Times

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
SOMEBODY forgot to clue Daniel Boulud in to all of this recession talk. John Fraser and Ed Brown didn't get the memo, either.
 All three chefs recently opened, or are about to open, ambitious restaurants in Manhattan, and that's only the half of it. They located these restaurants on the Upper West Side, which is by reputation as hospitable to fine dining as Florida was to Rudy Giuliani.
 It's the audacity of hope redefined, or at least the audacity of hope in the form of coq au vin and chocolate fondant. 
 And it's a compelling illustration that the New York restaurant scene has entered a curiously exciting period that's curiously at odds with the times. If the Upper West Side is in on the action, there must be plenty of action indeed.
 Alain Ducasse is back -- on the East Side. Like Mr. Boulud, he has opened his first new New York restaurant in more than four years. Maybe ''recession'' doesn't translate into French, or maybe the euro-to-dollar exchange rate really pumps a toque full of confidence.
 Whatever the case, Mr. Ducasse last month opened Adour Alain Ducasse in the St. Regis hotel. True, it's less lavish than his last New York restaurant, Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, but then an Emperor's Day bacchanal at Nero's was less lavish than Alain Ducasse at the Essex House.
 Adour has a touch-screen wine bar, and nearly half of its entrees are above $40. Recession cuisine, it's not.
 And the only truly humble aspect of Mr. Boulud's latest effort, situated opposite Lincoln Center, is its name, Bar Boulud. Its menu focuses on some of the most sophisticated charcuterie in town, a dazzling array of terrines and pates laced with Cognac and truffle juice.
 But neither Adour nor Bar Boulud is as daring as the experiment under way by Marcus Samuelsson.
 Mr. Samuelsson, renowned for his Scandinavian cooking at Aquavit, is betting that he can make pan-African cuisine magnetic enough to fill about 150 seats at Merkato 55, which jostles for attention and affection among the Asian and Mediterranean behemoths in the meatpacking district.
 The restaurant's menu includes a ''kidogo bar'' section that allows diners to try various African breads slathered with various African toppings. That's not something the city's food mavens are used to.
 So why now, with the Dow so spastic and economists so morose?
 Restaurants opening today reflect calculations made as many as three years ago, in markedly different economic climates.
 It takes considerable time for restaurateurs to round up investors, lock in a lease and nail down contractors. And once they've gone a certain distance down that road, there's no turning back.
 Mr. Brown said in a telephone interview that he began to formalize plans for his new restaurant, Eighty One, two and a half years ago. He was signing contracts 18 months ago, he said.
 With about 110 seats, Eighty One, which will serve contemporary American food, is nearly as large as Ouest and larger than Telepan, two prominent Upper West Side peers. It faces nearby competition from Mr. Fraser's restaurant, Dovetail, which opened with about 80 seats in December.
 But Mr. Brown expressed optimism about Eighty One, into which more than $3 million has been poured.
 ''It's not my feeling that we're in a recession,'' he said. ''The rest of the country? Maybe. But we're in our own country of New York.''
 And in New York, he added, people and money -- and people with money -- are different. ''Those who have it seem to always have it, and they're going to go out to eat and maybe even spend more on dining,'' he said.
 That's a hope obviously shared by Mr. Fraser and by the chef Michael Psilakis, who just opened Mia Dona, which serves Mediterranean food on the East Side, and will soon move Kefi, on the Upper West Side, to a much larger space in the same neighborhood.
 His frenzy of recession-blind activity is explained by the fact that a chef or a restaurateur on a roll -- and Mr. Psilakis, who opened Anthos last year, is most definitely on a roll -- wants to exploit that, no matter the economic indicators. His or her velocity may not be the same when the slump ends.
 Ken Friedman, the restaurateur who teamed with the chef April Bloomfield to open the Spotted Pig four years ago, has been intent on a new project for the two of them ever since. And it just so happens that the middle of this imperfect year is when that project, John Dory, a proper seafood restaurant with white tablecloths and entrees in the $30 range, will probably open.
 In fact, Mr. Friedman has just taken on yet another imminent opening: the Rusty Knot, which he described as a dive bar with high-caliber finger food. His timing was dictated by the availability of the right space along the West Side Highway. 
 Besides, he, like some other chefs and restaurateurs, sees himself as less merchant than artist. ''I'm certainly not the kind who would look at the Dow,'' he said. ''Does a writer write or not write a book based on the economic climate? Does a songwriter write songs that way?''
 And then there's the matter of hotels. More and more these days their owners feel that they need to present destination restaurants to stay competitive and that they need to compete as vigorously in bad times as in good.
 Adour is in the St. Regis, which had been Lespinasse-less for too long. The Jumeirah Essex House has for a while needed an answer to the closing of Mr. Ducasse's restaurant there at the end of 2006, and so it just unveiled South Gate, which combines views of Central Park with the cooking of Kerry Heffernan, formerly of Eleven Madison Park.
 Whatever the specific motivations for specific restaurants, the city is awash in intriguing new places that seem to reflect an expansion, rather than a diminution, of nerve in the face of economic and political uncertainty.
 Whatever the reasons, the restaurants keep coming. Safe ways to invest money may be in short supply these days. Tasty ways to spend it aren't.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths COWAN, DAVID

 BODY:
 COWAN--David, co-founder of The New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA), was born in 1903. He died peacefully on February 17, 2008, aged 104. David was part of the NYSSA founding group that included Benjamin Graham, the father of securities analysis and one of the most influential men in the history of finance. Born in London, David's family soon moved to Montreal, Canada. 
He graduated from McGill University in 1923 with first class honors in economics, political science and French. In 1925, while employed in the investment department of the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, he beat 437 other entrants and won the Bonbright Prize and $5,000 for his Review (and Forecast) of the Development of the Electric Light and Power Industry 1920-1930. This achievement paved the way for his career as a utility industry analyst and he soon moved to New York City, where he worked almost fifty years on Wall Street, many of them with Shearson Bros. During World War II, David volunteered for the War Production Board. President Roosevelt established the War Production Board in 1942 to organize war procurement and production programs including the allocation of materials and production facilities. David, son of the late Alice and Albert Cowan, and brother of the late Lucien, was the devoted husband of the late Henriette Cowan, loving dad to Dianne Anderson, and doting grandfather of Steven and Caryn Hecht. Gentle, wry, funny, and above all, a gentleman, David will be missed and his spirit will be cherished forever.

HEADLINE: Making the Breakup Much Easier

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS

 BODY:
MICHAEL AYOUB was an experienced chef and restaurateur when a Brooklyn business owner enlisted his help in 1988 to turn around a struggling catering company. In exchange for his sweat equity, Mr. Ayoub would acquire a one-third interest and be an equal partner with the founder and his daughter.
 The next 10 years were a ''lovefest,'' Mr. Ayoub said, during which they opened two successful restaurants in Park Slope. But as competition intensified, the partners disagreed about strategies. Father and daughter ousted Mr. Ayoub in 2001. 
 When he tried to cash out, they argued that the business had hit hard times and wasn't worth anything. (Both restaurants have since closed.) Mr. Ayoub, 51, who now owns Fornino, an upscale pizzeria in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, said he walked away from the feud with just enough to pay his lawyer. 
 Such tangles and many others can be avoided with a buy-sell agreement -- basically a business prenup or a postnup, depending on when owners draw it up. In a buy-sell, partners (the process is the same for corporations and limited liability companies) decide what will happen to their interest in the company if events like death, divorce and personal bankruptcy occur. 
 A buy-sell can prevent an assortment of evils, like becoming unwilling partners with an owner's heirs, or leaving a surviving spouse illiquid because the remaining owners refuse to buy the survivor's inherited shares. By requiring a sale under certain circumstances, known as trigger events, and specifying the terms beforehand, the buy-sell avoids conflict and protects everyone, said Louis A. Mezzullo, author of ''An Estate Planner's Guide to Buy-Sell Agreements for the Closely Held Business.''
 The best time to arrange the details, which can require 20 pages or more, is before you begin a venture, said Robert E. Gregg, a lawyer with Squire, Sanders & Dempsey in Tysons Corner, Va. Still, Mr. Gregg, who has worked with many start-ups, said there was generally no harm in waiting six months or so until you're sure the business is workable. Either way, there are issues to sort out. 
 What events should you include? While some, like leaving the company, starting a competing business or offering shares to an outsider may seem obvious, others could require considerable soul-searching. For example, if a founding partner retires, the remaining owners may feel torn between a desire to reward past work and not wanting that person to get a free ride while they keep pouring themselves into the company. 
 Who can -- or must -- buy the business interest when one party wants out? In what's called a cross-purchase agreement, the option or obligation belongs to the remaining owners. Alternatively, you can use a redemption agreement, which designates the company as the buyer. A hybrid approach typically gives an owner the right of first refusal, with the company next in line if the owner doesn't exercise it.
 When owners' interests are divided unequally -- say, one is a majority shareholder -- you may also want to incorporate what's known as a tag-along provision. Then, if a 90 percent owner sells to Microsoft, for example, the deal must include the 10 percent shareholder too.
 The co-founders of the Brooklyn Brewery, also in Williamsburg, relied on their cross-purchase agreement when one of them, Tom Potter, 52, sold 50 percent of the voting stock in 2003 for an undisclosed sum and went to work for a nonprofit. Steve Hindy, 59, the other owner, who held the remaining voting stock, had the option to buy out Mr. Potter. But he chose not to do so because he approved of the buyer: David Ottaway, a longtime friend and one of the first investors in the company when it started in 1988. 
 How can you value the interests being sold? There are many ways to approach this. If you name a set amount, you'll need to update it annually to reflect changes in the company, the industry or the economy, said Samuel A. Donaldson, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law in Seattle. A more practical solution is to describe a process for determining the value, whether it is according to a formula or through an appraisal of the company's fair market value. 
 It is also possible to vary the purchase price depending on the triggering event, said Charles A. Redd, a lawyer with Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal in St. Louis. For instance, you might make it just a fraction of the fair market value when an owner defects to another company, but 100 percent of that value when an owner dies. 
 What are the payment terms and financing? A lump-sum payout is often associated with life insurance that is used to finance a buyout when an owner dies, Mr. Redd said. You'll need fewer policies if the company buys a policy for every owner, rather than if they insure one another individually, he said. The alternative is an installment sale, with payments plus interest over a defined period. These arrangements are common in buyouts where the owners don't anticipate a ready source of cash, which could happen if one owner gets divorced or wants to quit the business, Professor Donaldson said. The legal bill to prepare a buy-sell agreement can cost $2,500 to $15,000, depending on complexity. If your budget is tight, you can rely on the free buy-sell agreement that many life insurance companies offer policy buyers, but it will probably cover only an owner's death, not other trigger events. 
 You may be able to save by using a self-help book like ''Business Buyout Agreements: A Step-by-Step Guide for Co-Owners,'' by Bethany Laurence and Anthony Mancuso, and asking your lawyer to review your draft. 
 Whatever the price tag, a buy-sell agreement affords peace of mind that some people think money can't buy. As Mr. Potter, formerly of Brooklyn Brewery, put it in an e-mail message: ''Having the ultimate dispute resolution available in case of irreconcilable differences not only keeps you from coming to blows, but makes it less likely that you feel the need to split up in the first place.''

HEADLINE: Castro Quits One Role, but May Not Be Done Yet

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA; James C. McKinley Jr. contributed reporting from Mexico City, and Marc Lacey from Cancun, Mexico.

DATELINE: HAVANA 

 BODY:
Fidel Castro, bedridden for 19 months, on Tuesday gave up the almost unlimited power he has wielded in Cuba for nearly 50 years, but whether the surprise announcement represented a historic change or a symbolic political maneuver remained unclear. 
 It is expected that his brother Raul, 76, will be officially named president, and some experts consider him more pragmatic.
 Raul Castro has talked about bringing more accountability to government and possibly working to improve relations with the United States. But since taking over temporarily in the summer of 2006, he has largely operated in his brother's shadow, and, except for facilitating huge investments by Canadian and European resort developers here, he has brought about little change.
 Under Cuba's Constitution, a newly chosen legislative body, the National Assembly, is scheduled to select a 31-member Council of State on Sunday, including a new president. Fidel Castro said he would not accept the position even if it were offered to him. 
 In a letter of resignation read over early morning radio and television programs across the country, the 81-year-old Mr. Castro -- who has appeared frail in the few videos released by the Cuban government -- was said to be too ill to continue as head of state and would not stand in the way of others who were ready to take over, a sentiment he first expressed last December.
 Experts on Cuban politics say the decision on a successor remains in the hands of the Castro brothers and their inner circle, many of whom hold cabinet positions. Others said that a younger president could be brought in or that the posts of prime minister and president could be divided between Raul Castro and one of the ministers. 
 It was not clear what role, if any, Fidel Castro would play in a new government, or whether he would retain other powerful positions, including head of the Communist Party. But he signaled that he was not yet ready to completely exit the stage. 
 It is not even certain that Mr. Castro was well enough to actually write the letter of resignation. Doubts have arisen over his health and whether he could have written a string of essays that have been published over the last year and a half in Granma, the Communist Party organ. 
 ''I am not saying goodbye to you,'' said Mr. Castro in the letter written under his name and addressed to the Cuban people. ''I only wish to fight as a soldier of ideas.''
 The confusion of analysts in both Cuba and the United States about the extent to which Mr. Castro would withdraw from day-to-day government operations or continue to wield power from behind the scenes was reflected in the mix of opinions of people from the luxury beaches at the seaside resort of Varadero to the central park of Old Havana. 
 There was little evidence in the streets of the capital and in other cities to suggest that a monumental change was taking place in the Cuban hierarchy. But that could be because the accrued experience of state security officials made open demonstrations unlikely and assured that most reactions to the news would remain as covert as a high-five between passing friends on a crowded street, an act viewed in Havana. 
 Cuba's leading dissident tried to dampen expectations. 
 ''This isn't news,'' said the dissident, Elizardo Sanchez, after learning from friends that Mr. Castro was ceding power. ''It was expected and it does nothing to change the human rights situation, which continues to be unfavorable, or to end the one-party state. There's no reason to celebrate.''
 The pace of ordinary Cuban life continued. 
 In Varadero, workers collected garbage and cleaned pools as they normally would. On the highway, workers whitewashed barriers. In the seaside city of Matanzas, Eliana Lopez, a 55-year-old transportation inspector who had heard the news on her way to work, said she expected the revolution to continue, with change coming slowly but surely. 
 ''There is no surprise,'' Ms. Lopez said. She added, ''This is the correct decision,'' referring to Mr. Castro's declaration. 
 In Havana, an older generation of Cubans who maintained their admiration for Mr. Castro and his revolution, despite the crumbling condition of the city, were disappointed. Alba, 67, a retired nurse who, like many Cubans, was afraid to give her full name, told Agence France-Presse that she had expected Mr. Castro to be president for life and to ''die with his boots on.'' 
 However, members of a younger generation who had grown tired of what they saw as promises for a better life that never materialized, said they hoped there might be significant change, although their hopes were based more on wishful thinking than on a realistic view of the political situation. 
 ''It took a long time, but he finally said it and that's fantastic news,'' said Armando, a 28-year-old student who said it was about time Mr. Castro let go of power. 
 And there were many Cubans like Evelyn, 45, who neither cheered nor cried at the news that Mr. Castro would step aside. 
 ''I am not surprised and I don't feel sad either,'' Evelyn said. ''Everyone knew he was going to resign. Fidel is an athlete of politics. He knows what he does.'' 
 In trying to assess the future, political analysts pointed to signs that Raul Castro had a pragmatic streak. As acting president, he has encouraged more debate about Cuba's economic woes, sponsoring a series of town-hall-style meetings last fall to allow people to speak freely about their economic woes and the limits on their rights to travel.
 He has also brought up issues his brother never addressed. He has lambasted farmers for being inefficient. He has criticized the high cost of milk. He has acknowledged that the salaries the Cuban government pays are woefully low and do not meet the minimum needs of a family. He has criticized corruption, even letting state-controlled newspapers publish investigative articles about the looting and bad management practices at many state-controlled companies.
 The younger Mr. Castro also has a reputation as a manager who demands results from his cabinet members. Unlike Fidel, who liked to manage every detail of government himself, Raul has delegated authority and held his cabinet ministers accountable. 
 After decades during which Mr. Castro's grip seemed unbreakable, uncertainties arose in July 2006. Mr. Castro, suffering from an undisclosed abdominal ailment, had emergency surgery and temporarily handed over power to his brother. 
 In Tuesday's letter, which was also published in Granma, Mr. Castro said he did not step down earlier to avoid dealing a blow to the Cuban government before the people were ready for a traumatic change ''in the middle of the battle'' with the United States over control of the Cuba's future.
 ''To prepare the people for my absence, psychologically and politically, was my first obligation after so many years of struggle,'' he said. More than 70 percent of Cubans were born after he seized power in 1959.
 President Bush, the 10th president to cross swords with Mr. Castro, has tried to tighten the longstanding United States embargo and increase international pressure on Cuba during his time in office, restricting family visits to once every three years and putting a cap on the amount of remittances Cuban-Americans can send to relatives in Cuba. 
 Mr. Bush, traveling in Rwanda on a tour of Africa, reacted to Mr. Castro's decision to give up power by saying that the resignation should be the beginning of a democratic transition in Cuba leading to free elections. ''The United States will help the people of Cuba realize the blessings of liberty,'' he said.
 Mr. Bush called for Cuba to release political prisoners and to begin building ''institutions necessary for democracy that eventually will lead to free and fair elections.''
 Analysts in the United States say that even after Fidel Castro dies, Raul Castro, as president, would still find himself under tremendous pressure to sustain his brother's legacy, while at the same time working to break it down and provide a measure of economic and political freedom for the Cuban people. 
 If the National Assembly on Sunday unexpectedly selects someone other than Raul Castro -- the names of the Assembly's president, Ricardo Alarcon, Vice President Carlos Lage and Foreign Secretary Felipe Perez Roque are mentioned frequently -- it could represent a sign that Cuba is more eager to accelerate change than is widely believed, including an improved relationship with Washington. 
 The United States has stated that it would not negotiate with any Cuban government headed by either Fidel or Raul Castro.

HEADLINE: Supply Fears Push Oil to Triple Digits

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Crude oil closed above $100 a barrel for the first time Tuesday, vaulting through a longstanding psychological barrier amid persistent concern about whether production can keep up with rising global demand.
 The day's price rise of more than 4 percent capped a week-long run-up that began when President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela threatened to cut off oil exports to the United States over a legal struggle with Exxon Mobil. Crude oil fell from a record $100.10 a barrel in New York on speculation that a U.S. Energy Department report will show stockpiles rose for a sixth week, according to Reuters. Crude oil for March delivery dropped as much as 90 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $99.11 a barrel in after-hours electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Just as Mr. Chavez appeared to back off from his threats, an explosion at a Texas refinery on Monday reminded traders and hedge fund managers of the gasoline shortages and price increases that accompanied similar refinery failures last year. Even though the Alon USA refinery at Big Spring, Tex., was relatively small and American inventories are considered adequate, traders and hedge funds took the explosion as a buying signal. 
 ''With this credit crisis going on, everyone is on edge and the slightest disruption in crude oil or its products takes prices right up,'' said Michael Rose, director of the energy trading desk at Angus Jackson in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''Prices are going to go higher before they go lower.''
 Energy experts cited numerous underlying causes for the rise in energy prices, which have persisted despite a weakening American economy. American demand for gasoline has slipped about 50,000 barrels a day (out of total daily consumption of more than 20 million barrels) so far this year because of the slowing economy, but consumption in China, in India and in the oil-producing countries themselves continues to rise. Traders are also concerned about possible production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
 World supplies have been trimmed by substantial cutbacks in production in Iraq and Nigeria in recent weeks. Nigeria alone has lost about 10 percent of its daily production since guerrillas stepped up their sabotage and kidnapping of oil workers in the Niger Delta at the end of last year. Some analysts fear that OPEC could cut production further when it meets next month to counter the prospect that a softening world economy may eventually weaken demand and push prices down. 
 Prices for the benchmark grade of oil, West Texas Intermediate crude, rose $4.51 to close at $100.01 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price rose as high as $100.10 in trading during the day, at least the third time this year that oil prices crossed the $100 barrier during a trading day. While $100.01 is the first close above $100 a barrel and a record in nominal terms, it is still shy of the inflation-adjusted record of $103.35, set in April 1980. (That number will be recalculated on Wednesday when the government releases new inflation data.) 
 United States stock prices were dragged down by the record oil close, which helped to reverse a 157-point rally in the Dow Jones industrial average, because investors feared that higher energy costs would further weaken consumer spending. 
 The average national price for unleaded regular gasoline, according to AAA, the automobile club, and the Oil Price Information Service, stands at $3.03 a gallon, compared with $3.02 a month ago and $2.26 a year ago. It usually takes at least a week for increases in oil prices to be reflected in gasoline prices.
 ''We're looking at retail prices for regular unleaded of $3.50 to $3.75 in April and May,'' said Tom Kloza, an analyst with Oil Price Information Service. ''Those will be records.'' The record of $3.22 a gallon was set last May.
 Mr. Kloza also predicted record highs for diesel and jet fuel ''within the next 90 days.''
 Analysts say another factor causing the rise in oil prices is the falling value of the dollar. A depreciating dollar depresses investment by oil companies in developing fields because their salaries and other costs go up in local currencies as their earnings from dollar-denominated oil go down. It also encourages continued global consumption by shielding foreign buyers, whose currencies have been rising in relation to the dollar, from the full effect of price increases.
 The falling dollar, along with declining credit and stock markets, also encourages traders to seek a safe haven in oil and other commodities. 
 ''The way the markets look right now, with the dollar being weak against all currencies,'' Mr. Rose of Angus Jackson said, ''it's prudent for traders and people in other countries to buy dollar-denominated products like grains and energy.'' 
 The immediate cause that sent prices up today was the fire at the Texas refinery, energy experts said. The run-up, they said, was mostly psychological, since domestic supplies are considered ample to satisfy demand for the next several months.
 ''It served as a reminder to the market that major refinery mishaps are not necessarily just a memory,'' said Adam Robinson, an energy analyst at Lehman Brothers.
 The blast at the West Texas refinery, which caused four injuries, will halt processing of about 70,000 barrels a day for probably several weeks at least. The refinery provides gasoline to Fina service stations in Texas and the Southwest. A second refinery in Hawaii suffered a disruption over the weekend, but production was quickly restored.
 Oil refineries across the country were plagued last year by a variety of breakdowns, including fires, power failures and leaks, that trimmed production during the spring and summer driving seasons.
 The mishaps occurred as refiners were trying to meet a variety of new environmental regulations, add ethanol to their fuel mix and introduce fuels lower in sulfur, a pollutant. Energy experts say the refiners have taken steps to improve their performance this year, but there may be more incidents in the coming weeks as refineries go through routine maintenance and switch from producing winter blends to spring blends.
 ''It's kind of like starting up your lawn mower after it's been inactive for a while,'' Mr. Kloza said. ''It's a little tricky.'' 
 Following are the results of Thursday's auction of 3- and 6-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Lacking Cure, a New Tack on a Muscle Disease

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
For more than four decades, on telethons featuring celebrity performers and children in wheelchairs, Jerry Lewis has been raising money each Labor Day for the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the disease that helped make ''poster child'' part of the American idiom. 
 On the most recent telethon, which was staged in Las Vegas and raised $63.8 million, the ''Law and Order'' actress Mariska Hargitay spoke of patients' ''hope that M.D.A. research will lead to treatments and cures.'' Mr. Lewis, who has never disclosed why he chose this disease as his cause, once again closed the broadcast with an emotional rendition of the song ''You'll Never Walk Alone.'' 
 But for all the money collected toward a cure, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common form of the disease, still confines thousands of boys in this country to wheelchairs in their early teens. Many do not live past their 20s. 
 It is a stark reminder of how American medicine -- with its focus on breakthrough treatments -- can sometimes fail a complex, rare and stubbornly uncurable disease. Single-minded in their pursuit of a cure, doctors and researchers for years all but ignored the necessary and unglamorous work of managing Duchenne (pronounced doo-SHEN) as a chronic condition. 
 The approach is changing at a few medical centers, which are focused on making better use of available therapies to eke out longer lives for their patients. Rather than concentrate only on a cure, some researchers are now intent on developing drugs that may alleviate the effects of the disease. 
 But, absent a cure, too many doctors around the country still assume there is little or nothing that can be done for the muscle-wasting condition, parents and specialists say. 
 ''We're in a stone age with Duchenne,'' said Dr. Linda H. Cripe, a pediatric cardiologist at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. She describes Duchenne patients as ''a group of kids that pediatric medicine had forgotten, a group of lost boys.'' 
 Among those is Josh Winheld, who years ago served as the Muscular Dystrophy Association's poster boy in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Now, at age 29, Mr. Winheld is among the oldest Duchenne patients seen at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in part because of the unusually close oversight of his doctors. But the recent discussion of new drugs, however promising, holds little hope for him because he is already almost completely paralyzed. 
 ''I feel totally lost,'' he said. 
 Using a ventilator to help him breathe and a defibrillator to regulate his heart, and nourished by a feeding tube, he is able to move his head and operate his motorized wheelchair with a slight movement of his fingers. 
 He lives outside of Philadelphia with his parents and requires around-the-clock care. His medical expenses are covered by a combination of his parents' private insurance and state assistance. 
 Duchenne is caused by a mutation of the gene for dystrophin, a protein in muscle. The disease occurs almost exclusively in males, about once in every 3,500 live births, and occurs about a third of the time when there is no family history of the disease. 
 With the discovery of the gene in 1986, most of the research attention and financing focused on gene therapy -- coming up with a way to cure the disease by replacing the defective gene. 
 ''There was great hope at the time,'' recalled Mr. Winheld, who has his own blog (winheldsworld.blogspot.com) and is publishing his memoirs. ''We always thought 'cure.' '' 
 But the size of the gene and the variety of mutations have made even diagnosis problematic and researchers are now looking elsewhere for an answer. 
 The lack of interest in the mundane has also slowed progress in knowing what available therapies are the most useful. Large pharmaceutical companies often ignore a rare disease like Duchenne, and they are unwilling to undertake further research into treatments like steroids, where any benefits they show are shared by other manufacturers. 
 ''The economics aren't there,'' said Charles Farkas, head of the health care practice in the Americas for Bain & Company.
 The current focus has changed to trying to identify the patient's mutation and then using a cocktail of different drugs tailored for that specific mutation. 
 ''For too long, I was stuck on it as the home run or nothing,'' said H. Lee Sweeney, a professor and medical researcher at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, who is among the researchers now taking a different approach. ''The home run may skip the next two generations of these kids,'' he said. 
 Others are pushing doctors to focus on making the best use of what therapies are now available. ''For a very long time, this disease was no hope and no help,'' said Patricia Furlong, founding president of Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, a nonprofit group in Middletown, Ohio, who lost two sons to the disease. Her group has been instrumental in prodding doctors to concentrate on helping existing patients. 
 And it is often the parents who insist the doctors keep trying. 
 Two years ago, a 16-year-old Duchenne patient named Anthony Hoel stopped walking. His doctors in Minneapolis assumed there was nothing they could do and told Anthony's father, Tom, to accept the fact that his son would be in a wheelchair. The doctors ''were content to follow the old rule book,'' said Tom Hoel. 
 About a week after corrective surgery and extensive rehabilitation at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Anthony, now 18, walks with the aid of leg braces. 
 ''He is a real success story,'' said Dr. Brenda Wong, Anthony's doctor at Cincinnati. 
 The challenge for Josh Winheld's doctor, Richard Finkel, in caring for someone whose disease is advanced is to keep a close watch on his patient so he can quickly address any problems. 
 During a recent visit, for example, a nutritionist went over Josh's diet, making sure he got enough calories but not too much liquid to stress his heart, while Dr. Finkel examined Josh carefully and tried to determine if there were any changes in his condition. 
 Dr. Finkel is also among the doctors studying a new drug aimed specifically at a mutation that causes about 15 percent of the cases. Clinical trials for the drug, PTC124, are expected to begin enrolling patients early this year.
 To date, the greatest progress has been through the use of steroids. But exactly when steroids should be started, which work best and how best to manage the side effects still remain unclear. 
 And unlike their counterparts in cystic fibrosis, a disease where specialists have successfully stretched life expectancy for patients well into their adulthood, doctors have been slow to develop clear standards of care and aggressively track the results of varying treatments to determine how best to manage the disease.
 ''We've had the tools, and we haven't used them as effectively,'' acknowledged Dr. Finkel. 
 The result is that patients are often treated much later than they should be, with some doctors referring a patient to a cardiologist only after he has developed heart failure or waiting too long to start a patient on steroids. 
 The Muscular Dystrophy Association, which raises tens of millions each year through Jerry Lewis's telethon and other efforts, has also been criticized for a lack of focus on the specific needs of patients with Duchenne. 
 The organization finances some 225 clinics across the country, including the one at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. While Duchenne is the most common of the dystrophies, the association also raises money and provides services for more than three dozen conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. 
 The association has no direct oversight of the clinics, some of which may have little experience in treating a patient with Duchenne. 
 Dr. Valerie A. Cwik, the association's medical director, says the group is now working to create a formal research network to gather and share information about Duchenne. ''People have recognized there are gaps in our knowledge of this disease,'' she said. 
 There is also a federal effort under way to draft recommendations to treat Duchenne. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says these recommendations are likely to be made public late this year or early next year. ''That is going to go a long way to standardize care,'' Dr. Cwik said. 
 And even as experts say there is significant promise in some of the new drugs being studied, doctors like Dr. Wong at Cincinnati say they need to remain committed to making the seemingly small advances that buy patients like Anthony Hoel more time on his feet, or give Josh Winheld a chance to complete his graduate degree once his memoirs are published. 
 ''The outcome can be changed if you tweak little, little details,'' Dr. Wong said.

HEADLINE: With Earnings Up 38%, H.P. Raises Its Forecast

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
While some technology companies have warned of softening in the global economy, Hewlett-Packard is not seeing slowing demand in its own international business, company executives said Tuesday.
 Hewlett-Packard, however, has begun to see some tightening of the consumer market in the United States, Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive, told investors during a quarterly earnings conference call.
 ''In the U.S., at the end of the quarter, we saw a little more caution in the consumer segment than we've seen in the past,'' Mr. Hurd said. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Hurd raised his forecast for the full year. The company estimated that second-quarter revenue would be as much as $27.9 billion, and full-year revenue would be about $114 billion -- increases of about 9 percent in each case over the year-earlier period. Previously, H.P. projected sales for the 2008 fiscal year would be $111.5 billion.
 H.P., the world's largest technology company, is considered a bellwether for the tech sector, if not the economy as a whole, because its revenues are evenly balanced between consumers, small business and large enterprises, with its overseas business accounting for 70 percent of its revenue. 
 The company said first-quarter net income grew 38 percent, to $2.1 billion, or 80 cents a share, while revenue climbed 13 percent, to $28.5 billion, better than analysts had predicted. Mr. Hurd attributed the performance to continued cost-cutting efforts, growth of the sales force and the company's geographic reach.
 ''While I realize that macroeconomic uncertainties exist, we control many of the levers'' necessary to build the business, he said.
 But there are signs that H.P. is not escaping from a slowing economy totally unscathed. When adjusted for currency conversion, revenue grew 8 percent in the first quarter, whereas sales were up 11 percent and 12 percent in the two previous quarters, said A. M. Sacconaghi, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
 The second-quarter revenue estimate is below the first-quarter revenue, and thus represents a potential change in momentum, Mr. Sacconaghi said. In four of the last five years, H.P.'s second-quarter revenue has exceeded that in the first quarter, he noted.
 H.P. executives said that such guidance reflected the company's view that it cannot maintain the torrid pace of sales growth in the personal computer market. H.P. reported computer sales grew 24 percent worldwide in the first quarter from a year ago. Notebook PC revenue grew 37 percent, and even in desktop PCs, which have been flat or down for most companies, revenue grew 15 percent.
 The company has continued to take market share from other makers, while increasing profitability. Operating profit for the computer segment rose to $628 million, from $414 million in the year-earlier quarter.
 Revenue from the imaging and printing group grew 4 percent, to $7.3 billion, but sales of printers to consumers slipped 5 percent, the company said. The growth in shipments of consumer printers was nearly flat. Shipments of large-scale commercial printers, where the company has been focusing much of its attention, grew 13 percent.
 All other units reported increases in revenue and operating profit. At the software unit, operating profit almost tripled, to $51 million, on revenue of $666 million. 
 Mr. Sacconaghi, who has a ''hold'' rating on H.P.'s stock, said the company was in relatively good shape should demand slip.''I don't think anyone's immune in this environment,'' Mr. Sacconaghi said, ''but they're about as well positioned as anyone.''
 Hewlett-Packard did better than Wall Street analysts had predicted. As a result, its shares were up about 6 percent in after-hours trading. They had ended the regular trading session on Tuesday at $43.95, up 8 cents. 
 H.P.'s strongest growth was in the Asia-Pacific region, where revenue rose 22 percent. It grew 15 percent in its Europe, Middle East and Africa region and 8 percent in the Americas.
 When foreign currency conversion is taken into account, revenue grew 16 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, 7 percent in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and 7 percent in the Americas.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Hands Obama Victory, Ninth In A Row

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and JEFF ZELENY; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Ohio, and Megan Thee from New York.

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama decisively beat Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday night, accelerating his momentum ahead of crucial primaries in Ohio and Texas and cutting into Mrs. Clinton's support among women and union members.
 With the two rivals now battling state by state over margins of victory and allotment of delegates, surveys of voters leaving the Wisconsin polls showed Mr. Obama, of Illinois, making new inroads with those two groups as well as middle-age voters and continuing to win support from white men and younger voters -- a performance that yielded grim tidings for Mrs. Clinton, of New York.
 On the Republican side, Senator John McCain of Arizona won a commanding victory over Mike Huckabee in the Wisconsin contest and led by a wide margin in Washington State. All but assured of his party's nomination, Mr. McCain immediately went after Mr. Obama during a rally in Ohio, deriding ''eloquent but empty'' calls for change.
 For Mr. Obama, Wisconsin was his ninth consecutive victory, a streak in which he has not only run up big margins in many states but also pulled votes from once-stalwart supporters of Mrs. Clinton, like low- and middle-income people and women. Voters in Hawaii were also holding caucuses, but results were not expected until Wednesday morning. 
 Mrs. Clinton wasted no time in signaling that she would now take a tougher line against Mr. Obama -- a recognition, her advisers said, that she must act to alter the course of the campaign and define Mr. Obama on her terms. 
 In a speech in Ohio shortly after the polls closed in Wisconsin, she alluded to what her campaign considers Mr. Obama's lack of experience, and his support for a health insurance plan that would not initially seek to cover all Americans.
 ''This is the choice we face: One of us is ready to be commander in chief in a dangerous world,'' Mrs. Clinton said in the remarks, which she also planned to expand upon in a speech in New York City on Wednesday. ''One of us has faced serious Republican opposition in the past -- and one of us is ready to do it again.'' Mrs. Clinton did not mention the Wisconsin results; she did, however, call Mr. Obama to congratulate him on the victory.
 As Mrs. Clinton was speaking, Mr. Obama appeared on stage at a rally in Texas, effectively cutting her off as cable television networks dropped her in midsentence, a telling sign of the showmanship power of a front-runner.
 ''Houston, I think we achieved liftoff here,'' Mr. Obama told a crowd of 20,000 people in that city as he hailed the voters of Wisconsin. ''The change we seek is still months and miles away, and we need the good people of Texas to help us get there.''
 With 90 percent of the electoral precincts in Wisconsin reporting, Mr. Obama had 58 percent of the vote to Mrs. Clinton's 41 percent. On the Republican side, Mr. McCain had 55 percent to Mr. Huckabee's 37 percent. And early returns in Washington State showed him with 48 percent of the vote to Mr. Huckabee's 21 percent. 
 In Wisconsin, the survey of voters leaving the polls found that Democrats believed Mr. Obama would be more likely than Mrs. Clinton, by 63 percent to 37 percent, to defeat the Republican nominee in the fall.
 Her latest loss narrowed even further Mrs. Clinton's options and leaves her little, if any, room for error. Her road to victory is now a cliff walk.
 By the calculation of her own aides, she now almost certainly will need to win the next two big contests, Texas and Ohio on March 4, as well as Pennsylvania on April 22 in order to maintain a viable claim to the nomination and stop so-called superdelegates from breaking for Mr. Obama. But there has been evidence this month that Mr. Obama is building momentum with each victory, and recent polls have suggested that Mrs. Clinton's once-large lead in Ohio and Texas is shrinking.
 What is more, it may not be enough at this point for Mrs. Clinton to simply win Ohio and Texas. She needs delegates to catch up with Mr. Obama; under the rules by which the Democratic Party allocates delegates, she will need to win double-digit victories to pick up enough delegates to close the gap.
 Finally, Mrs. Clinton continues to struggle to find a way to try to raise questions about Mr. Obama and stop what has been a rush of voters to his side. Her Tuesday night speech about Mr. Obama's experience level was one of her toughest yet; still, she has been making similar arguments for months now, and they have not caught fire thus far.
 With his Wisconsin victory, Mr. Obama moved into a lead over Mrs. Clinton in delegates; going into the vote, he had 1,078 delegates to Mrs. Clinton's 1,081, according to a count by The New York Times. Wisconsin had 74 pledged delegates in play, while Hawaii had 20 pledged delegates.
 Although Wisconsin borders Mr. Obama's home state, Illinois, the primary presented a challenge because of the large share of blue-collar workers, a group that he has struggled to win over. Yet the results represented a turnaround for Mr. Obama: About one-third of voters in the Democratic primary came from union households, and they split their votes evenly between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, according to a statewide exit poll conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool.
 By contrast, in the Feb. 5 primaries in New Jersey and California, two states Mrs. Clinton won, the percentage of Democratic voters from union households was also about one-third of those surveyed by Edison/Mitofsky, but they supported Mrs. Clinton more strongly than in Wisconsin.
 About 6 in 10 white men voted for Mr. Obama, while white women split evenly between him and Mrs. Clinton, the polls showed. Mrs. Clinton turned in another strong performance with voters over the age of 60, meanwhile.
 In forging ahead, Clinton advisers say she is determined to win strongly among women and union members in Ohio and Texas, and cited a number of factors that they were counting on: Mrs. Clinton's performance in televised debates in each state this month, including one in Texas on Thursday; her increasingly populist message at campaign rallies; attacks by her and her advisers on Mr. Obama's authenticity; and her continuing portrayal of him as inexperienced.
 On the Republican side, Mr. McCain declared victory in Wisconsin shortly after the polls closed and continued rolling past his last major challenger, Mr. Huckabee, toward the goal of winning the 1,191 delegates needed to seal the party's nomination.
 But surveys of voters gave evidence of misgivings about his candidacy: more than 4 in 10 voters said Mr. McCain was not conservative enough; conservative voters split their votes evenly between the two men. And Mr. Huckabee won a majority of the vote of the one-third of evangelical voters who participated in the Republican primary.
 Addressing a packed ballroom in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. McCain said to cheers that he would urge the nation not to be ''deceived by an eloquent but empty call for change that promises no more than a holiday from history'' and warned against risking ''the confused leadership of an inexperienced candidate.'' He did not even allude to Mrs. Clinton.
 Both Democrats have been increasingly sounding populist notes recently to reflect the economic concerns of voters. In her remarks in Youngstown on Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton allied herself with Americans working on the ''night shift'' -- a phrase that is also the title of a new advertisement that began running in Ohio on Tuesday night. The ad ends with an image of Mrs. Clinton doing paperwork, illuminated by a lamp, as a narrator says, ''She's worked the night shift, too.''
 While Mrs. Clinton drew some of her largest crowds to date in Texas, her decision to spend time away from Wisconsin troubled some of her supporters, who believed she had erred in not campaigning enough in states she lost recently, like Maine.
 Mr. Obama's audiences, meanwhile, were filled with a tapestry of supporters -- young and old, black and white -- many of whom said they had been following the presidential race as it unfolded in neighboring states like Iowa.
 Mary Liedtke, a defense lawyer in Eau Claire, Wis., said she had been a supporter of Mrs. Clinton. But in the final weeks of the Iowa caucus campaign, she said she had become inspired by Mr. Obama's supporters.
 ''Some elderly women I've heard say, 'I want to see a woman president before I die,' and I know that's why some of them are supporting Hillary,'' Ms. Liedtke said in an interview after seeing Mr. Obama last weekend in her town.
 ''But you know what? That's a selfish reason to vote for a president just because you want to see a woman before you die,'' she added. ''What about the kids coming up? I feel we should vote for the young people.''

HEADLINE: Wisconsin? Texas and Ohio Are Where All the Action Has Gone

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and JEFF ZELENY; John M. Broder reported from Parma, and Jeff Zeleny from San Antonio. Mary Ann Giordano and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PARMA, Ohio 

 BODY:
Before the polls even opened in Wisconsin on Tuesday, the two Democratic contenders had moved on to campaign in Texas and Ohio, the two next big prizes on the primary calendar.
 In this blue-collar suburb of Cleveland, one of them, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, spoke at Grace's Grill of her plans to revitalize the ailing Ohio economy with investments in wind and solar power, medical research, advanced automotive technology and low-cost home loans to protect people from foreclosure. Ohio has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation.
 Mrs. Clinton's rival, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, was in San Antonio, where he also talked about the crisis affecting subprime borrowers. Mr. Obama pledged to penalize predatory lenders, offer a tax credit to cover 10 percent of interest on mortgages of struggling homeowners and make an additional $10 billion in bonds available to help buy first homes or avoid foreclosure. 
 The similar themes illustrate the parallel approaches that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are taking to the Ohio and Texas primaries, which will be held March 4, along with those of Rhode Island and Vermont. Both campaigns acknowledged the central importance of the contests in Ohio and Texas, where pocketbook issues of struggling families have emerged as a central concern.
 The four states together will decide 370 pledged delegates, the second-largest trove after the 22 contests on Feb. 5. Depending on the popular vote outcome and the complex delegate math, the March 4 votes could give Mr. Obama a commanding lead, put Mrs. Clinton ahead or leave them essentially tied and looking toward the next big-state contest, Pennsylvania on April 22.
 ''These are major, major, major battleground states,'' said Howard Wolfson, the Clinton campaign's communications director. ''It will be a major test of the two candidates.''
 The Clinton campaign said it was deploying staff members from other states to Ohio and opening offices in every Congressional district. In Texas, it has opened 20 offices and enlisted 4,000 precinct captains, almost halfway to where it wants to be, campaign officials said. 
 Texas' byzantine delegate-selection rules pose a particular challenge to the Clinton forces. Districts that produced heavy Democratic majorities in past contests get a disproportionate share of the delegates, and this favors Mr. Obama because of large turnout in 2004 and 2006 in college towns and black precincts, where he has done well in other states. Mrs. Clinton's strength is in the cities along the Mexican border, where she is popular with Hispanic voters, but which produce fewer delegates.
 Adding to the complexity, Texas holds a primary and a caucus on the same day, with the evening caucus open only to those who have already cast primary ballots, either in early voting (which began Tuesday) or at the polls on March 4. Mr. Obama has prevailed in most caucuses up to now.
 Mrs. Clinton said she could not begin to explain how the Texas system worked. ''I had no idea how bizarre it is,'' she said aboard her plane flying from Wisconsin to Ohio. ''We have grown men crying over it.''
 Clinton campaign officials have admitted being ill prepared for the series of contests after Feb. 5. Further evidence came this week when The Philadelphia Daily News reported that the Clinton campaign in Pennsylvania had failed to file a complete slate of delegates for that state's primary, falling 10 or 11 delegates short of the 103 delegates to be elected at the district level. Under party rules, however, those delegates could be restored later. Phil Singer, a campaign spokesman, said, ''We expect every one of our slots to be filled after the Pennsylvania primary.''
 After winning 23 contests before Tuesday, the Obama campaign is intensely competing in Texas and Ohio. Television advertisements started running in both states last week, including Spanish-language advertisements in Texas. 
 In Ohio, two advertisements focus on the state's battered economy and promise job-creation programs and an end to corporate tax loopholes; another is biographical, and a fourth paints Mrs. Clinton as an embodiment of the past.
 The Obama campaign has opened 10 regional offices in Texas, aides said, and plans to open more before the primary.
 Their strategy for Texas, Obama aides said, includes appealing to African-Americans in Dallas and Houston, as well as building upon the senator's popularity in Austin, where a rally last year drew 20,000 people. But Mr. Obama's first appearance in the state on Tuesday, in the heart of a Hispanic neighborhood in San Antonio, underscored his effort to compete with Mrs. Clinton for Hispanic supporters.
 Adrian Saenz, the Texas director of the Obama campaign, said 125,000 volunteers in the state had signed up to help the campaign when the operation formally began three weeks ago.
 ''We're not giving up any part of the state, regardless of where folks may say the Clintons have deep roots,'' Mr. Saenz said in an interview, adding that the campaign intended to find support among younger Hispanic voters. In the fight for Ohio, Mr. Obama has dispatched his top operatives, including Paul Tewes, the Iowa campaign manager, to run the state effort. Teams of organizers from states that held contests on Feb. 5 have also been dispatched to Ohio and Texas.
 The Clinton campaign plans to spend millions of dollars on advertisements in the two states, with an emphasis on Mrs. Clinton's experience and her economic message, which has taken on a new populist tone in recent days. 
 A new television advertisement in Ohio, ''Night Shift,'' is directed at lower-income voters, who have formed a bulwark of her support so far. It speaks of those who clean up in hair salons, work late at diners and pull the overnight shift in hospitals. 
 The Clinton campaign says it has raised $15 million in 15 days this month, most of it from online contributors, and top aides say they will be able to match Mr. Obama's spending in the coming contests.
 ''We're going to run a campaign down here in which we concede absolutely nothing,'' said Ace Smith, the Clinton campaign's Texas director and director of Mrs. Clinton's winning campaign in California.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Stays Cautious As Profit Beats Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday as shoppers looked for ways to offset difficult economic conditions. 
 The company, which has cut prices to try to win sales in the tough environment, gave a first-quarter and full-year earnings forecast that could come in below Wall Street's expectations.
An analyst with the Telsey Advisory Group, Joseph Feldman, said that given the economic slowdown, providing a cautious forecast near Wall Street's expectations was ''perfectly fine.''
 Wal-Mart's net income rose 4 percent, to $4.096 billion, or $1.02 a share, for its fourth quarter, from $3.94 billion, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Wal-Mart reported earnings of $1.04 a share, above analysts' average estimate of $1.02 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Revenue, which includes membership revenue for the Sam's Club warehouses, where shoppers pay an annual fee, rose to $107.43 billion from $99.08 billion.
 Sales at stores open more than a year, or same-store sales, in the United States increased 1.7 percent, excluding fuel sales. Same-store sales at Wal-Mart stores rose 1.6 percent, and advanced 2.5 percent at Sam's Clubs.
 For the first quarter, Wal-Mart forecast earnings of 70 to 74 cents a share. Analysts, on average, have been expecting earnings of 73 cents.
 For the year, it expected earnings of $3.30 to $3.43 a share, compared with analysts' expectation of $3.42.

HEADLINE: Broken Borders and Dover Sole: My Lunch With Lou Dobbs

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
So I was having lunch at the Four Seasons with Lou Dobbs the other day, locked in disagreement over who cared more about working people, him or me.
 Him: CNN host, biggest and loudest gun in the battle for tougher immigration policies, leader of a nightly crusade to expose the misdeeds of those he views as elitist fools and scoundrels.
 Me: editorial writer whose views on immigration qualify, to Mr. Dobbs and many others on his side of the debate, as elitist, foolish and scoundrelly. 
 Meeting at the Four Seasons was his idea, to continue a long, civil and inconclusive phone conversation about immigration. I got there early and waited at Mr. Dobbs's banquette. I looked around the hushed room, full of dark suits and a wintry glow. Mr. Dobbs appeared and settled in, his drink, cranberry juice and seltzer, materializing at his right elbow. 
 In the spirit of the occasion, I ordered strictly within our borders: lobster bisque, filet of bison and New York tap water. He had the Dover sole. 
 Among people whose immigration views I admire, Mr. Dobbs has a reputation as a hopeless blowhard. I did not dwell on that at lunch. I was his guest, and I had seen what happens if you try to skewer him with insult or accusation. Mr. Dobbs is unencumbered by self-doubt. The granite fortress of his certitude is smooth and featureless, and whatever boulders you hurl at it will end up on your head. Besides, I was looking for something better than an argument. I wanted to convert him. 
 An honest person must concede a lot when arguing immigration with Mr. Dobbs: Yes, the borders and ports are insecure, and poor countries like Mexico have done too little to solve their economic and migration problems. Yes, illegal immigration hurts some Americans, globalization causes many global problems and big corporations love to stick it to the little guy.
 My point to Mr. Dobbs was that the little-little guy -- the ''illegal alien'' crossing our ''broken borders'' -- was the wrong target. His overriding emphasis on solving globalization's many ills by urgently sealing the borders strikes me as populism gone astray.
 First, it's ineffective, because the country will never be ziplocked as tightly as he wants it to be. The price of trying is too high, and it ignores the millions who enter the country legally but overstay. Most shamefully, it does nothing to resolve the fates of the 12 million undocumented already here.
 Second, the obsession with enforcement dovetails with the agendas of some nasty people: the nativists for whom immigration is a simple case of brown and white, of preserving ''American'' culture by keeping Latinos out.
 Third, it does too little to attack the evil corporate elites that are Mr. Dobbs's sworn enemy. What makes illegal immigrants so delectable to big, bad business is their illegality -- their willingness to work cheap and under the table. So why not legalize and tax them? Assimilate the good guys, as this country has always done, and save law enforcement for the bad ones. 
 The idea is to confront abusive corporate power with worker power. If day laborers end up in our suburbs, where the money and jobs are, then give them safe places to gather and help them work together to keep from driving wages and working conditions down. If companies take advantage of workers, empower the workers to fight back: as union members, legal residents, citizens.
 But that's ''amnesty,'' a Dobbsian expletive. It's the opposite of the crackdowns endorsed by him and the hard-liners he praises, like the Minutemen. 
 Mr. Dobbs listened graciously and budged not. He said he respected immigrants, even illegal ones, who he felt had gotten an unfair shake from their governments. He reminded me of his fondness for Cesar Chavez. 
 Then he repeated his immigration credo. It went like this: the 1986 immigration law was an amnesty promoted by corporate interests waging war on the middle class. Thus the 2006 and 2007 reforms were also amnesty, pushed by the same self-serving plutocrats. So nothing they want is worth doing -- at least not until the border is sealed. 
 That could be a long time. While we wait, I am going to keep trying to convince Mr. Dobbs that a comprehensive solution -- enforcement plus assimilation -- is the best expression of the populism he espouses. 
 Mr. Dobbs admits that mass deportation would never work, although if you press him on what to do about the 12 million, he has no answer. He wants to hold that question ''in abeyance'' until the border is sealed. I find that oddly passive for someone so convinced of the dangers from the aliens in our midst.
 I told him that, and he smiled. The lunch was over. I didn't wrestle over the check because there was no check, just a goodbye from the staff. I got my coat and walked with Mr. Dobbs to his car. We shook hands and I thanked him for the discussion. He made me promise to continue it. I assured him I would.

HEADLINE: Cellphone Carriers Test All-You-Can-Talk Menus

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
A PRICE war among cellphone carriers is giving users a chance to stop counting their minutes.
 In recent days, three large cellphone companies in the United States have introduced unlimited calling plans for $99 a month, a departure from the industry's longstanding approach of charging customers for each minute used over a monthly allotment. 
 The moves, by Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, are meant to turn cellphone use into an activity covered by a single predictable fee, like watching cable television. Sprint, the nation's third-largest carrier, says it is testing fixed-rate plans in four cities and evaluating its own nationwide flat-rate offering.
 The industry's sudden fixation with flat-rate pricing speaks to the toll wrought by furious competition. As the wireless carriers jockey for a stagnating pool of customers and focus on building broadband data networks to support e-mail and Web browsing, rates for voice calls are dropping and generating less revenue. The new plans also demonstrate how difficult it is for the carriers to distinguish themselves on price.
 With the new unlimited plans, ''the carriers are trying to find ways to hold the line on voice, since voice is the most predictable piece of service they sell,'' said Charles Golvin, a wireless analyst for Forrester Research.
 Investors, however, are worried that a deepening price battle could cut into profitability. Shares of AT&T are down 9.3 percent over the last two days, and Verizon shares are off 6.8 percent. Sprint shares are down 9 percent.
 The new $99 plans are not necessarily a good deal. An average consumer spends $63 to $77 for cellphone service, depending on the addition of data services like e-mail, according to a study by J. D. Power & Associates. 
 Instead, the fixed-rate plans are aiming for the small yet valuable group of customers who make lots of daytime calls. (Most plans already offer unlimited night and weekend calls.)
 Mr. Golvin said the industry was slowly but inevitably changing its old ways. ''Consumers aren't really all that happy with the metered approach,'' he said. ''Eventually that will go by the wayside, and we'll just get something like we have for broadband Internet access today: use as much as you want, just don't abuse our network.''
 Verizon, the nation's second-largest wireless operator with 65.7 million customers, began the shift early Tuesday when it announced its $99-a-month unlimited calling plan. Data services like Internet browsing and e-mail will cost extra, the company said.
 Verizon did not have the stage to itself for long.
 About five hours after the Verizon announcement, AT&T, the nation's largest carrier with 70.1 million subscribers, introduced an identical unlimited-calling plan. About a half-hour later, T-Mobile USA, a division of Deutsche Telekom with 28.7 million subscribers, announced its own fixed-rate plan, though with a slight difference: the $99 includes text, picture and instant messaging.
 Peter Dobrow, a spokesman for T-Mobile, said the plans would probably appeal to about 1 in 20 people. T-Mobile already offers and heavily promotes a form of unlimited calling: its MyFaves Plan, for $39.99 a month, lets customers make unlimited calls to five people.

HEADLINE: In All Corners, The Sons of Drago

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Wladimir Klitschko of Ukraine fights Sultan Ibragimov of Russia on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden to unify the heavyweight championship, or at least the shares that aren't held by Oleg Maskaev, another Russian, and Ruslan Chagaev of Uzbekistan.
 Welcome to New York, Wlad (holder of the International Boxing Organization belt) and Sultan (World Boxing Organization), but we do have to ask: When, exactly, did boxing's glamour division turn into the American marketing equivalent of Olympic weightlifting, or women's tennis with unshaved legs? 
 ''Impossible, who would ever have thought?'' Emanuel Steward, the famed Detroit trainer, now the brains behind Klitschko, said contemplating how the decades-long stronghold of proud African-American warriors and cultural icons was metaphorically requisitioned by Ivan Drago, conqueror of the late, great Apollo Creed, if not Rocky himself.
 ''Times are changing, like this right here, something I never thought I'd see,'' Steward said. He reached across the table for the front page of Wednesday's New York Post, starring a beaming Barack Obama, after another lopsided primary victory. 
 A quarter-century ago, before boxing became a prisoner of its own splintered, chaotic subculture, before the Soviet Union Communists went belly up, such a dramatic geopolitical shift affecting the heavyweight division might have filled stadiums across the United States for the inevitable challenges from the West. 
 But the sports landscape is nothing like it was in the days when most Americans believed that boxing had game. And as Ross Greenburg, the president of HBO Sports, lamented, the next great or even very good American heavyweight will have to appear ''out of the woodwork'' because ''there's a sense of an assembly line here to create great athletes for basketball and football, where size is a factor.''
 Hence, HBO will broadcast the Klitschko-Ibragimov fight live, and hope to attract viewers by leading in with the premier of a documentary on the Brown Bomber, Joe Louis.
 ''There is a fan disconnect,'' Greenburg said when asked about the Drago effect. ''Unfortunately, Americans do rally around their own.''
 These days, they may also go looking for some old-fashioned patriotic brawling inside those cages, or octagons, of ultimate fighting, the phenomenon that seems to have found a niche -- at least that's what I hear from people who know such things -- as a cross between boxing and wrestling.
 From outside the ring, or up on the American social mountaintop, shouldn't any significant abandonment of a dangerous and inherently exploitive sport as a preferred way up the economic ladder by African-Americans or other impoverished minorities be seen as progress? Isn't it much better to dream of being the big man in the White House, or at least on the proverbial Division I campus? 
 Steward, the boxing purist less interested in political correctness, doesn't necessarily believe that heavyweight trends have been all a matter of choice, at least not from potential participants in the sweet science. Young athletes will follow the scent of money, he said, and there is little invested in boxing in the United States, in comparison with Eastern European amateur and Olympic development programs.
 Agreeing with Steward was Boris Grinberg, Ibragimov's manager, who said, ''Boxing is not like tennis; it's for poor people.'' Reminded that Maria Sharapova was no golden-haired child of the country club, he pointed out that there are tennis sponsors aplenty once they locate the gifted and talented.
 ''Young boxers need the school to learn,'' he said. ''United States, they spend money for politicians, for Obama. They spend money for war.''
 Not for hand-to-hand combat, apparently. According to Steward, this has accelerated the pathway to the pros, corrupted learning curves and created a system that churns out fundamentally unsound American fighters. We've heard and made this case about basketball players, and witnessed the resulting international beatings at the hands of athletically inferior but better skilled and drilled teams.
 Of course, America still underwrites and operates the world's foremost celebrity mart, so perhaps heavyweight boxing is another reflection of a culture that has become more about consuming than creating, more about importing than developing. As Klitschko said when I asked him why this fight wasn't being held in Kiev or Moscow or even in Germany, where he has fought most of his bouts: ''I like to repeat the words of Frank Sinatra. 'If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.' ''
 He is a strapping man, 6-feet-5 inches, who speaks carefully enunciated English, is known for political and charitable causes and whose brother, Vitali, was a World Boxing Council heavyweight champion.
 Ibragimov, the opponent, is unbeaten in 23 pro fights with one draw, his last victory coming in Moscow last October against the ancient Evander Holyfield -- another reminder of the sad state of the American heavyweight.
 At first glance, he could almost pass for Russell Crowe playing James J. Braddock in ''Cinderella Man.'' And as far as Grinberg, Ibragimov's manager, is concerned, Klitschko -- ''a walking machine'' -- may as well be Max Baer, compared with his man, who has worked diligently to become more of a boxing technician, the anti-Ivan Drago.
 When selling one's self in America, it is always a good idea to embrace style over an old Soviet stereotype.

HEADLINE: A Strong Quarter at Hertz, Which Will Look for More Cuts

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Hertz Global Holdings, the car rental company, said Wednesday night that its fourth-quarter profit rose on an increase in worldwide car rental revenue, but said it expected to cut jobs and improve efficiency in order to generate savings. 
 The company said the results were achieved ''despite economic headwinds in the U.S. affecting demand and pricing in the car and equipment rental businesses.''
 It forecast annualized savings, before restructuring costs, of about $250 million in 2008.
 The savings will come from efficiency initiatives, including outsourcing certain jobs, re-designing work flows and other changes that will lead to job reductions during the year.
 Net income in the quarter was $80.7 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with $39.8 million, or 14 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.4 percent, to $2.14 billion.
 On an adjusted basis, Hertz earned 29 cents a share for the fourth quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 26 cents a share on revenue of $2.07 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Car rental revenue rose 7.5 percent, to $1.67 billion, driven by an increase in transaction days. Revenue from worldwide equipment rental was up 7.4 percent, to $468.1 million.
 Looking ahead, Hertz forecast 2008 revenue of $8.9 billion to $9 billion. It expects adjusted earnings of $1.38 to $1.44 a share.
 Analysts expect it to post a profit of $1.42 a share and revenue of $9.04 billion for the year, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Hertz operates 7,900 car rental locations and ranks as the largest airport-based car rental agency in the United States. It also rents tools and equipment. The company was spun off by Ford Motor Company in 2005.

HEADLINE: Moving Soon To an Apartment Near You

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
BROOKE BERMAN is living in Seventh Heaven this week. That's the name of the three dorm rooms that New Dramatists, a nonprofit center for playwrights housed in an old church on West 44th Street, offers its 49 artists-in-residence for short stays. 
 Ms. Berman, who is 38, has made her garret room cozy with familiar objects: a necklace of buttons hanging from a nail, her white iBook embellished with ''Charlie's Angels'' stickers and a collage of words and pictures torn from magazines, across the middle of which is glued the word ''HOME.'' 
 Having lived in more than 30 apartments in 20 years -- three of them in the last six months -- Ms. Berman is skilled at making herself comfortable almost anywhere very quickly. 
 ''I can make anything home,'' says Ruth, Ms. Berman's proxy and the central character in her latest play, ''Hunting and Gathering,'' presented by Primary Stages through March 1. ''A couple of books, a scented candle in a tin, some fresh flowers, and we're good.'' 
 (Sadly, candles aren't allowed in Seventh Heaven, as Ms. Berman pointed out, indicating a stern notice on a whiteboard outside her room.) 
 Starring Keira Naughton and Mamie Gummer, ''Hunting and Gathering'' presents the tentative, transient lives of three aging Gen X New Yorkers and a brash college student (Ms. Gummer, who is Meryl Streep's daughter) trained in the school of low expectations. It's a sitcom-light bildungsroman that uses real estate, or the lack thereof, as a metaphor for character. 
 The idea for ''Hunting and Gathering'' came in 2001 when Ms. Berman was asked by an arts organization to write a 10-minute play on the subject of home. 
 ''I listed every apartment I'd ever lived in,'' said Ms. Berman, who was 32 at the time and had 15 addresses behind her. ''I was interested in the juxtaposition between our home life and our ability to connect with other people. And I was just beginning to realize that after 30 an air mattress isn't charming.'' (She gives that line to Ruth, played by Ms. Naughton.) 
 Seven years later Ms. Berman finds herself in the same tentative state. Living on money from the odd grant, temp jobs and teaching positions, she is emblematic of her Gypsy tribe -- theater people are the original urban nomads -- and a vivid example of the increasingly precarious domestic life of an artist trying to live in New York. 
 Rent for a studio or a one-bedroom in the East Village, for example, has more than doubled in 10 years, said Douglas Hochlerin, a broker with Bond New York, a firm specializing in Manhattan rentals. Last year, when the rent on Ms. Berman's Mott Street one-bedroom, where she had lived for three years, rose to $1,550 from $1,350, she gave up her lease, beginning another bout of itinerancy, as she described it. 
 ''It's all about money,'' Ms. Berman said cheerfully. ''It's not like I have a penchant for the transient life.'' 
 According to Emily Morse, the director of artistic development at New Dramatists, ''two major things have changed as far as this city is concerned: the real estate market and the fact that very little money is going directly to artists.''
 She continued: ''You used to be able to work a 20-hour week, pay the rent on your tiny studio, and still write your plays. That's no longer possible.'' 
 New Dramatists, which Ms. Morse described as ''part hotel, for people who are in transient positions in their lives,'' allows its artists-in-residence to stay in the Seventh Heaven rooms for three weeks at a time. They are always full.
 Last year the Research Center for Arts and Culture at Columbia University published a study of visual artists over age 62 in New York City. Most of them live on incomes under $30,000 and nearly half live in rent-stabilized apartments or subsidized housing. 
 ''The minute they move or die,'' said Joan Jeffri, the director of the center, ''it's over for the younger artists, because they won't be able to afford to live here.'' 
 Ms. Jeffri was referring to the nature of rent-regulated housing, which in many cases can be brought to market rates when a tenant leaves. She sees New York ''losing its creative capital,'' she added, ''if housing is not made more affordable for artists.''
 And the grants that used to pick up the slack have either petered out or do not stretch far enough, Ms. Morse and Ms. Jeffri said.
 Since the culture wars of the 1980s and '90s, which led to the National Endowment for the Arts ending its financial support of individual artists in most disciplines, ''other more locally based organizations are trying to pick up the slack,'' Ms. Jeffri said. ''This is particularly difficult in an economy like the one we're in now.''
 THE period in which ''Hunting and Gathering'' was hatched was more or less typical of Ms. Berman's turbulent New York experience. 
 In early 2000 she was living in a three-bedroom share in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, working as an assistant for the playwright Maria Irene Fornes and as the research editor of Paper magazine. She was making a little over $1,000 a month. (She had just spent two years in a share in Park Slope, Brooklyn, renting from an Austrian dancer who watched TV all day and, she said, asked Ms. Berman's boyfriend out.) She won a $20,000 playwright's grant, the Helen Merrill award, that year. 
 ''I didn't leave my room for a week,'' Ms. Berman said. ''I was so stunned. I'd never had money in my life.''
 Ms. Berman grew up in Detroit and Chicago. Her father, whom her mother divorced when she was 4, was a once-successful stockbroker and gambler, Ms. Berman said, who died of cancer when she was 9. Her mother, a prodigy pianist turned publicist, with movie star looks and a great sense of humor, was debilitated by severe diabetes. 
 Ms. Berman stretched her grant for a year. ''I upgraded everything in my life,'' she said. ''I took cabs, I ate sushi.'' She moved in with a friend, a theater director whose father owned a loft on West Broadway. The two women paid the maintenance; Ms. Berman's portion was $600. 
 ''It was the kind of loft the elevator opened into,'' she recalled dreamily. There was a sunken black bathtub the size of a small country. ''It was an idyllic time. We had dinner parties, workshops and rehearsals there. I got an agent.'' 
 It was the last apartment her mother saw, ''which is good,'' Ms. Berman said, ''because it was beautiful.''
 Late in 2001 she was laid off from Paper, which lost much of its advertising in the wake of 9/11. The grant had run out. Her roommate found out she had leukemia; her parents moved into the loft so they could be near her. Ms. Berman moved into a friend's apartment on 103rd Street (he was away for a few months at a theater festival).
 ''I was right back uptown where I had started,'' said Ms. Berman, who came to New York at 18 to go to Barnard College. ''I felt like my contract with Manhattan had come full circle.'' 
 Fast-forward a few apartments (including a share with Michael Chernus, who stars in ''Hunting and Gathering,'' on East Seventh Street, which they decorated in bright colors -- ''Nouveau Sesame Street,'' Ms. Berman said). There was a great job teaching playwriting to ''dead-end kids, that's what their principals had called them,'' Ms. Berman said, and there was her own playwriting as well. Her plays were workshopped or produced in cities like Chicago, New Haven, Los Angeles and London.
 In 2004 she turned 35 and thought, ''I'm too old to be living like this.'' She sold the film rights to her play ''Smashing'' to Natalie Portman, wrote Ms. Portman a screenplay and moved into her first solo apartment, the Mott Street one-bedroom. She bought furniture: an armoire, a kitchen table, ''a rad shower curtain'' with a Marimekko-like print, and bright green velvet floor pillows from Urban Outfitters. Ms. Berman felt happy and settled. She signed up for Netflix, had people over for tea.
 Then, last October, the rent was increased, and Ms. Berman, who had been juggling five jobs at once to pay for her apartment -- ''it was absolutely worth it,'' she said, ''but it was a lot of work'' -- gave up the lease. Two of her plays were scheduled to be produced in New York, and she thought she would find a share and save some money, and also investigate Los Angeles, where she had a few movies close to production. ''I thought, I could get health insurance!'' 
 Her mother, meanwhile, who had been ''dying for a very long time'' (one leg had been amputated a few years earlier), became more gravely ill. Ms. Berman underestimated what it would feel like to live with strangers in a share under these circumstances. After six weeks she bailed. 
 There were two weeks at a friend's grandmother's in France. A brief stay in Seventh Heaven, with trips to Detroit. When New Dramatists closed for the holidays, Ms. Berman stayed on a friend's couch on Spring Street. Rehearsals for ''Hunting and Gathering'' began on Dec. 18. Her mother died the next day. Then it was back to New Dramatists (there is no limit to the frequency of stays in an artist's seven-year residency, just to their duration), save for a week in February, when she flew to Detroit to clean out her mother's apartment. 
 ''She saved everything!'' Ms. Berman said. ''My Girl Scout uniforms, my camp clothes. These stickers,'' she pointed to the ''Charlie's Angels'' stickers on her laptop. ''Every letter I ever wrote or paper I took a crayon to.'' 
 There was also $300 worth of Bobbi Brown cosmetics, bought by her mother two weeks before she died. ''My inheritance!'' Ms. Berman said proudly. ''There wasn't any money but there were these really great creams.''
 In two weeks Ms. Berman will head to New Hampshire for six weeks at the MacDowell Colony. Another play of hers is being produced in New York in the spring; she is hoping to find a share in the city for a few months, then make her way to Los Angeles.
 ''A couple of years ago I had a psychic reading,'' she said. ''She told me Los Angeles was a good place for me.'' 
 ''Then I said, 'Where's my partner?' And she said, 'You're married to your work.' '' Ms. Berman rolled her eyes.
 Last week, at a talk-back after a performance of ''Hunting and Gathering,'' an elderly man raised his hand. 
 ''I really liked the play,'' he said. ''But I don't understand any of it. When I got out of school I married and had three kids. I've lived in four apartments my entire life.'' 
 Ms. Berman said: ''He was really confused. He just couldn't relate.''

PERSON: Samuel Karlin 

HEADLINE: Samuel Karlin, 83, Versatile Mathematician

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Samuel Karlin, a mathematician who applied his theoretical brilliance to such far-flung areas as economics and population studies, before helping to find ways to analyze DNA swiftly and comprehensively, died on Dec. 18, in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 83.
 The cause was a heart attack, according to an announcement from Stanford University, where he taught for many years. His death was announced last month but was not widely reported. 
 During World War II, mathematicians descended from the ivory tower to mold esoteric theory into practical solutions that helped win the war. Dr. Karlin accelerated this trend after the war by contributing to deeper understandings in fields as diverse as game theory, demographics and inventory management.
 Not that he neglected pure mathematics. Dr. Karlin's contributions to the understanding of how random variables are governed by the laws of probability were highly influential. He also added to the study of how mathematical elements are arranged into sets.
 In 1973, the National Academy of Sciences honored Dr. Karlin for his lifetime achievements, and, in 1989, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.
 The breadth of Dr. Karlin's intellect was apparent in his vow to change his major line of research every seven years to stay fresh and learn new topics. At the age of 65, he helped write what may have been the most important of his 450 scientific papers.
 He and Stephen F. Altschul proposed a method for estimating similarities between the known DNA sequence of one organism with that of another. Dr. Altschul and other scientists then used this as the statistical underpinning for a widely used computer program called Blast, which almost instantly makes such comparisons. Blast, which stands for basic local alignment search tool, has been called the Google of biological research.
 Dr. Russ Altman, a professor of bioengineering at Stanford, said that Dr. Karlin's most important contribution was helping come up with a way to rank the DNA matches in statistical significance. Thus, when a DNA sequence of a fruit fly and a human match, which they can, it is possible to say that the chances of this being simply a random match are zero, Dr. Altman said.
 This method thus becomes a way of studying evolution. At some point, the fruit fly and the human had to have had a common ancestor, Dr. Altman said.
 Samuel Karlin was born in Poland on June 8, 1924, and moved with his family to Chicago at the age of 2 months. At 9 or 10, he started working in a store to help with the family's finances, and, at 15, he taught Hebrew.
 His father wanted him to become a religious scholar, but Dr. Karlin won a scholarship to the Illinois Institute of Technology, then earned a doctorate in mathematics from Princeton in 1947. After a stint at the California Institute of Technology, he arrived at Stanford as a mathematics and statistics professor in 1956.
 At Princeton, he studied with John von Neumann, a father of game theory, the branch of applied mathematics designed to capture behavior in strategic situations. Working for the RAND Corporation while also teaching at Stanford in the 1950s, Dr. Karlin applied game theory to the analysis of games of pursuit and evasion like a dogfight between warplanes. The 10 books he wrote or helped write included one on game theory in 1959. 
 Dr. Karlin did pioneering work in an area mathematicians call total positivity, in which he delved into the probabilities of an adjacent pair of particles in random motion not hitting each other. This had applications to voting behavior, among other things.
 In his later years, Dr. Karlin was more apt to call himself a biologist than a mathematician, although all his biological work was mathematical. He relished poring through genetic data looking for anomalies. Sometimes he found mistakes, as in 2001, when he publicly pointed out that Celera, the biotechnology company, and the University of California, Berkeley, had made many mistakes in spelling out the ''genetic letters'' of the fruit fly genome.
 Other times he found something new and intriguing in data. He often contacted the scientist who had assembled the data and ended up working on a paper with him. One such scientist was his son Kenneth, a chemistry professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who cooperated with his father in studying heavy metals in genetic material.
 In addition to Kenneth, Dr. Karlin is survived by his wife, Dorit Carmelli; his son Manuel of Portland, Ore.; and his daughter, Anna, of Seattle.
 Dr. Karlin guided more than 70 students, regarded as a high number, to their doctorates. He was known for the emotional force, not to mention volume, with which he argued scientific points.
 ''I would not say he was intellectually gentle,'' Dr. Altman said.

HEADLINE: As Oil Stays Above $100, Economic Concerns Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Crude oil prices settled above $100 a barrel for a second day on Wednesday. 
 Oil futures rallied again, pushing briefly past $101 a barrel after the Federal Reserve lowered its forecast for economic growth this year, which energy investors took as a sign that the central bank would cut interest rates. At the pump, average gas prices rose 2 cents overnight. 
 The contract for March delivery of light crude, which expired late Wednesday, rose 73 cents to settle at $100.74 in New York trading after rising as high as $101.32, an intraday record. On Tuesday, the contract jumped $4.51 a barrel.
 On Wednesday, crude prices fluctuated in part because of low trading volume. Trading in the expiring March contract was about 10 percent of the level of trading in April crude oil, which will become the front-month contract on Thursday. When volumes are low, price moves can be exaggerated. April crude settled unchanged at $99.70 a barrel after rising as high as $100.86 earlier.
 Despite the reality of $100 oil, there are concerns that high prices -- and the higher gasoline and heating oil prices they spawn -- are sowing the seeds of their own destruction by contributing to the economic slowdown.
 ''The price gains raise questions about their sustainability in the face of eroding fundamental strength,'' Antoine Halff, an analyst at Newedge USA, said in a research note.
 At the pump, gas prices rose 2.1 cents to a national average of $3.053 a gallon Wednesday, according to AAA and the Oil Price Information Service. In it weekly survey, the Energy Department said regular gasoline rose 8.2 cents last week to an average of $3.042 a gallon. 
 Retail gas prices, which typically lag the futures market, are following oil higher. Analysts and the Energy Department expect prices to peak this spring well above last May's record $3.227 a gallon.

 A Singular Designer
 Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street; (212) 217-4558. 
 ''Madame Gres: Sphinx of Fashion,'' an exhibition of 67 garments made by Madame Alix Gres, the Parisian designer, will be at the museum through April 19. Madame Gres was influential, and private in her work and personal life. She was known for the so-called ''goddess gown,'' a classically inspired pleated silk gown; for designing clothing inspired by ethnic garments like the sari, which is draped rather than sewn; and for the use of materials like lightweight taffeta or heavy wools to create a three-dimensional sculptural look for her coats and dresses. 
 ''Exoticism,'' an exhibition exploring the influence of non-Western styles, textiles, imagery and construction on fashion, continues through May 7. 
 Hours: Tuesday through Friday, noon to 8 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free. Information: fitnyc.edu/museum.

 Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park; (718) 592-9700. 
 Two exhibitions will take a look at the New York State Pavilion designed by Philip Johnson for the 1964 World's Fair. The open-air site included a depiction of New York State in the form of a Texaco road map measuring 130 feet by 166 feet, which was embedded in the terrazzo floor. 
 ''Back on the Map: Revisiting the New York State Pavilion at the 1964-65 World's Fair,'' which continues through May 4, looks at the pavilion and efforts to restore parts of the map. The exhibition includes photographs of the pavilion as it was in 1964 and the conservation efforts, which began in 2006. Visitors will be able to watch conservators at work. 
 ''Anthony Auerbach, Empire State Pavilion,'' also through May 4, is an installation of the map as it looked in early 2006. Mr. Auerbach documented the decaying floor, which had plants pushing up through the map, through a series of 2,500 aerial photographs.

HEADLINE: New South Korean Leader Cleared in Fraud Inquiry

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
A special prosecutor on Thursday cleared President-elect Lee Myung-bak of South Korea of fraud accusations, four days before his inauguration.
 The investigation had tainted Mr. Lee's landslide victory on Dec. 19. 
 ''The president-elect was not involved in stock price manipulation,'' the special prosecutor, Chung Ho Young, said in a televised announcement, clearing Mr. Lee of charges that he participated in a stock fraud engineered by his former business partner, Kim Kyung Joon.
 Mr. Lee, the first president-elect in South Korea to go through a criminal inquiry, called the investigation ''a waste of national resources.'' But he said he was pleased that he could now focus on his campaign promise of revitalizing the slowing economy.
 ''I am relieved that my new government can now start without burdens,'' Mr. Lee was quoted as saying by his spokesman, Joo Ho Young. Mr. Lee will be sworn in on Monday.
 The announcement on Thursday could hurt Mr. Lee's political opponents ahead of parliamentary elections in April. Mr. Lee's conservative Grand National Party hopes to win a majority in order to help push economic changes, aimed partly at corporate deregulation, and ratify a free trade agreement with the United States.
 Special prosecutors also said they found no evidence that Mr. Lee lied about his wealth or that the City of Seoul, where Mr. Lee was a mayor before the election, gave a lucrative land development deal to an unqualified company.
 The accusations had dogged Mr. Lee, South Korea's first president-elect from a business background, throughout his campaign. 
 Two weeks before the election, state prosecutors had cleared him of wrongdoing. But parliamentary opponents, citing what they said was new video evidence, voted two days before the election to set up an independent investigation. Nonetheless, Mr. Lee, 66, won in a landslide.
 Special prosecutors were given 40 days to investigate in order to finish before the inauguration.
 On Sunday, they questioned Mr. Lee for three hours in a secluded Seoul restaurant, which was once a geisha house -- a move that appeared intended to save Mr. Lee the embarrassment of being summoned in public.
 Critics cited it as a sign that the investigators might have felt intimidated to delve too deeply into the case.
 Mr. Kim, who was extradited to Seoul, is on trial on charges of stock manipulation, embezzlement and forgery.

HEADLINE: Work to Begin on Platform Over Tracks on the West Side

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Despite a flagging economy, Brookfield Properties says it will start work in June on a $600 million platform over railroad tracks near Ninth Avenue, where it plans to build two towering office buildings. 
 Brookfield, a major commercial landlord in Manhattan, has owned the property between Ninth and Dyer Avenues, between 31st and 33rd Streets, for more than 22 years. But it has had difficulty luring a prominent company to what has long been regarded as Manhattan's last real estate frontier.
 The company now says the time is ripe to begin work. Development is pushing westward, and the site is only one block west of Pennsylvania Station. The vacancy rate for Manhattan office buildings is still relatively low, and the credit markets should recover fairly quickly from the subprime mortgage crisis, said Richard B. Clark, chief executive of Brookfield. ''For a long time, we believed that the West Side would be the city's next commercial zone,'' Mr. Clark said. ''It's clear that the time is now to make something of this site.'' 
 Brookfield's project is no simple matter. More than half of the five-acre site is over railroad tracks, which extend from Pennsylvania Station to the West Side railyards. Brookfield must build a three-acre platform, while trains continue to run below, before it can start putting up its first building. It hopes to sign a major tenant during the two years the job is expected to take.
 Brookfield's architect, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, has designed two towers, a 1.9-million-square-foot building at the northeast corner of the site and a 3.4-million-square-foot building at the southeast corner.
 In many respects, the project is a warm-up for the West Side railyards, where five developers are competing for the development rights. At the railyards, between 10th and 12th Avenues, from 30th to 34th Streets, developers will have to build two 13-acre platforms, at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion. They would then have the right to build 12 million square feet of high-rise office and residential buildings. Brookfield is one of the companies expected to submit a second round of bids to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Tuesday. But with concerns about the economy growing, many real estate executives and government officials worry that developers may reduce their offers.
 Brookfield is not alone in pushing forward with new office projects. Even so, some real estate executives warn that some of those projects could be postponed, especially if the developer lacks an anchor tenant.
 Over the past five years, developers have largely ignored office projects in favor of erecting lucrative residential towers, even though the destruction of the World Trade Center sharply reduced available office space. In that time, developers built only 16 commercial buildings with a total of 14.4 million square feet, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. 
 As companies expanded, space became tight and commercial rents soared, with many prime buildings now fetching more than $100 a square foot in annual rent. So developers are once again putting up office towers, some without an anchor tenant. 
 SJP Properties is building a 1.1-million-square-foot tower at Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street. To the north, Boston Properties is excavating a site between 54th and 55th Streets for a 39-story, 1-million-square-foot building that is scheduled to be finished in 2010. A year from now, Boston Properties and its partner, Related Companies, plan to start a second tower, with 900,000 square feet, at Eighth Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets.
 ''We obviously continue to feel good about west Midtown,'' said Robert E. Selsam, senior vice president of Boston Properties.
 At the World Trade Center site, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is building the 2.6-million-square-foot Freedom Tower, and JPMorgan Chase has signed a deal to erect a 1.3-million-square-foot building nearby. And on Church Street, the developer Larry Silverstein is beginning work on what will be three 60-story skyscrapers with a total of 6.2 million square feet.

HEADLINE: Pressed for Time and Money, Americans Are Giving Up Golf

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The men gathered in a new golf clubhouse here a couple of weeks ago circled the problem from every angle, like caddies lining up a shot out of the rough.
 ''We have to change our mentality,'' said Richard Rocchio, a public relations consultant. 
 ''The problem is time,'' offered Walter Hurney, a real estate developer. ''There just isn't enough time. Men won't spend a whole day away from their family anymore.''
 William A. Gatz, owner of the Long Island National Golf Club in Riverhead, said the problem was fundamental economics: too much supply, not enough demand.
 The problem was not a game of golf. It was the game of golf itself. 
 Over the past decade, the leisure activity most closely associated with corporate success in America has been in a kind of recession. 
 The total number of people who play has declined or remained flat each year since 2000, dropping to about 26 million from 30 million, according to the National Golf Foundation and the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.
 More troubling to golf boosters, the number of people who play 25 times a year or more fell to 4.6 million in 2005 from 6.9 million in 2000, a loss of about a third. 
 The industry now counts its core players as those who golf eight or more times a year. That number, too, has fallen, but more slowly: to 15 million in 2006 from 17.7 million in 2000, according to the National Golf Foundation. 
 The five men who met here at the Wind Watch Golf Club a couple of weeks ago, golf aficionados all, wondered out loud about the reasons. Was it the economy? Changing family dynamics? A glut of golf courses? A surfeit of etiquette rules -- like not letting people use their cellphones for the four hours it typically takes to play a round of 18 holes? 
 Or was it just the four hours?
 Here on Long Island, where there are more than 100 private courses, golf course owners have tried various strategies: coupons and trial memberships, aggressive marketing for corporate and charity tournaments, and even some forays into the wedding business. 
 Over coffee with a representative of the National Golf Course Owners Association, the owners of four golf courses discussed forming an owners' cooperative to market golf on Long Island and, perhaps, to purchase staples like golf carts and fertilizer more cheaply.
 They strategized about marketing to women, who make up about 25 percent of golfers nationally; recruiting young players with a high school tournament; attracting families with special rates; realigning courses to 6-hole rounds, instead of 9 or 18; and seeking tax breaks, on the premise that golf courses, even private ones, provide publicly beneficial open space.
 ''When the ship is sinking, it's time to get creative,'' said Mr. Hurney, a principal owner of the Great Rock Golf Club in Wading River, which last summer erected a 4,000-square-foot tent for social events, including weddings, christenings and communions.
 The disappearance of golfers over the past several years is part of a broader decline in outdoor activities -- including tennis, swimming, hiking, biking and downhill skiing -- according to a number of academic and recreation industry studies.
 A 2006 study by the United States Tennis Association, which has battled the trend somewhat successfully with a forceful campaign to recruit young players, found that punishing hurricane seasons factored into the decline of play in the South, while the soaring popularity of electronic games and newer sports like skateboarding was diminishing the number of new tennis players everywhere.
 Rodney B. Warnick, a professor of recreation studies and tourism at the University of Massachusetts, said that the aging population of the United States was probably a part of the problem, too, and that ''there is a younger generation that is just not as active.''
 But golf, a sport of long-term investors -- both those who buy the expensive equipment and those who build the princely estates on which it is played -- has always seemed to exist in a world above the fray of shifting demographics. Not anymore.
 Jim Kass, the research director of the National Golf Foundation, an industry group, said the gradual but prolonged slump in golf has defied the adage, ''Once a golfer, always a golfer.'' About three million golfers quit playing each year, and slightly fewer than that have been picking it up. A two-year campaign by the foundation to bring new players into the game, he said, ''hasn't shown much in the way of results.'' 
 ''The man in the street will tell you that golf is booming because he sees Tiger Woods on TV,'' Mr. Kass said. ''But we track the reality. The reality is, while we haven't exactly tanked, the numbers have been disappointing for some time.''
 Surveys sponsored by the foundation have asked players what keeps them away. ''The answer is usually economic,'' Mr. Kass said. ''No time. Two jobs. Real wages not going up. Pensions going away. Corporate cutbacks in country club memberships -- all that doom and gloom stuff.'' 
 In many parts of the country, high expectations for a golf bonanza paralleling baby boomer retirements led to what is now considered a vast overbuilding of golf courses.
 Between 1990 and 2003, developers built more than 3,000 new golf courses in the United States, bringing the total to about 16,000. Several hundred have closed in the last few years, most of them in Arizona, Florida, Michigan and South Carolina, according to the foundation.
 (Scores more courses are listed for sale on the Web site of the National Golf Course Owners Association, which lists, for example, a North Carolina property described as ''two 18-hole championship courses, great mountain locations, profitable, $1.5 million revenues, Bermuda fairways, bent grass, nice clubhouses, one at $5.5 million, other at $2.5 million -- possible some owner financing.'')
 At the meeting here, there was a consensus that changing family dynamics have had a profound effect on the sport.
 ''Years ago, men thought nothing of spending the whole day playing golf -- maybe Saturday and Sunday both,'' said Mr. Rocchio, the public relations consultant, who is also the New York regional director of the National Golf Course Owners Association. ''Today, he is driving his kids to their soccer games. Maybe he's playing a round early in the morning. But he has to get back home in time for lunch.''
 Mr. Hurney, the real estate developer, chimed in, ''Which is why if we don't repackage our facilities to a more family orientation, we're dead.''
 To help keep the Great Rock Golf Club afloat, owners erected their large climate-controlled tent near the 18th green last summer. It sat next to the restaurant, Blackwell's, already operating there. By most accounts, it has been a boon to the club -- though perhaps not a hole in one.
 Residents of the surrounding neighborhood have complained about party noise, and last year more than 40 signed a petition asking the town of Riverhead to intervene. Town officials are reviewing whether the tent meets local zoning regulations, but have not issued any noise summonses. Mr. Hurney told them he had purchased a decibel meter and would try to hire quieter entertainment.
 One neighbor, Dominique Mendez, whose home is about 600 feet from the 18th hole, said, ''We bought our house here because we wanted to live in a quiet place, and we thought a golf course would be nice to see from the window. Instead, people have to turn up their air conditioners or wear earplugs at night because of the music thumping.'' 
 During weddings, she said: ''you can hear the D.J., 'We're gonna do the garter!' It's a little much.''

HEADLINE: Rising Inflation Limits the Fed As Growth Lags

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington, Michael M. Grynbaum from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, for all its power, faces tough new limits on its ability to keep the economy out of a recession.
 Even though the Fed cut short-term interest rates twice in January, home mortgage rates have edged up steadily in the last few weeks and credit for businesses is as tight as it was when financial markets seized up last August.
 On Wednesday, the central bank, led by Ben S. Bernanke, found itself facing hints of a problem that the United States has not seen in decades: stagflation, the mix of slumping growth, sharp spikes in oil and food prices and a rising pace of overall inflation. 
 The Labor Department reported that consumer prices jumped 4.3 percent in January, compared with one year earlier. That was the biggest jump in more than two years. Even after excluding the volatile prices for food and energy, inflation was up 2.5 percent -- well above the central bank's unofficial target of 1 to 2 percent. 
 A few hours after the report on consumer prices, Fed officials acknowledged that they had reduced their forecast for growth this year to an anemic pace of 1.3 to 2 percent and that joblessness was likely to climb to 5.3 percent, from 4.9 percent today.
 The Fed's outlook helped propel the stock market higher on the expectation that the central bank's more dismal outlook for the economy would lead to further interest rate cuts aimed at reviving growth. After being down earlier, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 90 points, or 0.73 percent, to 12,427.26, while the Nasdaq composite index erased an earlier 0.6 percent loss to end 0.9 percent higher. 
 The Fed's new forecast, however, assumes that growth will be all but stagnant for the first six months of this year before the economy gets a lift in the second half from the economic stimulus package Congress recently passed, as well as from the Fed's own decisions to lower interest rates sharply.
 Certainly inflation is nowhere near the double-digit rates of the late 1970s, and many economists agree with Fed officials that inflation will cool as the economy slows. 
 But the combination of rising prices and stalling growth, aggravated by the deepening downturn in housing and credit markets, has put the Fed in a box of its own making. 
 On one hand, officials are cutting interest rates in order to keep the economy growing at a time when oil prices are surging, credit is tightening and major financial institutions are shell-shocked from the housing and mortgage busts.
 On the other, the fear of rising inflation makes it more difficult for Fed officials to jolt the economy with another wave of cheap money. Lower interest rates have already pushed down the value of the dollar, which in turn prompted oil-producing countries to push for higher oil prices.
 ''They are walking a very fine line right now,'' said Stephen G. Cecchetti, a professor at Brandeis International Business School. ''They are trying to maintain their low-inflation credibility at the same time they are dramatically cutting interest rates. The facts are that growth is falling quickly, and that inflation is high and rising.'' 
 Nowhere have the Fed's limitations been more apparent than in the home mortgage market. Even though the central bank cut short-term interest rates twice in January, in part to stabilize the housing market, investors remained so worried about the longer-term outlook that mortgage rates have edged up steadily in the last three weeks.
 ''What's disturbing and scary is that the Fed is doing all the right things -- cutting rates, and saying they'll do more -- but it's not doing anything,'' said Michael Menatian, president of Sanborn Mortgage, based in West Hartford, Conn. ''We have hundreds of customers who want to refinance, but they're locked out.'' 
 Fed officials do not see themselves as powerless. The central bank stunned investors by reducing rates twice in January, once at an unscheduled emergency meeting on Jan. 22 and again at a scheduled policy meeting on Jan. 30. Those moves brought the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate down to 3 percent. 
 According to minutes of both meetings, released on Wednesday along with policy makers' latest economic projections, Fed officials were increasingly worried that plunging confidence in financial markets would lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy of tighter credit conditions, stalled activity in the broader economy and even more fear in financial markets. 
 Fed policy makers, according to the minutes, noted that credit was becoming harder to get for both consumers and businesses and that financial institutions were vulnerable to more economic weakness after booking huge losses on mortgage-backed securities. 
 ''Some noted the especially worrisome possibility of an adverse feedback loop, that is, a situation in which a tightening of credit conditions could depress investment and consumer spending, which in turn could feed back to a further tightening of credit conditions,'' the central bank said in its summary of the discussion.
 But at least some Fed policy makers were also worried about rising inflation. William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, dissented from the first rate cut on Jan. 21, and Richard W. Fisher, president of the Fed's Dallas bank, dissented from the second one on Jan. 30.
 The new Fed forecast, a compilation of the individual projections by Fed governors and the presidents of the regional Fed banks, anticipates that inflation will slow down in response to slower economic growth and that consumer prices will rise, from 2.1 percent to 2.4 percent this year. 
 Fed policy makers made it clear they were willing to reduce interest rates in order to prevent a serious downturn, even if inflation was slightly higher than they wanted, according to the minutes.
 ''As had been the case in previous cyclical episodes, a relatively low real Federal funds rate now appeared appropriate for a time to counter the factors that were restraining growth, including the slide in housing activity and prices, the tightening of credit availability and the drop in equity prices,'' the summary recounted.
 In a nod to the more aggressive inflation-fighting members on the Fed's policy-making committee, the minutes also noted that policy makers should be ready to reverse course rapidly if the prospects for growth improved.
 ''All this sets the stage for a difficult dilemma for the Fed,'' Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm in Princeton, N.J., wrote in a report to clients. ''The only sure way the central bank can keep inflation expectations subdued is to tighten monetary policy and raise interest rates until investors, employees and business leaders are convinced that prices will remain low and stable.''
 But Mr. Baumohl predicted that inflation would indeed moderate as Fed officials hoped, noting that major discount retailers like Wal-Mart had already reduced prices in anticipation of lower consumer spending.
 ''Pricing power is very limited in this environment,'' Mr. Baumohl said in an interview. ''If companies raise prices to keep up with higher costs, they risk losing market share. And once they lose market share, it becomes very expensive and hellishly difficult to get it back.''

 BODY:
8 P.M. (BBC America) RAMSAY'S KITCHEN NIGHTMARES The 120-seat Curry Lounge has recently undergone a million-dollar renovation, with decor right out of Bollywood. But the menu is do-it-yourself, which makes life more than difficult for the head chef, who must concoct unfamiliar dishes for each order. Here Gordon Ramsay, above right with the chef Zahir, tries to fix his first Indian restaurant. 
 6:30 P.M. (Cinemax) THE ONE PERCENT Jamie Johnson, a great-grandson of the founder of Johnson & Johnson and the Emmy-nominated director of the documentary ''Born Rich,'' in which several young heirs did the unthinkable and talked about their family money, focuses this time on the growing gap between the rich and everyone else in America. Specifically, he examines the 1 percent of society that controls nearly half of the nation's wealth. Among those offering their opinions: the economist Milton Friedman; the billionaire Adnan Khashoggi; Roy O. Martin, a Louisiana lumber tycoon who spends with the Bible as his guide; Chuck Collins, a great-grandson of Oscar Mayer who gave up his inheritance for moral reasons; and Bill Gates Sr., the father of the richest man in the United States.
 9 P.M. (NBC) THE CELEBRITY APPRENTICEDonald Trump sends the teams by helicopter to the QVC headquarters in Pennsylvania, where each must write, direct and produce a 10-minute live sales segment for the channel. Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. serve as their father's eyes and ears.

The patient wants his old life back, and that means suing the church that annulled his marriage. 
 10 P.M. (Fuse) LIVE THROUGH THIS There are comebacks, as this new music series documents, and then there are comebacks, like the one the Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx, right, experienced when, in December 1987, he was declared dead from an overdose before being revived with a shot of adrenaline to his heart.
 10 P.M. (NBC) LIPSTICK JUNGLE Wendy (Brooke Shields) decides to take her daughter to a Women in Media luncheon. Nico (Kim Raver) decides to slow down her affair.

HEADLINE: Brakes on a Foreign Deal

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Michael J. de la Merced in New York and Eric Lipton in Washington contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Does the ''America for Sale'' sign require a warning label?
 That would seem to be the case in light of the apparent collapse on Wednesday of a Chinese company's effort to purchase a stake in 3Com, an American maker of Internet router and networking equipment, in the face of Bush administration questions about the deal's national security risks.
 The proposed $2.2 billion deal had called for Bain Capital, a private equity firm based in Boston, to join with a Chinese company, Huawei Technologies, to acquire 3Com. The snag was that 3Com makes antihacking computer software for the military, among other things, and Huawei Technologies has ties to the Chinese military.
 A special federal panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, had been examining the national security risks of the deal. A person briefed on the talks said that at one point, 3Com offered to divest itself of the antihacking software unit, known as TippingPoint, but that the Bush administration was unswayed. 
 The concern in Washington was that the Chinese company would be able to alter the electronic equipment and computer software sold to the military in a way that made it less than 100 percent effective. ''It is easier to hide than it is to find,'' a United States official said about problems in software.
 Despite the collapse of the 3Com deal, American officials and specialists in the field said it would be premature to conclude that the United States had decided it needed to crack down on foreign investments, even in delicate technology areas.
 Last year, for example, there were nearly 2,000 mergers and acquisitions of foreign and American companies in transactions involving more than $400 billion, according to Thomson Financial. 
 Yet Cfius examined only 147 of the transactions for possible security violations. In nine cases, the companies withdrew from the process once concerns were raised, as 3Com did on Wednesday, though it hinted that it might still try to win approval down the road. 
 The person with knowledge of the 3Com talks, who was not authorized to comment, said that given the concerns of the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security, it was doubtful that 3Com could arrive at what is called a ''mitigation agreement'' to let the deal go through. Such accords usually involve safeguards, pledges and internal separation walls.
 ''We are very disappointed that we were unable to reach a mitigation agreement with Cfius for this transaction,'' said Edgar Masri, 3Com's chief executive, in a statement. He added that 3Com would seek ''alternatives that would address Cfius's concerns'' and continue to try to build its global networking business.
 The troubles of the 3Com deal cast new light on the committee, which consists of representative of 12 agencies and is led by the Treasury Department. The panel's mandate to block foreign investments was bolstered last year after criticism of its handling of the 2006 purchase of a company that operates American ports by a company in Dubai.
 The withdrawal of the bid by Dubai Ports World occurred not because the foreign investment committee rejected it but because of a torrent of criticism from Capitol Hill, around the same time that similar criticism of a deal by the Chinese state energy company to buy Unocal also led China to withdraw.
 The activities of the little-known committee have multiplied since 2006, in part because there are more foreign acquisitions and mergers involving American properties and companies and also because the buyers and sellers are increasingly alert to the fallout and choose voluntarily to submit their deals to the review process.
 ''There's no question that Dubai Ports World led to an increase in filings of transactions with Cfius,'' Clay Lowery, assistant secretary of Treasury for international affairs, said in an interview last week before the 3Com withdrawal.
 ''Cfius is a voluntary process,'' Mr. Lowery added. ''Any of the agencies that sit on the committee can request a filing, but most companies recognize that it's in their interest to file if the transaction might raise national security questions.''
 The Treasury Department would not comment on the 3Com situation.
 Meanwhile, the problems of the 3Com deal are sure to aggravate tensions with China. 
 This month, federal officials charged a Defense Department official with passing classified documents to China. In a separate case, the Justice Department arrested a former Boeing engineer in California on charges of economic espionage for the Chinese.
 Members of Congress have also asked the Bush administration to defend its decision last year to allow certain Chinese companies to import crucial military technologies without licenses, after a report by the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, an independent research group, charging that the companies have ties to the military.
 The 3Com deal had already drawn criticism in Congress from Republicans and Democrats, who cited a study by the RAND Corporation a few years ago outlining the ties between Huawei Technologies and the Chinese military.
 The RAND study said that the Chinese company had been founded by the man who is now its chief, Ren Zhengfei, a former senior figure in the People's Liberation Army. 
 American officials said his identity had led to particular concerns at homeland security, which began a cyber-security initiative recently.
 The questions being raised in Congress over the deal -- led by Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Senator John Kyl of Arizona, both Republicans, as well as many prominent Democrats -- made some people wary of another firestorm like the Dubai Ports deal of two years ago.
 ''It's hard to conceive that, at some senior levels in the administration, there wasn't an appreciation that if this were concluded favorably, there might be an adverse political reaction,'' said a Republican aide, who was authorized to speak as long as he remained anonymous. ''There are growing concerns about cyber-security, and it's a presidential election year.''
 China's increasing involvement in the United States economy, including the recent purchase by a Chinese government investment fund of stakes in the private equity firm Blackstone and in the investment banker Morgan Stanley, has aggravated concerns in Congress. But the Bush administration does not view these as threats to national security.
 In addition, foreign investors have been careful to make sure their investments are below the 10 percent threshold that would lead to questions of whether a foreign government would control the American-owned entity. The 3Com deal involved a stake of more than 16 percent by the Chinese company.
 Some lawmakers like Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, have suggested that the federal law should be expanded to allow the United States government to block foreign acquisition of companies in economically strategic areas, especially when the investors are foreign governments.
 But the Treasury Department adamantly opposes extending the curbs on foreign investments into areas that affect economic security as opposed to national security, though it says it will monitor growing foreign investments in whole sectors of the economy, even in the financial sector. 
 The major deals of the last several months in which sovereign wealth funds owned by foreign governments have bought sizable stakes in Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Blackstone, the Carlyle Group and others are thus not likely to be blocked by Cfius, accordingto most experts.

HEADLINE: City's Sweeping Rezoning Plan for 125th Street Has Many in Harlem Concerned

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The street may not be much to look at now, say people who grew up in Harlem during the 1950s and 1960s, but back then, 125th Street seemed like the bustling center of the world.
 At Moore's book shop, a lawyer named Thurgood Marshall was often seen browsing through volumes of African-American history, while at the corner of Lenox Avenue, Malcolm X could be heard proselytizing as a young boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, listened intently among the crowd. 
 Up the street, Aretha Franklin or Stevie Wonder performed periodically at the Apollo Theater, and Fidel Castro once conferred with Nikita Khrushchev over lunch at the Hotel Theresa. Blumstein's may not have been Macy's, but it did have black mannequins and, at Christmastime, a black Santa Claus.
 The street has long been in decline, though national chain stores like Starbucks have taken an interest in it more recently. Now the Bloomberg administration has proposed the most sweeping zoning changes for the street since 1961, when there was a citywide rezoning and 125th Street was at the heart of African-American cultural life. 
 The rezoning, which is expected to be approved by the city's Planning Commission in the coming weeks, is part of package of city plans that call for the thoroughfare to be transformed from a low-rise boulevard lined with businesses like hair salons and buffet-style soul food restaurants into a regional business hub with office towers as high as 29 stories and more than 2,000 new market-rate condominium apartments, as well as hotels, bookstores, art galleries and nightclubs. 
 The corridor between 124th and 126th Streets from Broadway to Second Avenue would be rezoned, which could ultimately force out more than 70 small businesses and their 975 workers and might lead to the razing of some of the street's century-old buildings. 
 Although the city has said it will not require any residents to move out, the proposal has caused widespread fear that thousands of longtime African-American residents will eventually have to move as the area becomes more expensive. Even now, some apartments in Harlem sell for $2 million or more.
 Still, even opponents of the plan agree that new development on 125th Street is necessary to reduce unemployment and to improve the area's $17,452 median household income, which is about one-third the rest of Manhattan, according to a 1999 Planning Commission report. 
 What opponents say they do not want is for the street, which has been an incubator for pioneering arts and social movements, to be turned into another Manhattan cookie-cutter strip with expensive shops and shaded by skyscrapers.
 ''One hundred twenty-fifth Street, like everywhere in the world, must change,'' said Dabney Montgomery, 84, an informal community advocate who has lived in Harlem for 52 years. ''But we are interested in change that will benefit the people of Harlem. The rezoning would make 125th Street into another 86th Street. That, we don't want.''
 Amanda M. Burden, chairwoman of the Planning Commission, who since her appointment in 2002 has presided over some of the most extensive rezoning undertaken for two generations, said she was not intent on making 125th Street another generic boulevard. 
 Ms. Burden said she had spent more time studying the 125th Street proposal -- including attending 30 to 40 meetings and walking the street on several occasions -- than she had on any other project, including Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and Columbia University's expansion in western Harlem. 
 ''It's one of the most renowned streets in the world, and there was a great time on 125th Street when people came from all over the world to enjoy its night life and culture,'' she said. ''It's not what it was.''
 Last year, the American Planning Association named 125th Street one of the ''10 Great Streets in America,'' calling it the ''Main Street of black American culture.'' 
 The street, the group said, has ''managed to maintain a strong identity through periods of tremendous population growth and infrastructural strain, disinvestment and urban renewal.'' 
 But residents, who often call Harlem a village and refer to 125th Street as its Main Street, say they worry that its personality will not survive rezoning. 
 ''This would be signing Harlem's death warrant,'' said Craig Schley, executive director of a group called VOTE People, which opposes the rezoning. ''It is part of the continuing 'Katrina-fication' of Harlem, carried out with a pen instead of a hurricane. They intend to remove people in this area, plain and simple.'' 
 Community Board 10, which represents central Harlem, voted against the 24-block rezoning last year, saying that the plan includes far too little housing that most Harlem residents could afford and that any new housing should be placed on 124th and 126th Streets because it would harm the commercial character of 125th. 
 The community board also said the proposed 29-story height limit was too high and would cause cultural fixtures like the Apollo Theater and the Studio Museum of Harlem to be dwarfed. There is currently no height limit on the street, but building height became an issue recently when developers unveiled proposals for skyscrapers along the street, including a 21-story building for Major League Baseball.
 ''Harlem is one of the few places left in the city where you can see the sky,'' said Franc Perry, the community board chairman. ''You're able to get some fresh air and see the sun, and it's not blocked by high rises.''
 City Councilwoman Inez E. Dickens, who represents central Harlem, said she was concerned about portions of the plan but believed the need for change was paramount. Ms. Dickens's position is critical to the prospects of the rezoning because most other council members would be unlikely to oppose her when the plan reaches the City Council.
 ''It is quite clear to me that in doing nothing, our village loses,'' she said. ''Keeping 125th Street as is only satisfies the status quo. If we are truly to affect the unemployment rate, especially amongst the young black and Latino males of our community, then we must pursue our involvement in inevitable change.'' 
 The street, which in recent years has emerged from a years-long decline symbolized by boarded-up storefronts, has served as both Harlem's Main Street and as a cultural touchstone for leading figures, including Bill Clinton, who has an office there.
 During a recent weekend day, with temperatures hovering around freezing, members of the Communist Party were recruiting on a corner of 125th Street while volunteers for various presidential campaigns were handing out fliers on the other side of the street. A group of Black Hebrew Israelites was denouncing white people near the Apollo, vendors were selling books, incense and DVDs they had laid out on the sidewalk, and a man opened his coat to display watches for sale. 
 Rap, gospel and soul music came from speakers set outside the street's small stores as visitors from Europe and Japan riding on red tour buses took it all in.
 While only a few years ago pedestrians on the street had been almost exclusively black or Latino, there are now significant numbers of whites and Asians who have moved to Harlem to find apartments more affordable than in much of the rest of Manhattan.
 Ms. Burden, the planning chairwoman, said the city's proposals would help maintain the street's vitality and culture by requiring large developers to set aside ground-floor space for arts and entertainment uses and by encouraging smaller developers to do the same through an incentive program. 
 Ms. Burden played down the notion of widespread displacement, saying that more than 90 percent of the housing in the area was ''rent protected,'' including the neighborhood's several large public housing complexes.
 The idea that the street needed development hit her, she said, when she attended a recent Roberta Flack concert at the Apollo with a friend who works on the street.
 After the concert ended, Ms. Burden said, she asked her friend where they should eat. ''Downtown,'' the friend replied. 
 ''There should be a million different eateries around there, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to frame and control growth on 125th Street,'' Ms. Burden said. ''The energy on the street is just remarkable, and it's got to stay that way.''

HEADLINE: That '70s Look: Stagflation

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

DATELINE: Lately, many people are hearing an echo 

 BODY:
-- faintly perhaps but distinctly audible -- of the stagflation of the 1970s.
 Even as economic growth sags, oil and gasoline prices are surging to new heights. Gold is on the rise, along with the prices of such basic commodities as wheat and steel. And on Wednesday, with the latest government report on consumer prices, there are signs that overall inflation, after years of only modest increases, may be breaking out of its box. 
 For the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, all this could not come at a worse time. With the credit markets in disarray from the collapse of the housing bubble, Mr. Bernanke is cutting rates in a headlong rush to blunt the risks of recession.
 But in putting its emphasis above all on reviving growth, America's central bank, according to some economists and even a few Fed officials, may face a bigger inflation problem down the road. 
 ''They are cutting rates with a bill to be paid later,'' said John Ryding, chief United States economist at Bear Stearns. ''The question is not, will we get inflation, but how much will it cost to stuff the genie back in the bottle. This has the feel of 1970s stagflation.''
 Over the last 12 months, consumer prices are up 4.3 percent on average, according to the Labor Department. The core index of consumer price inflation, which excludes food and oil, was 2.5 percent higher in January than a year earlier, significantly above the Fed's unofficial comfort zone of a 1 to 2 percent underlying inflation rate. That's a far cry from the double-digit inflation rates that battered the economy at times in the 1970s, but still worrisome. 
 Analysts like Mr. Ryding say that by tolerating such price rises and maybe even allowing them to escalate, the Federal Reserve is risking its hard-won credibility as an inflation fighter, which will ultimately require it to push up interest rates higher than otherwise to contain the damage.
 Most economists still expect the Fed's policy-making committee to cut interest rates again when it meets on March 18, engineering its sixth reduction since September. But the fears of a revival of inflation underline the difficult decisions it now faces. 
 Like the Fed, economists generally remain more concerned about the immediate threat of recession than the more distant fear of higher inflation. Recent data suggests an economy that may be in a downturn or close to it. The consensus view is that the expected slowdown is likely to create enough spare capacity to suck inflationary pressures out of the economy.
 Moreover, even if some additional inflation is a side effect of the Fed's prescription, many economists say, it sure beats the alternative. Once the interest rate cuts have nursed the economy through the next few difficult quarters, they say, the Fed can easily raise rates again to respond to any pickup in inflation.
 ''They are going to fix the wound now,'' said David Durst, chief investment strategist of the Global Wealth Management Group of Morgan Stanley. ''They are going to take care of the growth situation and then fight inflation when the economy gets stronger.''
 Reinforcing this view, there are few signs that inflation is seeping into the labor market and pushing up wages in anticipation of higher prices to come.
 That may be comforting to the Fed, but keeping inflation contained still may not be easy. In recent days some officials at the central bank have gone out of their way to warn that they are not prepared to let down their guard -- even if it means that the Fed has to be less aggressive about cutting interest rates. 
 In a speech this month, Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said ''the Fed has to be very careful now to add just the right amount of stimulus to the punch bowl without mixing in the potential to juice up inflation once the effect of the new punch kicks in.''
 Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, echoed that view, saying in a speech that ''we cannot be confident that a slow-growing economy in early 2008 will by itself reduce inflation.''
 ''As we learned from the experience of the 1970s,'' Mr. Plosser added, ''once the public loses confidence in the Fed's commitment to price stability, it is very costly to the economy for the Fed to regain that confidence.''
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Plosser explained that the Fed seemed to be making progress against inflation in the first half of 2007 but he started to become more worried during the second half.
 ''Since the summer almost all of the measures of inflation that we look at have begun to accelerate again, and in some cases pretty sharply,'' Mr. Plosser said. ''Perhaps the inflationary pressures are more broad-based than just energy.''
 While Mr. Plosser said he hoped that inflation was about to moderate on its own, ''we do have a dual mandate after all -- one is price stability and the other is growth.''
 ''We can't just throw one out of the window when it is convenient.''
 To Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, such talk is seen on Wall Street as a clever tactic intended to help jawbone inflationary expectations downward while the Fed continues to cut rates for at least a while longer.
 ''We expect Fed officials will ramp up their rhetoric in speeches and in testimony that they will work diligently to keep inflation expectations under control,'' Mr. Baumohl wrote to clients after the latest consumer price figures were released Wednesday. ''Mere words, to be sure. But it would be a mistake to construe them as hollow.''
 Zach Pandl, an economist at Lehman Brothers, said that the statements so far have been by less important Fed officials and that the Fed's real views should be measured by its actions, which are to cut rates aggressively with less concern about inflation.
 Those actions have led a number of economists to warn that the Fed's aggressive easing moves, combined with the strong demand for industrial and agricultural commodities from emerging global economic powers like China and India, may be laying the groundwork for a new era of rising inflation.
 ''The period of falling inflation that we have been in for all the '80s and '90s and early 2000s has come to an end,'' said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research and trading firm in Greenwich, Conn. ''That is over.''
 Mr. Darda points to the surge in commodity prices, including food and oil. Long-term rates are rising in the bond market, reflecting the view that both growth and inflation may pick up later this year and into 2009, as well as fears about bad debt.
 And, according to Mr. Pandl, a measure of investors' inflation expectations provided by the difference between the yield on normal Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities ''spiked quite a bit higher'' after the Fed cut rates in January even though it ''has been trading lower since then.'' 
 Then there is gold, which has historically been a refuge for investors seeking protection from eroding currencies. 
 Gold ''has risen a lot since the Fed began lowering rates,'' Mr. Darda said. ''That's an ominous sign. Once we are in 2009 and 2010, we are going to figure out that inflation is far less benign.''

HEADLINE: A Gaping Divide: Straddling Capitalism's Fault Line

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Jamie Johnson, an heir to the pharmaceutical fortune that bears his family's name, has made a career out of retailing his wealth guilt, and so far the results have been anything but shameful. In ''Born Rich,'' shown on HBO in 2003, young people living on ancestral largess spoke -- insightfully, candidly, obnoxiously -- about the joys and agonies of their circumstances. The film garnered Mr. Johnson two Emmy nominations, and he deserved them. It also won him a chance to try his hand again, this time with ''The One Percent,'' another documentary, which arrives with the goal of examining the great, gaping disparity in wealth that severs the American soul. 
 To accomplish his current mission (the film will be shown Thursday on Cinemax), Mr. Johnson moved from Regency-style rooms to cracked sidewalks, extending himself to capitalism's biggest beneficiaries and poorest victims. That he probes the first camp with greater depth says a lot about the comfort he feels among his own kind, even as the film tries to persuade us of his disillusion. 
 Mr. Johnson triumphs when he titillates. Although he sits down to speak seriously about economic inequity with the likes of Ralph Nader and the former labor secretary Robert B. Reich, he reaches the heights of his reportorial talent extracting offensive expressions of cluelessness and self-satisfaction from the moneyed and powerful. 
 Here is the Kinko's founder Paul Orfalea on why he wouldn't mind getting even richer: ''Well, one day I'd like to go to the Moon and look at the planet Earth and say, 'Wow, there's part of my portfolio.' '' The Michael Moore fantasy just keeps going. Here is Mr. Orfalea talking about his random acts of charity: ''I don't usually give homeless folks money. Unless a homeless person is playing music or trying to better themselves, selling pencils or doing something, I generally don't do much.'' 
 There is a chance that these comments have been taken out of context. For all we know Mr. Orfalea may be financing six orphanages in Rwanda right now, but whatever the truth of his philanthropy, his remarks give substance to the prejudice that the extraordinarily well off behave obliviously and as if immune to judgment.
 That rich people get in trouble by talking too much was made evident in Mr. Johnson's previous film. In a particularly surprising moment we learn that Nicole Buffett, a granddaughter of Warren E. Buffett who works as a household organizer for a wealthy family in San Francisco, has been excommunicated by her grandfather simply for participating in Mr. Johnson's current project. She holds a letter from him explaining that he no longer considers her part of the family.
 Mr. Johnson's film suffers from his insistence on trying to get his father, James Loring Johnson, to talk about his wealth. He has no interest, and Jamie Johnson's badgering winds up seeming like the pestilence borne of entitlement. When the family's asset manager, Brian McNally, gets him to back off by calling him ''an arrogant trustifarian,'' you're just not sad.
 Such immaturity turns up elsewhere, primarily when it seems that Mr. Johnson thinks he is telling us something we don't already know. The film's implicit presumption is that the viewer has very little idea that a tiny percentage of the American population -- the 1 percent -- controls the majority of the wealth, and that poor people suffer because of it. The cuts between images of lives high and low (he goes to private clubs and Palm Beach; he interviews people in the projects on the South Side of Chicago and flashes scenes of a post-Katrina New Orleans) are so abrupt and jarring that the film almost seems to be saying: ''Like, Omigod! There are all these people who play croquet, and then there are, like, these guys who don't have anything and are forced to drive cabs.'' 
 But ''The One Percent'' compels despite its many simplicities, showing, for instance, how sugar titans in this country have bought enough political influence to reap millions and millions in government subsidies as they trample the Everglades and exploit workers. Mr. Johnson is a young heir who isn't out trying to name a fragrance after himself. And he cares, even if naively, about something that truly matters.

HEADLINE: Reality-Based Rate Cuts

 BODY:
Since last summer, when the financial markets began to crack, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has taken his share of criticism. When he didn't immediately cut interest rates, he was accused of being too timid. When he cut aggressively last month, critics said he had panicked. 
 Criticism comes with the job. And now that he's shown that he can take the hits, Mr. Bernanke would do the markets a favor by making it clear that if inflation continued to rise, he would have to raise rates far sooner than Wall Street would like. That dose of reality may be the only way to avoid a whipsaw in the market that could negate much of the good from the rate cuts. 
 If price pressures continue to build -- and the latest data show no letup -- Mr. Bernanke may have to raise rates rapidly beginning later this year. In the minutes of the Fed's meeting in January, released on Wednesday, some Fed officials noted the inflationary dangers. Others seemed to dismiss the risks, believing that a slowing economy would automatically relieve price pressures. 
 That could be wishful thinking. Globalization, once a force for driving prices down, has taken an inflationary turn. This week, oil prices have repeatedly closed above $100 a barrel, driven by global demand and a weaker dollar. Consumer prices in January were 4.3 percent above their level a year earlier, one of the largest year-over-year increases in years. Import costs also grew last month, at an annual rate of 13.7 percent, the highest since the Labor Department began keeping records in 1983. 
 Higher inflation -- and higher interest rates -- could lead to slower growth. So the challenge for policy makers is to find a way to lessen the impact of a slowdown today, without simply pushing off a contraction until next year. The Bush administration and Congress have not inspired confidence with their recently passed stimulus package. The White House insisted on putting tax rebates at the center of the effort, and Democratic lawmakers went along. Rebates will provide a boost by pumping cash into the economy. But they are much less effective than other measures that could have been taken. 
 Today's economic problems are complex. But playing down the dangers only leads to confusion, false hope and half-measures that may fit a political agenda but are poor economics. Resolving the problems with the least amount of pain would be easier if policy makers -- and candidates -- were frank about the tough times ahead.

HEADLINE: 2 Superdelegates Declare For Obama in New Jersey

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama won the backing of two additional superdelegates from New Jersey on Wednesday, including one who had declared for his opponent in the Democratic presidential race, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 State Senator Dana L. Redd of Camden, who had backed Mrs. Clinton, said she switched because Mr. Obama's growing support had convinced her that Mr. Obama was the best choice to win the general election and lead effectively as president. 
 Donald Norcross, a labor leader and co-chairman of the powerful Camden County Democratic organization, who had been uncommitted, said that Mr. Obama's strong campaign and ability to attract voters from a wide array of demographic groups indicated that he could assemble the kind of coalition needed to change the tone in Washington.
 ''We need to seize this momentum, attract a new generation of leaders to our party, while rallying behind the candidate who can best unite the country during these uncertain economic times,'' said Mr. Norcross, a member of the Democratic National Committee and president of the South Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''That candidate is Senator Barack Obama.''
 As a senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton has had the backing of most of New Jersey's Democratic establishment, including Gov. Jon S. Corzine and most members of the Democratic Congressional delegation. Senator Clinton handily won New Jersey's primary on Feb. 5, earning 59 pledged delegates to 48 for Mr. Obama. 
 The week before the vote, Mr. Norcross and the Camden County organization sponsored a campaign appearance by former President Bill Clinton, who was campaigning for his wife.
 Since then, however, Mr. Obama has won 10 straight primaries and shaken loose the support of an assortment of prominent Democrats.

HEADLINE: On a Battlefield of Civil Rights, Race Fades for Some Voters

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: CULLMAN, Ala. 

 BODY:
The racial breakthroughs have come gingerly in Alabama over the years: a black mayor there, an old Klansman put on trial here, a civil rights memorial there. 
 And a few weeks ago, voters in a county that is more than 96 percent white chose a genial black man, James Fields, to represent them in the State House of Representatives. It is a historic first, but the moment is full of awkwardness. 
 ''Really, I never realize he's black,'' said a white woman in a restaurant, smiling.
 ''He's black?'' asked Lou Bradford, a white Cullman police officer, jokingly. 
 ''You know, I don't even see him as black,'' said another of Mr. Fields's new white constituents, Perry Ray, the mayor of one of the county's villages, Dodge City. 
 A woman congratulates Mr. Fields as he stops in traffic, and afterward, he shakes his head ruefully: ''Sometimes, I have to pinch myself: 'Am I really black?' ''
 Yet in a state once synonymous with racial strife, there is no denying this milestone, for all its tentativeness. Everyone -- the voter in Cullman, the Alabama politician, the local historian -- is rubbing his or her eyes, a little. 
 ''It strikes me as a real watershed event,'' said Samuel L. Webb, a historian at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
 Last fall, another black man, Eric Powell, was elected to the Mississippi State Senate from a district that is more than 92 percent white, and no one could find a modern precedent for that, either. Mr. Fields and Mr. Powell are Democrats who decisively beat white candidates in districts that traditionally support Republican presidential candidates.
 Inevitably, there are questions about what this might mean for Senator Barack Obama's candidacy in the Deep South, and the quick answer, perhaps, is not that much, at least in Cullman County at this moment. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton beat Mr. Obama here, by a margin of four to one, in the Democratic primary this month, as many here readily point out. 
 Yet there are parallels. The very quality that voters here highlight, in so many words, as one of Mr. Fields's more attractive attributes -- that they are at ease with him -- is one of Mr. Obama's most important selling points. The implications are not lost on State Senator Zeb Little, the majority leader in the Alabama Senate and a Democratic power broker in Cullman: black politicians can win in unlikely districts, transcending history and partisan politics, if voters can see them as one of their own.
 ''James is comfortable around white people, and white people are comfortable around James, and you see the same thing with Obama,'' Mr. Little said. (He had asked Mr. Fields not to run, he recalls, because he did not think a black candidate could win.)
 Granted, the peculiar local circumstances at play in these elections are not readily duplicated in a national election. Mr. Fields and Mr. Powell were enmeshed in their communities -- hometown heroes, well before their elections. Mr. Powell, 41, was a football coach in the local schools in Corinth, Miss., and had played at the University of Mississippi; Mr. Fields, 53, is a former marine and part-time Methodist minister who worked in the unemployment office here for years, helping many find jobs. He served on the board of the local electrical cooperative, was active in the Boy Scouts and was a high school basketball star. 
 ''He's a dadgum good fellow,'' said W. F. Davis, a retired boilermaker, at Jack's, a roadside restaurant here, as Mr. Fields basked in congratulations nearby. ''He's always been one of us.''
 The distinction between ''one of us'' and something else, of course, is always present in a county where Mr. Fields still sees Confederate flags dotting the landscape.
 ''There's two different races, in that race,'' explained James Rice, a white resident describing black people, as Mr. Fields affably worked voters at Jack's. ''You got some that don't want to be nothing, and you got some that want to help. You don't find too many like James Fields.''
 Still, with many voters here, Mr. Fields has a personal bond dating to the days before new factories brought a measure of prosperity. Voters -- rural white Alabama voters -- smilingly approach the big, open-faced man; they hug him and joke with him.
 ''When their sons and daughters needed jobs, they said: 'You go see James Fields. You go see that black man down there,' '' Mr. Fields recalled. ''When I returned from college, my whole life was centered around helping people. I was a public servant,'' he says -- a description readily echoed by many he encounters here. 
 For unsavory historical reasons, it could easily have turned out differently in a county that is almost entirely white. Mr. Fields inherited a bitter racial legacy, one he is conscious of though unsoured by. If you drove into Cullman 70-odd years ago, you might have happened on ''a neatly-painted sign'' by the roadside, as the New York writer Carl Carmer described it in his book, ''Stars Fell on Alabama,'' one bearing a chilling and crude inscription telling blacks: ''Don't Let the Sun Go Down on You in this Town.''
 It had always been a place of few blacks because there were few plantations, and the whites wanted to keep it that way. The sign has long since passed into half-remembered folk memory. But the sentiments behind it lingered; the Ku Klux Klan and Citizens Councils were strong in these hills, and blacks in Cullman were effectively confined to a forlorn hillside hamlet known as The Colony, which is where Mr. Fields grew up. 
 Still, the racial legacy is complicated, as it is everywhere in Alabama: Cullman was also the home base of Gov. James E. Folsom, whose moderation on race helped damage his career in the 1950s. 
 Matter-of-factly, Mr. Fields recounts an early history hemmed in at every turn by racism, at least until high school years. 
 In town, on Saturdays, ''you didn't try anything on.''
 ''You'd look at stuff,'' he said. ''We literally had nothing going to the cotton fields, picking cotton, beans.'' 
 His father worked the night clean-up crew at a poultry-processing plant. And ''beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' he said, blacks knew they were unwelcome in the white, white town of Cullman. 
 When integration came to the schools in the mid-1960s, no one was eager to embrace the black students. ''We were up for auction: who wants the colored people,'' Mr. Fields said, recalling that only a school in another town would accept them. His parents made him travel a back road to avoid trouble; he vividly recalls driving up on a Klan rally as a young man.
 But then, in high school, things changed. His athletic prowess earned him friendship among white peers; when rival football teams yelled racial epithets at him, his own classmates protectively retaliated. 
 All his life, Mr. Fields says calmly, he has had to deal with white people, in the fields, at school, and at work. Mr. Powell had a similar experience. 
 ''I spent more time, as a kid, growing up with my white friends in their homes,'' Mr. Powell said. In a county that is 98 percent white, ''we were always around each other,'' he said. 
 People in Cullman talk about Mr. Fields's excellent connections in the state capital, Montgomery -- he once served as assistant director of the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations -- but they also speak, hesitantly, about sloughing off an age-old burden. 
 As Rob Werner, the owner of an outdoor-goods store here, put it: ''People said, 'Of course, James is black. This is great, this will get this off our back.' ''

HEADLINE: In Little Little Havana, Not Quite as Much of a Cuban Feel

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: UNION CITY, N.J. 

 BODY:
 As might be expected, Fidel Castro's retirement announcement on Tuesday occasioned much reflection on the past, many wistful remembrances of happier times and different eras in this town at the heart of the nation's largest Cuban community outside South Florida. As might not be expected, the subject was often not Cuba. It was Union City.
 Mr. Castro's announcement was certainly big news for many people in what is sometimes called Little Little Havana, where at its peak more than 90 percent of the businesses on the main drag of Bergenline Avenue were Cuban-owned. And so the television trucks and reporters from as far away as the newspaper from Catalonia, Spain, descended on Pan Con Todo, Las Americas and El Artesano, local restaurants where people gather for Cuban fries, pan con bistec, cafe Cubano and dulce de leche. 
 These days, though, locals are as likely to be found at the Noches de Colombia restaurant or the Euro Barcelona bakery. They might wander into the Oro Italiano jewelry store where Daniel Perez, the Puerto Rican Muslim behind the counter, greeted Marcial Villanueva, who is from Peru and stopped by after leaving work. 
 They might shop at the Chinese-owned Glory Shoes, the Shanghai Comforter Import Company or one of the many storefronts where immigrants send money back home to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
 Union City is still a vital, bustling center of Latin culture. Even the sign for Joe's Pizza promises ''Pollos a la Brasa.'' But once dominated by Cubans, it is now a hodgepodge of the Latin, and sometimes Asian, diasporas. It's not quite New Jersey's answer to Little Italy, a place defined by what it once was. Still, ask Victor Bas, who owns El Waterloo clothing, the store his father opened in 1967, about things now and he shrugs: ''There's a lot of 'used to be' around here.''
 He still sells guayaberas and linen shirts in bright colors -- ''happy clothes'' -- to Latin immigrants. But the days when the stores on Bergenline Avenue were, like his father's, named for well-known businesses in Cuba are long gone. ''Back then it was more Main Street, U.S.A., or maybe Main Street, Havana,'' he said. ''Now it's more diverse, more hectic. To be honest, I miss the old days.''
 The Cubans are hardly gone. You can wander into a shop where the elderly owner waves away an interview request but looks at the television showing news of Mr. Castro's resignation and spits out ''asesino'' -- assassin. Cuban men gather in front of Las Americas or at the Jovenes Unidos social club to talk politics. Cubans have most of the economic power and own much of the real estate.
 But at the Cuban-American National Council, a social service agency, Lucia Gomez said the clientele now runs the gamut of nationalities. She remembers growing up in town, her mother Cuban, her father Mexican, when Cubans dominated Bergenline Avenue. According to the Census Bureau, the population was 31.8 percent Cuban in 1980. It was 11.6 percent in 2006.
 Now, she said, the mayor is Anglo, the Colombians and Dominicans are rising political powers, and the city government seems inclined to name schools or other institutions after Cubans as a gesture of respect to make up for their decline in actual influence.
 ''In the past, you could never imagine seeing a Che Guevara shirt on Bergenline Avenue,'' she said. ''Now, sometimes I see them, and I have to laugh. I said, 'Oh, my God, you haven't been lynched yet?' But I guess you can wear that now.''
 Part of what has happened is just generational. Mr. Castro managed to outlast most of his enemies, who have died or retired to Florida. Those left behind are of a different generation. 
 So Daniel E. Marrero, a graphic designer, has made Pan Con Todo into a hip take on Cuban themes, from the cool turquoise neon out front to the nostalgic retro artwork and pre-Castro artifacts and crafts inside. It feels more like a SoHo Cuban restaurant than a Union City one. 
 He knows the announcement of Mr. Castro's retirement can't be the same experience for him as it was for his father, who was jailed before fleeing Cuba. 
 ''They lived it, they lost it, they lost everything,'' Mr. Marrero said. ''I could never really know what it was like.''
 And for many inside, Mr. Castro is already old, old news. Carlos Rodriguez, half Ecuadorean and half Colombian, is more interested in what looks to him like this generation's Castro, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, and in Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, who strikes him as a Chavez imitator.
 Even Mr. Marrero's mother, Isabel Diaz, 57, who fled Cuba at 17, finds herself talking about Mr. Castro and Little Little Havana in the same way: products of a moment in time that passed without you quite knowing it. She gets nostalgic about the place and, despite herself, doesn't seem to summon up rage for the man.
 ''Oh, he had charisma,'' she said of Mr. Castro. She was sitting at the counter of the restaurant with her son's banana tree and nostalgic art of 1950s Cuban baseball behind her. ''He was evil. But that brain. That brain. There was no other brain like his.''

HEADLINE: Go On A Savings Spree

BYLINE: By DALTON CONLEY. 
Dalton Conley, the chairman of New York University's sociology department, is the author, most recently, of ''The Pecking Order: A Bold New Look at How Family and Society Determine Who We Become.''

 BODY:
CONGRESS has passed and President Bush has signed legislation to rescue the economy from the jaws of recession. The $168 billion package, which includes an effort to increase consumer spending by distributing $600 rebates to individuals, can be faulted in many ways: with two wars and a budget deficit the nation can't really afford it; it will probably arrive too late in the business cycle to actually make a difference; and the near-universal aspect of the rebates doesn't make much sense. But the most fundamentally troubling thing is the premise that while consumer overspending got us into this mess, more will get us out of it. This is akin to the old saw about curing a hangover with the hair of the dog that bit you. 
 What if instead of giving rebates we helped create an investor society by seeding universal investment accounts? This would not only pump cash into the economy, through the slightly more indirect route of investment, it would also help us correct some of the near-fatal flaws in our long-term economic landscape. 
 The recent slowdown in gross domestic product growth is only a symptom of recession, not the cause. While there are many things to blame for the current crisis -- most notably the subprime mortgage mess -- one factor that has received little attention is America's low savings rate. In 2005, net private savings in the United States were negative. In other words, we were spending money that we didn't have, chipping away at our national wealth. 
 The last time the savings rate dipped into the red was during the Great Depression. At that time, of course, it made sense not to save. Joblessness was high and money scarce; we needed to dip into our kitty to survive. But our negative savings during the Bush boom had a different cause. Evidently, we felt so flush with (paper) gains in the stock and housing markets that we spent money as if there were no tomorrow. 
 Republicans have long argued that the way to stimulate long-term growth is by promoting investment over spending. Hence their perennial efforts to lower taxes on capital gains, dividends and corporate profits. But whether such policies actually stimulate increased investment is open to debate, since the wealthy folks who gain most from these tax reductions are probably already investing their money. And the tax savings don't trickle down as much as their advocates claim. 
 Democrats, more concerned with helping working families, consider consumer spending to be the magic bullet, so they favor tax rebates. But this only encourages us to continue our profligate ways. 
 Why not combine the best of both philosophies and try to stimulate investment by all Americans? The simplest approach would be to seed universal mutual fund accounts for low-income Americans. The best way to do this would be through a so-called refundable tax credit deposited directly into a special investment account for each taxpayer. In future years, the government could contribute an additional 50 cents for every dollar the taxpayer deposited into this account. Think of it as a universal 401(k), but one that could be used not only for retirement but also for things like a down payment on a house, college expenses or unexpected health costs. 
 Such investment incentives would do more than just help stimulate business growth by providing new capital. They would fundamentally change taxpayers' lives. Some research suggests that asset-holders behave more responsibly and are more civic-minded than those without wealth. After all, they have a stake in the future of the economy and their community. This is why banks in cities don't readily offer mortgages for apartments in buildings in which most of the tenants are renters, not owners. My own research suggests that having savings and investment equity is one of the best predictors of whether someone's children will attend and graduate from college. Investing motivates people of all income levels to defer gratification and become knowledgeable about the economy and society. 
 Finally, to the extent that investment accounts grow, they decouple economic security from job security. By providing a cushion during employment transitions, they are the best possible form of unemployment insurance. 
 For some reason, legislation to create universal investment accounts -- proposed by senators and representatives from both parties over the past decade -- has repeatedly stalled in Congress. But now the economy is in trouble, and there is general agreement that this is a time for action. President Bush has already authorized the plan to stimulate more of the spending that got us into this trouble. But it's still not too late to make the effort to create a true investor society.

 Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.
 ATLAS SOUND (Saturday and Sunday) In his band Deerhunter, Bradford Cox howls eerily over slow-moving noise nebulae, inevitably leading to malevolent blares. As Atlas Sound, he is a solo sound collagist whose curiosity stretches to spacey electronic samples and loops of African mbiras. With White Rainbow and Valet. Saturday at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; Sunday at 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $12. (Ben Sisario)
 BEAT THE DEVIL (Friday) Beat the Devil's Shilpa Ray is a petite powerhouse, roaring about love, horror and Solomon Grundy in a raw, bluesy alto while pumping atmospheric chords on the harmonium. The group opens an extension of the summertime Seaport Music Festival at a small (indoor) space near the South Street Seaport called @Seaport. Also on the bill is a screening of a documentary on the band. At 7 p.m., 219 Water Street, at Beekman Street, Lower Manhattan, seaportmusicfestival.com; free, but reservations are recommended. (Sisario) 
 BLACK MOUNTAIN, BON IVER (Friday) The squally Canadian group Black Mountain plays 1970s-influenced hard rock at its most digressive, by turns ominous and bucolic. Bon Iver is the project of Justin Vernon, an indie veteran from Wisconsin whose falsetto pulls his strummy, pretty songs up and away from diffident folk-rock toward something sneakier. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Kelefa Sanneh)
 BETTY BUCKLEY (Saturday and Sunday) Fusing theatrical grandeur with open-ended pop-jazz arrangements, Ms. Buckley epitomizes the singer as Method actor, passionately (sometimes scarily) living inside her material. Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m., Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Feinstein's at Loews Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; cover, $40 to $75; minimum, $25 to $40. 
 (Stephen Holden)
 LAURA CANTRELL (Friday) The sweetheart of the alt-country rodeo, Ms. Cantrell specializes in uncomplicated songs of burned hearts and private agonies -- in other words, classic country material -- and is smart enough not to let her connoisseurship get in the way of her storytelling. With Mia Riddle and Mamie Minch. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $12. (Sisario)
 ERIC CLAPTON AND STEVE WINWOOD (Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) Looking more and more like regular dads who happen to be timeless rock gods, Mr. Clapton and Mr. Winwood -- who reunited last summer at Mr. Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival -- join for three concerts at Madison Square Garden to play from the songbook of Blind Faith, their short-lived band with Ginger Baker and Rick Grech. At 8 p.m., (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $64.50 to $254.40. (Sisario)
 GEORGE CLINTON AND PARLIAMENT-FUNKADELIC (Tuesday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any puritan reflexes. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $39.50.(Jon Pareles)
 JUDY COLLINS (Friday and Saturday, and Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song, whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. At 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125 and $175. (Holden)
 DALEK, RUSSIAN CIRCLES (Sunday and Monday) Dalek is a hip-hop duo from Newark led by a rapper of the same name, who intones apocalyptic rhymes over stormy backing tracks. Russian Circles is a throwback to the 1990s heyday of ''math-rock'' instrumental bands, stuttering along in jerky, irregular time signatures before finding release in big metallic chords. With Young Widows. Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. Monday at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario)
 DEATH VESSEL, MIKE WEXLER (Friday) As Death Vessel, Joel Thibodeau, a transplant to Brooklyn from the lo-fi scene in Providence, R.I., sings bluegrass-inspired elegies in a hauntingly high, almost feminine voice. He plays at Pete's Candy Store as part of the ''Brooklyn Next'' festival with Mike Wexler, a local songwriter in the psych-folk vein who sings in a guarded near-monotone like a naughty child. At 9 p.m., 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Sisario)
 GIPSY KINGS (Monday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, the members of this French pop group are to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $39.50 to $79.50. (Pareles)
 HOT 97 WINTER FEST (Friday) When pop stars appear at concerts presented by the radio stations that helped them become famous, the mood can more resemble obligation than joy. But Hot 97's events usually deliver real thrills, as much because of the starry lineup as because of the sparks that sometimes fly between performers. Friday's show at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island is pretty fantastic: Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Trey Songz, Birdman, Juelz Santana, T-Pain, J. Holiday, Fat Joe, Rick Ross and Flo Rida. At 7:30 p.m., 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com or hot97.com/concerts; $150 to $250. (Sisario)
 KAKANDE, MORY KANTe (Sunday) Led by Famoro Dioubate, a Guinean griot based in New York, the band Kakande plays light and nimble grooves on electric bass, congas, flutes and saxophone, all surrounding the cascades of melody on Mr. Dioubate's balafon, a wooden xylophone. The concert comes with the significant endorsement of Mory Kante, one of Guinea's best-known musicians (''Yeke Yeke''). At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25. (Sisario)
 LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Friday and Saturday, Tuesday through Thursday) Lincoln Center's flagship pop series is dedicated to crossing genres and experimenting with the idea of a modern American canon. That aesthetic is perfectly embodied by the octogenarian singer Jimmy Scott, who began with Lionel Hampton and has lately been applying his stirring and still-innocent alto to songs by Prince and Elvis Costello; he appears on Friday night. Saturday features John Lloyd Young of Broadway's ''Jersey Boys'' with songs from the 1960s and '70s. But the real coup this season is K. D. Lang, who has just released perhaps her most intimate and affecting album, ''Watershed'' (Nonesuch). This is a rare opportunity to see her in such a small and casually elegant space. At 8:30 p.m., with an additional show on Saturday at 10:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $150. 
 (Sisario)
 MAGNETIC FIELDS (Friday through Sunday) For someone who detests playing live, Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields is an unfailingly charming entertainer, breezing through his repertory of caustic bonbons -- the band's latest, ''Distortion'' (Nonesuch), is a cross between Noel Coward and the Jesus and Mary Chain -- and performing his role as M.C. with perfect drollery. His band finishes a sold-out four-night run at the Town Hall, with the Interstellar Radio Company as the opening act. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org. (Sisario)
 MATMOS (Saturday) M. C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel of Matmos make music out of almost any found sounds: playing cards being shuffled, the slurping of liposuction, even melting ice. On Saturday they take on a particularly ambitious task by interpreting ''The Backyard,'' the final act of Robert Ashley's epic video opera ''Perfect Lives.'' At 8 and 10 p.m., Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10 per set. (Sisario)
 THE NATIONAL (Friday and Saturday) One of New York's unflashiest success stories, the National has built a significant following with flawless, wilting ballads featuring the weary baritone of Matt Berninger, who seems pained by his ability to conjure cruelties like ''You could have been a legend/But you became a father.'' The band has sold out two nights at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's opera house as part of the ''Brooklyn Next'' festival, which highlights Kings County talent in clubs and performance spaces all over the borough. Full schedule: bam.org. At 8 p.m., 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Sisario)
 PATATO TRIBUTE (Monday) Carlos Valdes, better known as Patato, who died in December at 81, was a diminutive giant of Latin music and jazz: an innovator on the conga drums who played with everybody and knew the right antics to stir up a crowd. Paying tribute at S.O.B.'s are Little Johnny Rivero and the LP All-Stars. At 8 and 10 p.m., 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $12 to $15. (Sisario)
 PELA, APOLLO SUNSHINE, LIAM FINN (Wednesday) Pela, from New York, calls its music ''pastoral punk,'' which means wide-open skies of bouncy bass lines and sparkling guitars. Unfortunately, it also means gloom borrowed from Interpol and the Strokes. The tunefulness of folk-rock and the Beatles goes joyously off the rails in the songs of Apollo Sunshine, from Boston. Don't miss Liam Finn, the talented 24-year-old son of Neil Finn of Crowded House, who has his father's sense of melodic, economical songcraft as well as a cool wistfulness that comes down from Elliott Smith. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $13. (Sisario)
 THE ROOTS (Friday) This veteran hip-hop group from Philadelphia has stuck proudly to socially conscious, we're-all-in-this-together lyrics, but it is its excellence and flexibility as a live funk band that have made its reputation. At 7:30 and 11 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 307-7171, apollotheater.com; $31.50 and $41.50. (Sisario)
 SON DE LA FRONTERA (Saturday and Sunday) The new generation of flamenco stars are tinkerers, adding to and subtracting from traditional performance styles in search of surprises and crossover hits. Son de la Frontera, from near Seville, Spain, uses a tres, a small Cuban guitar, for tranquil meanderings driven by the gentle rhythms of clapping hands. Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 545-7536, worldmusicinstitute.org; $35 and $45; $15 for students. (Sisario)
 ST. VINCENT (Thursday) St. Vincent is Annie Clark, a 25-year-old songwriter whose time as a collaborator of Sufjan Stevens and the Polyphonic Spree did not prepare the world for the brilliance and grandeur of her debut album, ''Marry Me'' (Beggars Banquet), a small universe of romance that recalls the prime of Kate Bush. With Foreign Born. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $15. (Sisario)
 SUPER FURRY ANIMALS, TIMES NEW VIKING (Sunday and Monday) The long-running Welsh band Super Furry Animals plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys melodies, zooming space-rock and some penitent country-folk. Times New Viking, from Columbus, Ohio, takes after Guided by Voices in all the right ways, with inspired, exuberant garage-rock fantasies and a love for sonic corrosion and distortion. But make no mistake: the high points are all secondhand. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 (sold out on Monday). (Sisario)
 JIM WHITE (Tuesday and Thursday) Swampy Southern gothic has been this songwriter's stock in trade since his emergence a decade ago. He has said that his latest album, ''Transnormal Skiperoo'' (Luaka Bop), represents a happier turn, but it sure seems as dark as ever. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $15. (Sisario)

 RUTH ROOT ''Richard Tuttle''; ''Josef Albers''; ''The Quilts of Gee's Bend''; ''Ski Socks.'' The news release for Ruth Root's first solo at Andrew Kreps since 2003 is an illustrated litany of free-associative visual references, some more predictable than others. A nod to the visionary colorist Sonia Delaunay might be expected, but what about ''Matching Dresses and Wallpaper in 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' ''? 
 For an emerging artist, a list like that might sound pretentious, but Ms. Root has been around long enough to get away with it. Her eight recent paintings, all made with enamel on shaped aluminum panels (and untitled, like the one at left), exhibit combinations of geometric forms and saturated colors -- a toothpaste green and a crocuslike violet, a warm gray and a wan chartreuse. It is probably no accident that they resemble comic-strip speech bubbles; in the past, Ms. Root has adorned her compositions with pairs of tiny eyes and trompe l'oeil cigarettes. 
 She abandoned this gimmick several shows ago, but she has retained a quirky sense of humor. In Ms. Root's news release, painters' painters like Philip Guston and Mary Heilmann are credited alongside ''ghosts,'' ''shaped bathmats'' and those ski socks (black with a groovy red-and-gray Scandinavian design). It all reinforces the idea that color-blocked abstract painting can be friendly and approachable without losing its high-modernist cachet. (Through March 16, Andrew Kreps Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, 212-741-8849, andrewkreps.com.) KAREN ROSENBERG

 Museums
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'ART DOES NOT EQUAL LIFE: ACTIONS BY ARTISTS OF THE AMERICAS, 1960-2000,' through May 18. The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'ARCHIVE FEVER: USES OF THE DOCUMENT IN CONTEMPORARY ART,' through May 4. You need no grounding in art theory to understand the messages generated by this powerful brain-pincher of a theme show. The archive of the title is less a thing or a place than a concept, an immersive environment: the sum total of documentary images, mostly photographic, circulating in the culture, on the street, in the media and finally in what is called the collective memory. From an Andy Warhol silk-screen of a black civil rights demonstrator attacked by police dogs, to a gallery wallpapered with the front pages of international newspapers reporting on the destruction of the twin towers, truth, untruth and their consequences make up the riveting story here. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045, icp.org.
 (Holland Cotter)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ETERNAL ANCESTORS: THE ART OF THE CENTRAL AFRICAN RELIQUARY,' through March 2. This beautiful show has a universal theme: life as a cosmic journey homeward, with parental spirits, embodied in charismatic materials and images, counseling and chiding us every step of the way. European, Asian and African reliquaries sit side by side in the first gallery; then some of the world's greatest Fang and Kota sculptures take over and sweep through to the end. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JASPER JOHNS: GRAY,' through May 4. Since his paintings of targets and American flags took the art world by storm 50 years ago, Jasper Johns has been a cultural fact and the subject of numerous museum exhibitions. But this is one of the best. Moody, opulent and eloquent, it singles out his many paintings in gray, the color at the core of his sensibility, along with numerous sculptures, drawings and prints that are inherently gray. Together they chronicle his maturation from brilliant, methodical young artist to a deeper, more lyrical, less predictable one. And frankly, it is almost a relief to follow the incessant unfolding of this singular career without the brightly colored, better-known masterpieces. See above. (Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'POUSSIN AND NATURE: ARCADIAN VISIONS,' through May 11. If a painter can be judged by the love he inspires, Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) was one of art history's great valentines. Corot, Delacroix, Constable and Cezanne all adored him. So did Picasso and Matisse. You can see why in this show of his post-Classical, pre-Romantic landscapes and drawings. Every age has a different style for ''serious'' in art; Poussin's was different from our own, but enthralling and moving in its moral gravity and poise. See above. (Cotter) 
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'MICHELANGELO, VASARI AND THEIR CONTEMPORARIES: DRAWINGS FROM THE UFFIZI,' through April 20. Michelangelo, with a couple of spectacular drawings, is the marquee name here, but many of the 16th-century Florentine artists he influenced fill the space, beginning with the extreme polymath Giorgio Vasari. A handful of drawings by Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino will knock your socks off, as will work by a few less familiar artists, all working to make the Medici rulers of Florence look good. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'NEW PERSPECTIVES IN LATIN AMERICAN ART, 1930-2006: SELECTIONS FROM A DECADE OF ACQUISITIONS,' through Feb. 25. Collecting Latin American art is a longstanding tradition at MoMA, but it languished a bit in the 1960s and '70s. These recent acquisitions attest to its resurgence in the '90s, with a shift toward various forms of Constructivist-based abstraction that emerged from that region, starting in the postwar period. Unusually oriented toward the body in its emphasis on optical perception and the possibility of function, these selections set the stage for subsequent generations of artists, many of whom are also represented here. The postwar works are especially exceptional, and historically important, but the choices throughout are for the most part excellent. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'PICTURING NEW YORK: THE ART OF YVONNE JACQUETTE AND RUDY BURCKHARDT,' through April 13 (Burckhardt); through May 4 (Jacquette). This dual exhibition displays photographs by Burckhardt, who died at 85 in 1999, alongside paintings by Ms. Jacquette, his widow and 20 years his junior, who is still working. Burckhardt's black-and-white images approach the city from several angles, descending from rooftops to street level and even into the subways. Ms. Jacquette's works peer down into the canyons between high-rises. This pair of shows does not establish either artist as an unjustly overlooked talent, but it reveals the competing visions of the city behind a romantic and creative partnership. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org.

 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'WACK! ART AND THE FEMINIST REVOLUTION,' through May 12. This big, messy, fascinating scrapbook of a show focuses on the years between the mid-1960s and the early '80s when feminism had its most intense impact on contemporary art. Presenting works by 120 women, its quality is uneven, but the overall effect is exciting. It takes you back to a heady time when women were throwing out old, patriarchal laws and reinventing art in all kinds of idiosyncratic and sometimes dangerously extreme terms. 22-25 Jackson Ave. at 46th Ave., Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.

 SCANDINAVIA HOUSE: 'ARS FENNICA: FINNISH ART NOW,' through April 12. Finland has its own version of the Turner Prize in Britain: the $50,000 Ars Fennica Prize. This sleepy show presents works by 2007's four finalists. It includes gimmicky sculptures by Markus Kahre; fairy-tale-like images painted and drawn by Elina Merenmies; Anna Tuori's brushy, mock-kitsch paintings of vaguely Asian landscapes; and, by Elina Brotherus, large, bland landscape photographs and a relaxing video triptych of people skinny dipping in peaceful, outdoor waters. 58 Park Avenue between 37th and 38th streets, (212) 879-9779, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KORI NEWKIRK: 1997-2007,' through March 9. The Bronx-born artist Kori Newkirk, now based in Los Angeles, first came to New York's attention in the 2001 group show ''Freestyle'' at the Studio Museum. He is now having a solo at the museum, organized by its director and chief curator, Thelma Golden. This 10-year survey devotes plenty of room -- nearly the entire double-height main gallery -- to the shimmering pony-bead curtains for which Mr. Newkirk is best known. It also finds him pursuing more oblique forms of expression, particularly in his recent forays into video. It all adds up to a kind of maxed-out minimalism or, as Mr. Newkirk has described it, a ''ghetto-fabulous conceptualism.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Rosenberg)

 LARRY POONS: 'THROW, POUR, DRIP, SPILL & SPLASH' When they were made -- with paint thrown at or poured down vertical canvases -- 30 years ago, these paintings seemed to thumb their noses at the Minimalists and the Color Field painters alike. Today their heavy downpours and feathery splashes look implacable, extravagantly rich in color and surface, and slightly mad, like wilding Pollocks made with Monet in mind. Jacobson Howard, 33 East 68th Street, (212) 570-2362, jacobsonhoward.com, through March 1. (Smith)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 KATI HECK In her energetic New York debut, this young German painter operates on all pistons slightly to the right of the frenetic realist painter Ashley Bickerton. She leavens her exacting, sometimes grotesque realism, which evokes Neue Sachlichkeit, with regular doses of neo-Expressionist extravagances a la Martin Kippenberger and occasional bits of art-historical quotation (from van Gogh, for example). The results are entertaining, outlandish and ambitious but as yet distinguished more by skill and aplomb than by genuine originality. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 729-4949, maryboonegallery.com, through March 1. (Smith)
 LEON POLK SMITH: TORN PAPER DRAWINGS, 1956-1964 This little-known series of quasi collages was made by tearing sheets of soft paper finished in bright monochromes or black and exposing fuzzy white edges that function as drawn, sometimes calligraphic lines, spirals and arabesques. Japanese and Chinese ink-brush painting comes to mind, as do Henri Matisse and Jean Arp's well-known excursions into cut or torn paper. But mainly these works reveal a tender, playful side to Mr. Polk Smith, an early proponent of glossy, rigorous hard-edge Minimalist painting. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, eighth Floor, (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com, through March 1. (Smith)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 RACKSTRAW DOWNES Working on location, Mr. Downes paints subjects that would seem mundane, drab or sadly desolate by calendar-art standards: street scenes in Brooklyn with subway bridges looming overhead and an abandoned racetrack in the Texas desert, for example. But he paints them so attentively and with such a lovingly sensuous touch that the images have a breathtaking lucidity.Betty Cunningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, bettycuninghamgallery.com., through March 1. (Johnson)
 CHRIS MARTIN This painter, an underground favorite, works in the gap between the comical and the visionary, enlivening his colorful, sometimes boisterous works with plastic foam discs, collaged paper and casual construction. As much objects as paintings, they reflect the synthesis of multiple cultural sources and exude a formal ease and indifference to refinement that translate into something like real-life tolerance and wisdom. Mitchell Innes & Nash, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through March 1. (Smith)
 'MIRROR MIRROR' This exhibition of fine antique mirrors and contemporary artworks relating to them offers no systematic theory of what mirrors mean to us, but it gives pause for philosophical rumination. Old mirror styles range from florid, gold-leafed Spanish Colonial to a 1970s vintage circular mirror framed in jellylike bands of green and red Murano glass. Artists include Richard Artschwager, Cindy Sherman and Douglas Gordon. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 691-6565, edwardthorpgallery.com, through Feb. 23. (Johnson)
 SHIRIN NESHAT Two doleful magic realist videos by Ms. Neshat are based on characters and events in ''Women Without Men,'' a novel by the Iranian writer Shahrnush Parsipur. ''Munis'' focuses on a young woman who dives off a high roof and, in a postsuicide dream, participates in an anti-shah demonstration that is crushed by soldiers. In ''Faezeh'' a teenage girl dreams of being raped by unidentified men in a forest. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com, through Feb. 23. (Johnson)
 Last Chance
 'EAT THE DOCUMENT' This group show, organized by Dean Daderko, is worth a visit just to see the carousel of a tie-dye fabric painting/sculpture by Alan Shields (1944-2005), a wonderful outside-the-loop artist who is ready for a major close-up look. He is joined here by another artist who died too young, Jimmy De Sana (1950-1990), as well as by two estimable young figures: A. K. Burns, who also produces paintings using dyes, and the photographer Eileen Quinlan, whose abstract photographs beautifully pick up on the formal ambiguities of Mr. Shields's work. Larissa Goldston Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, third Floor, Chelsea, (212) 206-7887, larissagoldston.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)
 LOREN MACIVER, 'THE POETRY OF OBJECTS' Of the dozen paintings in this luminous Loren MacIver survey, one titled ''The Poet'' depicts a single, bust-length female figure. Her slender shoulders are accentuated by a scoop-neck dress, as is her vase-like neck. Above that, though, flesh is exchanged for a cloud of flowers and stars. MacIver's art is like this: head in the clouds, feet on the ground; a pixilated edition of everyday. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 755-2828, alexandregallery.com, through Feb. 29. (Cotter)

 Opera
 'CARMEN' (Saturday and Wednesday) It takes a powerful singer to make a strong impression amid the flamboyant spectacle of Franco Zeffirelli's crowded 1996 production. But the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina, whose Carmen is a sultry, rich-voiced seductress, has the voice and personality to stand out from the cavorting children, crowds, dancers and barnyard menagerie. Marcelo Alvarez is an ardent and believable Don Jose. Krassimira Stoyanova is Micaela, Lucio Gallo sings Escamillo and on Wednesday the title role will be reprised by Nancy Fabiola Herrera. Emmanuel Villaume conducts with grace and vigor. Saturday at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out on Saturday, $175 tickets remaining for Wednesday. 
 (Vivien Schweitzer) 
 'THE DANGEROUS LIAISONS' (Saturday) Dicapo Opera Theater presents Conrad Susa's setting of the 18th-century exercise in sadism by Choderlos de Laclos. At 8 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $55. (Bernard Holland) 
 'MANON LESCAUT' (Saturday) The Met has dusted off its drearily realistic 1980 production of Puccini's ''Manon Lescaut'' for one reason: Karita Mattila. This charismatic Finnish soprano gives a riveting portrayal of the title role, singing with the requisite richness and power, yet conveying girlish awkwardness. The tenor Marcello Giordani may bring stylish Italianate ardor to his portrayal of Manon's lover, the chevalier des Grieux, but his singing is overly emotive, sometimes sloppy and blatant. The esteemed conductor Donald Runnicles takes over for James Levine in this final performance of the run. At 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220. 
 (Anthony Tommasini)
 'OTELLO' (Friday and Tuesday) The title role in Verdi's ''Otello'' is one of the great vocal and acting challenges for a tenor in the Italian repertory. The acclaimed South African tenor Johan Botha brings power, rich tone, confident delivery and elegance to the role, his first Otello at the Met. Still, over all his performance is dramatically bland. Renee Fleming, singing Desdemona at the Met for the first time since 1995, gives a vulnerable, poignant and vocally classy performance. Carlo Guelfi is an idiomatic and intelligent though not particularly gripping Iago. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) 
 'PETER GRIMES' (Thursday) Britten's profound seafaring tragedy returns to the Metroplitan with the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey in the title role and the soprano Patricia Racette as Ellen Orford. Donald Runnicles conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $26 to $250. (Holland)
 'LA SONNAMBULA' (Wednesday) The rising Cuban-born soprano Eglise Gutierrez takes on the touchstone role of Amina in Bellini's ''Sonnambula'' with the Opera Orchestra of New York. The cast in this concert performance at Carnegie Hall includes the tenor Dmitry Korchak as Elvino and the bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as Count Rodolfo. The indispensable Eve Queler, the founder of this popular enterprise, conducts. Over the years she has shown a special affinity for the Bel Canto repertory. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $125. 
 (Tommasini)
 Classical Music
 ALARM WILL SOUND (Thursday) Alan Pierson leads his enterprising young ensemble in a typically eclectic program that includes the New York premiere of John Adams's ''Son of Chamber Symphony'' and works that range from thorny scores by Nancarrow, Ligeti and Harrison Birtwistle to early music by Josquin and Ciconia and transcriptions of electronica by Aphex Twin and Mochipet. But the real surprise here is likely to be a version of ''Philosophy of the World'' by the Shaggs, a sister band from the late 1960s and early '70s that attracted a following amused by the ineptitude of its songwriting and playing. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $40. (Allan Kozinn)
 AXIOM (Wednesday) Anticipating the Messiaen centenary in December, Jeffrey Milarsky leads this energetic Juilliard ensemble in Messiaen's vivid mystical vision ''Des Canyons aux Etoiles.'' At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)
 BARGEMUSIC (Friday through Sunday) There's plenty of action on the barge this weekend, starting on Friday with the music of Luis Prado, Arvo Part, Prokofiev and Janacek, performed by the violinist Johnny Gandelsman and the pianist Francesco Tristano Schlime. On Saturday and Sunday the pianist Doris Stevenson, the cellist Carlos Prieto and the violinist Mark Peskanov (Bargemusic's artistic director) unite for the American premiere of Samuel Zyman's Suite for Cello Solo and works by Martinu, Smetana and Dvorak. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students. (Schweitzer)
 BRENTANO STRING QUARTET (Wednesday) The Brentano players take a look at what prominent composers were thinking toward the end of their careers. The music is Mozart's ''Prussian'' Quartet, Elliott Carter's Piano Quintet with Thomas Sauer, Bartok's last quartet and the Contrapunctus XIV from Bach's ''Art of Fugue.'' At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Holland)
 CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Friday and Sunday) The main draw at this concert, the final program in the perhaps overhyped ''American Voices'' series, should be the premiere of Alan Louis Smith's ''Vignettes: Covered Wagon Woman.'' This substantial song cycle for mezzo-soprano, which sets to music the diary entries of a woman who crossed to the West alone in a covered wagon, was written for the astounding Stephanie Blythe, who is having a breakout season. The program includes pieces by Anthony Philip Heinrich, Gottschalk and Ives. Friday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $50 to $29. (Tommasini)
 CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday and Tuesday) A great orchestra, a fine pianist and singer, and one of music's truly important minds bring two interesting programs to Carnegie Hall. Pierre Boulez is the conductor for both evenings. Matthias Pintscher's ''Osiris'' will have its first New York performance on Monday, accompanied by Debussy's great orchestral suite, ''Images,'' and the Bartok Third Piano Concerto with Mitsuko Uchida. Tuesday brings Berio's ''Quatre Dedicaces'' and Stravinsky's ''Petrouchka''; Susan Graham will sing Berlioz's ''Nuits d'Ete.'' At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $128. (Holland)
 DAVID FINCKEL AND WU HAN (Tuesday) This husband-and-wife cello-and-piano duo returns to the Morgan Library's shiny, tiny new hall with sonatas by Beethoven and Brahms, and two sets of pieces by Anton Webern. At 7:30 p.m., Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; $45. (Holland)
 MARKUS GROH (Sunday) This German pianist, who recently recorded works by Liszt for the Avie label, offers a colorful program including the composer's monumental Sonata in B Minor. The lineup also includes Schulhoff's ''Five Etudes de Jazz,'' Ginastera's Sonata No. 1 and works by Kurtag and Ligeti. At 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25. (Schweitzer) 
 JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Saturday). The Juilliard School makes a trip to Carnegie Hall with James DePreist conducting the Juilliard Orchestra. Of interest is Chen Yi's ''Ge Xu.'' Familiar will be the Prokofiev Third Piano Concerto, with Stephen Beus as soloist. Everyone should recognize the Berlioz ''Symphonie Fantastique,'' which threatens to be the most played symphonic piece in New York this season. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $10 to $25. (Holland)
 JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Saturday and Monday) In 1900, when the series that became the Peoples' Symphony Concerts got going, an individual ticket cost 10 cents. Amazingly, ticket prices haven't risen much, adjusted for 108 years of inflation. On Saturday night s the Juilliard Quartet plays a program of works by Beethoven, Shostakovich and Verdi. Yes, Verdi wrote an impassioned string quartet. The quartet will play the Verdi a second time on Monday, in a free concert at the Juilliard School of Music that also includes works by Haydn, Ralph Shapey and Elliott Carter. Saturday at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. Monday at 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; tickets required. (Tommasini) KRONOS QUARTET (Friday) Surprises, mostly pleasant ones, are always plentiful when the Kronos performs. Here they offer new and recent scores by Gary Leport, Clint Mansell, Fernando Otero, Aviya Kopelman, John Adams and Aleksandra Vrebalov. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Kozinn)
 MIDORI (Sunday) This excellent violinist offers the second installment of a three-part series exploring parallels and contrasts between the music of Alfred Schnittke and Toru Takemitsu. On Sunday the spotlight is on Schnittke. Midori will be joined by musicians including the fine pianist Marc-Andre Hamelin and the Daedalus Quartet for Schnittke's Sonata No.1 and Septet, Shostakovich's Piano Quintet in G minor and Bach's Trio Sonata in G. At 5 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway and 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $60. (Schweitzer)
 MMARTISTS IN CONCERT (Friday) The fine musicians of the resident ensemble of the Metropolitan Museum of Art have started going by the catchy (if unusual to read) name MMArtists in Concert. Friday's program offers string quintets by Beethoven and Dvorak framing the modernist American composer Charles Wuorinen's Piano Quintet. At 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $35. (Tommasini)
 MUSIC FROM JAPAN (Saturday and Sunday) This organization offers New Yorkers a chance to discover traditional and contemporary Japanese music. A two-day minifestival opens on Saturday with ''Exploring Ma: Ancient Winds and Percussion,'' a program of repertory chosen for its use of ''ma,'' or powerful silence. Works by John Cage, Toru Takemitsu and Hiroya Miura (a premiere) will be juxtaposed with music from Japan's gagaku tradition. On Sunday, the premieres of works by three established Japanese composers will be presented, followed by a question-and-answer session. Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $20, or $35 for both concerts. (Schweitzer)
 ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Saturday and Sunday) This fine chamber ensemble celebrates the 70th birthday of Joan Tower, who concludes her 10-year stint as the Orchestra of St. Luke's composer in residence this year. The first of three programs focusing on music by Tower, her contemporaries and those who influenced her takes place Saturday, with excerpts from Messiaen's ''Quartet for the End of Time,'' the final movement of Shostakovich's Piano Trio No. 2, Stravinsky's ''Elegie'' for solo violin, the premiere of a work by Sergei Tcherepnin, and Ms. Tower's ''For Daniel'' for violin, cello and piano. Saturday at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street; Sunday at 2 p.m., Dia:Beacon, Beacon, N.Y.; $25. Information: (212) 594-6100, oslmusic.org. (Schweitzer)
 SO PERCUSSION AND KNEEBODY (Friday) Here is a promising collaboration between two inventive ensembles: a virtuosic percussion ensemble and a band of freewheeling postmodernists. At 7 p.m., Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. Free with museum admission, which is pay what you wish after 6. (Kozinn)
 RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA (Saturday and Sunday) In past visits, Vladimir Jurowski has done wonders with this independent Russian ensemble. Now that he has been anointed as one of the most insightful conductors of his generation, his two Lincoln Center concerts are bound to be hot tickets. On Saturday he leads Schubert's ''Unfinished'' Eighth Symphony (heard here in a completion by Anton Safronov) and the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1, with Stephen Hough as the soloist. On Sunday, Garrick Ohlsson is the soloist in the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, which shares the bill with the Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6. Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $69. (Kozinn)

HEADLINE: When Bankers Are Afraid to Act

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Where is the next J. P. Morgan?
 In times of market crisis, the safest course for any one market participant may be the riskiest course for the entire market. If everyone wants to sell, prices can go in only one direction.
 In past financial crises, it has fallen to someone -- regulators, investment banks or even a single banker -- to organize collective action and avert disaster.
 Such moves involved persuading people to take steps that seemed to go against their own private interests. Buy stocks when everyone wants to sell? Lend money to a bank in danger of failing, when your own bank might need the money tomorrow? Join with others to buy securities from a desperate seller, rather than try to maximize your own profits from his precarious position? It goes against the basic principle of markets, that your job is to look out for yourself.
 But all those things have happened in the past. Unfortunately, nothing like them is happening in the current crisis. 
 In 1907, Morgan demanded that presidents of New York trust companies -- then a type of second-class bank -- act together to save one of their own, the Trust Company of America, from a bank run.
 The presidents, wrote Robert F. Bruner and Sean D. Carr in their book, ''The Panic of 1907,'' were ''convinced that it was their primary responsibility to conserve their assets in order to survive the financial storm that was swirling around them.'' Morgan said that would simply assure that all would fail, one by one. 
 Morgan, then the dominant figure in American finance, called the presidents to a Saturday meeting in his library -- and locked the door. Not until dawn Sunday did he let them out, after they had committed the needed cash.
 In 1987, on Tuesday, Oct. 20, it appeared that the crash of the previous day was going to get worse. Market makers had little capital and less appetite to risk it, and one by one trading in the shares of major companies was halted because there were no buyers. In Chicago, the futures market was talking about halting trading in stock index futures because there were not enough stocks trading to know what the futures were worth.
 That changed when two major brokerage firms -- Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers -- sent word to the New York Stock Exchange floor that they would buy any stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 if their orders were needed to keep the shares trading. Just after that word was sent, the market turned around.
 In 1998, when a possible hedge fund failure seemed to threaten the financial system, it was the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that called in all the major financial institutions and organized a bailout.
 But efforts to organize concerted action this time have been limited. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has sought to get agreements in two areas -- renegotiating mortgages and putting together a fund to deal with one of the early manifestations of the problem, the threatened collapse of odd financial instruments called structured investment vehicles -- but there has been no visible effort to deal with the underlying problem.
 In part, that may reflect the slow realization of what is at stake. For many months, we called it the subprime mortgage crisis, because that was where the problem first became apparent. But that label is far too narrow, and serves to obscure what is at stake.
 ''Rather ominously, borrowing costs for even the most creditworthy of firms have started to rise,'' said Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics in London. Homeowners who can still get mortgages have seen rates rise in recent weeks, and banks say they are tightening their standards for both credit cards and commercial real estate loans.
 ''The principal cause for concern today is the paralysis of the credit markets,'' Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and an adviser to President Ronald Reagan, wrote in The Wall Street Journal this week. ''The collapse of confidence in credit markets is now preventing that necessary extension of credit. The decline of credit creation includes not only the banks but also the bond markets, hedge funds, insurance companies and mutual funds. Securitization, leveraged buyouts and credit insurance have also atrophied.''
 The latest area of crisis is one that Morgan would have recognized in 1907. The major Wall Street houses -- from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to Citigroup and Merrill Lynch -- have refused to commit capital to the auction-rate market, a market that was supposed to allow investors to sell each week, via an auction that set interest rates.
 Now many auctions are failing. That has left customers unable to sell securities that were supposed to have virtually guaranteed liquidity, and it has left the issuers -- who paid fees to the banks to conduct the auctions -- paying ridiculously high interest rates. It's not easy to get both borrowers and lenders feeling angry and abandoned, but Wall Street has managed the feat.
 When the crisis storms gathered in late 2007, much of the problem was with complicated securities -- collateralized debt obligations, for example -- that were extremely difficult to analyze. The failure of buyers to step up may have been rational. But that is not true with some of the auction-rate securities. They represent loans to borrowers that by any standard should be deemed good credits. 
 But the big banks were unable or unwilling to either buy the securities or find customers to buy them. That lack of action has damaged the reputation of each of the houses, in ways that would have been unthinkable a few months ago. But the bosses are scared. They no longer are sure just how adequate their capital is, and they are afraid to commit it while the financial crisis swirls around them. Some got their jobs because their predecessors were too willing to take risks.
 It is not clear what the Fed or the Treasury could, or should, do now. The players can no longer be gathered into a single room, and they are regulated in different countries around the world, if they are regulated at all. Things are far more difficult because many of these markets are unregulated, making it difficult to gauge who is at risk and for how much.
 But it is hard to see this ending until something is done to, in Mr. Feldstein's words, assure ''that necessary extension of credit.'' Lowering interest rates will not, by itself, do that so long as the banks and investors are too scared to lend money at any rate.
 In their book on the Panic of 1907, published last year before the crisis began, Mr. Bruner and Mr. Carr hailed Morgan's actions, as well as the Fed's 1998 move to salvage the hedge fund. But they warned, presciently as it turned out, that the current environment might hamper similar efforts in a new crisis.
 ''In a globally complex financial system, will such collective action be possible if the crisis is triggered beyond the reach of any of today's regulators?'' they asked.
 So far, it appears the answer is no.

HEADLINE: Protesters Attack American Embassy in Belgrade

BYLINE: By BOSTJAN VIDEMSEK and DAN BILEFSKY; Bostjan Videmsek reported from Belgrade, and Dan Bilefsky from Pristina, Kosovo. Warren Hoge contributed reporting from New York, and David Stout from Washington.

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia 

 BODY:
Demonstrators attacked the United States Embassy and set part of it ablaze on Thursday as tens of thousands of angry Serbs took to the streets of Belgrade to protest Kosovo's declaration of independence. 
 The United States has been a strong advocate of Kosovo's independence from Serbia and was among the first countries to recognize the new state, stoking deep resentment. Rian Harris, an embassy spokeswoman, said that a body had been found inside the building, but that all embassy staff members were accounted for. 
 Witnesses said that at least 100 people broke into the embassy, which was closed, and burned some of its rooms. One protester ripped the American flag from the facade of the building. An estimated 1,000 demonstrators cheered as the vandals, some wearing masks, jumped onto the building's balcony waving a Serbian flag and chanting ''Serbia, Serbia!'' the witnesses said. A police convoy firing tear gas dispersed the crowd. 
 The Associated Press reported that the small fires at the embassy were quickly extinguished.
 Serbian television reported that the Croatian Embassy had also been attacked, and the state news agency said that the Bosnian and Turkish Embassies were also targets. The police said at least 140 people had been injured in the incidents, 32 of them police officers. Security sources estimated that 150,000 people joined the protests. 
 Groups also broke into a McDonald's in central Belgrade and destroyed its interior. Witnesses said vandals were attacking foreign-owned shops, including a Nike store, and were seen carrying off shoes and other goods as the Serbian police looked on.
 The United States Embassy had been closed since Sunday after it was stoned. 
 R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, telephoned Serbian officials to formally complain about the breaching of the embassy, said a State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack. Mr. McCormack told reporters on Thursday that ''we would hold the Serbian government personally responsible for the safety and well-being of our embassy employees.''
 He added that the security that had been provided was completely inadequate. 
 The United Nations Security Council issued a unanimous statement of the 15 members saying they ''condemn in the strongest terms the mob attacks against embassies in Belgrade which have resulted in damage to embassy premises and have endangered diplomatic personnel.'' The action was taken at the urging of Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador.
 The violence fueled fears in Washington and Brussels that Serbia was turning to the virulent nationalism of the past. But Serbian analysts predicted the country would ultimately embrace the West as it came to terms with losing its medieval heartland. 
 In recent days, Western leaders have watched with growing alarm as Serbia's hard-line prime minister, Vojislav Kostunica, who helped lead the revolution that overthrew Slobodan Milosevic in 2000, has replicated the nationalist talk of the late dictator, who used Serbs' outrage that their ancestral heartland was dominated by Muslim Albanians to come to power in Serbia. 
 ''As long as we live, Kosovo is Serbia,'' Mr. Kostunica told the crowd in Belgrade. ''We're not alone in our fight. President Putin is with us,'' he said of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. 
 In a sign of the divisions within Serbia's government, the pro-Western president, Boris Tadic, was absent from the rally, on a state visit to Romania. 
 Western diplomats said their hope for a moderate Serbia had been buttressed by the recent re-election of Mr. Tadic, who campaigned on the argument that holding on to Kosovo did not justify sacrificing Serbia's future in Europe. Their optimism, however, was tempered by the strong election showing for Mr. Tadic's opponent, Tomislav Nikolic, a far-right nationalist who has exploited Serbs' discontent over Kosovo by arguing that Serbia should reject Europe and look to Moscow and China instead. 
 But while Moscow has gained in popularity in Serbia by blocking Kosovo's integration into the international community, leading Serbian intellectuals said most Serbs realized that the Kremlin's willingness to fight for their cause was limited. ''Russia wasn't there to help Serbs during the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, it wasn't there to help Serbs in 1999 during the NATO bombing, and most people realize it will not go that far now,'' said Zoran Dogramadziev, a leading Serbian writer. 
 In the short term, analysts said an anti-European Union backlash would gain force after the West's support for an independent Kosovo. But Marko Blagojevic, an analyst with the Center for Democracy and Free Elections in Belgrade and a pollster, stressed that recent polls showed that 65 percent of Serbs saw their future in the European Union. 
 Mr. Blagojevic said he did not believe this had drastically changed. He noted that only about 10 percent of Serbs supported going to war over Kosovo. 
 Serbian analysts said that rather than reflecting a resurgence of dangerous nationalism, the protests over Kosovo reflected disenchantment by the ''losers of the transition'' -- those Serbs who have not benefited from the country's democratic transformation during the eight years since Mr. Milosevic fell. 
 Unemployment hovers at about 21 percent, while the country's annual per capita gross domestic product of about $7,400 has made Serbia one of Europe's poorest countries. 
 Without European Union membership, Serbs do not enjoy the open borders of their neighbors. Many Serbs say they feel isolated and closed in. Yet many of the younger generation say they would happily trade poor, landlocked Kosovo for better jobs and economic security. 
 ''For my generation, the opportunity to have a good life is far more important than this piece of land,'' said Aleksandar Obradovic, a 23-year-old political scientist from Belgrade who did not protest on Thursday and, like many Serbs, has never been to Kosovo. 
 Ljubica Gojgic, a leading Serbian commentator, noted that Mr. Milosevic had been overthrown by the Serbian people, who had recently put their faith in a newly elected moderate president, backed by the West. ''If Tadic is good enough for the E.U. and Washington, why is he not acceptable to the Albanians in Kosovo?'' she asked. ''Milosevic is dead.''

HEADLINE: Rescues Weighed As Homeowners Wallow in Debt

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and LOUIS UCHITELLE; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington and Louis Uchitelle from Memphis and New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Prodded in part by some of the nation's biggest banks, the Bush administration and Congress are considering costly new proposals for the government to rescue hundreds of thousands of homeowners whose mortgages are higher than the value of their houses.
 Not since the Depression has a larger share of Americans owed more on their homes than they are worth. With the collapse of the housing boom, nearly 8.8 million homeowners, or 10.3 percent of the total, are underwater. That is more than double the percentage just a year ago, according to a new estimate of the damage by Moody'sEconomy.com.
 Administration officials say they still oppose any taxpayer bailout for either people who borrowed more than they could afford or banks that made foolish loans during the height of the speculative bubble in housing.
 But with the current efforts to arrest the housing collapse so far bearing little fruit, Washington is being forced to explore new ideas, among them the idea of a federal mortgage guarantee for troubled borrowers. 
 And policy makers are listening to proposals from industry and community groups to use government funds to purchase and refinance billions of dollars in mortgages now in danger of default.
 Many owners are only gradually becoming aware that their homes would sell for less than the debt against them -- a phenomenon, said Richard T. Curtin, director of the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, that is ''beginning to weigh on people, making them uncertain and nervous about the future.'' 
 That nervousness is evident across the country, particularly in places like Memphis, a city of nearly 1.3 million people where falling home prices and negative equity are new experiences.
 The housing slumps of the mid-1970s and late 1980s were confined to the coasts. The current bust, while leaving some cities relatively unscathed, has cut a far wider path and it comes just when home debt is at its highest level since World War II.
 For Stuart B. Breakstone, the problem hit home when he was forced to come to the closing on the sale of his eight-year-old custom-built house with a check for $65,000. The money, out of his own pocket, was to pay the difference between what he still owed on the mortgage for his home and the lower selling price.
 Mr. Breakstone, a 42-year-old lawyer, and his wife, Lori, chief of customs agents at Memphis International Airport -- who together earn more than $250,000 a year -- managed to extricate themselves by paying off the mortgage. But millions of others are trapped in their homes. They have jobs, make their mortgage payments on time, but cannot raise enough cash to cover the shortfall. 
 Some eventually default, surrendering to foreclosure. But the vast majority -- embedded in their communities, their children in public schools, their reputations at stake -- wait nervously in hope that prices will bottom and rise once again, eliminating their negative equity and restoring their freedom to sell or refinance.
 ''People can't believe this is happening to them,'' said Robert Moulton, president of the Americana Mortgage Group in Manhasset, N.Y.
 In Washington, it will be difficult to engineer a bailout similar to the one for savings and loan companies in the early 1990s, because Democrats and Republicans alike cringe at the very word bailout and fear a backlash by people who never became overextended. 
 But with millions of homeowners already underwater and the prospect that millions more may face the same situation, Democrats and Republicans alike are scrambling for ideas to keep people from simply walking away from their homes and to help those struggling to pay their bills.
 Bank of America, which is in the process of acquiring Countrywide Financial and has potentially huge exposure, has circulated a proposal to create a new federal agency that would buy vast quantities of delinquent mortgages at a deep discount and replace them with fixed-rate federally guaranteed loans.
 The bank warned that tightening credit conditions were leading to ''escalating levels of delinquency and default among borrowers'' and ''an unprecedented number'' of homes that would enter foreclosure.
 Administration officials have given the Bank of America plan a cold reception. But the idea is similar to one proposed by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. 
 The Federal Housing Administration, meanwhile, is examining ways to expand its new insurance program, known as FHA Secure, to help people replace their costly subprime mortgages with federally guaranteed fixed-rate mortgages.
 Mortgage industry executives have complained that the F.H.A.'s eligibility requirements are so restrictive that the new program has helped only a trickle.
 Credit Suisse executives said they have held lengthy meetings with F.H.A. officials and have urged the agency to relax rules that currently disqualify many borrowers.
 One idea, company officials said, was to allow borrowers who had simply made six payments during the course of their mortgage to qualify.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has ordered his staff to come up with options for a broader rescue bill. An aide to Mr. Frank said his bill would, among other things, allow the government to buy up at least some troubled mortgages.
 A more modest plan is being developed by John M. Reich, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the agency that regulates savings and loan companies. His plan, still in rough form, would create a voluntary system under which mortgage lenders would reduce debt and monthly payments to reflect the diminished sales value of a home.
 It would take the remainder of the mortgage as a ''negative amortization certificate,'' a lien that the investor could recoup if the house were later sold for its original mortgage value or higher.
 In an interview, Mr. Reich said he hoped that most of the old mortgages would be replaced by cheaper mortgages insured through the F.H.A.
 ''It isn't a bailout,'' Mr. Reich said. ''It is a market-driven solution.''
 For Americans caught in a mortgage trap and owing more on a home than it would sell for, consumer spending and confidence are the most immediate casualties, Mr. Curtin reports. But the damage goes deeper.
 People cannot move easily to jobs in other cities if they have to sell their homes at a loss. The $168 billion federal stimulus package is likely to be less effective than intended because many homeowners may simply use their government checks to pay down their debts.
 Housing prices in Memphis fell by 2.5 percent last year, only the second decline since records began to be kept in 1968, and by far the largest dip, according to Chandler Reports, which gathers this data for Greater Memphis.
 The Memphis metropolitan area highlights the larger national trend, with the average first-mortgage debt, at $153,764, edging above the average home price, $152,815, for the first time. And that does not count refinancing and home equity loans, as well as closing costs.
 Collie Tuttle, in her early 60s, is caught in this bind. Four years ago, she purchased a newly built four-bedroom three-bathroom house in the Memphis outer suburb of Olive Branch, Miss., for $270,000. She put nothing down, relying on her six-figure income from selling furniture to pay down the mortgage, reducing it to $248,000.
 But then she lost her job, and in her next one -- also selling furniture, but at lower pay -- sheis being forced to choose between her home and the rest of her life.
 ''It was a big mistake on my part to buy this house,'' she said. Divorced, with two grown sons, she rattles around in it alone. She had thought the house would add to her wealth.
 But now, to sell it for the $269,000 a potential buyer was recently willing to pay, ''I would have to come up with $6,000 from my pocket,'' Ms. Tuttle said, explaining that she cannot afford to invade her meager retirement account. ''All I'm asking is for enough so that I come out even.''
 Her house payments and utilities come to nearly $2,400 a month. That is affordable, she said, on her present income. But very little is left over to replace her 11-year-old car, to travel, to pay down her credit card debt, or even to buy new clothes. 
 ''I'm stuck,'' she said. ''I've tried everything and I can't get rid of this house.'' 
 The reluctance to sell at a loss helps to explain why the number of homes listed for sale in the Memphis area has climbed to more than 13,000 from 9,000 a year ago.
 Jane and Kevin Naus, in their mid-40s, have had their home on the market since last May; their attempts to sell for a price that covers their debts are skewing their lives.
 Mr. Naus took a job in Greenville, N.C., last March, at a local bank. His wife stayed behind, putting their house up for sale, just a month before prices began to unravel.
 But there were no offers at the $239,000 the couple asked for their four-bedroom brick house on a one-acre corner lot, so they gradually cut the price to $220,000, barely enough to cover the $192,000 in mortgage debt and an additional $22,000 in closing costs and broker's fees. It still did not sell.
 Mr. Naus says prices are under downward pressure because of competition from the auctioning of foreclosed homes at bargain prices. There were 5,714 foreclosures in Memphis in 2007. ''In our neighborhood alone,'' Mr. Naus said, ''five houses were sold last September and October, and four of the five were foreclosures.''
 Mrs. Naus joined her husband in Greenville in December but he lost his job in January, when his division was shut down. The couple decided to stay in Greenville, to be near the family of Mrs. Naus, who has multiple sclerosis and no longer works. 
 Her $1,800-a-month in disability pay, however, falls short of the $1,400 in monthly payments on the Memphis house and the $700 in rent for an apartment in Greenville. The Nauses make up the difference with his severance pay, and occasional dips into their savings, which have fallen below $100,000.
 ''We don't want to lose the house or cut the price,'' Mrs. Naus said, ''and end up owing money.''
 ''Basically,'' she added, ''we are praying that the house sells before my husband's severance runs out.''
 The Breakstones are similarly in danger of sinking, despite their high income. After forking over $65,000 on the house they just sold, they are struggling with $670,000 in debt on their present, larger home -- perhaps more than the house itself is worth.
 The Breakstones, each previously divorced, married in 2006, bringing three children to their union. They needed a bigger house than the one Mr. Breakstone had built.
 Mr. Breakstone thought that he could sell his other home quickly, but it sat on the market for 17 months and finally brought only $170,000. He covered the shortfall by borrowing against his present home -- bringing it closer to being underwater, too.
 Now the Breakstones are saddled with $4,000 a month in house payments, and $14,000 more in fixed outlays, including child support, car leases, taxes, consumer debt and utilities, using up the bulk of their income.
 ''I used to think,'' Mr. Breakstone said, ''that I would pay the piper later and enjoy life now. I've totally reversed that view.''

 Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.
 ATLAS SOUND (Saturday and Sunday) In his band Deerhunter, Bradford Cox howls eerily over slow-moving noise nebulae, inevitably leading to malevolent blares. As Atlas Sound, he is a solo sound collagist whose curiosity stretches to spacey electronic samples and loops of African mbiras. With White Rainbow and Valet. Saturday at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; Sunday at 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $12. (Ben Sisario)
 BEAT THE DEVIL (Friday) Beat the Devil's Shilpa Ray is a petite powerhouse, roaring about love, horror and Solomon Grundy in a raw, bluesy alto while pumping atmospheric chords on the harmonium. The group opens an extension of the summertime Seaport Music Festival at a small (indoor) space near the South Street Seaport called @Seaport. Also on the bill is a screening of a documentary on the band. At 7 p.m., 219 Water Street, at Beekman Street, Lower Manhattan, seaportmusicfestival.com; free, but reservations are recommended. (Sisario) 
 BLACK MOUNTAIN, BON IVER (Friday) The squally Canadian group Black Mountain plays 1970s-influenced hard rock at its most digressive, by turns ominous and bucolic. Bon Iver is the project of Justin Vernon, an indie veteran from Wisconsin whose falsetto pulls his strummy, pretty songs up and away from diffident folk-rock toward something sneakier. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Kelefa Sanneh)
 BETTY BUCKLEY (Saturday and Sunday) Fusing theatrical grandeur with open-ended pop-jazz arrangements, Ms. Buckley epitomizes the singer as Method actor, passionately (sometimes scarily) living inside her material. Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m., Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Feinstein's at Loews Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; cover, $40 to $75; minimum, $25 to $40. 
 (Stephen Holden)
 LAURA CANTRELL (Friday) The sweetheart of the alt-country rodeo, Ms. Cantrell specializes in uncomplicated songs of burned hearts and private agonies -- in other words, classic country material -- and is smart enough not to let her connoisseurship get in the way of her storytelling. With Mia Riddle and Mamie Minch. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $12. (Sisario)
 ERIC CLAPTON AND STEVE WINWOOD (Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) Looking more and more like regular dads who happen to be timeless rock gods, Mr. Clapton and Mr. Winwood -- who reunited last summer at Mr. Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival -- join for three concerts at Madison Square Garden to play from the songbook of Blind Faith, their short-lived band with Ginger Baker and Rick Grech. At 8 p.m., (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $64.50 to $254.40. (Sisario)
 GEORGE CLINTON AND PARLIAMENT-FUNKADELIC (Tuesday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any puritan reflexes. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $39.50.(Jon Pareles)
 JUDY COLLINS (Friday and Saturday, and Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song, whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. At 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125 and $175. (Holden)
 DALEK, RUSSIAN CIRCLES (Sunday and Monday) Dalek is a hip-hop duo from Newark led by a rapper of the same name, who intones apocalyptic rhymes over stormy backing tracks. Russian Circles is a throwback to the 1990s heyday of ''math-rock'' instrumental bands, stuttering along in jerky, irregular time signatures before finding release in big metallic chords. With Young Widows. Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. Monday at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario)
 DEATH VESSEL, MIKE WEXLER (Friday) As Death Vessel, Joel Thibodeau, a transplant to Brooklyn from the lo-fi scene in Providence, R.I., sings bluegrass-inspired elegies in a hauntingly high, almost feminine voice. He plays at Pete's Candy Store as part of the ''Brooklyn Next'' festival with Mike Wexler, a local songwriter in the psych-folk vein who sings in a guarded near-monotone like a naughty child. At 9 p.m., 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Sisario)
 GIPSY KINGS (Monday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, the members of this French pop group are to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $39.50 to $79.50. (Pareles)
 HOT 97 WINTER FEST (Friday) When pop stars appear at concerts presented by the radio stations that helped them become famous, the mood can more resemble obligation than joy. But Hot 97's events usually deliver real thrills, as much because of the starry lineup as because of the sparks that sometimes fly between performers. Friday's show at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island is pretty fantastic: Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Trey Songz, Birdman, Juelz Santana, T-Pain, J. Holiday, Fat Joe, Rick Ross and Flo Rida. At 7:30 p.m., 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com or hot97.com/concerts; $150 to $250. (Sisario)
 KAKANDE, MORY KANTe (Sunday) Led by Famoro Dioubate, a Guinean griot based in New York, the band Kakande plays light and nimble grooves on electric bass, congas, flutes and saxophone, all surrounding the cascades of melody on Mr. Dioubate's balafon, a wooden xylophone. The concert comes with the significant endorsement of Mory Kante, one of Guinea's best-known musicians (''Yeke Yeke''). At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25. (Sisario)
 LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Friday and Saturday, Tuesday through Thursday) Lincoln Center's flagship pop series is dedicated to crossing genres and experimenting with the idea of a modern American canon. That aesthetic is perfectly embodied by the octogenarian singer Jimmy Scott, who began with Lionel Hampton and has lately been applying his stirring and still-innocent alto to songs by Prince and Elvis Costello; he appears on Friday night. Saturday features John Lloyd Young of Broadway's ''Jersey Boys'' with songs from the 1960s and '70s. But the real coup this season is K. D. Lang, who has just released perhaps her most intimate and affecting album, ''Watershed'' (Nonesuch). This is a rare opportunity to see her in such a small and casually elegant space. At 8:30 p.m., with an additional show on Saturday at 10:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $150. 
 (Sisario)
 MAGNETIC FIELDS (Friday through Sunday) For someone who detests playing live, Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields is an unfailingly charming entertainer, breezing through his repertory of caustic bonbons -- the band's latest, ''Distortion'' (Nonesuch), is a cross between Noel Coward and the Jesus and Mary Chain -- and performing his role as M.C. with perfect drollery. His band finishes a sold-out four-night run at the Town Hall, with the Interstellar Radio Company as the opening act. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org. (Sisario)
 MATMOS (Saturday) M. C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel of Matmos make music out of almost any found sounds: playing cards being shuffled, the slurping of liposuction, even melting ice. On Saturday they take on a particularly ambitious task by interpreting ''The Backyard,'' the final act of Robert Ashley's epic video opera ''Perfect Lives.'' At 8 and 10 p.m., Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10 per set. (Sisario)
 THE NATIONAL (Friday and Saturday) One of New York's unflashiest success stories, the National has built a significant following with flawless, wilting ballads featuring the weary baritone of Matt Berninger, who seems pained by his ability to conjure cruelties like ''You could have been a legend/But you became a father.'' The band has sold out two nights at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's opera house as part of the ''Brooklyn Next'' festival, which highlights Kings County talent in clubs and performance spaces all over the borough. Full schedule: bam.org. At 8 p.m., 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Sisario)
 PATATO TRIBUTE (Monday) Carlos Valdes, better known as Patato, who died in December at 81, was a diminutive giant of Latin music and jazz: an innovator on the conga drums who played with everybody and knew the right antics to stir up a crowd. Paying tribute at S.O.B.'s are Little Johnny Rivero and the LP All-Stars. At 8 and 10 p.m., 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $12 to $15. (Sisario)
 PELA, APOLLO SUNSHINE, LIAM FINN (Wednesday) Pela, from New York, calls its music ''pastoral punk,'' which means wide-open skies of bouncy bass lines and sparkling guitars. Unfortunately, it also means gloom borrowed from Interpol and the Strokes. The tunefulness of folk-rock and the Beatles goes joyously off the rails in the songs of Apollo Sunshine, from Boston. Don't miss Liam Finn, the talented 24-year-old son of Neil Finn of Crowded House, who has his father's sense of melodic, economical songcraft as well as a cool wistfulness that comes down from Elliott Smith. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $13. (Sisario)
 THE ROOTS (Friday) This veteran hip-hop group from Philadelphia has stuck proudly to socially conscious, we're-all-in-this-together lyrics, but it is its excellence and flexibility as a live funk band that have made its reputation. At 7:30 and 11 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 307-7171, apollotheater.com; $31.50 and $41.50. (Sisario)
 SON DE LA FRONTERA (Saturday and Sunday) The new generation of flamenco stars are tinkerers, adding to and subtracting from traditional performance styles in search of surprises and crossover hits. Son de la Frontera, from near Seville, Spain, uses a tres, a small Cuban guitar, for tranquil meanderings driven by the gentle rhythms of clapping hands. Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 545-7536, worldmusicinstitute.org; $35 and $45; $15 for students. (Sisario)
 ST. VINCENT (Thursday) St. Vincent is Annie Clark, a 25-year-old songwriter whose time as a collaborator of Sufjan Stevens and the Polyphonic Spree did not prepare the world for the brilliance and grandeur of her debut album, ''Marry Me'' (Beggars Banquet), a small universe of romance that recalls the prime of Kate Bush. With Foreign Born. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $15. (Sisario)
 SUPER FURRY ANIMALS, TIMES NEW VIKING (Sunday and Monday) The long-running Welsh band Super Furry Animals plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys melodies, zooming space-rock and some penitent country-folk. Times New Viking, from Columbus, Ohio, takes after Guided by Voices in all the right ways, with inspired, exuberant garage-rock fantasies and a love for sonic corrosion and distortion. But make no mistake: the high points are all secondhand. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 (sold out on Monday). (Sisario)
 JIM WHITE (Tuesday and Thursday) Swampy Southern gothic has been this songwriter's stock in trade since his emergence a decade ago. He has said that his latest album, ''Transnormal Skiperoo'' (Luaka Bop), represents a happier turn, but it sure seems as dark as ever. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $15. (Sisario)

HEADLINE: Bank Chief Says Japan's Economy Resilient

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The governor of the Bank of Japan, Toshihiko Fukui, said on Friday that the global economy continued to expand but that a slowdown in the United States, if it deepens, could affect growth in other parts of the world. 
 ''We need to bear in mind the possibility that further disruptions in global financial markets or a slowdown in the U.S. economy may have adverse implications not only for major economies but also for emerging economies,'' Mr. Fukui said at a seminar.
 He said there was no change to the bank's basic monetary policy stance, which is to adjust rates by closely examining upside and downside risks.
 Market adjustments amid repricing of risks would take time, making it unavoidable for banks to incur losses, Mr. Fukui said. 
 At a financial committee in parliament's lower house, Mr. Fukui said that Japan's economy had become more resilient to external shocks, but that ''downside risks to the global economy are heightening and their impact on Japan's economy remains uncertain.''
 ''We will fully examine not just our main economic scenario'' but the risks to the country in guiding monetary policy, said Mr. Fukui, whose term expires next month.
 The Bank of Japan has long said it will raise rates gradually, as its current policy rate of 0.5 percent is so low it could lead to overheating in the economy in the long term.
 But shaky global markets, concern over slowing American growth and growing pessimism over Japan's economic outlook have kept the bank from raising rates for a year.
 A recovery in share prices since late January has led investors to cut back expectations of a rate cut this year.
 Mr. Fukui said Japan's growth was slowing partly because of a slump in domestic housing investment. But it has become more resilient to external shocks than in the past and a positive cycle of output, incomes and spending remains intact, he said.
 ''It is highly likely that the Japanese economy will continue to expand moderately,'' he said.
 Some economists say the upbeat tone is becoming harder to swallow given growing concern that the American economic slowdown could gradually affect global growth and hurt exports.

HEADLINE: 'Oil!' and the History of Southern California

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Eric Schlosser, the author of ''Fast Food Nation'' and ''Reefer Madness,'' owned the film rights to ''Oil!'' the 1927 Upton Sinclair novel that was the inspiration for ''There Will Be Blood,'' the movie made by Paul Thomas Anderson. In this interview Mr. Schlosser explains how and why he became entranced by the book, and discusses the tumultuous era in Southern California that Sinclair wrote about. 
 The Meatpacking Connection
 Q. How did you come to be an executive producer of ''There Will Be Blood'' and to own the movie rights to ''Oil!''? Had you already read a lot of Upton Sinclair before writing ''Fast Food Nation,'' which was compared to ''The Jungle,'' the only Sinclair book most of us are familiar with? 
 A. When ''Fast Food Nation'' was published, I was constantly asked questions about Upton Sinclair, I guess because he wrote about meatpacking and I wrote about meatpacking. But I didn't really know a lot about him. I'd read ''The Jungle,'' but I didn't know much more than that. So I decided to sit down and read as many of his books as I could -- the man wrote about 90 -- and I found many of them compelling. Sinclair looked at almost every aspect of American culture and the American economy and wrote an expose about it. He wrote an expose of evangelical Christianity and religion in general, called ''The Profits of Religion.'' He wrote an expose of the banking industry and a wonderful expose about corporate control of journalism in the United States.
 And he wrote a novel called ''Oil!'' that I read and absolutely loved. It's a flawed novel but it hit deeply and stayed with me. And I was immediately struck by the idea that it would make a great film: it had a great setting and characters and set of issues -- the corruption of government by oil money, the rise of the car culture, the birth of Los Angeles -- which seemed fascinating and cinematic.
 Now, this isn't something I normally do, but I contacted the estate of Upton Sinclair and bought the film rights to the book. Before I became a journalist I worked for an independent film company in New York, and I thought that when I finished the book I was writing I would try to get ''Oil!'' made into a movie. What I really wanted to do was find a director who felt as passionately about the book as I did. Oddly enough, what happened was the director found me. It turned out that Paul Thomas Anderson had found a copy of the novel in a used bookstore in London, and become obsessed with it and its themes, much the same way I had. He got in touch with me and told me he really wanted to do a film inspired by the book.
 To be honest, at first, I wasn't sure he was the right guy for the job, which shows how smart I am. But then he came up to see me, and we spent a couple of days together, and I realized that he was the real deal, absolutely brilliant, a real artist. He had a bold and original vision of how to tell this story. He felt intensely passionate about the material. So I decided he should do it. That's how I became executive producer.
 'Los Angeles Was the Kuwait of the Jazz Age'
 Q. ''Oil!'' takes place about a decade or so later than the movie and, at 548 pages, sprawls over practically every social and economic trend of the era, from California's new car-crazed culture to face lifts to the factional battles of America's ''reds.'' But the heart of it is a detailed chronicle of the Southern California oil boom. How would you summarize how all these themes fit together?
 A. The novel is epic in scope, and it's really about the day and age in which Sinclair was living, the society of Southern California in the 1920s. George Bernard Shaw regarded Sinclair as the great historian of his era, who managed to capture the essence of the times in his novels.
 Los Angeles during the 1920s was a laboratory of the future. It was the first city created to serve the needs of the automobile -- it's where the car culture was born. And for a brief period, it was the center of world oil production. A handful of major discoveries -- at Huntington Beach, at Signal Hill near Long Beach, at Telegraph Hill and Santa Fe Springs in Orange County-- made Southern California the world's biggest oil producer. The oil industry became the leading sector of the California economy, and the state was soon responsible for about a quarter of the world's supply.
 In many ways Southern California was the Kuwait of the Jazz Age. An enormous amount of money was quickly made there and spent in all kinds of extravagant ways. Oil money funded huge real estate developments and encouraged the construction of roads and highways for the automobiles that would use the oil. Hollywood was born in the decade from around 1911 to 1921, and oil money financed some of the new films.
 Family dynasties emerged. The Gettys made their fortune from the Southern California oil boom, as did the Dohenys. Alphonzo Bell, a farmer in Orange County, suddenly became rich when oil was discovered on his land. Among other things, Bell became a real estate developer, and the wealthy enclave of Bel-Air was one of his early creations.
 This was a whole new society in the making, and it was being fueled by oil money the likes of which no other city had ever seen before.
 One of the major themes of the book is the corrupting power of oil money, a subject that could hardly be more timely. The protagonist of ''Oil!'' bribes anyone and everyone in his path, whether it's a landowner whose property he needs or a county official who can build him a new road. The bribery extends from the lowest level of society to the very top, and eventually the California oil men decided to buy themselves a U.S. President and run his Cabinet.
 The Southern California culture of the 1920s also produced a new form of evangelical Christianity. Aimee Semple McPherson was a hugely influential and popular evangelist in Los Angeles, and thousands of people attended her Foursquare Church. It was probably the first megachurch. The character Eli Sunday who appears in both ''Oil!'' and ''There Will Be Blood'' was partly inspired by McPherson. She was one of the first evangelists to preach on the radio, attracting an enormous following. And like some of her recent counterparts, her career was ended by a sex scandal.
 By the time ''Oil!'' was published in 1926, the idea of a corrupt alliance between business and government wasn't very controversial. There was enormous disillusion about the outcome of World War I and the motives behind it and the role of big business in society. That partially explains why the novel was so successful. ''Oil!'' was banned in Boston not because of its political viewpoint, but because of a subplot involving abortion.
 The Suburban Oil Derrick
 Q. Both the novel and the movie show how the oil boom and real estate dealings overlapped, whether this involved large landholders and wealthy investors, or struggling homesteaders and homeowners. What was the relationship between the two in Southern California?
 A. During the first two decades of the 20th century, as the oil industry was developing in Southern California, there was also an extraordinary real estate boom. It was targeting well-to-do Midwesterners who were drawn to the area by the climate and the appeal of a whole new way of life.
 Once oil was discovered, the two fed upon one another. For example, some people who became wealthy in the oil business later became real estate developers, like Alphonzo Bell.
 Real estate ads in Southern California began to promote the notion that if you bought some land, you could not only build a house on it, but also drill for oil there as well. Much of the oil was discovered right in the middle of suburban subdivisions, like in Long Beach and Huntington Beach. The photographs are incredible. You have these new suburban tract homes, with hundreds of oil derricks rising from their midst.
 So it was like a gold rush, and people thought they could make money off the land and make money off the derrick in their back yard.
 The area also attracted swindlers. There were a number of real estate scams, in which people were sold land believing they could become wealthy from the oil beneath it. I think the Los Angeles district attorney was involved in one of them and was imprisoned for his role in it.
 So it really was a Wild West culture, with people drawn to this new golden land with the notion of enjoying the sunshine and getting rich quick.
 The Real Oil Baron 
 Q. Who were the real-life models for the oil barons in Sinclair's novel -- J. Arnold Ross and the far less sympathetic Vern Roscoe -- and for the very different protagonist in the film, Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis?
 A. Edward Doheny was one of the central figures in the Southern California oil boom. He was a major influence on Upton Sinclair and on the director Paul Thomas Anderson in the creation of their characters.
 Sinclair was very clear in the preface of ''Oil!'' that he was not writing a roman a clef and that there was no one in the book who was directly inspired by a real-life counterpart. But Doheny obviously was an inspiration for Vern Roscoe.
 Doheny was one of the first to discover oil in the Los Angeles area and had begun his career as a miner. In ''There Will Be Blood,'' the scenes in which Daniel Plainview, the character played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is alone in a mine with a pick-ax give a strong sense of how prospectors like Doheny struggled for their money. Doheny made a fortune off oil in Los Angeles during the early 20th century -- his big strike was right near where Dodger Stadium is today -- then invested heavily in the Mexican oil industry. The final scene of ''There Will Be Blood'' was shot at Doheny's mansion.
 He thought he could get whatever he wanted by buying people, and he bought his way all the way to the top, to the White House. Doheny and his oil buddies played a leading role in gaining Warren G. Harding the presidency.
 The Harding administration was one of the most corrupt in American history. The Teapot Dome scandal, which involved payoffs for government oil leases, was named after an area in Wyoming. But one of the major leases involved was in California, at Elk Hills in Kern County, with the oil rights going to Doheny -- and a few hundred thousand dollars going into the pockets of Albert Fall, the secretary of the interior. Fall wound up going to prison for a year, but Doheny beat the rap and was never convicted, despite playing a central role in the scandal.
 The protagonist of ''Oil!'' J. Arnold Ross, in some respects resembles Harry F. Sinclair, an associate of Doheny's who was also involved in Teapot Dome.
 Upton Sinclair liked to say that all art was propaganda, of one kind or another. And he proudly turned much of his writing into Socialist agit-prop. But he decided not to do that with ''Oil!'' -- at least, not as bluntly as in other books -- and as a result, Arnold Ross is a complex, sympathetic oil man, a well-meaning capitalist. The bribery and corruption the novel depicts seem endemic to the system, simply the way of doing business, and not the fault of any individual character. I found the father-son relationship to be one of the best things about the book.
 Sinclair's Window on the Wealthy
 Q. How was it that Sinclair knew so much not only about the Socialist and workers' rights movements, which he was a part of, but also could portray, in sometimes sordid detail, the lives of the rich?
 A. Upton Sinclair gained his great literary success in the East when ''The Jungle'' was published in 1906. With some of the profits from ''The Jungle'' he created a Socialist commune in New Jersey called Helicon Hall. When that burned to the ground, creating a tabloid frenzy about his personal life, Sinclair moved to California, where he lived pretty much the rest of his life.
 Even though he was a great supporter of ordinary workers and their rights, and even though he put himself in the middle of strikes and other demonstrations on behalf of organized labor, Sinclair had a somewhat patrician background and settled in Pasadena, which was a wealthy community. He also lived for a while in Beverly Hills.
 His wife was a woman of means and had various real estate investments, including a couple of lots near Signal Hill, in Long Beach, where oil was discovered. Upton Sinclair accompanied his wife to a local community meeting where people were discussing what to do about the drilling rights. As he sat in a modest living room and watched an angry argument unfold among neighbors who were suddenly seized with greed, with visions of oil fortunes, he had the idea to write a novel about the Southern California oil boom.
 That scene is one of the early scenes in the novel, and it also appears briefly in the film. Sinclair witnessed the oil boom firsthand and became fascinated by it and decided to research every part of the industry.
 And although he was a great friend to workers, a lot of Sinclair's social life involved the wealthy of Pasadena and later of Beverly Hills. He was friends with movie stars like Charlie Chaplin, and through his wife came to know some of the wealthiest and most socially prominent people in Los Angeles. He never bought into that world, but he saw it and saw it very clearly, and spent time in the grand houses of the wealthy and at their parties, and spent time among the poorest in the city, and I think that allowed him in ''Oil!'' to depict the lives of workers, as well as those of the decadent rich in Los Angeles and Hollywood.
 How Suburban Sprawl Began
 Q. What impact did this period in Southern California history have on America?
 A. The car culture that emerged in Southern California had a profound impact on American culture, as other cities began to develop along similar lines, with the automobile at the center of regional planning, and the oil industry essential for that growth. Los Angeles had the oil and the cars at the start of the 20th century, a combination that we are still paying for. When you look at suburban sprawl throughout the United States, Southern California in the 1920's created the template.

HEADLINE: Children in Poverty: There Is No Excuse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Poverty Is Poison,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 18), echoes what members of Congress heard at a national summit meeting about child development that Democrats convened last year. Children who grow up in poverty have a much lower chance of success in school and in life, but investments in early childhood development help to even the odds, offering hope and opportunity where little existed before.
 The despair that poverty brings to millions of American children compels us to take a serious and sustained national approach. Last year's bipartisan revamping of the Head Start program to focus on early intervention was huge progress; now we need to do the hard work of making sure this important initiative is financed. 
 Other solutions can be found in our tax policy -- we can reward parents struggling to lift their families out of poverty.
 Democrats insisted that the recent economic stimulus package include rebate checks for 35 million families who work but earn too little to pay federal income tax, and we included additional benefits for families with children. The approach of these recovery rebates is similar to that of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is widely recognized as one of America's most effective anti-poverty policies.
 Poverty is indeed poison -- to the children who fall prey to it, and to the future strength of our nation. With a singularity of purpose, America can develop an antidote. 
 Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House Washington, Feb. 20, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman is right that the ''War on Poverty'' 44 years ago had a positive effect by reducing poverty, particularly among children. That this effort to improve the lives of millions of Americans was derailed by reactionary politics couldn't be more true.
 In the late 1960s, I was responsible for coordinating federal antipoverty programs for the six states of the Northeast at the United States Office of Economic Opportunity. I saw firsthand the positive effects of programs like Head Start, the Job Corps and the Neighborhood Youth Corps -- designed to help children and teenagers. 
 I also witnessed the cynical, systematic attacks on these programs by Richard M. Nixon and his point man, Spiro T. Agnew. The phony rhetoric they used to stigmatize the programs was passed along by the media. Thus, ''economic opportunity'' programs became ''minority'' and then ''welfare dependency'' ones. The reality was that two-thirds of the poor being served were white.
 Nixon severely weakened the national initiatives, and then Ronald Reagan abolished the coordinated federal effort altogether in 1981. (At the time I was chairman of the president's National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity.) The consequence: four million Americans were driven into poverty, most of whom were women and children. 
 Poverty is poison, and politics can be toxic. 
 Arthur I. Blaustein Berkeley, Calif., Feb. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman helps shatter the myth that there is nothing we can do about poverty. Too many people think that the state of poverty in America is inevitable, never questioning what we can do to change it nor looking at the inspiring progress of other industrialized nations. 
 I believe that it is possible not only to end poverty in the United States, but also to end extreme poverty around the globe within our lifetime. Our country can help make this happen by passing the Global Poverty Act and holding ourselves accountable for our part in achieving the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals.
 Cynthia Changyit Levin Morton Grove, Ill., Feb. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Having worked in Newark for over a decade, I am bewildered that people could believe that poor Americans are not that poor. 
 Poverty anywhere is not a fixed notion but a relationship between the resources available to the general public and the resources available to the poor. From health care and nutrition to transportation and access to good schools, poor children and their families struggle every minute of every day. Those who do climb out of poverty have done so with immense and uncommon personal effort. Not everyone is so gifted.
 John Edwards did indeed set the stage for Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton to follow on this matter.
 Jo Ann Joseph Glen Ridge, N.J., Feb. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In a new study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, cognitive neuroscientists found that while stories were being read to children of poverty, they were ''less able to screen out noises embedded in the stories'' than were children from more affluent families. Such evidence suggests that cognitive skills are strongly influenced by environment. 
 Since distractions of all kinds, including those that stem from difficult home environments and antisocial street behaviors, are a constant in the lives or many poor children, it is no wonder that their reading test scores suffer. Nor is it then surprising that as a consequence, dropouts and suspensions are disproportionate among minority children, especially black boys. 
 Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, now all but forgotten, needs to be revived by our next president.

HEADLINE: Kenya's Glimmer of Hope

 BODY:
After weeks of horrific tribal violence, Kenya's rival leaders appear to be closing in on a political deal. That is the only hope for stopping the killing and the only chance for salvaging a country that until recently was one of Africa's most stable and prosperous. 
 We strongly urge President Mwai Kibaki to conclude, and implement, an agreement that would share real power with his principal challenger, Raila Odinga. Anything less will stoke more fury and destruction. Together, the two must quickly address constitutional and land reform issues that are the root causes of the chaos. 
 It is terrifying how quickly Kenya began to tear itself apart after December's disputed presidential elections -- and after the electoral commission hastily handed a second term to Mr. Kibaki over Mr. Odinga. 
 The violence since has been the stuff of nightmares: rapes, mutilations and ethnic purges. More than 1,000 people have died, and 300,000 have been driven from their homes. While there has been a lull in recent days, the economy is paralyzed and observers warn that all sides are still armed and ready to attack. 
 Diplomats from the United Nations, the African Union and the United States have spent weeks prodding Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga toward some compromise. On Thursday, Kenya's government announced that it would create a new position of prime minister for Mr. Odinga, one of his chief demands. Any deal would quickly fall apart if Mr. Kibaki also doesn't cede some real authority and responsibility. Mr. Odinga deserves a meaningful role -- and Kenya's survival requires it.
 That will not be enough. The government must prosecute those responsible for the worst violence and provide new homes for the displaced. An independent commission -- made up of the country's most-respected leaders -- must be established to find out what really happened in the December vote and to recommend ways to reform and strengthen the electoral system. 
 There will be no lasting peace, we fear, unless Kenya addresses the fundamental inequalities that turned neighbor against neighbor and ethnic group against ethnic group. This is a winner-take-all system in which presidents hold tremendous power and favor members of their own ethnic group. Mr. Kibaki is a Kikuyu, the largest and most powerful ethnic group in Kenya, while Mr. Odinga is a Luo, a group that feels that it has never gotten its fair share. 
 The government must find ways to create new jobs and more equitably share land. Kenya needs a more balanced government system that gives all groups a voice and a sense that their rights will be protected. 
 Kenya will need a lot of outside help to pull back from the abyss. The international community must be ready to offer aid and technical help to encourage essential reforms. It must also be ready to impose punishments on anyone who stands in the way of a settlement.

HEADLINE: McCain Loan Complicates Financing Of Campaign

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
A bank loan that Senator John McCain took out late in 2007 to keep his presidential campaign afloat is complicating his desire to withdraw from public financing for his primary effort. 
 The Federal Election Commission, in a letter it released on Thursday, said Mr. McCain could not withdraw from public financing until he had answered questions about a $4 million line of credit for borrowing that was secured, in part, in December by the promise of federal matching money. 
 Mr. McCain sent a letter to the commission on Feb. 7 saying he had decided to decline the matching money for his primary campaign. His request for public money, in which the government matches campaign contributions, was made last year as the campaign was running out of cash. 
 After his fortunes began to rise from his victory New Hampshire and campaign gifts increased, however, Mr. McCain decided against taking the public money. Taking it would have limited his spending between now and the Republican convention in September to $40 million. 
 Candidates not accepting public money have no limits on spending in the primaries. 
 For the general election, Mr. McCain has challenged Senator Barack Obama, the leading Democratic candidate, to abide by a promise made this year to use public financing for his general election if he is the nominee and if Mr. McCain does so, as well. 
 Mr. McCain's decision to use private money through the rest of the primaries has been challenged by the election commission, which regulates campaign finance. Its chairman, David M. Mason, has questioned provisions in a loan agreement between the McCain campaign and the Fidelity and Trust Bank in Bethesda, Md.
 A modification to the loan in December requires that if Mr. McCain fails to win the Republican nomination or place within 10 percentage points of the winner, he would be forced to ''remain an active political candidate'' and apply for public financing, even if he did not want to. 
 Practically, however, the commission will most likely not address the issue before Election Day. Because of a stalemate between the White House and Senate Democrats, it has just two of the four required commissioners, meaning that it cannot conduct business. 
 At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. McCain said about the loan: ''We think it's perfectly legal. One of our advisers is a former chairman of the F.E.C., and we are confident that it was an appropriate thing to do.'' 
 Kenneth Gross, a lawyer in Washington who advises Democrats and Republicans on campaign finance, called the commission's letter ''a problem.''
 ''There is no chance that he is going to restrict his spending,'' Mr. Gross said of Mr. McCain. ''But without a commission, this situation cannot be cleared up. It is a bizarre situation.'' 
 The $4 million line of credit carries an 8.5 percent interest rate. It also required Mr. McCain, 71, to obtain a $4 million life insurance policy. Around $3 million has been borrowed under the credit line. 
 On the Democratic side, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is receiving help from a group in raising money from supporters who have given the maximum legal amount to her campaign and cannot give more. 
 The group, the American Leadership Project, a new so-called 527 committee, is about to start a television advertising effort in Ohio and Texas. Its 30-second advertisements portray Mrs. Clinton as a champion of the middle class and make thinly veiled swipes at Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Time Runs Short to Decide Albany Health Care Cuts

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer has not called anyone in the health care lobby a crybaby this year. At least not yet.
 Last year, when hospital groups and health care unions resisted Mr. Spitzer's $1.3 billion cut in health services, he ran a television commercial assailing them as the camera panned across a maternity ward full of screaming newborns. 
 They shot back with their own ads featuring a defiant nurse who told the governor to ''walk in my shoes for a day, and then call me a crybaby.'' Then, in what amounted to a public flogging, the governor told his opponents over breakfast one morning that they were ''guardians of the status quo.'' 
 But this year, as Mr. Spitzer is again proposing to cut health care spending, both sides are trying to behave.
 ''I think you can see already that the level of discussion and reaction is different this year than it was last year,'' said Dennis P. Whalen, Mr. Spitzer's deputy secretary for health. ''We've been engaged in productive discussions with hospitals about these changes that we're pursuing.''
 The president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, Kenneth E. Raske, said: ''We really didn't want to have a confrontation, nor did he. I think we've engaged in a fair, constructive, thoughtful dialogue.''
 But even if voices have been lowered, the stakes remain high. Mr. Spitzer's plan calls for the biggest changes in the way hospitals are reimbursed for Medicaid expenses in more than two decades. In all, he would eliminate $980 million in Medicaid and other health care expenses to help narrow a state budget deficit of at least $4.4 billion.
 He would achieve those savings, in part, through a major revision of the formula that sets reimbursement rates for hospitals for Medicaid expenses. Under a system established in 1981, the state has repaid hospitals for care given to Medicaid patients based on the cost of that treatment in 1981 with an adjustment each year for inflation.
 In 1981, however, medicine was radically different, and the Spitzer administration is trying to make its case that today's reimbursement rates should better reflect the changes in medical technology since then. 
 Administration officials have said the state is losing money by overpaying for procedures like hip replacements, which used to require much longer hospital stays. According to administration statistics, the procedure entailed a 14-day hospital stay in 1981, but require only 4 days now. Under the new formula, the state would pay about $17,700 for each procedure, as opposed to about $29,000. 
 Hospital lobbyists and the labor unions for health care workers do not dispute the contention that the formula needs an overhaul, but they are concerned that hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements may be shortchanged. Those facilities are often the ones in the worst financial shape -- hospitals that serve poor communities and health care providers for the elderly and physically disabled.
 Complicating matters further, hospitals and health care facilities do not yet know how they will fare individually under the formula, because the Spitzer administration has not completed its facility-by-facility analysis of the reimbursement formula changes.
 ''It's nearly a month after he's released the budget, and they don't have information,'' said Senator Kemp Hannon, chairman of the Senate Health Committee. ''Working out the specifics is a real necessity before you start to say yes to these things.''
 Mr. Whalen said the administration would have its financial analysis completed by the end of the month. But since the new fiscal year begins April 1, health care providers wonder if that will leave enough time to study the governor's plan and determine whether they should go along with it.
 ''I think they're so anxious to implement the reforms -- which we agree are needed -- that they may be hitting the accelerator too hard to try to get agreement on the details by April 1 when we don't have the impact analysis yet,'' said Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, a statewide trade group for hospitals.
 The looming question then is whether the crunch to get the budget approved on time will spoil the civility that has characterized discussions between the administration and the health care lobby so far. 
 ''Every time there is a delay in getting the data to us, that means the turnaround time for vetting that data shrinks,'' Mr. Raske said. He added, ''The health care community can step up to the plate, but we're not going to be there by ourselves.''
 Administration officials and health care lobbyists have said privately that their disagreements last year were exhausting and damaging for everyone involved. Despite the apparent willingness of both sides to bargain with as little ill will as possible, the slowing economy and growing state deficit could outweigh those intentions.
 ''There's the intent to do this differently,'' said Jennifer Cunningham, a consultant for the 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, ''but at the same time the state's finances are in worse shape than ever.''
 So far, the plan has generated little, if any, resistance in the Legislature, which must approve Mr. Spitzer's budget. 
 Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, said, ''I think it is actually quite far along on the path to becoming law.'' 
 But on the Senate side, whether there is any serious opposition remains to be seen. Mr. Hannon said he had doubts about the bill, but had not taken a firm position on it.

HEADLINE: Struggling but Grateful, Liberia Welcomes Bush

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia 

 BODY:
It has been 30 years since a sitting president of the United States has visited this West African nation, and in the decades since, rebel generals with nicknames like Butt Naked laid waste to this seaside country, raping and plundering, and a brutal warlord named Charles G. Taylor campaigned for the presidency under the slogan, ''He killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will vote for him anyway.''
 Now Mr. Taylor is gone, pushed out in 2003 after more than a decade of civil war, and Liberia is taking tender steps toward recovery under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman to be democratically elected president in modern Africa. On Thursday, Air Force One touched down at the airport near Monrovia, and a sitting president of the United States -- George W. Bush -- stepped onto Liberian soil once again. 
 ''It's easier to tear a country down than it is to rebuild a country,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech at the Barclay Training Center, where the United States is helping to train soldiers so Liberia can replace United Nations peacekeepers with its own army. ''And the people of this good country must understand the United States will stand with you as you rebuild your country.''
 While here, Mr. Bush also promised Liberia one million textbooks by the next school year, and desks and chairs for 10,000 students. 
 One subject that did not come up, at least not publicly, was Africom, the Pentagon's new command headquarters for Africa. Liberia has expressed interest in playing host to the command, but Africom has met with resistance elsewhere in Africa and for now, the headquarters will remain in Stuttgart, Germany.
 Liberia was the final stop on Mr. Bush's six-day, five-nation African tour, selected because the White House wanted to end on a high note. The country still faces enormous challenges, not least of which is the lack of an army. United Nations peacekeepers, including an all-female force from India, line the streets here. Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf told Mr. Bush that she understood that the United States would eventually have to reduce its peacekeeping assistance.
 ''But please,'' she asked him, ''do not do so so sharply as to affect our security until our forces are ready.''
 Mr. Bush has an extraordinarily warm relationship with Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf, a Harvard-educated economist whose supporters call her the Iron Lady or, simply, Ma. Laura Bush, the first lady, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice attended Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf's inauguration in January 2006. Last year, Mr. Bush awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, saying she had ''the tough mind of a natural-born executive, and the gentle instincts of a mother.''
 On Thursday, she returned the favor, giving Mr. Bush the key to the city of Monrovia, named for another United States president, James Monroe. ''You are safe here,'' she told him later.
 The historical ties between Liberia and the United States are strong, yet the emotional bond is largely one-way. Many Americans do not realize that Liberia was founded by free African-Americans, who set sail here from New York Harbor in 1820 as part of a movement in the United States to repatriate former slaves to Africa. The American dollar is widely used as currency.
 Here in Monrovia, the connection is deep, as palpable as the thick, humid air. When the White House press corps boarded a bus at the airport on Thursday, the driver stood in the aisle and made a formal introduction.
 ''My name is David,'' he said. ''I will be your driver. We have no regrets when you people come here. We love you. You are our role model.'' 
 A busload of jaded reporters applauded.
 With almost no electricity, scant running water, an unemployment rate of 80 percent and a life expectancy of 42 years, Liberia remains in rough shape. 
 The White House had initially hoped Mr. Bush could deliver his speech at the Executive Mansion, which overlooks the Atlantic, but the building was heavily damaged by fire during a Liberian Independence Day celebration two years ago, and has been under renovation since. The dirt roads from the airport to the city are lined with shantytowns, where people live in rickety shacks under corrugated metal roofs.
 But Liberia scurried to spruce up for Mr. Bush's arrival. In Monrovia on Thursday morning, workmen were still plastering Mr. Bush's picture on billboards an hour before his arrival. Schoolgirls in white shirts and navy blue jumpers waited along the streets, American flags tucked into their hands. The Stars and Stripes flew along the city's main boulevard, twinned with the Liberian flag, which is nearly identical to that of the United States except it has one star instead of 50. It is also reminiscent of the flag of Texas, the Lone Star State.
 ''I feel pretty much at home here,'' Mr. Bush said. ''In Liberia, you fly the lone star flag.''
 Mr. Bush was the third American president to visit Liberia -- after Franklin D. Roosevelt and Jimmy Carter -- and the visit was an emotional, if brief, way to wrap up his African travels. It lasted just six and a half hours, and the speech at the training grounds lasted just six minutes. 
 It was also a bookend, of sorts, to Mr. Bush's previous trip to Africa, in the summer of 2003, when he faced difficult questions about why the United States was not intervening to end the bloodshed here. After returning home, Mr. Bush sent in a contingent of about 200 marines to join 100 American troops already in Liberia, enough to persuade Mr. Taylor to flee. On Thursday, Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf sounded grateful.
 ''We thank God that the guns of war are silenced,'' she said. ''Our reconciliation process is under way, our people are beginning to sleep more soundly at night.''

HEADLINE: Children in Poverty: There Is No Excuse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Poverty Is Poison,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 18), echoes what members of Congress heard at a national summit meeting about child development that Democrats convened last year. Children who grow up in poverty have a much lower chance of success in school and in life, but investments in early childhood development help to even the odds, offering hope and opportunity where little existed before. 
 The despair that poverty brings to millions of American children compels us to take a serious and sustained national approach. Last year's bipartisan revamping of the Head Start program to focus on early intervention was huge progress; now we need to do the hard work of making sure this important initiative is financed.
 Other solutions can be found in our tax policy -- we can reward parents struggling to lift their families out of poverty.
 Democrats insisted that the recent economic stimulus package include rebate checks for 35 million families who work but earn too little to pay federal income tax, and we included additional benefits for families with children. The approach of these recovery rebates is similar to that of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is widely recognized as one of America's most effective anti-poverty policies.
 Poverty is indeed poison -- to the children who fall prey to it, and to the future strength of our nation. With a singularity of purpose, America can develop an antidote. Nancy Pelosi 
 Speaker of the House
 Washington, Feb. 20, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman is right that the ''War on Poverty'' 44 years ago had a positive effect by reducing poverty, particularly among children. That this effort to improve the lives of millions of Americans was derailed by reactionary politics couldn't be more true.
 In the late 1960s, I was responsible for coordinating federal antipoverty programs for the six states of the Northeast at the United States Office of Economic Opportunity. I saw firsthand the positive effects of programs like Head Start, the Job Corps and the Neighborhood Youth Corps -- designed to help children and teenagers. 
 I also witnessed the cynical, systematic attacks on these programs by Richard M. Nixon and his point man, Spiro T. Agnew. The phony rhetoric they used to stigmatize the programs was passed along by the media. Thus, ''economic opportunity'' programs became ''minority'' and then ''welfare dependency'' ones. The reality was that two-thirds of the poor being served were white.
 Nixon severely weakened the national initiatives, and then Ronald Reagan abolished the coordinated federal effort altogether in 1981. (At the time I was chairman of the president's National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity.) The consequence: four million Americans were driven into poverty, most of whom were women and children. 
 Poverty is poison, and politics can be toxic. Arthur I. Blaustein 
 Berkeley, Calif., Feb. 18, 2008

HEADLINE: Debate Takes On Contentious Air For Democrats

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama veered from collegial to clenched and combative in a debate on Thursday, with Mrs. Clinton turning especially aggressive as she all but accused Mr. Obama of plagiarism and derided his political message as ''change you can Xerox.''
 Mr. Obama, buoyed by 11 straight victories in the most recent nominating contests, sought to maintain a positive tone throughout, though at one point he accused Mrs. Clinton of suggesting that his supporters were ''delusional'' or ''being duped'' by his themes of hope and unity.
 Those few sharp rejoinders, as well as an emotional closing comment by Mrs. Clinton that seemed to move the audience -- and even Mr. Obama -- were the most memorable moments in a debate that had been loaded with expectation, with Mrs. Clinton seeking to stop the Obama juggernaut.
 After the 90 minute face-off was over, it was not clear that Mrs. Clinton, in the toughest position of the campaign for her, had done enough to change the course of the contest. 
 Mrs. Clinton, who is girding for March 4 Democratic primaries in Texas and Ohio that aides say she must win, alternated between high notes early in the debate -- smiling and nodding at Mr. Obama, pitching her economic plans for the umpteenth time -- and pointed criticisms that she has been making somewhat fruitlessly for weeks now, like portraying Mr. Obama as all talk and little action.
 In her sharpest attack to date on the originality of his oratory and ideas, Mrs. Clinton cited news reports about Mr. Obama's nearly verbatim use of remarks first delivered by a close ally, Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts. She argued that Mr. Obama had drawn great praise for his speeches, and then questioned whether they had been plagiarized.
 Playing off a trademark line of Mr. Obama's, she said: ''Lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in. It's change you can Xerox.''
 The comment elicited loud groans and some applause from the audience at the University of Texas at Austin.
 Mr. Obama softly spoke over her, saying, ''Oh, but that's not what happened there,'' yet eventually chose not to engage, saying he wanted to reply only to her criticism on the issues. A moment earlier, though, he had defended his use of Mr. Patrick's language, saying that it was limited to two lines -- and that the criticisms reflected a ''silly season in politics.''
 ''The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think is silly,'' he said to applause and laughter.
 For the most part, the two rivals heaped their complaints and criticisms on Republicans -- namely President Bush, whom the they mentioned a total of 23 times. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton mentioned the leading Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain of Arizona, twice; Mr. Obama mentioned him four times.
 If the candidates spent the first 45 minutes acting more like running mates than rivals, Mrs. Clinton spent much of the last half of the debate trying to inflict damage on Mr. Obama. 
 At one point, she sought to undermine his stature by referring to an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday night, much replayed on cable news, in which a Texas official supporting Mr. Obama, State Senator Kirk Watson, could not cite a major legislative accomplishment of the candidate.
 ''I do think that words are important and words matter,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ''but actions speak louder than words, and I offer that.''
 Defending his record in the Senate, Mr. Obama pushed back against Mrs. Clinton, suggesting that she was insulting the intelligence of the millions of people who had voted for him, attended his rallies and watched their debates.
 ''The implication is, is that, you know, the people who have been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional,'' Mr. Obama said to chuckles. ''The thinking is that somehow they're being duped and that eventually they're going to see the reality of things.''
 ''Well,'' he added, ''I think they perceive reality of what's going on in Washington very clearly.''
 While Mrs. Clinton may have been harsher than Mr. Obama, she ended the debate with the night's most memorable grace note, as if eager to leave voters with a gentle final impression after the political skirmishing. 
 ''The hits I've taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country,'' she said. ''And I resolved at a very young age that I'd been blessed, and that I was called by my faith and by my upbringing to do what I could to give others the same opportunities and blessings that I took for granted.''
 ''You know, no matter what happens in this contest, I am honored to be here with Barack Obama. I am absolutely honored,'' she said, reaching over to shake her rival's hand. ''You know, whatever happens, we're going to be fine.''
 Mrs. Clinton entered the debate with her advisers somewhat torn about how aggressive to be against Mr. Obama, who is enjoying significant political momentum after his string of victories and has a narrow lead in delegates for the Democratic nomination.
 Some advisers said she believed that simply by sitting on a stage, making her cases side-by-side with Mr. Obama, would reap points because she would look experienced and presidential.
 But others said she needed to be more assertive in making him seem ill-prepared for the job.
 As for her actual performance, Mrs. Clinton appeared relaxed at times as she made her case. At other points, she looked as if she could not wait to deliver punches or respond to Mr. Obama's remarks. Still, little that she said appeared to rattle him.
 For much of the debate, the two candidates agreed over and over again: on their support for immigration reform, economic aid to struggling Americans and democracy in Cuba. 
 Each also tried to appeal to a major part of the Texas electorate, Hispanics, by emphasizing their support for immigration reform and their involvement in past legislation to help immigrants and their family members.
 Mrs. Clinton has come to count on Hispanic voters, who helped her win nomination contests in Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico, but Mr. Obama is hoping to make in-roads with populist economics arguments and by emphasizing the needs of immigrants.
 Mrs. Clinton defended her support for building a physical barrier along the border with Mexico, noting twice that Mr. Obama voted for it as well, but at the same time she called for a review of the project, which, she said, had become ''absurd'' under the Bush administration.
 ''As with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that is counterproductive,'' she said.
 Mr. Obama almost entirely echoed her remarks, and also drew applause with his criticism of the current president. ''The Bush administration is not good at listening; it's not something they do well,'' he said.
 The candidates also agreed that no aspect of a bilingual culture had been bad for America.
 ''I think it's important for a lot of Americans to do what I have never been able to do: learn another language,'' Mrs. Clinton said. She noted that she opposed making English the official national language, but also said it should remain a ''common unifying'' language for all Americans.
 Asked about Cuba, Mr. Obama said he was willing to meet with Raul Castro ''without preconditions,'' but he also insisted that thetalks would have to deal with human rights, releasing political prisoners and other issues.
 Mrs. Clinton responded that the United States should have diplomatic negotiations ''with anyone'' but noted that she and Mr. Obama had differed on when and whether the president should offer a meeting with foreign leaders without preconditions.
 ''I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change is happening,'' she said.
 The candidates drew frequent applause as they made direct appeals to people in ''Ohio and Texas,'' a phrase they both used a few times. 
 Clinton advisers have said Mrs. Clinton must win the Texas and Ohio primaries by at least 10 percentage points if she has any hope of catching up with Mr. Obama in the delegate count, particularly because he has shown momentum recently at picking up support from elected officials who count as superdelegates.
 The two candidates are set to meet for a final debate on Tuesday in Cleveland.

HEADLINE: Don't Rerun That '70s Show

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Will the next president be the second coming of Jimmy Carter? Given Thursday's economic headlines, full of dire warnings about the return of 1970s-style stagflation, you might think so.
 Realistically, though, the parallels between the problems facing the U.S. economy now and those of the late-1970s aren't that strong. That's the good news.
 The bad news is that the economy probably will look similar to, but worse than, the economy that undid the first President Bush. And it's all too easy to see how the next president could suffer a political fate resembling that of both the elder Mr. Bush and Mr. Carter. 
 Let's talk first about the Carter-era economy.
 Jimmy Carter's overall economic record was much better than most people realize -- the average economic growth rate under his administration was 3.4 percent per year, slightly higher than the growth rate under Ronald Reagan and far better than growth under either Bush. 
 Reagan famously asked Americans whether they were better off than they had been four years ago; the answer, actually, was yes -- most families had higher real income in 1980 than they did in 1976.
 But the good economic news came in the Carter administration's early years, while its final year was marked by rising unemployment and soaring inflation, largely caused by a surge in oil prices.
 And once again we have a weakening economy coupled with rising inflation, again thanks in large part to a surge in oil prices.
 That said, I don't believe we're really facing anything comparable to 1970s stagflation. For one thing, we're less dependent on oil: America has more than twice the real G.D.P. it had in 1979, but consumes only slightly more oil. For another, there's no sign of the wage-price spiral that once drove inflation into double digits -- in fact, wage growth has been declining even as inflation rises.
 What's much more likely is that we'll have an economy like that of the early 1990s, only worse.
 The first President Bush presided over the 1990-1991 recession. But his real problem came during the alleged recovery, which was hobbled by financial problems at many banks, which had been badly damaged by the collapse of the late-1980s real estate bubble, and by sluggish consumer spending, held down by high levels of household debt. 
 As a result, the unemployment rate just kept rising, not reaching its peak of 7.8 percent until June 1992.
 If all this sounds familiar, it should. Many economists have pointed out the parallels between the current situation and the early 1990s: another real estate bubble, subprime playing more or less the same role formerly played by bad loans by savings and loan institutions, financial trouble all around. 
 The difference is that the problems look a lot worse this time: a much bigger bubble, more financial distress, deeper consumer indebtedness -- and sky-high oil prices added to the mix. So if history is any guide, we should be looking at an extended period of economic weakness, probably extending well into 2010, and quite possibly even longer.
 Can the next president do anything to avoid that outcome? In terms of straight economics, the answer is a clear yes. 
 To this day, it's not clear what Mr. Carter could have done differently: stagflation is a problem with no good solutions. But weak spending is a treatable condition. A serious fiscal stimulus plan -- one that emphasized public investment and aid to Americans in economic distress rather than across-the-board tax rebates, which many people won't spend -- could do a lot to ease the country's economic pain. 
 Politically, however, it's hard to see this happening.
 If the next president is a Republican, he will be captive to the doctrine that tax cuts are the answer to all problems, and therefore won't seek an effective response to the economy's troubles.
 And even if the next president is a Democrat, any serious stimulus plan would face intense, ideologically motivated opposition in Congress. Will the next president be prepared to fight for an effective plan? Or will we end up with a compromise like the one Congressional Democrats agreed to this year, legislation that assuages conservative objections at the cost of undermining the plan's effectiveness?
 Until recently, I thought the biggest political struggle facing the next president was likely to be over health care reform. But right now it looks as if the first thing on the next administration's plate will have to be dealing with a weak economy. 
 And if effective action isn't forthcoming, the next president will suffer the fate of Jimmy Carter, who began his administration with words of uplift -- ''Let us create together a new national spirit of unity and trust'' -- and ended up delivering America into the hands of the hard right.

HEADLINE: Suburbia's March to Oblivion

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
THE mortgage crisis has put ''for sale'' signs in front of houses across the country -- including so-called McMansions -- the large, expensive, often tasteless homes that have taken up so much suburban space over the last couple of decades.
 But frantic selling is just the beginning, according to Christopher B. Leinberger, a professor of urban planning at the University of Michigan. ''Signs of physical and social disorder are spreading'' through cul-de-sac suburbia, he writes in the March issue of The Atlantic. And it is not just because of the mortgage mess. A ''structural change'' is occurring in the housing market -- a ''major shift in the way many Americans want to live and work,'' moving social problems out of the city and into the suburban fringe (theatlantic.com). 
 Mr. Leinberger cites the work of Arthur C. Nelson, the director of Virginia Tech's Metropolitan Institute (www.mi.vt.edu), who has predicted that, by 2025, there will be a surplus of 22 million large-lot homes (those built on at least one-sixth of an acre). This, Mr. Leinberger writes, is a result of ''the pendulum swinging back toward urban living,'' thanks to a set of economic, social, and demographic trends.
 The result, he says, could be that low-density suburbs ''may become what inner cities became in the 1960's and 1970's -- slums characterized by poverty, crime, and decay.''
 Meanwhile, he writes, demand for ''urban living'' will continue apace. Although the mortgage squeeze may slow development of lofts and condominiums in the central cities and ''walkable'' towns and suburbs, ''it will surely continue.''
 The idea that the American experiment with suburban sprawl would end badly is not a new one. But the work of Mr. Nelson, as amplified by Mr. Leinberger, shows that ''the traditional suburban model may be even less sustainable than we imagine,'' writes Gil Smart, a columnist with The Sunday News of Lancaster, Pa., and writer of that newspaper's blog, Smart Remarks (blogs.lancasteronline.com/smartremarks). 
 But Mr. Smart has one criticism of the idea. If, he writes, ''McMansion suburbia is on the far side of the bell curve, it ultimately becomes even harder to construct new 'urbanized' developments than it already is because the people who own those McMansions will have an obvious incentive to fight tooth and nail to protect their equity. Assuming they have some.''
 HEALTH ALERTS The site design leaves much to be desired -- graphics tend to run into each other and block out text and links, for example -- but HealthInspections.com might be a good place to visit before heading to your favorite restaurant.
 The site is meant to ''spotlight the important work of health inspectors and to give the public easier access to inspection reports for restaurants, hotels and other public facilities.'' It offers video, audio, and text reports from across the country. Recent features include an audio report on ''Bad Goat Meat in Chicago,'' and a warning that the lemons pushed onto your drinking glass may be ''loaded with bacteria.''
 FAKE ADS This month, strange billboards and TV spots started appearing in Canada for an obviously fake pharmaceutical product called ''Obay.'' One bus-stop ad, depicting a smiling father and son, carried the message: ''My son had ideas of his own. Obay put a stop to that.''
 Joey deVilla of Toronto wondered if the ads were a critique of overmedicated youth (joeydevilla.com). The Torontoist wondered if the ads were for a church or religious cult (torontoist.com).
 Turns out the ads were devised by Colleges Ontario, an organization that represents 24 Ontario colleges. A news conference will be held Monday explaining what the ''product'' is all about (collegesontario.org).

HEADLINE: Washington Lends a Hand

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Over the last two decades, few industries have lobbied more ferociously or effectively than banks to get the government out of its business and to obtain freer rein for ''financial innovation.'' 
 But as losses from bad mortgages and mortgage-backed securities climb past $200 billion, talk among banking executives for an epic government rescue plan is suddenly coming into fashion.
 A confidential proposal that Bank of America circulated to members of Congress this month provides a stunning glimpse of how quickly the industry has reversed its laissez-faire disdain for second-guessing by the government -- now that it is in trouble.
 The proposal warns that up to $739 billion in mortgages are at ''moderate to high risk'' of defaulting over the next five years and that millions of families could lose their homes. 
 To prevent that, Bank of America suggested creating a Federal Homeowner Preservation Corporation that would buy up billions of dollars in troubled mortgages at a deep discount, forgive debt above the current market value of the homes and use federal loan guarantees to refinance the borrowers at lower rates.
 ''We believe that any intervention by the federal government will be acceptable only if it is not perceived as a bailout of the bond market,'' the financial institution noted.
 In practice, taxpayers would almost certainly view such a move as a bailout. If lawmakers and the Bush administration agreed to this step, it could be on a scale similar to the government's $200 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry in the 1990s. The arguments against a bailout are powerful. It would mostly benefit banks and Wall Street firms that earned huge fees by packaging trillions of dollars in risky mortgages, often without documenting the incomes of borrowers and often turning a blind eye to clear fraud by borrowers or mortgage brokers. 
 A rescue would also create a ''moral hazard,'' many experts contend, by encouraging banks and home buyers to take outsize risks in the future, in the expectation of another government bailout if things go wrong again. 
 If the government pays too much for the mortgages or the market declines even more than it has already, Washington -- read, taxpayers -- could be stuck with hundreds of billions of dollars in defaulted loans. 
 But a growing number of policy makers and community advocacy activists argue that a government rescue may nonetheless be the most sensible way to avoid a broader disruption of the entire economy. 
 The House Financial Services Committee is working on various options, including a government buyout. The Bush administration may be softening its hostility to a rescue as well. Top officials at the Treasury Department are hoping to meet with industry executives next week to discuss options, according to two executives.
 ''There are a lot of ideas out there,'' said Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for President Bush, when asked at a White House press briefing on Friday about a possible buyout program. ''There are many different ways in which we can address this problem and we continue to look at ways in which we can do that.'' 
 Supporters contend that a government rescue could be the fastest and cleanest way to force banks and investors to book their losses from bad mortgages -- a painful but essential first step toward stabilizing the housing market. 
 The government would buy the mortgages at their true current value, perhaps through an auction, at what would probably be a big discount from the original loan amount. The mortgage lenders, or the investors who bought mortgage-backed securities, would be free of the bad loans but would still have to book their losses.
 If the government took control of the bad mortgages, supporters of a rescue contend, it could restructure the loans on terms that borrowers could meet, keep most of them from losing their homes and avoid an even more catastrophic plunge in housing prices.
 ''Every citizen has a dog in this hunt,'' said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a community advocacy group that has developed its own mortgage buyout plan. ''The cost of spending our way out of a recession is something that everybody would have to bear for a very long time.'' 
 Mr. Taylor estimated the government might end up buying $80 billion to $100 billion in mortgages. But he said the government could recoup its money if it was able to buy the mortgages at a proper discount, repackage them and sell them on the open market.
 Surprisingly, the normally free-market Bush administration has expressed interest. Treasury officials confirmed that several senior officials invited Mr. Taylor to present his ideas to them on Feb. 15. Mr. Taylor said he had also received calls from officials at the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is part of the Treasury Department.
 But even supporters acknowledge that a government rescue poses risks to taxpayers, who could be left holding a very expensive bag.
 Ellen Seidman, a former director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and now a senior fellow at the moderate-to-liberal New America Foundation, said the government's first challenge is to buy mortgages at their true current value. If the government overpaid or became caught by an even further decline in the market value of its mortgages, taxpayers would indeed be bailing out both the industry and imprudent home buyers.
 ''It's not easy, but it's not impossible,'' Ms. Seidman said. ''There are various auction mechanisms, both inside and outside government.''
 A second challenge would be to start a program quickly enough to prevent the housing and credit markets from spiraling further downward. Industry executives and policy analysts said it would take too long to create an entirely new agency, as Bank of America suggested. But they expressed hope that the government could begin a program from inside an existing agency.
 But even if the government did buy up millions of mortgages and force mortgage holders to take losses, the biggest problem could still lie ahead: deciding which struggling homeowners should receive breaks on their mortgages. 
 Administration officials have long insisted that they do not want to rescue speculators who took out no-money-down loans to buy and flip condominiums in Miami or Phoenix. And even Democrats like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, have said the government should not help those who borrowed more than they could ever hope to repay.
 But identifying innocent victims has already proved complicated. The Bush administration's Hope Now program offers to freeze interest rates for certain borrowers whose subprime mortgages were about to jump to much higher rates. But the eligibility rules are so narrow that some analysts estimate only 3 percent of subprime borrowers will benefit.
 Bank executives, meanwhile, warn that the mortgage mess is much broader than people with subprime loans. Problems are mounting almost as rapidly in so-called Alt-A mortgages, made to people with good credit scores who did not document their incomes and borrowed far more than normal underwriting standards would allow. 
 Borrowers who overstated their incomes are not likely to get much sympathy. But industry executives and consumer advocates warn that foreclosed homes push down prices in surrounding neighborhoods, and a wave of foreclosures could lead to another, deeper plunge in home prices.
 Right or wrong, the arguments for rescuing homeowners are likely to be blurred with arguments for rescuing home prices. At that point, industry executives are likely to argue that what is good for Bank of America is good for the rest of America.

HEADLINE: China, in New Role, Uses Ties to Press Sudan on Troubled Darfur

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan 

 BODY:
Amid the international outrage over the bloodshed in Darfur, frustration has increasingly turned toward China, Sudan's biggest trading partner and international protector, culminating in Steven Spielberg's decision last week to withdraw as artistic adviser to the Beijing Olympics. 
 And it may be working. 
 China has begun shifting its position on Darfur, stepping outside its diplomatic comfort zone to quietly push Sudan to accept the world's largest peacekeeping force, diplomats and analysts say. 
 It has also acted publicly, sending engineers to help peacekeepers in Darfur and appointing a special envoy to the region who has toured refugee camps and pressed the Sudanese government to change its policies. 
 Few analysts expect China to walk away from its business ties to Sudan, but its willingness to take up the issue is a rare venture into something China swears it never does -- meddle in the internal affairs of its trading partners. 
 ''China in my view has been very cooperative,'' said Andrew S. Natsios, the former special envoy of President Bush to Sudan. ''The level of coordination and cooperation has been improving each month.''
 For all of China's billion-dollar oil contracts, multimillion-dollar arms shipments and Security Council veto protection of Sudan, the global power with the biggest influence over the country has scarcely a dime invested here, has no ambassador on Sudanese soil and has slapped progressively tougher sanctions on its government: the United States. 
 While conventional wisdom holds that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have sapped America's prestige and power, especially in Muslim countries, the United States remains the gatekeeper to international respectability in the eyes of the Sudanese government, and its power to influence top officials here -- through threats or inducements -- remains unmatched, diplomats, Sudanese government officials and analysts say. 
 ''Coming to some sort of agreement with the United States is the Holy Grail of Sudanese politics,'' said a senior Western diplomat in Khartoum, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''No one has been able to deliver it.''
 This holds true though Sudan is awash in investments from Asia and the gulf that would, in theory, allow the oil-rich but development-poor country to prosper more broadly than it has despite American opprobrium. 
 American approval and acceptance would transform Sudan in a way the billions of dollars from China, India, Malaysia, Iran and the gulf have been unable to: by opening the spigots of Western development aid and with it a deal to reduce its nearly $30 billion in external debt, along with technical assistance to manage the tide of money rushing in. 
 ''We are receiving billions of dollars in foreign investment that we are not even prepared to absorb,'' said Ali al-Sadig, a senior diplomat and Sudanese government spokesman who worked on the China desk of Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years. ''We don't have the capacity. We need Western expertise. Sudan wants, above all, a normal relationship with the United States and the West.'' But the Bush administration seems divided on what to do about Darfur. On one hand, there is heavy pressure from advocacy groups, Congress and others to take a tough line with Sudan, stepping up sanctions and hammering the government over new attacks. 
 At the same time, because Sudan is a crucial ally of the United States in fighting terrorism, some in the administration argue that it cannot be allowed to become more isolated and further beyond the West's orbit than it already is, diplomats and analysts say.
 Sudan's relationship with the West has been troubled ever since Omar al-Bashir seized power in 1989 and embraced militant Islam, playing host to a variety of jihadists, including Osama bin Laden. The relationship hit its lowest in 1998 when the Clinton administration bombed a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory it claimed was producing chemical weapons, though the allegation has never been proved. 
 After Sept. 11, Sudan reached out to the United States, realizing that it could find itself in the cross hairs of America's military might just as Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and Iraq later did. The two countries have since cooperated on counterterrorism issues, even though Sudan remains on an American list of nations that sponsor terrorism. 
 Mr. Bush sent John C. Danforth, the former Missouri senator, to help negotiate a deal to end the civil war in southern Sudan that had lasted two decades and claimed two million lives. 
 Sudan had many reasons for wanting to end the war -- its military was exhausted, and a stalemate was helping neither side -- but the chance to improve relations with the United States was a big inducement for Sudan's government. 
 Then ''Darfur happened,'' the diplomat said.
 At first, the conflict in Darfur seemed a fly in the ointment, a distraction from the main work of securing peace between the north and south. But five years later, the Darfur crisis is undermining the peace agreement and threatens to tear Sudan apart.
 More than 200,000 have died in Darfur, according to international estimates, and 2.5 million have been pushed into camps here and in Chad, sowing chaos in one of the world's poorest regions. Sudan's government says the toll has been greatly exaggerated.
 The conflict has also inspired one of the largest protest movements in the United States since the battle to end apartheid in South Africa. China, with its vast commercial interests and sensitivity to criticism around the Olympics, presents a unique leverage point for this movement. 
 Like Mr. Spielberg, Mia Farrow, an actress and Darfur activist, has said China can do more, specifically by pushing for the full deployment of 27,000 peacekeeping troops in Darfur, supplying some of the helicopters needed for the mission and demanding an end to aerial bombardment of civilian areas. 
 But some diplomats and analysts argue that offering concessions, not demands -- a chance to come off the state sponsor of terrorism list or easing sanctions -- may offer the best opportunity to get Sudan's government to strike a deal in Darfur. 
 There are grave risks to that strategy, not least of which is that Sudan's government has a history of making agreements and not fully putting them in place. 
 ''What this government responds to is pressure,'' Jerry Fowler, executive director of the Save Darfur Coalition, said of Sudan's leaders. 
 As a senior Western diplomat in Khartoum put it, the West's stance on Sudan must be ''mistrust but verify,'' a twist on Reagan's posture on the Soviet Union. 
 Furthermore, the Sudanese government is far from unanimous in its craving for international respectability. The small cadre who have ruled this country since the National Islamic Front seized power in a coup in 1989 have tried a variety of guises -- radical Islamism, Arab nationalism and garden variety despotism -- in their quest to hang on to power. 
 The relative moderates who were crucial to negotiating a deal with the south have been largely sidelined, and analysts and diplomats say that hard-liners in the military and elsewhere are increasingly less interested in Western ties. 
 As for China, analysts warn, there are limits to how far it will go. Olympics or no, China's leadership simply has too much at stake in Sudan. 
 ''Their political fortunes are tied to their ability to deliver a constant stream of economic goods at home,'' said Christopher Alden, a senior lecturer at the London School of Economics who has studied China-Africa relations. ''They can't say, 'O.K., we have sunk billions over the long term in Sudan and we are just going to walk away from it because of Darfur.' It is just not going to happen.'' 
 China, along with Iran, Russia and others, is still selling weapons to Sudan. While China says it is abiding by a United Nations embargo on sending weapons directly to Darfur, an analysis of shell casings and vehicles found in Darfur by a panel of United Nations experts found that Chinese weapons were making their way to Darfur.
 Fractures among the rebel groups in Darfur and threats from Sudan's neighbors, like Chad, may have more impact on the quest for peace than anything Washington or Beijing does.
 Still, John Prendergast, a former Clinton administration official, advocate and writer on Sudan for two decades, said that China and the United States needed to be engaged. 
 ''Unless China and the U.S. are both exerting much more pressure on Sudan, the crisis will continue to spiral out of control,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''China has unique economic leverage, while the U.S. retains leverage based on its ability to confer or withdraw legitimacy.''

HEADLINE: Trapped in the Past

 BODY:
Kosovo's declaration of independence was never going to be easy. Still, it is alarming to see the Serbian government so unwilling to peacefully channel its citizens' anger and disappointment. Its failure to control rampaging crowds that set fire Thursday to part of the United States Embassy compound in Belgrade -- and attacked several other embassies -- is a shocking and unacceptable abdication of responsibility. 
 Russia's willingness to fan those resentments is another sign that it is more interested in accumulating power than exercising leadership. On Friday -- incredibly and dangerously -- Russia's envoy to NATO warned that Moscow might use ''brute military force'' if the alliance expands its peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
 Every effort has been made by NATO, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States to accommodate Serbian fears and sensitivities. Belgrade has never demonstrated any remorse for the carnage unleashed by former dictator Slobodan Milosevic on Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority -- nor any willingness to negotiate the province's independence.
 When Kosovo declared its independence last week -- after nearly a decade of international administration -- it did so with the full support of the United States and other major states under a sensible United Nations plan that includes international supervision and protection for its ethnic Serb minority. 
 Kosovo's future had to be settled so the Balkans could finally move beyond such anachronistic hatred. Earlier this month, a slim majority of Serbians voted for a better future -- including conciliation and a place in Europe -- by re-electing President Boris Tadic, a moderate who wants to plant Serbia firmly in the West. Since then, nationalist leaders have incited passions with anti-Western rhetoric and promises never to relinquish Kosovo. 
 That made Thursday's incident all the more suspicious. The Serbian police -- who are obligated under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic facilities -- left the American compound unguarded, allowing protesters to force their way in and set part of it ablaze. 
 We are also disappointed that Mr. Tadic chose to be out of the country at such a sensitive time. If he is to fulfill his own vision of a Serbia anchored in the West, he is going to have to show more courage and a firmer hand. 
 Serbian leaders have a clear choice: stoke this xenophobia and self-pity, and further isolate themselves, or tamp down these passions and accept Europe's offer of economic and political integration.
 The European Union has offered Serbia an agreement that would begin to open European markets to Serbian products and relax some travel restrictions as a first step toward membership in the union. On Friday, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said negotiations would be delayed until the crisis abated. Belgrade has a lot to lose by ignoring such warnings. 
 History has proved that Balkan resentments can trigger wider conflict. It must not happen again.

HEADLINE: Cheap Cocaine Floods a Slum In Argentina, Devouring Lives

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Joao Pina contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
Bilma Acuna has two drug-addicted sons and roams the streets of the Ciudad Oculta slum here with a purpose: to save others from the same fate. 
 She and the group of mothers she helps organize have become the only bulwark, it seems, against the irrepressible spread of paco, a highly addictive, smokable cocaine residue that has destroyed thousands of lives in Argentina and caused a cycle of drug-induced street violence never seen before in this country. 
 The scourge underscores a significant shift in both Argentina and its larger neighbor, Brazil, which in just a few years have become sizable cocaine consumers. Brazil now ranks as the second largest consumer of cocaine in the world after the United States, the State Department says.
 The surge in drug use has been fueled by porous borders, economic hardship and, more recently, the rolling back of restrictions on coca growing since President Evo Morales took office in 2006 in neighboring Bolivia. The result has been the democratization of cocaine in this part of South America, which has become the dumping ground for cheaper, lower-quality cocaine. 
 In the five years since residents first began noticing the crude yellowish crystals being smoked on the streets of Ciudad Oculta, a neighborhood of 15,000 people within Buenos Aires, paco has become the dominant drug that dealers are peddling.
 Just weeks after first trying the drug, Mrs. Acuna's son Pablo Eche began selling everything he owned to feed his addiction. He committed violent robberies. In a drug-fueled rage he destroyed his house and then sold the land that was left, ending up freezing and alone on the streets until his grandmother took him in. 
 ''The majority of the kids are using here,'' said Mrs. Acuna, 46. ''My son saw what was happening with the kids in the streets that were using paco, and he always said he wouldn't get caught up in that. But he did.''
 The challenges to stopping the flow are immense. Fewer than 200 federal police officers patrol Brazil's 2,100-mile border with Bolivia, though the Brazilian government says reinforcements are on the way. Only 10 percent of Argentina's airspace is covered by radar, leaving traffickers free rein. 
 Cocaine seizures and major drug raids in Argentina and Brazil have surged in the past two years. The influx of raw cocaine paste used to make crack, from both Bolivia and Peru, has been particularly acute. In Brazil, such seizures by the federal police nearly quadrupled from 2006 to 2007, to 2,700 pounds from about 710 pounds, according to the police.
 In Argentina, the deep financial crisis of late 2001 turned places like Ciudad Oculta into what are known here as villas miserias, or towns of misery, easily exploitable markets of impoverished people looking for escape. 
 ''Cocaine is no longer the drug only of the elite, of high society,'' said Luiz Carlos Magno, a Brazilian narcotics officer in the Sao Paulo State Police Department. ''Today kids buy three lines of cocaine for 10 reals,'' or about $6. For about $1 in Brazil and about $1.50 in Argentina, users can buy enough of the cocaine for a 15-minute high. 
 Paco is highly addictive because its high lasts just a few minutes -- and is so intense that many users smoke 20 to 50 paco cigarettes a day to try to make its effects linger. Paco is even more toxic than crack cocaine because it is made mostly of solvents and chemicals like kerosene, with just a dab of cocaine, Argentine and Brazilian drug enforcement officials said. The surge in lower-quality cocaine hitting the streets has resulted from a crackdown by both countries on the chemicals needed to transform cocaine paste, or pasta base, as it is called, into powder form.
 Tougher customs rules to track the flow of the chemicals, manufactured in large quantities in both countries, have limited access for Bolivian traffickers seeking to refine the base cocaine into higher-value powder, said Gen. Roberto Uchoa, Brazil's national drug secretary.
 As the quality of Bolivian cocaine has fallen off, the European market, in particular, has rejected it, the general said. So more of it has gone to Argentina and Brazil. In Sao Paulo, the police say the cocaine on the streets is less than 30 percent pure. ''Every year they are producing more, and that is driving down prices,'' said Mr. Magno, with the state police. 
 Traffickers are cutting the cocaine powder with everything from boric acid to lidocaine to baking powder, leading to severe health effects like infections and blood clots, health officials said. ''It is the garbage cocaine that is coming here,'' Mrs. Acuna said. ''The kids here are smoking garbage.''
 Mrs. Acuna, a soft-spoken Paraguayan native, is battling paco's spread to save the barrio, but also to save her family. Tragedy first struck in August 2001 when two drug dealers shot and killed her 16-year-old son, David, one week after he was believed to have witnessed a murder. The dealers are now in prison for his death.
 A few years later Pablo Eche, her eldest son, and her younger son, Leandro, 20, became addicted to paco. That was when she helped form a Mothers of Paco support group. 
 With less than three dozen members in Ciudad Oculta, the mothers have few ways to counter the armed dealers who hold sway over the neighborhood. Instead, they find safety in numbers.
 On one recent afternoon, Mrs. Acuna led a walk through the Oculta with some eight women. As she walked along the mostly unpaved streets, Bolivian and Paraguayan music blaring from open windows, she pointed out kiosks and red brick homes where dealers were known to sell. A teenager strode by at one point, a pistol stuffed in the front of his shorts. 
 A tiny police station the size of a one-car garage sat in a makeshift plaza. A police car was parked outside. ''The police haven't entered here much since 2001,'' Mrs. Acuna explained. 
 Argentine government officials have increased money in recent years for drug education, prevention and rehabilitation, but they have yet to announce any major plans to tackle the paco problem, which has left local law enforcement officials overwhelmed.
 Instead, led by the mothers, residents are largely taking matters into their own hands. Mrs. Acuna fields dozens of calls a week from mothers seeking help with their children's addictions. She refers some to government-run psychiatric clinics, and urges others, some of them recovering from addictions themselves, to join the group.
 Mrs. Acuna operates a small diner with a bare concrete floor where the mothers hold many of their meetings. At one meeting on Jan. 28, Liliana Barrionuevo blurted out that not enough was being done to crack down on the dealers. Some mothers cast their eyes around nervously, fearful of reprisals.
 ''Before there were codes,'' another mother, Andrea Cordero, chimed in angrily. ''The dealers would never sell to young kids, and the users would never use in public. Now there are no codes. We need to stand up and stick it to two or three dealers.''
 The descent of Mrs. Acuna's son Pablo Eche parallels that of his neighborhood. His addiction began in 2003, when he was 21. His girlfriend at the time, six months pregnant with their son, left him and moved to Italy. Argentina's economic crisis was still ravaging the country, and Ciudad Oculta was gripped by hopelessness.
 Every day seemed to be worse. ''The lack of money isn't the nightmare,'' Mr. Eche said of the economic crisis. ''It's the pressure that it causes in a person, the desperation and the depression.'' He said he ''was looking for a way to not feel anything, to not feel sadness, to find a way not to cry.''
 For months he had passed the kiosk on a corner near his house where he knew dealers were selling a new drug, one, it was whispered, that could cheaply fill that hollow place inside. ''I always passed it, but never bought anything,'' he said.
 Then one day he did.
 From the first 15 minutes, paco seized his soul. Soon, he could no longer hold a job, even at his mother's diner. And he could never have enough. At one point he went on a three-day paco bender without a wink of sleep, he said. 
 Three months after smoking his first pipe, he sold anything he could to turn into cash for paco. Finally, in a drug-induced hysteria, he destroyed the one-bedroom house his mother had given him, tearing down the roof and walls and ripping out the flooring. Eight months into his addiction, he sold what was left for about $315, one-quarter what his mother had paid.
 His relationship with his mother was in shambles. He had stolen from her, and stolen from other family members as well. ''I had turned into a nobody to her,'' he said. ''I caused her a lot of pain.''
 He was homeless, starving and suffering from severe drug-induced chills when his grandmother finally took him in. His mother later came around. 
 These days, his eyes are clear, his voice steady. Interned at a drug-dependency clinic some 40 minutes from Ciudad Oculta -- his fourth rehabilitation stint -- he said he had been clean of drugs since October. 
 Now 25, he is again writing poetry, something he had not done since before he discovered paco. ''The future is uncertain,'' he said. ''But I am getting back my dreams.''
 But he worries about his brother Leandro, who is still prone to all-night paco benders. ''I hope he finds a way to stop,'' he said. And he mourns for Ciudad Oculta. ''Right now I can see all the little kids lining up to buy,'' he said, closing his eyes deeply. ''Paco is a plague. Somehow we need to protect them from this.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 28, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday described a cocaine epidemic in Argentina fed by the consumption of paco, an addictive smokable cocaine residue. The article included an explanatory paragraph about paco's addictive power and toxicity that repeated material from a 2006 article published in The Miami Herald, without attributing it to the newspaper. The correspondent, who had done his own research with Argentine and Brazilian officials on the drug and its effects, should have summarized it in his own words, or credited The Herald.

 F.C.C. fines 13 FOX STATIONS The Federal Communications Commission on Friday fined 13 Fox TV stations $7,000 each for airing a 2003 episode of ''Married By America'' that included graphic scenes from bachelor and bachelorette parties. The F.C.C. in 2004 proposed a $1.2 million fine against 169 Fox affiliates that aired the episode. But the agency, in a forfeiture order on Friday, said it would only fine stations in markets from which it received complaints. ''Fox strongly disagrees with the commission's conclusions in the notice and we will be actively considering our options,'' Scott Grogin, the company's senior vice president for corporate communications, said. The company is owned by the News Corporation. (AP) 
 7 MONTHS IN TRADING CASE 
 A former broker at Bank of America, Paul Risoli, was sentenced to seven months in prison on Friday for taking $12,500 in bribes in exchange for shares of initial public offerings. Mr. Risoli is one of 10 people who pleaded guilty in an insider trading case that prosecutors said was one of the largest on Wall Street in recent years. Mr. Risoli, right, who worked for Banc of America Securities, admitted in August that he accepted kickbacks from a partner at a New York-based hedge fund, in return for shares in companies going public. ''I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to make up for what I did wrong,'' he said in federal district court in Manhattan. In March, Risoli and 12 others were accused of trading on previous knowledge of mergers and stock picks. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 ALCAN FACES ANTITRUST ACTION The European Commission said on Friday that it had charged Alcan, the Canadian aluminum producing unit of Rio Tinto, with the antitrust violation of ''tying'' the sale of one product to another. Alcan denied the accusations. The commission said those wanting to buy Alcan's aluminum smelting technology also had to purchase handling equipment sold by Alcan subsidiary ECL. ''It is the commission's preliminary view that Alcan is dominant on the market for aluminum smelting technology and that this contractual tie might significantly harm its customers and ultimately end-users of aluminum,'' the commission said. (REUTERS) CHANGE AT VANGUARD The Vanguard Group, a fund manager known for its low-cost portfolios, surprised the industry on Friday when it announced that its chief executive, John J. Brennan, would step down. 
 The company said that a longtime Vanguard executive, F. William McNabb III, who has run the institutional investor group for more than a decade, would become president on March 1 and succeed Mr. Brennan within a year. During Mr. Brennan's 12 years leading Vanguard, the company's assets increased to $1.25 trillion from $238.7 billion. His decision shocked industry analysts and investors, especially considering he is only 53 and says he is in good health.
 In addition to taking the post of president on March 1, Mr. McNabb will become a Vanguard director. Mr. Brennan was handpicked for the job when Vanguard's founder, John Bogle, searched for a successor. (REUTERS)
 LOWER RATING FOR LENDER GMAC and its Residential Capital mortgage unit were cut several notches deeper into junk status by the rating agency Standard & Poor's , which said mounting mortgage losses might require new capital injections from General Motors Corporation and Cerberus Capital Management. 
 Separately, ResCap said it might sell its business that finances vacation resorts. It said it has borrowed $635 million under a new $750 million financing agreement from GMAC to fund that business's operations while it looks for a buyer. GMAC has been exploring asset sales, acquisitions and joint ventures for ResCap, which lost $4.35 billion in 2007 as the housing slump led to higher defaults and lower loan volume

 HELP FROM NORTHERN TRUST The Northern Trust Corporation became the latest money manager to aid ailing short-term funds when it said on Friday that it had earmarked as much as $229 million for eight funds that are exposed to troubled structured investment vehicles. The firm said it would use its own money to keep clients from losing their money in funds that suffered losses due to soured SIVs. Traditionally in short-term funds, investors expect to get their money back and if funds' losses are too severe, managers have stepped in to make their clients whole. The company said it would take a ''nominal'' noncash charge of as much as $229 million. (REUTERS)
 RETAIL SURGE IN CANADA Canadian retail sales advanced for a third straight month in December on new automobiles, a sign that consumer spending remains buoyant and may temper an economic slowdown. Sales rose 0.6 percent to 35.1 billion Canadian dollars ($34.7 billion), after a 0.9 percent gain in November, Statistics Canada said. Fourth-quarter sales rose 1.2 percent, while sales for all of 2007 increased 5.8 percent, the agency said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

HEADLINE: With Housing in a Downturn, a Company Renovates

BYLINE: By PATRICIA R. OLSEN

 BODY:
AS the post-holiday blues drag on for retailers, even high-end brands are feeling the pinch. Hunter Douglas, in Upper Saddle River, N.J., is the leader in the custom window coverings industry, but even it is not immune from the housing slowdown and the current economy. While waiting for the housing industry and consumer confidence to improve, Hunter Douglas is focusing on its internal operations and strengthening its dealer and distributor alliances.
 As someone who survived toppling off a cliff on a horse while growing up in Oklahoma, the chief executive, Marv Hopkins, has shown he can deal with pressure. Recently he discussed weathering a weakened economy and banking on the company's green product line. Here are excerpts from the discussion. 
 Q.How is Hunter Douglas faring in the housing slowdown?
 A. Business is tougher than it was when housing was at an all-time high the last few years, but our December sales were flat with last December. Given the market and the general performance of home furnishings and home decor companies, we feel we did far better than most companies in the industry, who have reported 15, 20 or 30 percent downturns. We like our chances going forward.
 Q.Are you wholly dependent on how well the housing industry does, or do high-end consumers like yours buy no matter what?
 A. As anyone in the home furnishing or home decor industry, we're affected, but we're not wholly dependent. Our target consumer has substantial discretionary funds and they're interested in the best products and brands for their home. Our average sale to consumers is somewhere between $1,500 and $3,000. They look at it as a long-term investment. 
 The largest segment of our business is related to remodels and renovations. If folks aren't buying new homes, they're probably going to renovate and thus need new window-covering products.
 Q.What is your strategy when there are rumors of a recession? Have you cut back on staff, or will you, if the economy doesn't improve soon?
 A. We don't anticipate cutbacks. It takes a long time to learn the complexity of our products and our business. We believe in a long-term strategy. We may be more selective in adding personnel in the future. When business is good in our industry, there's a tendency, no matter how good you are, to operate a little more loosely than you should. The current economy is an opportunity for us to tighten up internally and improve our operations, come out of it a stronger company.
 In 2008 we're going to be even more aggressive and invest more in marketing and our overall sales effort than in previous years. It's an opportunity to strengthen our position in the market. The window is one of the most important visual areas in the home. We need to do an even better job of preparing our retail dealers and educating the consumer about our products. We're also making a major investment to redesign and improve our Web site so customers can better interact with us.
 Q.How does this downturn compare to earlier ones you've been through?
 A. To us, the last soft period was in 1991. The business did flatten out for a time, but we took an aggressive position. We introduced one of the most successful products in the industry, Silhouette window shading, and we couldn't keep up in demand in the near term. We invested heavily in it, and despite the consumer slowdown it took off like a rocket.
 Q.You've been at the top of your game for so long. Is this a chance for the smaller companies to gain on you?
 A. In custom window coverings, we have a larger share than the next two companies combined. As closely as we can measure it, we have between 25 and 30 percent market share. I'm always running scared because I don't want to take anything for granted. We respect our competition. Our feeling is, if we take better care of our customers than anyone else, we'll be O.K.
 Q.Your parent company in the Netherlands is publicly held, yet you're private. Is that challenging?
 A. That's the way we like it. Our whole philosophy is to operate in a very decentralized way -- minimal interference with maximum accountability. As a private part of a public company, we don't have to worry about quarterly performance and can focus on the long term. We don't have the distractions that we might have if we were listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Q.Is global warming helping your bottom line?
 A. I can't measure it, but many of the unique window coverings we've developed are cellular -- they have an insulating air space in the middle, between two or three layers of fabric -- and do a great deal to reduce energy needs in the home by helping to keep the cold air out in the winter and the heat out in the summer. Our products are green. We see an opportunity going forward to promote these advantages even more strongly to a receptive public.
 Two years ago we introduced a new product, the Duette Architella, that is highly energy-efficient. It has a fabric cell within a cell. There's nothing like it on the market. This year we're introducing Pirouette window shadings, which look like a hobbled Roman shade, roll up like a roller shade and offer adjustable light control like a blind.

HEADLINE: Ahhh, the Seductive Fragrance of Molecules Under Patent

BYLINE: By CHANDLER BURR

 BODY:
Its scent is reminiscent of a mixture of a just-picked apple and a rose in its prime. But to the Takasago International Corporation, which manufactures this synthetic material, it smells even sweeter. 
 Last year, that chemical, with the trade name Thesaron, became an essential ingredient in a new perfume, Silver Shadow Altitude, released by Davidoff, a brand owned by Coty. Playing a role in one of the most successful international fragrance trade names -- Davidoff has had a scent on the top five perfume best-seller list for the last 20 years -- means that molecule is highly profitable for Takasago. 
 Thesaron is a perfume industry version of pharmaceuticals like Lipitor, the commercial name of the active ingredient developed by Pfizer that lowers blood cholesterol. Drug companies have long made a lot of money by patenting new molecules.
 Similarly, the scent makers -- Symrise of Holzminden, Germany; Givaudan of Geneva; International Flavors and Fragrances of New York; and Takasago of Tokyo -- spend billions on research to find new smell molecules, patent them and sell them. The innovative scents of these ''captives,'' as the patented molecules are known, are crucial to enticing consumers to buy the 600 or so new perfumes introduced every year and appealing to buyers of other fragrant products like soaps and air fresheners. 
 Captives have other virtues as well. Jean Jacques, Takasago perfumer, put Thesaron in Altitude, for example, because it solved three problems: Thesaron has the fruity/rosy note of a very expensive class of molecules called rose ketones, but it costs far less and can be used in unlimited amounts (rose ketones are restricted because they set off allergic reactions at high doses). 
 Ned Polan, a vice president for fragrance ingredient research at I.F.F., pointed out another quality of captives: they allow perfumers to recreate smells found in nature and create new, wholly unknown ones. 
 ''There are no new colors to see and very few new sounds, but we are actually creating new, unique smells no one has ever smelled before,'' Mr. Polan said. It is, quite literally, as if a paint company could make a new shade of blue.
 Givaudan produces natural and synthetic perfumery raw materials and employs the perfumers who use these materials to make fragrances. In 2006 Givaudan's sales were 2.9 billion Swiss francs ($2.64 billion), and the double-digit sales growth of its fine-fragrances division -- which that year made perfumes for Yves Saint Laurent, Burberry, Tom Ford and Hugo Boss -- was powered by Givaudan's captives. 
 Givaudan began creating molecules in 1902. ''Our new molecule platform drives our innovation and takes up a most significant part of our R&D budget,'' said Kate Greene, vice president for marketing at Givaudan. ''We have over 50 researchers dedicated to new captives.''
 Like Pfizer, Abbott Laboratories or Novartis, Givaudan's annual report prominently lists its new patents: ''Three new molecules were introduced to the perfumers' palette in the first half of 2007. Zinarine, natural green and tomato leaf notes with aspects of mint, fig, hyacinth; petitgrain Paradisamide, a long-lasting, fresh tropical fruit note with nuances of grapefruit, rhubarb and cassis; and Florymoss, a floral, green, mossy note which blends well with floral fruity and spicy accords.'' 
 As with other scent makers, Givaudan does not break out the share of its research devoted to creating captives, but the company's total research budget in 2007 was 371 million Swiss francs. According to Ms. Greene, Givaudan has become the leading producer of captives; its perfumers put the captive Amber Ketal in Aqua di Gio from Armani and Polo Blue from Ralph Lauren. 
 Each year, Givaudan's scientists develop over 2,000 new molecules. After scent evaluation, synthesis studies and toxicity testing, ''only three or four per year are selected for launch,'' Ms. Greene said. 
 But they are crucial. Captives ''provide newness to our perfumers' palettes,'' she said, ''which in turn brings innovation to our clients' brands.'' 
 Takasago has just reorganized its two main chemical research centers in Japan and the United States. A scientist there, Ryoji Noyori, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2001 for his work in the synthesis of new captives. 
 Takasago's captive Hindanol is in the scent it makes for Johnson & Johnson's self-tanning product Holiday Skin. It smells of sandalwood, but it can do what no natural sandalwood can.
 Where the natural is heavy and used as a perfume's ''base note'' -- smelled only after the lighter molecules have diffused -- Hindanol is highly diffusive and thus can be used as a ''top note,'' allowing the user to smell sandalwood where she would not have before.
 ''Captives give us performance and functional attributes in different applications like soap or detergents where you might need specific attributes,'' said Michael Popplewell, vice president for corporate research at I.F.F.
 One example is a molecule that stays firmly on fabric, perfect for scenting laundry detergents. ''That's a specific attribute we like to see,'' he said.
 Captives also bolster ecological efforts. A captive synthetic jasmine can smell stronger than its natural counterpart, so perfumers can use fewer chemicals to get the same power, which reduces both the company's costs and the amount of water needed to wash it away.
 John C. Leffingwell, a scent industry analyst, notes: ''Sandalwood is becoming outrageously expensive, around $1,700 per kilogram, and in short supply.'' India's sandalwood forests have been so decimated, further harvesting has been banned. Also, captives do not require costly and polluting fertilizers or cause farmers to deplete the soil.
 The bulk of I.F.F.'s fundamental research spending goes to new molecules, and I.F.F. supports a large interdisciplinary scientific team.
 ''Your chemist generates a molecule,'' Mr. Popplewell said. ''Then you have to analyze what you've created -- is it pure, how does it work? -- then you have to create a synthesis, and then you have to figure out how to scale up to industrial production levels.'' 
 Each molecule is assessed for potential commercial value -- and each must pass toxicology tests. Those selected for the patent process are written up by I.F.F.'s patent lawyers and submitted to patent offices around the world. Responses arrive, Mr. Polan said, ''generally in six months to several years.''
 In the United States, patents generally run 17 years, but after about 10 years, scent makers will start selling captives to their competitors, sacrificing exclusivity but generating another revenue stream.
 Mr. Popplewell will not divulge how many researchers at I.F.F. work on new captives. ''But we're increasing activities in open innovation,'' he said. ''There's lots of smart people out there, so we're collaborating with neighboring disciplines, universities, consultants and outside institutes.''
 Scent makers do not reveal the cost for each molecule. ''The cost depends on what the patent office makes us do, on the chemical, on the testing we have to do to get technical details right on yield, purity and reproducibility of the process synthesis chemistry, on whether we need new equipment and processes to make the molecule,'' Mr. Popplewell said. ''Also the planned use or production volume: how much do we think we're going to use in perfumes.'' 
 He added: ''It isn't cheap.''
 But in the end, it leads to I.F.F. captives like a proprietary musk I.F.F. uses in Sarah Jessica Parker's perfume Lovely. 
 Costs can limit the number of new molecules that the scent makers bring to market. ''The biggest,'' said Jonathan Warr of Takasago's research department, is ''safety testing, particularly now with more restrictions being imposed by clients. We're only interested in captives with global scope, materials that can be manufactured and marketed in China and Japan as well as Europe and North America.''
 One recent successful Takasago captive is l-muscone. A musk, l-muscone has been known for years, but no one could come up with a way to make it economically until Takasago did. It then patented not the molecule but the synthesis pathways to produce it.
 L-muscone is still expensive (''It's a luxury material,'' Mr. Warr said, ''costing high four figures per pound''), and it has no trade name yet because Takasago does not sell it to anyone else. It's a ''nature identical'' -- identical to the molecule found naturally in a gland in the musk deer -- but Takasago produces only the synthetic version. 
 Andrea Lupo, a perfumer at Takasago, put l-muscone in the perfume Intimately Night for David and Victoria Beckham and Coty, their licensee.
 ''It helps create the scent's unique signature,'' she said. ''The Coty people wanted a fragrance of edginess and masculinity. I wanted to give it a fresh, edgy top, and I used ginger and mandarin to blast that out, with a warm, sensual sandalwood, amber and coconut middle,'' including the noncaptive synthetic aldehyde C-18. 
 With conventional musks, Ms. Lupo said, the perfumer has to use a lot, but that then damps the other materials.
 ''The benefit of l-muscone is that you can get a musk effect using a small amount,'' she said. ''So I was able to get a dark sexiness without repressing my sparkling top notes. It lets you use musk in a different way.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 7, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Feb. 23 about molecules used to make perfumes misstated the length of patents in the United States. It is 20 years, not 17. The article also misidentified the makers of two perfumes and misspelled the name of one of the perfumes. Polo Blue from Ralph Lauren is made by International Flavors and Fragrances, and Acqua di Gio (not Aqua di Gio) from Armani is made by Firmenich. Neither are made by Givaudan. The article also misstated the proprietary status of Amber Ketal, a scent used in both perfumes. It was no longer under patent when it was used in those two fragrances.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Agency Says Iran Has Used New Technology

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The International Atomic Energy Agency described for the first time on Friday the evidence it has shown to Iran that strongly suggests the country had experimented with technologies to manufacture a nuclear weapon, but reported that Iranian officials had dismissed the documents as ''baseless and fabricated.''
 The exchange was contained in an 11-page report in which the agency painted a mixed picture of Iran's activities, and confirmed that Iran had begun to deploy a new generation of machinery to enrich uranium. The report, prepared by Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the agency, said Iranian officials had finally begun to answer a number of longstanding questions about its nuclear activities. 
 But officials with the United Nations agency said Iran had refused to deal with the evidence that served as the basis for American charges that Iran had tried to design a weapon. Much of it was contained in a laptop computer slipped out of the country by an Iranian technician four years ago and obtained by German and American intelligence agencies.
 A National Intelligence Estimate published in early December by American intelligence agencies concluded, to the surprise of many in the White House, that Iran had suspended its work on a weapons design in late 2003, apparently in response to growing international pressure, adding that it was not clear whether the work had resumed.
 That report threw into disarray the Bush administration's efforts to increase pressure on Iran. Since early last summer Mr. Bush has been trying to persuade the United Nations Security Council to ratchet up sanctions against Iran and pass a third resolution intended to cause more economic pain to the country. 
 But with the doubts now that Iran is actively pursuing a weapon, Russia and China -- which have deep commercial and oil ties to Iran -- have balked, agreeing only to a greatly watered-down set of sanctions that has yet to go to the Security Council for a vote.
 Those sanctions are not based on suspected weapons work, but rather on Iran's continued refusal to halt enriching uranium. The new report confirms that Iran has begun deploying a new generation of centrifuges that can make fuel, for nuclear power plants or for weapons, much more efficiently.
 ''If this resolution is not voted, the credibility of the Security Council will be very much in doubt,'' R. Nicholas Burns, an under secretary of state, said on Friday. ''The Security Council must now vote for new sanctions.''
 But Mr. Burns is leaving his post in a week, and inside the administration, it is becoming clear that the Iranians have been able to build centrifuges far faster than the administration could impose new sanctions. 
 Since the intelligence report came out, America's allies have spun all kinds of theories about the internal machinations that led to it, including that intelligence analysts were boxing Mr. Bush in, preventing him from taking military action against Iran's nuclear sites. 
 Officials who worked on the report have denied any such intent. The director of national intelligence, Mike McConnell, told Congress he now regretted how the intelligence estimate was presented, saying it failed to emphasize that Iran was moving ahead with the hardest part of any bomb project: producing the fuel. Designing a crude weapon is considered a far easier task.
 With an eye to the decisions Mr. Bush's successor will have to make, two retired senior diplomats, William Luers and Thomas Pickering, and a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jim Walsh, are publishing an article next week in The New York Review of Books urging the United States to use the intelligence report as a reason to open unconditional talks with Iran, and ultimately to establish an international fuel-production facility on its soil. 
 But Mr. Burns rejected that idea again Friday, and for years the administration has argued that if such a facility was allowed in Iran, its scientists would learn the difficult art of uranium enrichment and ultimately use that knowledge in a covert bomb project.
 It was the evidence that Iran had, in the past, tried to design a weapon that is at the heart of the last confrontation between Iran and the nuclear agency. 
 Since 2005, the I.A.E.A. has urged the United States and other countries to allow it to show Iran the evidence obtained on the laptop, which intelligence officials have said once belonged to an Iranian technician with access to the country's nuclear program. But the United States. refused to allow the information to be shown to the Iranians until a few weeks ago. 
 Now that roadblock has been broken. The report says that a week ago the I.A.E.A was given permission to show original documents to the Iranians. In the report issued Friday, the agency described some of that evidence in public for the first time. 
 The most suspicious-looking document in the collection turned over to the I.A.E.A. was a schematic diagram showing what appeared to be the development of a warhead, with a layout of internal components. ''This layout has been assessed by the agency as quite likely to be able to accommodate a nuclear device,'' the I.A.E.A. wrote. But that does not prove it was a nuclear warhead, and Iran argued that its missile program used ''conventional warheads only.''
 David Albright, a former weapons inspector who now runs the Institute for Science and International Security, said: ''The issue now is whether this is symptomatic of a comprehensive nuclear weapons effort, or just individual projects. Is it part of a plan to design and develop a weapon that can fit on a nuclear missile? And if so, why are so many pieces missing?''

HEADLINE: Landmark Massachusetts Building Where Wharton Wrote Faces Foreclosure

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
The Mount, Edith Wharton's estate in Lenox, Mass., is in danger of being put in foreclosure, says Stephanie Copeland, president of Edith Wharton Restoration, the organization that owns and maintains this stately residence and its surrounding gardens.
 Since 2002, Ms. Copeland explained by phone this week, the Mount, which is open to the public -- much of it has been restored in recent years to match the period when Wharton lived there -- has been covering its operating expenses by borrowing from the Berkshire Bank in nearby Pittsfield. It now owes the bank some $4.3 million, and in mid-February, when it failed to meet a scheduled monthly payment of $30,000, the bank sent a notice that it intended to start foreclosing unless the default was remedied promptly, Ms. Copeland said.
 To stay open, she added, the Mount needs to raise $3 million by March 24. ''The bank has really been very patient,'' she explained. ''They're eager to help us work this out.'' 
 If the Mount succeeds in raising that sum, Ms. Copeland said, an anonymous donor is waiting in the wings who has pledged to match it. The money could be used to help restructure the bank loan and to settle another outstanding debt, roughly $2.5 million, that the Mount incurred from a private lender in 2005 to buy Wharton's 2,600-volume library from George Ramsden, a British book collector. The Mount also owes Mr. Ramsden roughly $885,000, to be paid off in nine yearly installments, and recently it defaulted on a scheduled payment to him, too.
 ''The situation is quite serious,'' Sandra Boss, interim chairwoman of the Mount's board, said in a telephone interview from London, where she works. ''On the one hand, the Mount is winning awards for preservation and is internationally renowned as an institution. And it's well run from an efficiency perspective. We've made great progress by cutting costs and raising revenues. On the other hand, our current debt levels are unserviceable and unsustainable. We're not in control of our own destiny unless we can mount a restructuring of our debt.'' 
 Ms. Boss became a board member in late 2006, when the board was reformed to include people with business expertise and fund-raising experience. ''We knew the situation was challenging,'' she said. ''But we didn't anticipate it would get this bad.'' She added that raising money for nonprofit organizations was more difficult in a downward-trending economy and ruefully recalled the flinty Mrs. Gryce, a character in Wharton's novel ''The House of Mirth,'' who only ''subscribed to Institutions when their annual reports showed an impressive surplus.'' 
 The Mount, which is open from May to October and weekends in November and December, receiving some 30,000 visitors annually, was built by Wharton in 1902. She designed it herself, in accord with the simple aesthetic -- simple for the time, anyway -- she had championed in her first book, ''The Decoration of Houses,'' written with Ogden Codman Jr. The house has 35 rooms, including an enormous piano nobile, or first-floor gallery, but is noteworthy in part for its private spaces, especially Wharton's bedroom suite, where she did most of her writing.
 Wharton lived at the Mount only until 1910, when her marriage to the troubled Teddy Wharton became unsalvageable, and she moved permanently to France. But the house, which she treasured in memory, was where she came into her own as a writer; it's where she finished ''The House of Mirth,'' her breakthrough novel (part of whose profits paid for the Mount's elaborate gardens) and got the inspiration for ''Ethan Frome.'' It is now on the register of National Historic Landmarks and is one of only a few such places associated with a woman and her accomplishments.
 From 1912 to 1942 the Mount was owned by private parties, including Carr V. Van Anda, a former managing editor of The New York Times, and then it was bought by the Foxhollow School, a girls' boarding school, which sold it to a developer in 1977. In 1980 the property was purchased by Edith Wharton Restoration, which leased it to Shakespeare & Company, a local theatrical troupe, until 2001, when long-postponed renovation began. The Mount has received numerous preservation grants over the years, as well as private gifts, and much of the house now looks the way it did when Wharton lived there.
 ''It's easy to get people to pay for a new roof or to plant the garden,'' Ms. Copeland said. ''What's hard is to get them to pay for operations.''

HEADLINE: Word of Bailout for Insurer Lifts Market

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street staged a turnaround late Friday, shooting higher in the last half-hour of trading after word that a bailout plan for the troubled bond insurer Ambac Financial Group could be announced next week. 
 The major indexes were narrowly mixed after a week of choppy trading.
 Reports shortly before the closing bell that a bailout plan for the Ambac Financial could be announced Monday or Tuesday pushed shares up sharply. 
 Ambac finished up $1.48, at $10.71.
 The market's turnaround came after nearly two full days of selling. The Dow Jones industrial average had been down nearly 130 points, but by the close, showed a 225-point reversal from its lows of the session.
 ''With the overall financial crunch we've experienced, this brings new confidence in the sector,'' said Jim Herrick, manager of equity trading at Baird & Company, referring to Ambac.
 Ambac's proposal includes a plant to split itself in two in a bid to safeguard its top credit ratings and avert losses on securities that it guarantees for big banks.
 The Dow rose 96.72 points, to 12,381.02.
 Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.58 points, to 1,353.11, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 3.57 points, to 2,303.35.
 For the week, the Dow edged up 0.27 percent, while the S.& P. 500 rose 0.23 percent and the Nasdaq lost 0.79 percent.
 The market's early decline followed a sell-off Thursday that left the Dow down more than 140 points, or 1.15 percent. 
 Investors worried about a weaker-than-expected reading on regional manufacturing from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia as well as another drop in the Conference Board's monthly index of leading economic indicators.
 Bond prices reversed alongside stocks, falling 8/32, to 97 16/32. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.8o percent from 3.77 percent late Thursday. 
 Crude oil for April delivery rose 58 cents, to settle at $98.81 a barrel in New York trading.
 The day's late reversal appeared to ease some of Wall Street's concerns about the prospects for the financial sector and the overall economy after several weak economic readings. 
 The reports in recent weeks have raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve will be able to fend off a recession. There have also been more urgent fears that the United States may be entering a period of stagflation -- when stalling growth accompanies rising prices -- for the first time since the 1970s.
 As occurred Wednesday and again late Friday, investors at times set aside those concerns and snapped up stocks either to cover bets that stocks would fall or because of genuine optimism that officials from the Fed to other parts of the government could help right the economy. 
 Wednesday's gains followed a quiet start to the week Tuesday -- markets were closed Monday -- and came after minutes from the Fed's last meeting indicated that the central bank planned to lower interest rates as needed and look past some gathering concerns about inflation.
 The Fed's next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for March 18. Policy makers lowered crucial interest rates half a point, to 3 percent, on Jan. 30, after an emergency three-quarter-point cut the previous week.
 Ryan Detrick, strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, said that among the reports next week, investors will be looking to readings on producer prices -- a crucial measure of inflation -- as well as consumer sentiment. Mr. Detrick noted that recent consumer confidence figures, which have been weak, added to concerns that hesitant consumers could pare their spending.
 In addition, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will be testifying about the economy during two appearances on Capitol Hill.
 In corporate news, Merrill Lynch lowered its ratings on the government-sponsored lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to sell, contending the companies face continued headwinds amid the credit crisis. Freddie Mac fell $1.14, or 4.1 percent, to $26.61, while Fannie Mae declined 27 cents, to $28.72.
 The software maker Intuit fell $2.74, to $27.05, after posting a 21 percent decline in its second-quarter profit late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Move Over, Oil, There's Money In Texas Wind

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: SWEETWATER, Tex. 

 BODY:
The wind turbines that recently went up on Louis Brooks's ranch are twice as high as the Statue of Liberty, with blades that span as wide as the wingspan of a jumbo jet. More important from his point of view, he is paid $500 a month to permit 78 of them on his land, with 76 more on the way.
 ''That's just money you're hearing,'' he said as they hummed in a brisk breeze recently.
 Texas, once the oil capital of North America, is rapidly turning into the capital of wind power. After breakneck growth the last three years, Texas has reached the point that more than 3 percent of its electricity, enough to supply power to one million homes, comes from wind turbines. 
 Texans are even turning tapped-out oil fields into wind farms, and no less an oilman than Boone Pickens is getting into alternative energy.
 ''I have the same feelings about wind,'' Mr. Pickens said in an interview, ''as I had about the best oil field I ever found.'' He is planning to build the biggest wind farm in the world, a $10 billion behemoth that could power a small city by itself.
 Wind turbines were once a marginal form of electrical generation. But amid rising concern about greenhouse gases from coal-burning power plants, wind power is booming. Installed wind capacity in the United States grew 45 percent last year, albeit from a small base, and a comparable increase is expected this year.
 At growth rates like that, experts said, wind power could eventually make an important contribution to the nation's electrical supply. It already supplies about 1 percent of American electricity, powering the equivalent of 4.5 million homes. Environmental advocates contend it could eventually hit 20 percent, as has already happened in Denmark. Energy consultants say that 5 to 7 percent is a more realistic goal in this country.
 The United States recently overtook Spain as the world's second-largest wind power market, after Germany, with $9 billion invested last year. A recent study by Emerging Energy Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., projected $65 billion in investment from 2007 to 2015.
 Despite the attraction of wind as a nearly pollution-free power source, it does have limitations. Though the gap is closing, electricity from wind remains costlier than that generated from fossil fuels. Moreover, wind power is intermittent and unpredictable, and the hottest days, when electricity is needed most, are usually not windy.
 The turbines are getting bigger and their blades can kill birds and bats. Aesthetic and wildlife issues have led to opposition emerging around the country, particularly in coastal areas like Cape Cod. Some opposition in Texas has cropped up as well, including lawsuits to halt wind farms that were thought to be eyesores or harmful to wetlands.
 But the opposition has been limited, and has done little to slow the rapid growth of wind power in Texas. Some Texans see the sleek new turbines as a welcome change in the landscape.
 ''Texas has been looking at oil and gas rigs for 100 years, and frankly, wind turbines look a little nicer,'' said Jerry Patterson, the Texas land commissioner, whose responsibilities include leasing state lands for wind energy development. ''We're No. 1 in wind in the United States, and that will never change.''
 Texas surpassed California as the top wind farm state in 2006. In January alone, new wind farms representing $700 million of investment went into operation in Texas, supplying power sufficient for 100,000 homes.
 Supporters say Texas is ideal for wind-power development, not just because it is windy. It also has sparsely populated land for wind farms, fast-growing cities and a friendly regulatory environment for developers. 
 ''Texas could be a model for the entire nation,'' said Patrick Woodson, a senior development executive with E.On, a German utility operating here.
 The quaint windmills of old have been replaced by turbines that stand as high as 20-story buildings, with blades longer than a football field and each capable of generating electricity for small communities. powerful turbines are able to capture power even when the wind is relatively weak, and they help to lower the cost per kilowatt hour.
 Much of the boom in the United States is being driven by foreign power companies with experience developing wind projects, including Iberdrola of Spain, Energias de Portugal and Windkraft Nord of Germany. Foreign companies own two-thirds of the wind projects under construction in Texas.
 A short-term threat to the growth of wind power is the looming expiration of federal clean-energy tax credits, which Congress has allowed to lapse several times over the years. Advocates have called for extending those credits and eventually enacting a national renewable-power standard that would oblige states to expand their use of clean power sources.
 A longer-term problem is potential bottlenecks in getting wind power from the places best equipped to produce it to the populous areas that need electricity. The part of the United States with the highest wind potential is a corridor stretching north from Texas through the middle of the country, including sparsely populated states like Montana and the Dakotas. Power is needed most in the dense cities of the coasts, but building new transmission lines over such long distances is certain to be expensive and controversial.
 ''We need a national vision for transmission like we have with the national highway system,'' said Robert Gramlich, policy director for the American Wind Energy Association. ''We have to get over the hump of having a patchwork of electric utility fiefdoms.''
 Texas is better equipped to deal with the transmission problems that snarl wind energy in other states because a single agency operates the electrical grid and manages the deregulated utility market in most of the state.
 Last July, the Texas Public Utility Commission approved transmission lines across the state capable of delivering as much as 25,000 megawatts of wind energy by 2012, presuming the boom continues. That would be five times the wind power generated in the state today, and it would drive future national growth.
 Shell and the TXU Corporation are planning to build a 3,000-megawatt wind farm north of here in the Texas Panhandle, leapfrogging two FPL Energy Texas wind farms to become the biggest in the world.
 Not to be outdone, Mr. Pickens is planning his own 150,000-acre Panhandle wind farm of 4,000 megawatts that would be even larger and cost him $10 billion. 
 ''I like wind because it's renewable and it's clean and you know you are not going to be dealing with a production decline curve,'' Mr. Pickens said. ''Decline curves finally wore me out in the oil business.''
 At the end of 2007, Texas ranked No. 1 in the nation with installed wind power of 4,356 megawatts (and 1,238 under construction), far outdistancing California's 2,439 megawatts (and 165 under construction). Minnesota and Iowa came in third and fourth with almost 1,300 megawatts each (and 46 and 116 under construction, respectively).
 Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado and Oregon, states with smaller populations than Texas, all get 5 to 8 percent of their power from wind farms, according to estimates by the American Wind Energy Association.
 It has dawned on many Texans in recent years that wind power, whatever its other pros and cons, represents a potent new strategy for rural economic development.
 Since the wind boom began a few years ago, the total value of property here in Nolan County has doubled, and the county judge, Tim Fambrough, estimated it would increase an additional 25 percent this year. County property taxes are going down, home values are going up and the county has extra funds to remodel the courthouse and improve road maintenance.
 ''Wind reminds us of the old oil and gas booms,'' Mr. Fambrough said. 
 Teenagers who used to flee small towns like Sweetwater after high school are sticking around to take technical courses in local junior colleges and then work on wind farms. Marginal ranches and cotton farms are worth more with wind turbines on them.
 ''I mean, even the worst days for wind don't compare to the busts in the oil business,'' said Bobby Clark, a General Electric wind technician who gave up hauling chemicals in the oil fields southwest of here to live and work in Sweetwater. ''I saw my daddy go from rags to riches and back in the oil business, and I sleep better.''
 Wind companies are remodeling abandoned buildings, and new stores, hotels and restaurants have opened around this old railroad town. 
 Dandy's Western Wear, the local cowboy attire shop, cannot keep enough python skin and cowhide boots in stock because of all the Danes and Germans who have come to town to invest and work in the wind fields, then take home Texas souvenirs.
 ''Wind has invigorated our business like you wouldn't believe,'' said Marty Foust, Dandy's owner, who recently put in new carpeting and air-conditioning. ''When you watch the news you can get depressed about the economy, but we don't get depressed. We're now in our own bubble.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 29, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Saturday about the growing use of wind power in Texas referred imprecisely to the amount of money that Louis Brooks is paid for allowing 78 wind turbines on his ranch on the outskirts of Sweetwater, Tex. It is $500 a month for each, not $500 for all of them. The article also misstated the length of blades for new wind turbines that stand as high as 20-story buildings. The blades span about 200 feet; they are not ''longer than a football field,'' which is 300 feet.

HEADLINE: On Clothing Racks, Inflation Is the Hot Trend

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE great clothing price deflation -- brought on in part by China's entry into the world economy -- may be over.
 The January report on consumer prices in the United States, released this week, showed that the prices of apparel are now higher than they were two years ago. That is something that has rarely happened since 1998, a period of nearly a decade in which clothing prices tended lower even as other things were rising. 
 The apparel increases, which have been strongest in women's clothing, contributed to a rising overall inflation rate that set off talk of stagflation this week. 
 In 1998, the last time that such prices were regularly rising, China accounted for 7.8 percent of United States imports of clothing, other than shoes and knitted items. The latest government figures show that China's market share was 16.3 percent in the first nine months of 2007. During that period, the overall volume of imports doubled and China doubled its market share.
 The acceleration in apparel prices has been particularly apparent in recent months. Since October, such prices have been rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, with women's clothing rising even faster -- 7.3 percent. 
 The increases have come as Chinese wages rose and the value of the dollar fell, against not only the Chinese currency but against many other currencies as well. A falling dollar will raise the prices of imported goods unless their local currency price is reduced.
 Even with these increases, the inflation rate for apparel -- a category that includes shoes as well as clothes -- is running well below the overall inflation rate. But those added costs may have helped to depress retail sales during the holiday season, as consumers faced higher clothing price tags at the same time they were having to pay more for food and gasoline.
 The growth of China as an exporter was not the only reason clothing prices sagged for much of the last decade, but its aggressive expansion of its exports, coupled with similar efforts of some other Asian countries, was a major contributor. 
 At the end of 2007, the overall Consumer Price Index was up 31 percent over the previous 10 years. Over that same period, the apparel index was down 10 percent. 
 The apparel area with the least deflation over that period -- and with an increase over the last five years -- was shoes. (It is, however, an area where prices are now slipping a little.) It may be significant that this is an area in which China established domination years ago. By 1993, it accounted for 53 percent of American shoe imports, a figure that was up to 73 percent in the most recent data. With such a large market share, China may have faced less competition from other countries that could help to hold down prices. 
 Lower prices of imported goods were a major reason the inflation rate was held down in recent years. If imported good prices are now destined to rise more in line with the cost of services, that could provide a lift to the overall rate of inflation, at a time when the economy is weakening.

HEADLINE: The Double Standard in Crisis Resolution

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
As the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by almost a third last month while the White House and Congress scrambled to concoct a $150 billion-plus fiscal stimulus package to loosen up the credit crunch, economic policy makers in developing countries couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. 
 Could this be the same United States that backed the International Monetary Fund's get-tough strategy during the emerging-market crises in the 1990s -- pushing countries from Asia to Latin America to slash government spending and raise interest rates to recover investors' confidence and regain access to lending from abroad? 
 ''This creates a lot of resentment on the other end of the world,'' said Joseph Stiglitz, who was chief economist of the World Bank at the time. 
 Much like the current subprime mortgage disaster in the United States, the 1990s financial crises were brought about by a bubble of reckless lending that was pierced suddenly. Until then, the afflicted nations seemed to be in great shape, with high growth and low inflation. Investors raved about the ''Asian growth miracle'' as they poured in money. 
 There was a dark side to the miracle. All that cash encouraged careless lending and fueled large trade deficits. In 1997, investors ran for the exit in Thailand, unleashing a chain reaction across Asia, Russia and South America. 
 When countries went to the I.M.F. for help, the fund imposed a tough regimen that many economists now consider to have been unnecessarily harsh. 
 The fund maintained that high interest rates were necessary to regain investors' confidence, stanch the flight of capital and halt the decline in currencies. The fund also insisted that these governments reduce spending and investment to cut their external deficits and their need for foreign financing. The economies of Southeast Asia contracted by 7 percent in 1998. Millions of jobs were lost.
 Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who helped managed the crisis in the late 1990s, rejects talk of a double standard. He argues that the United States is facing a very different situation. While Asian countries suffered from a foreign loss of confidence in their currencies, he noted that the current crisis here stems from the collapse of the housing market -- the puncturing of a domestic bubble that can be addressed by boosting domestic demand. An overriding imperative in the United States, he says, should be to avert a drastic economic slowdown. 
 Others would argue that the United States -- with a large budget and trade deficit -- could do with a bit more austerity. Some economists fear that the steep interest-rate cuts could fuel inflation. Others question whether slashing interest rates to stimulate lending can help mitigate a credit crunch that is the aftermath of a binge of reckless lending.
 ''I would say there was even a more compelling case for some Asian countries to have kept low interest rates than for what we are doing,'' argued Mr. Stiglitz.
 Asian countries might have been able to lower interest rates and recover if immediately repaying foreign creditors in full hadn't been such an imperative. Some afflicted countries could have afforded more public spending to mitigate the impact of the financial crises because they had healthier budget balances than the United States has today.
 The economic differences between the Asian crises and the subprime mess are real. Still, Mr. Stiglitz argues that the main reason behind the diametrically opposed approaches to crisis resolution is political rather than economic. 
 Of course, these countries didn't have a choice if they wanted help from the I.M.F. The United States, which has a much larger economy and borrows from abroad in its own currency, hasn't had to ask for outside help. The response to the American subprime mortgage crisis is being crafted within the American political system where policy makers are inevitably much more sensitive to domestic social and political consequences. That is also why economists -- and some government officials -- can contemplate even more unorthodox approaches, including subsidizing banks and mortgage holders. 
 Beyond the issue of fairness, there is an irony to the disparate approaches to financial troubles in the North and South. One of the consequences of the I.M.F.'s harsh medicine was that governments in developing countries vowed never again to rely on the fund and set out to hoard piles of foreign reserves in case a crisis were to strike again. Flooding back into Treasury bills, this cash has contributed to keep American interest rates at rock bottom and fueled a bubble of reckless mortgage lending. That bubble is now bursting.

HEADLINE: Washington Lends a Hand

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Elizabeth and Ben Kilgore are back in the real estate market. All it took was a little-publicized section of the economic stimulus package President Bush signed into law last week that lowered the borrowing cost of buying a more expensive home.
 The Kilgores, who live in Tiburon, Calif., just north of San Francisco, are looking for a larger home in town for their growing family. Three years ago, when they bought their first home, they resigned themselves to buying a condominium because it meant taking out a mortgage they knew they could manage. 
 ''This will push us into a price range that's now financially possible,'' said Ms. Kilgore, a real estate agent in Marin County.
 And if the limit on loans backed by a government-backed housing finance entity like Fannie Mae is raised from $417,000 to the full $729,750 she has been hearing about, Ms. Kilgore said, ''we will be able to get a 30-year fixed mortgage for less than what we're paying now plus our homeowner's dues.'' 
 The temporary change in the loan limits is not about to revive the housing market on its own. But in some of the higher-priced regions of the country that have been hit hardest by the flagging real estate market, it could make a big difference. For if anything is going to breathe new life into the local housing economy in places like the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Washington and Boston, it is home buyers emboldened by the prospect of larger loans at lower interest rates.
 Daniel Billett, a mortgage broker in Seattle, where homes in the downtown area sell for a median price of around $400,000, said that he, like dozens of people he knows, is poised to refinance an existing jumbo loan at a lower interest rate.
 ''As soon as the loan limits are implemented and lenders are accepting applications. I'll be the first in line,'' said Mr. Billett, whose company, Response Mortgage Services, has been receiving a steady stream of inquiries from clients in recent weeks. ''I'm going to save hundreds, and I mean hundreds, of dollars every month on my current jumbo loan, by switching to a conventional loan.''
 For years, rates on jumbo loans, those for more than $417,000, were only slightly higher than rates on conforming loans at or below that limit. But now, with the interest rate on conforming loans at around 6 percent, sometimes less, jumbo loans are at least a percentage point higher. 
 ''The difference is as big as it's ever been,'' said Bart Welles, a mortgage broker in Larkspur, Calif.
 For a high-priced home, 1 percent can make a big difference. A monthly payment on a jumbo 30-year loan of $729,000 at 7 percent would be $4,850. Monthly payments on a conforming loan of the same amount, at 6 percent, would be $4,371, a $479 difference.
 As the credit squeeze deepens, lenders have been reluctant to underwrite jumbo mortgages. That leaves houses languishing on the market, further depressing an already distressed housing market. 
 The change in loan limits, which allows the federal housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase or guarantee the mortgages, is intended to encourage lenders to write more mortgages because they can easily sell them to the agencies.
 It should also stimulate house buying and mortgage refinancing. As the thinking goes, once people start borrowing money, they will set back into motion the economic machine of brokers, agents and lenders that has been stalled for the past year and has helped stall the overall economy. 
 ''Of all the various strategies proposed to help the housing market,'' said Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody'sEconomy.com, ''I think this one has the greatest potential, particularly for expensive housing markets.''
 The change in loan limits will go into effect sometime in early March and will last at least through the end of the year. In areas where median prices do not exceed $271,050, such as the entire state of Alabama, the basic loan limit will be $271,050.
 In areas where the median sales price is higher, the limits will rise to 125 percent of the median price, not to exceed $729,750. (The rules defining which locations qualify and where the borders of the areas will be drawn to determine the appropriate median price are to be written by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.) 
 High-priced housing markets -- particularly much of coastal California, with some of the most expensive real estate in the nation -- would benefit the most. In a state like California, or in the Northeast and Northwest, where home prices far exceed the national median of about $206,000, jumbo loans are a significant portion of the mortgage market.
 In San Francisco, where the median home price is $777,000, 35 percent of all loans were nonconforming, according to First American CoreLogic, a data and analytics company in Santa Ana, Calif. 
 The anticipated stimulative impact is all the more important because prices are falling sharply. Prices have dropped 20.4 percent over the past year in Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco, and 13.1 percent in neighboring Alameda County, according to DataQuick Information Systems. 
 Indeed, California is probably the state hardest hit by the housing slump. As inventories rose in most cities, the median price dropped 16.9 percent from May to December, according to DataQuick. (Prices are still high; the California Budget Project, a public policy advocacy group, estimated that a family would need an annual income of $196,878 to afford the median-priced home in San Francisco.)
 Across the state, homeowners stuck with high interest rates and potential homeowners who are still searching are watching the situation closely.
 The window in the new law is short. But Mr. Faucher, the economist, said that if problems in the market continued, particularly in expensive markets, he would not be surprised to see the higher loan limits extended. ''There's nothing set in stone,'' he said. 
 At first, the strongest interest is expected to come from people refinancing existing loans. In Berkeley, Calif., where the median home is worth about $776,000, MPR Financial, a mortgage brokerage firm, has received dozens of calls from clients asking about the possibility of refinancing their existing loans.
 ''Quite a few people who got their loans when the rates were higher have called in,'' said Paul Riccardi, the firm's president. ''We tell them we have their application, and we'll have it ready to go.''
 In other places where housing prices are high, there is a similar anticipatory buzz about a change in the conforming loan cap. 
 In San Diego, real estate activity has dropped off noticeably in the past year. According to DataQuick, the number of homes sold in San Diego in January dropped 34 percent from a year ago. A change in the conforming loan limit could give a much-needed boost to the market, said Jim Abbott, a real estate agent there. 
 ''The availability of jumbo loans was so easy,'' Mr. Abbott said. ''Now they're not, and it's really exacerbated the problem. But I don't think anyone is counting on it until it actually happens.''
 Jim Byrnes, a real estate agent in Palo Alto, Calif., where Zillow.com pegs the median home value at $1.4 million, said he had two clients who were first-time home buyers and were waiting for the new law to take effect. 
 ''They're literally waiting on the sidelines to see what happens,'' he said. ''If they can get a better interest rate it will make their path so much easier.''
 Of course, prices for some houses in certain California enclaves and other luxury locations remain so stratospherically high that a change in the conforming loan limit, no matter how drastic, would have little effect.
 ''It won't make so much difference here,'' said Edna Sizlo, a real estate agent in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the adjacent suburb of Montecito has homes valued at a median $4.1 million, making them among the most expensive in the nation. ''There's nothing you can even live in for under $1 million.''

HEADLINE: An American Portrait

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
IN a gift to marketers -- and trivia buffs -- everywhere, The American magazine has put together a fascinating look at ''the diurnal and nocturnal habits'' of the average resident of the United States.
 Here are snapshots from the report compiled by Karlyn Bowman, using results from a survey conducted by the Gallup Organization in August. 
 When asked what they wear to work most days, about 6 percent said ''formal business clothes''; 52 percent said ''casual business''; 25 percent said ''casual street clothes, such as jeans''; and 15 percent said they wore a uniform. About 67 percent of men said they never wore a tie at work. And 20 percent said they did so ''occasionally.''
 The ''hours worked in a typical week (mean): 43.6.''
 When asked how much time their colleagues waste during the day, the mean number reported was 90 minutes. When asked how much time they waste, respondents said one hour.
 About 8 percent said their commute took two hours or more, while 28 percent said it took them 30 minutes or less. The most common response, at 36 percent, was 30 to 59 minutes. 
 About 85 percent of respondents said they usually drove to work. Only 4 percent said they took mass transit, while just 3 percent said they walked.
 On the question of what was their personal best time of day, 55 percent said mornings, 15 percent said afternoons, 20 percent said evenings, and 6 percent said late nights. Presumably the other 4 percent are cranky all the time.
 FUN WITH OSCAR Here, courtesy of Clayton Neuman in Fast Company, are a few tidbits to ponder, should the broadcast of ''Hollywood's greatest night'' lag on Sunday: 
 ABC paid an estimated $50 million to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the right to broadcast this year's Oscars.
 There is a 200 percent increase in weekly box-office revenue for a film that receives a nomination for either best picture or best actor. A best actress nomination, however, increases revenues by only 150 percent.
 The estimated cost to produce the 40 statuettes for this year is $16,000.
 PENNY UNWISE Quick! Which costs more? A house that is listed at $450,000 or one on the market for $451,435?
 According to a paper done for the Cornell University business school, and cited by The Atlantic, many people will say the precise price ($451,435) is less expensive, even though it is not. 
 The explanation, according to the magazine, is that ''because we tend to use precise numbers for small amounts and round numbers (lots of zeros) for large ones, sellers can make buyers perceive a price is smaller than it is by replacing zeros with other digits.''
 The authors examined 27,000 real estate transactions in New York and Florida and found the Florida homes with listing prices that ended in three zeros sold for 0.73 percent less than comparable properties. (The effect ''was slightly less pronounced'' in New York.)
 It doesn't sound like much, but it amounts to more than $3,000 on a $450,000 sale.
 CALLING ALL GUYS ''Do you consider yourself very happy? Very successful? Are you sure? If so, count yourself among rare company,'' Best Life writes.
 Of the 1,026 men ages 30 to 54 surveyed by the magazine, in conjunction with American Express, just 10 percent said they were both ''very happy and very successful.''
 So, does that mean that the other 90 percent are unhappy failures?
 ''Not quite,'' the magazine concludes. ''It simply means the majority of us are still striving for gains in career, relationships and family (81 percent in the poll cop to doing just that).'' 
 FINAL TAKE We end with a depressing number. Citing research by the National Endowment for the Arts, Reader's Digest writes, ''38 percent of employers consider high school graduates deficient as readers.'' PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: 2 Plans and Many Questions on the Uninsured

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Brandy Coons is what health economists call a free rider.
 She may not fully appreciate it, but her decision to go without health insurance, like millions of similarly situated Americans, has become central to the pre-eminent policy dispute of the Democratic presidential campaign.
 Ms. Coons, a 23-year-old waitress who rents a room and rarely eats out, said she could probably afford a high-deductible policy if she gave up her gym membership and spent less on her amateur photography. But she chooses instead to gamble against the odds of confronting a bankrupting catastrophe. 
 ''I'm young and in pretty good shape,'' Ms. Coons said one recent afternoon, on her way to the treadmill at the Fitness Factory in Midtown Atlanta. ''I looked at Blue Cross Blue Shield. But the only thing I could see myself really needing it for are prescriptions and dental because there are so many free clinics, or a hospital visit really isn't all that expensive.''
 She continued, ''The insurance premium was more than what I would pay for my prescriptions, so I just decided not to deal with it.'' 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton contends that the only way to achieve universal health coverage, and to make the marketplace fair and efficient, is to require that everyone have insurance. That would include people like Ms. Coons, who may not currently rank health care above other needs and wants.
 Senator Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, shares her goal of insuring all Americans. But he says that a mandate could mean financial devastation for middle-class families if the government did not first adequately reduce the cost of insurance.
 Both candidates express confidence that by pumping at least $110 billion into subsidies and tax credits they can make policies affordable for all. The difference is that Mr. Obama insists he will be able to lure all of the uninsured simply by dangling the carrot of low premiums; Mrs. Clinton believes there will always be some free riders who respond only to a government stick.
 Neither campaign has provided enough detail about its plan to enable more than guesswork about how it might influence consumers like Ms. Coons. They have not detailed what kind of subsidies would be needed or who would be entitled to them. Mrs. Clinton has not fully explained how she would make everyone comply with her plan or exactly how she would cap the amount a family would have to spend on premiums. 
 Each candidate would raise the money needed to subsidize premiums by rolling back President Bush's tax cuts for high earners, taxing businesses that do not insure their workers and reducing costs through electronic record keeping, preventive medicine and chronic disease management.
 But there is little certainty about how much those initiatives might save, or when. Nor can it be known if the savings would offset the potential cost of new technology and drugs and the cost of providing care to the newly insured. There are also questions about whether the new savings and tax increases would be enough to subsidize insurance for all who need help.
 Both candidates are backed by teams of prominent economists from top universities and policy groups. But with little real-world precedent to guide them, their assessments are necessarily an amalgam of statistical modeling and back-of-the-envelope calculation.
 ''In a campaign, people put out proposals that aren't highly specified, that don't have enough detail to model them effectively,'' said E. Richard Brown, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an Obama adviser. ''These numbers are based on a lot of assumptions.''
 In speeches, debates and dueling advertisements, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have brandished projections that even their originators acknowledge are tenuous. 
 Mrs. Clinton, for instance, has charged repeatedly that Mr. Obama's plan would leave 15 million people uninsured. Doing so, she has said, amounts to Democratic apostasy. ''I don't want to leave anybody out,'' she said in Thursday's debate in Austin, Tex.
 But the economist who devised that number, Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that while he felt strongly that a mandate was needed to achieve universal coverage, he was less firm about his projection. ''There is a lot of margin for error around that estimate,'' Mr. Gruber said.
 Mr. Obama, meanwhile, maintains in a television advertisement that his plan will ''cover everyone.'' That claim is disputed by some of his own advisers, including Mr. Brown, who recently calculated that the Obama plan might leave behind two million free riders.
 ''That's the number we would expect to continue to be uninsured unless they're forced to buy coverage,'' Mr. Brown said.
 There is no consensus among health economists about how many free riders there are, or on their economic impact. But of the 47 million uninsured people in the United States, 7.3 million come from families with incomes of $75,000 or more, and an additional 6.9 million earn between $50,000 and $75,000, according to 2006 census estimates. 
 Some of those with moderate or high incomes may have been shut out of the insurance market because of age or pre-existing health conditions. Researchers believe a majority are self-employed or among the growing number of Americans whose employers do not offer affordable insurance. Their only insurance options may be high-priced individual policies.
 Many free riders are assumed to be young and at little risk of major illness, but they do consume health care. A recent analysis by the New America Foundation, a Washington policy group, found that 16 percent of the patients who received uncompensated medical care in 2004 had family incomes of at least four times the federal poverty level (which would currently be $41,600 for an individual and $84,800 for a family of four).
 They accounted for $5.8 billion of the estimated $41.4 billion in uncompensated care that year. Most of it was delivered in hospitals, which are required by federal law to treat patients with emergency conditions, regardless of ability to pay. A vast majority of that care is covered by the federal, state and local governments in a direct cost shift to taxpayers.
 But there is also a shift to the privately insured. Hospitals and doctors raise their fees to compensate for the losses they incur by treating uninsured and underinsured patients, and insurers pass those increases along to consumers. A 2005 study found that the shift added 8.5 percent to the average premium. 
 Many free riders, including Ms. Coons in Atlanta, never consider that the care they receive in community clinics and emergency rooms is subsidized by taxpayers and private policyholders. ''I still pay for everything,'' Ms. Coons said, ''and I certainly pay taxes.''
 Mrs. Clinton says that requiring everyone to get insurance, in addition to addressing the taxpayers' cost-shift, is a prerequisite to ending discrimination against those with pre-existing medical problems. Only then, she argues, would it be fair for the government to require insurers to cover even those likely to require expensive care. 
 ''By allowing people to stay out, you risk that only the sick will come in,'' said Len M. Nichols, director of health policy for the New America Foundation, and a reluctant supporter of a mandate. ''Insurers have to protect themselves. Bringing everyone in also lowers costs across the board because the risk pool is wider.''
 Mr. Obama, for his part, all but denies the existence of free riders. ''I don't see those folks,'' he said when asked last month about people who may need to be forced to buy insurance.
 He said he would mandate coverage for children and allow parents to cover children up to age 25 on their policies. But recognizing that affordability is often in the eye of the beholder, he would not immediately require coverage of adults. He says he would be open to a mandate later if there were holdouts, convincing some economists that the dispute is more about the timing of a mandate than the need for one. 
 ''I believe the reason people don't have health care isn't because no one's forced them to buy it,'' Mr. Obama said this month in Wisconsin. ''It's because no one's made it affordable.''
 There is no settled view about what makes health insurance affordable. A survey last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the average annual premium was $4,479 for an individual and $12,106 for a family.
 Massachusetts, the only state that mandates insurance coverage, considers insurance to be affordable for anyone with a family income that is more than three times the federal poverty level, above $31,200 for an individual and $63,600 for a family of four. Coverage for those making less is subsidized in full or in part by the state.
 Unlike Mrs. Clinton's plan, however, Massachusetts offers exemptions from the mandate to those who can demonstrate they would otherwise suffer financial hardship. It expects to offer 60,000 such waivers this year.
 Some share of the population will disregard virtually any government mandate, either by intent or inertia, and the early evidence about the Massachusetts law is mixed. Only half of the state's estimated 600,000 uninsured enrolled by the end of 2007, the first deadline. That may be because the state set a gentle initial tax penalty of $219 to soften any perception of heavy-handedness. This year, the fine will rise to as much as $912 for some residents.
 ''The Massachusetts experience shows that unless you have very clear, very stringent penalties that are directly enforceable, mandates don't work,'' said Austan D. Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist who advises Mr. Obama. 
 Mrs. Clinton acknowledged Thursday that a mandate would be politically unpopular, noting in the debate that she ''took a big risk'' to propose one.
 ''You chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people,'' she told Mr. Obama. ''That's a big difference.''
 Mr. Obama responded that his goal was the same as hers, to cover everyone. ''We think,'' he said, ''that there's going to be a different way of getting there.''

HEADLINE: Castro, Nearly Retired, Keeps Busy With a Few Pokes at U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: HAVANA 

 BODY:
If anyone thought Fidel Castro was going to slip into quiet retirement, he dispelled that notion on Friday when he published a broadside against American politicians who have called for democracy in Cuba. 
 The letter published in official newspapers here was the first word from Mr. Castro, 81 and ailing, since he announced early Tuesday morning that he would step down as president of the country he ran with absolute control for nearly 49 years. He said he would neither seek nor accept another term.
 The country is waiting for Sunday, when the National Assembly, a rubber-stamp group in the opinion of most experts, will choose a new president at the direction of Communist Party leaders. Most people expect Mr. Castro's brother Raul, the defense minister, to step into his shoes. Five years younger, Raul has been acting president since Fidel Castro fell ill in July 2006. 
 In his letter, Mr. Castro poked fun at American presidential candidates for their calls for a change to multiparty democracy in Cuba, saying they were pandering for votes. He scoffed at calls for elections, asserting that what Americans really wanted was to annex the island.
 '' 'Change, change, change!' they shouted in unison,'' he wrote. ''I agree. 'Change!' But in the United States.
 ''Cuba changed a while ago, and will continue on its dialectical course,'' he continued. ''We will never return to the past, say our people. 'Annexation, annexation, annexation!' the adversary responds. That's what he thinks, deep inside, when he talks about change.''
 Mr. Castro said that making the decision to hand over power, at least officially, had exhausted him, but that afterward he was calm. ''The night before, I slept better than ever,'' he wrote. ''My conscience was clear, and I promised myself a vacation.''
 The column appeared on Page 4 of the newspapers Granma and Juventud Rebelde, a break from past practice in which Mr. Castro's musings were always front-page news.
 In the streets, Cubans greeted the column with smiles, laughter and no small amount of skepticism.
 ''He says Cuba has already changed, that it changed when he took power in 1959,'' said Rafael, an unemployed sea pilot who asked that his last name not be used. ''What a joke.''

HEADLINE: Plan to Rebuild Penn Station Area May Be Close to Failure

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The sweeping $14 billion proposal to transform Pennsylvania Station and the district around it is in danger of collapse because of the softening economy, shortfalls in government financing, political inertia and daunting logistical problems, government officials and real estate executives involved in the project said this week.
 The proposed project, known as Moynihan Station, calls for building half a dozen skyscrapers, relocating Madison Square Garden one block away and constructing a monumental new train station on 34th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Civic groups, developers and government officials have embraced the plan as an act of civic redemption for the demolition of the original Penn Station in the 1960s, saying it will also create a first-class business district around the nation's busiest rail hub.
 But the project has grown in size and complexity, and the estimated cost of the new station has tripled, to $3 billion. There is squabbling between developers, the Garden, government officials, community groups and preservationists over the designs and how much the public would benefit. And now negotiations have stalled, despite three years of planning and lobbying in Albany and Washington, the officials and executives said. Those people spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid inflaming state officials. 
 Proponents of the plan, who view the $14 billion project as a rare opportunity to refurbish Penn Station and revitalize the district, say they still hope that Gov. Eliot Spitzer will be able to drag it back from the edge of failure. In an interview Friday, Mr. Spitzer said he was committed to the Moynihan project, which he contends is critical to the future of the city.
 Officials say the governor plans to meet next week with the developers behind the project -- Stephen M. Ross of Related Companies and Steven Roth of Vornado Realty Trust -- and the owners of Madison Square Garden in an effort to resolve major financing issues.
 But the developers, who have spent more than $50 million on the planning effort, and the Garden have grown weary of the slow pace of progress, the executives said.
 The project's linchpin, moving Madison Square Garden one block west to the Farley Post Office, may fall out of place. Frustrated by the delays and rising costs, Madison Square Garden has revived plans to renovate the 30-year-old arena instead of relocating. Garden officials have told real estate executives and civic leaders that they plan to announce the renovation plans in early March.
 During discussions in December, Garden executives, developers and government officials agreed that if they did not make progress over the next two months, they would part ways, according to two people who have been briefed on the talks. Garden officials did not attend a scheduled planning meeting on Thursday.
 The plan to build a grand train station and erect the skyscrapers was always dependent on the demolition of the current Garden, the brown doughnut-like structure that sits over the crowded corridors of Penn Station, where the station would be built. More than 550,000 passengers pass through the station every day.
 Some government officials involved in reviewing the project contend that the Garden's threat to renovate could be a bargaining posture intended to gain concessions on the design of the new arena in the Farley Post Office. Those officials say that the state and the city have leverage over the Garden, which would need a variety of state and city approvals to renovate the arena.
 In any event, the governor said Friday that he was highly confident that his deal was going ahead.
 ''It's a critical investment for Midtown,'' Mr. Spitzer said in a telephone interview. ''This, in conjunction with Hudson Yards, where we have taken a vacant piece of land and now have five competing bids to add 12 million square feet of commercial and residential space, will redefine Midtown Manhattan.''
 The governor was referring to the pending sale of the development rights over the West Side railyards, which sit three blocks west of Penn Station, from 30th to 33rd Street, between 10th and 12th Avenues. The second round of bids for the development rights are due Tuesday.
 Some government officials and real estate executives are concerned that a slowing economy and the current state of the credit markets, where there is little money available for large real estate deals, could cause problems for both the sale of the railyards and the Moynihan project.
 The Spitzer administration can ill afford a setback for either project, urban planners say, after its announcement in January that it had significantly cut back its plans to expand the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
 ''We're convinced that this is the key catalyst to West Side development,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a supporter of the Moynihan project. ''It's got lots of moving parts, and they're not meshing well. But there's so much money to be made by everyone and there's so much in the public interest. It's essential that we get it done and we get it right.''
 One of the key issues for the Moynihan project is the cost of building a new train station, whose estimated price has grown to $3 billion from $1 billion. (The station would be named after the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who first suggested turning the Farley Post Office into a new Penn Station.) The negotiations involve state and city officials and officials from the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit, Amtrak, two subway lines and the Port Authority.
 Patrick J. Foye, co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said that the city and the state have each pledged to invest $300 million in the station, and that the developers have agreed to put up $550 million. The developers, in turn, would get valuable development rights to build skyscrapers in the surrounding area. 
 That would be especially tantalizing for Mr. Roth, whose company already owns a major portion of the neighborhood, including the Hotel Pennsylvania and No. 1 and No. 2 Penn Plaza.
 ''Significant progress on the Moynihan project has been realized, but there are significant challenges yet to be resolved,'' Mr. Foye said Friday.
 But even if the developers can whittle the cost of the station by several hundred million dollars, there is a serious shortfall. Both government officials and the developers are hoping that they can obtain what is essentially a matching grant of $800 million from the federal government, a figure that Congressional officials say may be unrealistically high.
 There are also a raft of design issues, ranging from what the new Penn Station would look like to how a new arena for the Garden would fit into the Farley Post Office. The developers have proposed inserting 1.2 million square feet of shops and department stores into the station, which critics say would turn the building into a shopping mall rather than a monumental train station like Grand Central Terminal.
 The Garden, which signed a nonbinding agreement with the developers in February 2006, would essentially trade its current site between Seventh and Eighth Avenues to the developers for a new $1 billion arena within the walls of the state-owned post office, a landmark building between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 1, 2008

An article last Saturday about the outlook for the Moynihan Station project, a $14 billion proposal to rebuild Pennsylvania Station, construct skyscrapers and relocate Madison Square Garden, misstated the age of the Garden. It is 40 years old, not 30.

HEADLINE: Connecting the Dots on Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''A Rip-Off by Health Insurers?'' (editorial, Feb. 18) alleges that health plans are undercompensating physicians who provide services out of network. Yet you never considered whether it is appropriate for physicians to charge out-of-network patients double or triple what in-network patients are charged and far more than Medicare pays them for the same services. 
 The news pages, meanwhile, are replete with stories about the impact of rising health care costs on the economy, employers and working families. 
 It's time to connect the dots. At a time when soaring health care spending is among the most critical challenges facing our nation, the data show that health insurance plans' new generation of cost-containment tools are beginning to make coverage more affordable and accessible. 
 In fact, health insurance premiums in 2006 grew at the slowest rate in more than a decade. You should evaluate objectively the value of health plan tools as well as the appropriateness of provider charges.

HEADLINE: An Arsenal Against Drugs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The War on Drugs Starts Here'' (editorial, Feb. 13) is timely, insightful and necessary. 
 The editorial points out that while significant money has been devoted to assisting major source countries producing heroin and cocaine, Mexico and Colombia, the funds for prevention efforts at home have been decreased. This situation makes no sense. 
 While heroin and cocaine are indeed produced abroad, we must recognize that reducing demand and increasing awareness and treatment are critical elements to curbing the problem of drug abuse. The best interdiction system in the world will stop only a fraction of the drug flow into America. 
 The best intelligence and drug law enforcement investigations will not put behind bars all the drug dealers on our streets. We definitely need these efforts, and this is no time to cut back on critical funds for drug law enforcement. 
 We need, in fact, to continue to upgrade our intelligence and investigative capabilities, but we also need to promote greater awareness of the hazards of drug use, to provide for assistance for those recovering from addiction, and to help parents and schools, communities and families to deal with the reality of this public health, as well as public safety, menace.
 This is an election year, and we have heard plenty of rhetoric from candidates from both parties, but I have yet to hear a campaign speech or a debate question focused on drug abuse in America. Our future leaders need to recognize that drug and alcohol abuse is still one of our country's biggest problems, sapping the strength of our youth and draining our families and economy of billions of dollars, in addition to the pain and suffering and loss of life caused by addiction. 
 Let's hope that future debates, campaign speeches and legislative action will address the importance of drug abuse and the need to use all of our arsenal in this war, including law enforcement, interdiction, prevention and treatment.
 Peter B. Bensinger Chicago, Feb. 20, 2008

HEADLINE: Confronting A Wave of Foreclosures

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
WITH more than 20,000 subprime mortgages in Connecticut scheduled to reset to higher interest rates over the next two years, the wave of foreclosures currently flooding court dockets throughout the state represents the early stages of what could be a protracted deluge. While foreclosures are up all over the state, the region hit hardest so far is New Haven County. 
 The higher default rate there, compared with other counties, is linked to heavy concentrations of subprime and adjustable-rate loans, as well as, experts say, weaknesses in the local economy. 
 Much of the foreclosure activity is in New Haven, the state's third-largest city, but foreclosure filings have also soared in the surrounding communities of West Haven, Meriden and Waterbury. 
 In the city of New Haven, where some 50 properties in foreclosure have been auctioned since October, community leaders are trying to coordinate their efforts to help distressed homeowners.
 A task force appointed by Mayor John DeStefano Jr. is considering a three-pronged approach. It would increase foreclosure counseling services, explore potential litigation against lenders and establish a pool of as much as $10 million to buy foreclosed properties for use as rentals or affordable housing. 
 ''We're seeing an increase in vacant properties for the first time since 1996, and we think that's probably the beginning of the impact,'' said Robin Golden, the Selma M. Levine clinical lecturer in law at Yale Law School and a member of the task force. ''New Haven has invested so much in its neighborhoods that it would be a real shame to see it go backward.'' 
 Last year, foreclosure filings in New Haven County were up 127 percent over 2005, compared with a climb of 111 percent statewide, according to RealtyTrac, a national real estate information service.
 That translated to an estimated 2.12 percent of New Haven County households entering some stage of foreclosure in 2007. The next highest rate, 1.76 percent of households, was in Windham County, in the state's much less densely populated northeastern corner. 
 Data from the Warren Group, a New England real estate research firm, backs up those findings. Filings of lis pendens, the first step in the foreclosure process, climbed by 75 percent in New Haven County from 2005 to 2007, while increases in most other Connecticut counties were closer to 50 percent. The one exception was Windham County, where filings rose by 82 percent. 
 Foreclosure woes in New Haven County are directly linked to large numbers of subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates, said Carla Weil, executive director of the Greater New Haven Community Loan Fund and a member of the mayor's task force. As interest rates on those loans rise, borrowers who can no longer afford the payments and don't have enough equity to refinance are falling behind. 
 New Haven and Waterbury have the second- and third-highest numbers of subprime mortgages in Connecticut, according to a recent state report, and West Haven is sixth. (Bridgeport, in Fairfield County, is first, but the countywide foreclosure rate is mitigated by much lower activity in the surrounding wealthy towns.) 
 The correlation with foreclosures is all too apparent in lower-income neighborhoods of New Haven, Ms. Weil said. The neighborhoods with the highest levels of foreclosure activity -- Fair Haven, the Hill and Newhallville -- also amassed the highest numbers of adjustable-rate mortgages over the past two years. 
 In West Haven, Robert Fischer, president of Fischer Realtors, has noticed the impact on multifamily properties in particular. He predicted that the number of houses on the market in West Haven would swell with bank-owned properties in coming months. 
 The county's relative vulnerability to the housing market downturn also reflects lagging job growth, said Don Klepper-Smith, chief economist and director of research at DataCore Partners in New Haven. As of December, year-over-year job growth in the New Haven labor market area measured 0.3 percent, compared with 1 percent statewide. 
 ''It's pretty clear that the job market here hasn't performed as well,'' Mr. Klepper-Smith said, adding that the county's median household income is almost 10 percent lower than the state median. 
 The financial pain is beginning to spread outside of the subprime market, said Bridgette P. Russell, managing director of the HomeOwnership Center at Neighborhood Housing Services of New Haven.
 The people coming through her doors for foreclosure prevention counseling these days include borrowers with conventional loans and Federal Housing Administration loans, she said. 
 The mayor's task force is using Yale law students to gather more details about the scope of the mortgage crisis, and to look for potential targets of litigation.
 About 40 percent of the loans in foreclosure in New Haven since 2005 are held by just seven lenders and servicers, Ms. Weil said. 
 The students will also be examining whether outside investors are buying up foreclosed properties, a potential concern for the city. 
 ''If owner-occupied houses are lost to absentee landlords who aren't really concerned about the neighborhood,'' Ms. Weil said, ''that's going to undermine all the work that's been done so far.''

HEADLINE: New on the Job, Quick to Act

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Bill Smith and Andy MacPhail made the most traumatic moves. Neal Huntington made virtually no moves at all. Is this any way to improve the team that has been the worst in the major leagues the past 15 years?
 Huntington (Pirates), Smith (Twins) and MacPhail (Orioles) are three of the seven general managers in new jobs this winter, charged with improving their teams. MacPhail has been a general manager twice before (Twins and Cubs), and he had a head start in his new job, assuming his position last June. 
 Ed Wade (Phillies then, Astros now) and Frank Wren (Orioles then, Braves now) have also had experience. But four are first-timers: Smith, Huntington, John Mozeliak (Cardinals) and Tony Reagins (Angels).
 All seven, though, were responsible for making decisions this winter that would transform their teams into competitive, attractive outfits. Some were faced with more agonizing decisions than others. 
 Smith, for example, had two pending free agents he had to sign or lose. He lost center fielder Torii Hunter to Reagins and the Angels, and traded pitcher Johan Santana (after Santana rejected his four-year, $80 million offer) to the Mets. 
 MacPhail, faced with 10 successive losing seasons, decided to start over and traded shortstop Miguel Tejada to Houston and pitcher Erik Bedard to Seattle for a bevy of young players.
 The other new guys on the block lost or moved a handful of other name players, primarily Andruw Jones, Edgar Renteria, Scott Rolen and Brad Lidge.
 The Pirates lost no one of prominence. (One could argue they have no one of prominence.) They did not add any prominent players, either. 
 Huntington has mainly claimed a few players off waivers and signed marginal players to minor league contracts. He has made one trade, sending reliever Salomon Torres to Milwaukee for the minor league pitchers Marino Salas and Kevin Roberts.
 Not that he was expected to rush out and sign expensive free agents, but Huntington has done nothing to give Pittsburgh fans hope that the Pirates can avoid a major league-record-tying 16th consecutive losing season. A sub-.500 season will send the Pirates into the record books with the 1933-48 Phillies.
 The Pirates' new players are Josh Wilson, Ty Taubenheim, Chris Gomez, Jorge Velandia, Hector Carrasco, Jaret Wright, Casey Fossum, T. J. Beam, Adam Bernero, Elmer Dessens, Doug Mientkiewicz, Luis Rivas and Ray Olmedo. At first glance, not to mention second, third and fourth, there does not appear to be an impact player in that group. 
 ''It's been a busy off-season despite a lack of activity on the 25-man roster,'' Huntington said. 
 The Pirates, he said, have changed their scouting and development system, but the results will not be noticeable for several years. The fans, meanwhile, will continue to be restless.
 ''They want to win; they're frustrated at our years of losing,'' Huntington acknowledged. ''They feel we should have gone out and been more aggressive in the free-agent market. We weren't able to sign any of the bigger name free agents. Some we didn't pursue because we didn't feel it was appropriate for us. We have market appropriate resources at our disposal, but we can't do things just to appease the fans.''
 The Orioles, like the Pirates, are one of four teams in baseball history that have had 10 consecutive losing seasons after finishing in first place. MacPhail's mandate is to return the team to competitiveness. He felt the best place to start was trading Tejada and Bedard.
 ''In those two players, I had two assets that were going to expire for the Orioles in two seasons,'' MacPhail said. ''That was my judgment.''
 The Orioles' economics, he said, prevented him from ''throwing money at free agents and solving our problem that way.'' If he could acquire the right prospects for his two stars, MacPhail said, they could be part of the solution. For Tejada and Bedard, the Orioles obtained 10 players, including 7 pitchers.
 ''If you rely on free agency to acquire pitching you'll find that they are expensive and fragile,'' MacPhail said. ''Better to spend on bats.''
 He has been around long enough to be realistic about prospects. ''Prospects are just prospects,'' he said. ''Not all will pan out. It's hard to trade Tejada and Bedard and say you're going be better in '08, but I think we took steps to make us better in the future.''
 Wade, who acquired Tejada for the Astros, was probably the busiest new general manager in terms of shuffling the roster. 
 ''Twenty-seven of the 52 players we have in camp have been acquired since the end of last season,'' Wade said. ''You need the name tags that say, My Name Is. ... ''
 Wade obtained Tejada to be the Houston shortstop and signed Kazuo Matsui to replace the retired Craig Biggio at second base. He traded closer Lidge for center fielder Michael Bourn.
 ''When I came in here, obviously we had a pretty good nucleus of players,'' Wade said. ''But we felt we needed to add offense, particularly speed.''
 Bourn and Matsui will bat 1-2, preceding Lance Berkman, Carlos Lee and Tejada, giving the Astros a potent upper half of the lineup. Wade acquired Jose Valverde, whose 47 saves led the majors last year, from Arizona to replace Lidge as the closer. He also added Geoff Blum and Darin Erstad to bolster the bench.
 ''We're still out there talking on several different fronts,'' the energetic Wade said. ''I don't know what will happen.''
 Waiting by the Phone
 Between them, they have 1,371 home runs and no jobs. Doesn't anybody want an aging super slugger with more baggage than an airplane cargo hold?
 With spring training in full swing and exhibition games beginning Tuesday, Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa are left standing in the unemployment line. A significant number of other free agents do not have jobs, either.
 Starting pitchers: Jeff Weaver, David Wells, Kyle Lohse, Bartolo Colon, Freddy Garcia, Russ Ortiz, Eric Milton, Aaron Sele, Rodrigo Lopez.
 Relief pitchers: Armando Benitez, Arthur Rhodes, Jose Mesa, Antonio Alfonseca.
 Hitters: Mike Piazza, Shawn Green, Shannon Stewart, Preston Wilson, Reggie Sanders, Kenny Lofton, Rondell White, Corey Patterson, Ryan Klesko, Trot Nixon, Julio Franco.
 Like these other players, Bonds and Sosa are looking for perhaps the same job: designated hitter with an American League club, but no such positions seem to be available to them.
 ''Is Barry retiring? No,'' Jeff Borris, his agent, said. ''Is he working out? Yes. Does he want to play? Yes.'' 
 But Borris would not discuss Bonds's prospects. ''I won't characterize the interest on behalf of the clubs,'' he said. ''There will be a time when it's appropriate for me to discuss the Bonds negotiations, but this is not the time.''
 Adam Katz would not discuss his client's job prospects, either. ''He's still unsigned,'' Katz said of Sosa, leaving it at that.
 Pettitte Shows Class
 Andy Pettitte spent an hour answering every question he was asked at a news conference last week and was prepared to answer more questions if Jason Zillo, the Yankees' media-relations director, had not ended the session. Compare that response to use of performance-enhancing substances with the public responses of some other players in similar circumstances.
 Paul Lo Duca, with the Washington Nationals, issued a brief statement apologizing ''for mistakes in judgment'' and for the resulting distraction. But he did not acknowledge using human growth hormone, as the Mitchell report said he had done, and when asked questions later, declined to comment further.
 Eric Gagne, after joining Milwaukee, acted in a similarmanner. He apologized to his new teammates and said he felt bad for his family and friends, but he neither acknowledged that he used H.G.H. nor entertained questions. 
 Jay Gibbons and Brian Roberts of Baltimore were more forthcoming than Lo Duca and Gagne, discussing their use of banned substances.
 Who Told Whom What? 
 An addendum to the case made here last week that Roger Clemens was not believable in his testimony before a Congressional committee.
 Clemens said his agent, Randy Hendricks, never told him that George Mitchell had asked to meet with Clemens. Hendricks, however, is also Andy Pettitte's agent, and on Page 50 of his deposition for the committee, Pettitte said, ''I think Randy called me about August, maybe, and told me that they were wanting to speak with me.''
 Hendricks would probably not have told Pettitte and failed to inform Clemens of the request.

 BODY:
THE WELSH GIRL, by Peter Ho Davies. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.95.) The lives of three people intersect in a town in northern Wales during World War II: a sheep farmer's pregnant daughter who yearns for bigger things, a young German prisoner of war imprisoned in a camp near the town and a half-Jewish German who interrogates prisoners for the British. Davies's first novel is a ''kaleidoscopic study of the clash ... between personal history and 'history' as it plays out on the world stage,'' Jennifer Egan wrote in the Book Review.
 THE AENEID, by Virgil. Translated by Robert Fagles. (Penguin, $16.) This tale of Aeneas' wanderings and the eventual establishment of the Roman Empire has been translated into English many times, and Fagles, an emeritus professor of comparative literature at Princeton who previously translated Homer's ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey,'' ''comes to the fray well armed,'' our reviewer, Brad Leithauser, said. He added that Fagles renders the Latin hexameters of Virgil (at right) into variable lines with a ''capaciousness ... well suited to this vast story's ebb and flow.'' 
 THE GREAT RISK SHIFT: The New Economic Insecurity and the Decline of the American Dream, by Jacob S. Hacker. (Oxford, $15.95.) Hacker, a Yale professor, tells the story of the decline of economic security in America during the past 30 years. ''Problems once confined to the working poor -- lack of health insurance and access to guaranteed pensions, job insecurity and staggering personal debt, bankruptcy and home foreclosure -- have ... become an increasingly normal part of middle-class life,'' Hacker writes in his preface to this new and expanded edition. His vision is of a ''security and opportunity society'' that restores financial stability to ordinary Americans.
 MORAL DISORDER: And Other Stories, by Margaret Atwood. (Anchor, $13.95.) These 11 loosely linked stories -- Atwood's first collection in 15 years -- have an autobiographical feel as they chart one woman's life in Canada from childhood to motherhood to older age.
 BETTER: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance, by Atul Gawande. (Picador, $14.) ''What does it take to be good at something in which failure is so easy?'' Gawande, a surgeon who is also a staff writer at The New Yorker, asks. In these essays, he weaves together clinical narratives and anecdotes from other disciplines to explain how some doctors manage to avoid being ''just a white-coated cog in a machine.'' 
 MATTERS OF HONOR, by Louis Begley. (Ballantine, $15.) Several members of Harvard's class of 1950 -- one a Holocaust survivor who wants to distance himself from his immigrant roots, another an aspiring writer from an old New England family -- navigate college and the world beyond in this novel by the author of ''Wartime Lies'' and ''About Schmidt.'' 
 Two recent biographies of Hitler's favorite, Leni Riefenstahl, who may be the most controversial filmmaker in history, try to disentangle her many lies and to place her work in historical perspective. Steven Bach, who was in charge of worldwide production for United Artists and has written two other biographies, gives a fascinating account of the making of ''Triumph of the Will'' in LENI: The Life and Work of Leni Riefenstahl (Vintage, $16.95). Jurgen Trimborn, a professor of film, theater and art history at the University of Cologne, presents Riefenstahl chiefly as a careerist in LENI RIEFENSTAHL: A Life, translated by Edna McCown (Faber & Faber, $17.) 
 WINTERWOOD, by Patrick McCabe. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) A suburban journalist is enchanted, pretty much literally, by a wild old fiddle player in the ''latest fever dream of a novel'' by this Irish writer, as our reviewer, Gregory Cowles, described it. He continued: ''A lot of writers insist it's dangerous to forget the past, but McCabe suggests it's more dangerous to remember it.''
 THE GOLDEN ROAD: Notes on My Gentrification, by Caille Millner. (Penguin, $14.) Born in San Jose in 1979, Millner has always struggled with her identity -- as an African-American growing up in a Latino part of town, as a middle-class black in the Silicon Valley, as a student at Harvard and, later, as a resident of New York, London and Cape Town. Millner, who now sits on the editorial board of The San Francisco Chronicle, seems coy about much of her personal life, but the glimpses she gives us of ''an idealistic, delicately calibrated young woman desperate to grow up ... win us over,'' Amy Finnerty wrote in the Book Review.
 POWER, FAITH, AND FANTASY: America in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present, by Michael B. Oren. (Norton, $17.95.) American interaction with the Middle East begins with Jefferson and the Barbary pirates in this ambitious history by an American-born Israeli scholar. Oren is particularly interesting on lesser-known episodes like the missionary effort of the 19th century; the chapters that deal with America as a superpower are less conclusive. Oren illustrates our continuing confusion about the Middle East and our inability to be honest about our own motives in the region.

HEADLINE: Citywide Scissors, Bloodletting in the Neighborhood

BYLINE: By JOSEPH HUFF-HANNON

 BODY:
AT Public School 308 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, mornings officially begin with an address to teachers and students by the school's tall and commanding principal, Gail Bell-Baptiste.
 One morning this month, recent attendance figures were announced, teachers were reminded that ''we are preparing for something magnificent here, the magnificent lives of these young people,'' and students were invited to buy Valentine's Day Candygrams from the chess club.
 Back in her cluttered office, Dr. Bell-Baptiste reflected on a less cheerful aspect of her job: having to perform emergency midyear surgery on her school's budget. The hard choices she made illustrate the ground-level impact of a $180 million cut in the citywide system's annual operating budget of $10.3 billion, excluding teachers' salaries. 
 ''Principals are livid about this,'' Dr. Bell-Baptiste said. ''How can they cut our budget in February after we've already made our plans for the year?'' 
 On Jan. 31, principals at public schools received an e-mail message from the city's Department of Education ordering them to cut 1.75 percent from their operating and programming budget. By the next day, the money had disappeared from the schools' online budgets, forcing administrators to make immediate decisions about whom to let go and which programs to drop. 
 The cut followed a $324 million cut the mayor announced for next year's school budgets. The earlier cut was part of broad-based budget reductions that Mayor Bloomberg attributed to the city's worsening economy and that affected every city agency. 
 P.S. 308, which is on Quincy Street near Malcolm X Boulevard, may turn out to be one of the luckier schools, in that Dr. Bell-Baptiste was able to trim the required $108,000 from the budget without firing anyone or cutting after-school programs. The school did, however, lose four teacher's aides, who had to be transferred immediately to other schools. As a result, the student-teacher ratio in four classes has doubled. 
 Class sizes will also climb because of the disbanding of an early childhood ''bridge'' class that many parents prized, a mix of 16 kindergarten and first-grade students. 
 ''Not all kids go to kindergarten; my daughter didn't,'' said Natira Kinsey, who has a son in kindergarten and a daughter in first grade. ''That bridge class really helps some first graders play catch-up. It's important for their self-esteem. Now those kids have to start all over in a new class.''
 With a student body of more than 800 children that draws overwhelmingly from low-income families, P.S. 308 has been hailed by www.insideschools.org, a nonprofit Web site that evaluates city schools, as one of the top kindergarten-through-eighth-grade schools in the district, and in the top third citywide.
 As with many other schools that succeed at educating children from low-income families, its success appears rooted in a combination of dedicated teachers, involved parents, and enriching field trips and after-school and weekend programs. 
 At P.S. 308 these programs were spared this year, but they may be next on the chopping block.
 And like many an educator, Dr. Bell-Baptiste cautions that morale can be another casualty of budget cuts. ''Some of my younger colleagues, newer principals and teachers, they just can't believe it,'' she said. ''I've been around so I have thick skin, but one of my youngest teachers was in tears.''

HEADLINE: Fear of Insurance Trouble Leads Many to Shun or Hide DNA Tests

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
 Victoria Grove wanted to find out if she was destined to develop the form of emphysema that ran in her family, but she did not want to ask her doctor for the DNA test that would tell her. 
 She worried that she might not be able to get health insurance, or even a job, if a genetic predisposition showed up in her medical records, especially since treatment for the condition, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, could cost over $100,000 a year. Instead, Ms. Grove sought out a service that sent a test kit to her home and returned the results directly to her. 
 Nor did she tell her doctor when the test revealed that she was virtually certain to get it. Knowing that she could sustain permanent lung damage without immediate treatment for her bouts of pneumonia, she made sure to visit her clinic at the first sign of infection.
 But then came the day when the nurse who listened to her lungs decided she just had a cold. Ms. Grove begged for a chest X-ray. The nurse did not think it was necessary. 
 ''It was just an ongoing battle with myself,'' recalled Ms. Grove, of Woodbury, Minn. ''Should I tell them now or wait till I'm sicker?''
 The first, much-anticipated benefits of personalized medicine are being lost or diluted for many Americans who are too afraid that genetic information may be used against them to take advantage of its growing availability. 
 In some cases, doctors say, patients who could make more informed health care decisions if they learned whether they had inherited an elevated risk of diseases like breast and colon cancer refuse to do so because of the potentially dire economic consequences. 
 Others enter a kind of genetic underground, spending hundreds or thousands of dollars of their own money for DNA tests that an insurer would otherwise cover, so as to avoid scrutiny. Those who do find out they are likely or certain to develop a particular genetic condition often beg doctors not to mention it in their records.
 Some, like Ms. Grove, try to manage their own care without confiding in medical professionals. And even doctors who recommend DNA testing to their patients warn them that they could face genetic discrimination from employers or insurers.
 Such discrimination appears to be rare; even proponents of federal legislation that would outlaw it can cite few examples of it. But thousands of people accustomed to a health insurance system in which known risks carry financial penalties are drawing their own conclusions about how a genetic predisposition to disease is likely to be regarded.
 As a result, the ability to more effectively prevent and treat genetic disease is faltering even as the means to identify risks people are born with are improving. 
 ''It's pretty clear that the public is afraid of taking advantage of genetic testing,'' said Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health. ''If that continues, the future of medicine that we would all like to see happen stands the chance of being dead on arrival.''
 Caught in a Bind
 For Ms. Grove, 59, keeping her genetic condition secret finally became impossible. When her symptoms worsened she was told to come back to the clinic before antibiotics would be prescribed. But there had been a snowstorm that day, and she could not summon the strength to drive.
 ''I have alpha-1,'' she remembers sobbing into the phone. ''I need this antibiotic!''
 The clinic called in the prescription.
 Ms. Grove, who does freelance accounting from home and has health insurance through her husband's employer, allowed herself to be identified here because she said she felt an obligation to others -- including some in her own family -- to draw attention to the bind she sees herself in. 
 ''Something needs to be done so that you cannot be discriminated against when you know about these things,'' she said. ''Otherwise you are sicker, your life is shorter and you're not doing what you need to protect yourself.''
 Employers say discrimination is already prohibited in the workplace by the Americans with Disabilities Act and existing laws governing privacy of medical records. But employee rights advocates say nothing in those laws explicitly prevents employers hard-pressed to pay for mounting health care costs from trying to screen out employees they know are more likely to get sick. 
 Courts have yet to rule on the subject. When the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission sued the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway for secretly testing the blood of employees who had filed compensation claims for carpal-tunnel syndrome in an effort to discover a genetic cause for the symptoms, the case was settled out of court in 2002. 
 And in 2005 when Eddy Curry, then the center for the Chicago Bulls, refused a genetic test to learn if he was predisposed to a heart ailment, the team traded him to the New York Knicks. 
 Insurers say they do not ask prospective customers about genetic test results, or require testing. ''It's an anecdotal fear,'' said Mohit M. Ghose, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, whose members provide benefits for 200 million Americans. ''Our industry is not interested in any way, shape or form in discriminating based on a genetic marker.''
 Still, a recent study by the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute found otherwise. In 7 of 92 underwriting decisions, insurance providers evaluating hypothetical applicants said they would deny coverage, charge more for premiums or exclude certain conditions from coverage based on genetic test results.
 The Medical Cost
 Regardless of whether discrimination actually occurs, many health care professionals say the pervasive anxiety over it demands legislative action. Geneticists complain that discrimination fears prevent them from recruiting research participants, delaying cures and treatments for disease. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, the same concern is a leading reason people cancel appointments for tests that detect cancer risk. 
 ''We are dealing with potential lifesaving interventions,'' said Dr. Kenneth Offit, chief of the center's clinical genetics service. ''It's a tragedy that people are being scared off by this.''
 The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which passed the House of Representatives by a wide margin last year, would prohibit insurers from using genetic information to deny benefits or raise premiums for both group and individual policies. (It is already illegal to exclude individuals from a group plan because of their genetic profile.) The bill would also bar employers from collecting genetic information or using it to make decisions about hiring, firing or compensation. But it has yet to reach the Senate floor.
 Meanwhile, a $300 genetic test for prostate cancer risk announced last month immediately drew callers to a public radio station in Washington that was discussing the test, voicing fears of insurance discrimination. Dr. Karim Kader, who made the test possible with his discovery that men who carry certain DNA variants are four to five times likelier to develop prostate cancer, assured one caller that the test would be ''very private.'' 
 For some, that is not good enough. 
 Linda Vahdat, director of the breast cancer research program at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, estimates that 20 percent of her patients choose to pay for the DNA test for inherited breast cancer risk with cash, to avoid submitting insurance claims.
 And last year, hundreds of customers paid the start-up company DNA Direct for tests that range in cost from $175 to $3,456 to ensure that no third party, not even a doctor, had access to their results. Mary, a freelance camera assistant in Brooklyn, for instance, sent a swab of her cheek cells to DNA Direct to find out if her extreme fatigue was caused by hemochromatosis, a genetic condition in which the body retains too much iron.
 ''I would rather not lay out the $200 myself,'' said Mary, who requested that her last name be withheld for the same reason she paid for her own test. ''But it seemed safer.''
 Treatment for hemochromatosis typically involves removing a unit of blood twice-weekly by phlebotomy. But that would mean disclosing the condition to a doctor, so Mary is planning on becoming a frequent blood donor.
 Kathy, a financial analyst in Houston who would like to know if she, like her two sisters, has a genetic predisposition to breast cancer, said she was not going to take even an anonymous test. ''Then,'' she said, ''I'm just in a position of having to lie.'' 
 The culture of secrecy around genetic information is stronger in the United States, some experts say, than in countries where people are guaranteed health care. Among Americans at risk for Huntington's disease, an incurable brain disorder, only 5 percent take the DNA test to determine if they will develop it, compared with 20 percent of Canadians in the same position, according to Michael R. Hayden, a professor of human genetics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
 Here, doctors often feel obligated to inform patients of the potential financial downside. 
 ''I always warn them,'' said Dr. Stephen Moll, director of the Thrombophilia Program at the University of North Carolina, who uses a genetic test to determine the best treatment for patients with blood clots. ''Especially if they are self-employed, I don't want it to be a surprise if their health insurance premium goes up.''
 Unknown Risks
 After receiving a similar warning from her doctor, Katherine Anderson's parents did not allow her to be tested for Factor V Leiden, a genetic condition she might have inherited from her father that increases the risk of blood clots. 
 But last year, with nothing in Ms. Anderson's record to indicate reason for concern, a gynecologist prescribed a birth control pill to regulate her uneven periods. Six weeks later, Ms. Anderson, then 16, developed a clot that stretched from her knee to her abdomen. The pill, combined with the gene she had indeed inherited, had increased her clotting risk by 30-fold. 
 Now largely recovered, her primary concern is whether she will be viewed as a health insurance liability for the future. 
 ''I don't want to have to work for a big business just to get insurance,'' she said. ''This could be determining what I can do for my whole life.'' 
 For Judith Berman Carlisle, the price of privacy was forgoing the DNA test that would have convinced her not to have surgery. Ms. Carlisle, 48, who was setting up her own therapy practice, was afraid testing positive for the high-risk breast and ovarian cancer gene that runs in her family would prevent her from buying health insurance. 
 But her sister had developed ovarian cancer the year before, an aunt had died of it, and Ms. Carlisle was desperate not to get it herself. Her doctor agreed to remove her ovaries based on her family history -- the way such decisions were commonly made before a genetic test was available. 
 Ms. Carlisle was convinced the surgery would be less damning than proof that she carried a defective BRCA1 gene, which also confers a very high chance of developing breast cancer. 
 ''There's a big difference between someone saying, 'I have a strong family history,' '' Ms. Carlisle said, ''and saying, 'I only have a 13 percent chance of not getting breast cancer during the time you're insuring me.' ''
 Last fall, after the surgery to remove her ovaries, she began to consider a double mastectomy to remove any chance of breast cancer, the disease her grandmother and another aunt had died of. Having secured health insurance, she took the test for the BRCA1 mutation. It came back negative. 
 ''The first thing they said to me,'' Ms. Carlisle said, ''is that I have no higher risk than anyone on the street.''

HEADLINE: The Heart and Soul of Suburbia

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
THE bustling family- and singles-friendly neighborhood known as Huntington Village is neither incorporated nor an official government entity. But this restaurant-laden, shopper-happy 36-square-block cosmopolitan oasis is popular with residents and tourists as the downtown hub and the unofficial capital of the town of Huntington. 
 ''It is the heart and soul of the town,'' said Frank Petrone, the supervisor of Huntington, a western Suffolk County town of 200,000 whose offices are along Main Street in the quaint village area. ''It is the economic hub.''
 For the last 12 of the 14 years he has been in office, Mr. Petrone said, he has worked on making the village, which has 25,000 to 30,000 residents, a destination on the North Shore of Long Island, embellished with brick sidewalks, gaslight street lamps and hanging baskets. 
 ''People are attracted to the Charles Dickens storybook downtown,'' he said, though many of the smaller but incorporated villages in the town of Huntington like Northport have their own charms. 
 In January, the Long Island Index, which compiles data about the region, concluded in a report that the future of the Island depended on creating vibrant downtowns with affordable housing, and named Huntington Village, with its 352 storefronts, one of the Island's most popular.
 Donna Spinoso, a real estate agent with Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty's Huntington office, said the village was like ''living in a New England town rather than suburbia.'' 
 ''Many people that move to Long Island end up living in suburbia and go to the strip mall to get everything,'' Ms. Spinoso said. ''Huntington is not like that at all.'' 
 In January, Huntington was selected by America's Promise Alliance, a national organization founded by Gen. Colin L. Powell, as one of the 100 Best Communities for Young People in terms of making the well-being of children a top priority. Forty years ago, Huntington was the first township in New York to form a youth bureau as an agency of the local municipal government. 
 After scouting homes in Westchester and Nassau County that were too expensive, Michelle and Dennis Laterza bought a 10-year-old three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath colonial home on half an acre for $399,000 last December. It is on a block filled with other young couples and is a 10-minute walk from Main Street.
 ''This was the liveliest town,'' said Ms. Laterza, 26, who like her husband, Dennis, 27, grew up in a suburban tract area in West Islip and sought a more cosmopolitan community in which to raise a family. 
 Visitors with an environmental consciousness have an extra incentive to spend a day or evening in the village. 
 Last year, the town embarked on a green initiative that includes free parking for hybrid and alternative-fuel vehicles at the Long Island Rail Road station and on the street. 
 ''You can park there without feeding the meter,'' Mr. Petrone said. 
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Shingled colonials, Victorians and Arts and Crafts-style cottages form a mosaic of homes on the wooded, hilly streets south of Route 25A near the village center. Farther from the hub, a mix of newer split-levels and ranches and traditional older homes along winding roads give the neighborhood character, with grander houses and sprawling lawns stretching north to Lloyd Harbor. Water views of Huntington Harbor are placid and plentiful. 
 The geographic limits of the area, though not set in stone, are guided by walkability and generally extend a mile or so in all directions from the center of downtown at Main Street and New York Avenue, stretching to the boundary lines of Huntington Bay, Lloyd Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor and Huntington Station. 
 Houses are smaller, lots are smaller and taxes are lower in the village, often attracting retirees like Jerry Kessler, 80, a 50-year resident who downsized 10 years ago from a home with a pool on two acres to a town house closer to the main drag. 
 ''Our life revolves around our friends from the Huntington Country Club and the church and the village,'' said Mr. Kessler, the former president of Friends for Long Island's Heritage, which was formed in the 1960s (and has since disbanded), when the Walt Whitman Mall in nearby Huntington Station was developing and the village ''was going downhill.''
 Mr. Kessler said he was amazed by the crowds strolling along the village streets on Friday and Saturday nights, choosing to dine from a smorgasbord of Argentine, Japanese, Mexican and Mediterranean restaurants. ''Huntington regentrified itself and survived,'' he said. ''It became a hot spot.'' 
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 Homes are taking longer to sell but they keep moving, particularly in the more moderate price ranges. 
 According to a Daniel Gale Sotheby International Realty's market report, 278 homes and condominiums in the Huntington ZIP code 11743 were sold in 2007, compared with 318 in 2006. This excludes sales in Huntington Bay, Lloyd Harbor and Lloyd Neck within the same ZIP code. 
 Last year, homes stayed on the market for an average of 106 days, with an average price of $639,454, versus 81 days in 2006 at an average of $657,069. 
 There are currently 273 homes for sale in the Huntington School District, which includes parts of Huntington Station and Huntington Bay. The prices range from $219,000 for a five-room ranch on a third of an acre to $1.9 million for a 1869 manor house on almost two acres. 
 Additionally, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, there are 18 condos and co-ops on the market, with a median list price of $579,000. 
 WHAT TO DO
 The village is a cultural treasure chest. Beyond the local multiplex, the Cinema Arts Center is devoted to independent film and talks by filmmakers, as well as an Academy Awards party on Sunday and, in March, a documentary production workshop. 
 The Inter-Media Arts Center, housed in a converted old movie palace, features music performances with a sprinkling of dance and theater.
 The Huntington Arts Council holds shows at its Main Street Petite Gallery, sponsors the Huntington Summer Arts Festival with 50 dance, musical and theatrical performances in Heckscher Park, and also offers myriad artistic programs and services to cultural organizations and artists.
 After closing for a restoration project last June, the Beaux-Arts-style Heckscher Museum of Art, located in the 18.5-acre Heckscher Park, reopens in March. 
 THE SCHOOLS
 With 4,241 students, the Huntington Union Free School District, established in 1657, is the oldest of the eight school districts in the town of Huntington. 
 The district has four primary schools that serve kindergarten through Grade 3, two intermediate schools for Grades 4 to 6, one middle school for Grades 7 and 8, and a high school. 
 According to Michael O'Brien, the assistant superintendent for curriculum, 600 to 700 students take English as a second language, and there is also a dual English-Spanish language program.
 SAT scores for 2006, the latest available, were 511 for critical reading, 505 for writing and 524 in math, compared with state averages of 493 in reading, 483 in writing and 510 in math. 
 THE COMMUTE
 Forty miles from Midtown Manhattan, the Huntington station of the Long Island Rail Road offers service to Pennsylvania Station. The trip takes about an hour during peak hours; with transfers in Jamaica or Hicksville the commute can take up to one hour and 10 minutes. Monthly tickets purchased online cost $234.22; at the station, $239.
 The town runs its own municipal transit agency, Huntington Area Rapid Transit, providing bus transportation for $1.25 to the village and Walt Whitman Mall, Northport and Cold Spring Harbor. Paratransit rides are available to the disabled and to senior citizens. 
 THE HISTORY
 In 1658, five years after the establishment of the town of Huntington, the Old First Church, then a Congregational Church, was founded. In its early days, the church was used for religious services and for town meetings and court trials. Under British rule, the church was required to build a building that could seat 200. After George Washington was defeated in the Battle of Long Island, the British quartered troops and stabled horses at the church.
 In 1779, they dismantled the structure and used the timbers to build a fort in the middle of the town's burial ground.
 In 1784, after the Revolution, the present sanctuary, now the Old First Presbyterian Church, was built on the same site along Route 25A. A parish hall was built in 1926, and in 1980, a Sunday school wing with a gymnasium was added. The church, Presbyterian since 1748, has 688 members.

HEADLINE: Getting Out a Yes Vote on Budgets

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

 BODY:
IN Glen Ridge, the schools superintendent and other school board members laid out coffee and doughnuts at the train station in the center of town one recent morning to talk to residents about the need for more school financing and the coming school budget election.
 In the West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District, a program called ''The Voting Booth'' started this year in an effort to try to get more yes votes on Election Day.
 In Toms River, administrators and board members have scheduled 50 to 60 meetings to explain their budget to district voters.
 Election Day is not until April 15, when voters in about 550 of the state's 600 school districts go to the polls to cast their vote on school budgets. But with fears that many voters are not in the mood to say yes to higher spending for schools, administrators all over the state said they were doing more this year than in previous years -- and started their efforts earlier -- to inform citizens about the budget vote. 
 Everything from holding coffees to printing budget literature in Spanish is on the table to help get out the yes vote. A troubled national economy, soaring gas prices, talk of recession and a new confusing state financing formula have administrators fearful that this year's voters will push the no lever. While 78 percent of the state's budgets passed last year, there have been other years, particularly years when the economy was weak, that the percentage was lower. In 2006, only 53 percent of the budgets passed, and only 62 percent passed in 2003. 
 ''This is probably the hardest time to pass a budget than any of the 15 years that I've been involved in education,'' said Anne Einhorn, president of the school board in Cherry Hill, a district with about 11,800 students. ''It's the economy in general. It's the gas pump, the price of a gallon of milk. The middle class is unfortunately affected deeply. People are tired. They are working hard to live in a good community, but their income isn't keeping up with inflation. It's easy to go to the polls and pull the no lever and say, 'I don't have another dime.' '' 
 Dr. Daniel Fishbein, superintendent of Glen Ridge schools, agreed that while passing budgets was always a concern, there were factors this year that would make it more challenging. 
 ''We have people who have lost their jobs because of the economy, and we are going through a reassessment,'' he said. Glen Ridge is one of many communities in the state that are in the midst of a reassessment of their property values, or just completed one, and that often means a higher property tax bill for many residents, which leaves them in no mood to approve a school budget increase.
 When Glen Ridge held one of several monthly coffees at the train station this month, almost no one showed up to ask about the budget or other educational issues. School officials hoped it was not a harbinger of things to come.
 Bob Salvatelli, 41, a former member of the board, was one of three who chatted with the Board of Education members that morning. 
 ''I haven't seen the budget, but it's a difficult thing to do,'' he said about persuading voters to vote yes. ''In a town with no industry it's hard to get people to try to pay more for school services.''
 Frank Belluscio, spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, agreed that in tough economic times, the only place voters could vent frustration was in school budget and school bond votes. In December, New Jersey voters said no to $189 million in school construction projects on bond issues. Eight out of 14 districts voted yes on bonds, but less than half the $347 million sought by districts was approved.
 ''If you look at budget approval ratings you see a direct correlation with approval and the national economy,'' Mr. Belluscio said.
 This year there is a 4 percent cap on tax levy increases. If a district goes over that cap, it must put a second question on the ballot. In the past, second questions only needed to pass by having the highest number of votes. This year for the first time, second questions must be approved by at least 60 percent of the voters. Last year, 48 percent of the 87 second questions were approved, Mr. Belluscio said. But if they had been subjected to the new rules, fewer than 25 percent would have gotten more than 60 percent of the vote.
 In preparation for a tougher fight, educators are making their cases now. Administrators are prohibited from telling voters how to vote, but they can explain the budget to them.
 In West Windsor-Plainsboro, budgets have passed in recent years, but voter turnout remains low, said Gerri Hutner, district spokeswoman. Last year fewer than 10 percent of registered voters cast a ballot, passing the budget 1,282 to 1,015. This year along with coffees, signs and meetings with community groups, the district has put together a program called ''The Voting Booth.'' Each of about 50 volunteers find eight people to keep in constant touch with through the election season by phone, e-mail messages or even face-to-face meetings. The hope is each person will talk to friends and neighbors. ''We are taking a page out of the current election,'' Ms. Hutner said. 
 Millburn is holding more open budget meetings this year. On a Sunday in January, the district held an open forum where citizens could ask questions about the budget and other education issues. ''This year we intend to do a little more,'' said Dr. Richard L. Brodow, the superintendent. ''We try to explain that we have an obligation to this generation of children.'' Dr. Brodow also wants voters to know that with rising energy costs, double-digit increases in health care costs and state mandates, ''education is no longer inexpensive.'' 
 Last year in Millburn, a new citizens group called Advocates for Education sprung into action a few weeks before the election with fliers and calls to get out the yes vote. ''We will do anything in our power to get the parent vote out,'' said Sara Lazarus, a Millburn parent and one of the group's founders.
 In districts like Haddon Heights, where a school budget has not passed since the 2000-1 school year, there is an urgency to get out information about the budget and activate the yes voters, said Dr. Nancy M. Hacker, the superintendent. 
 Last year's budget was defeated by 21 votes out of 785 votes. Last Election Day, the district had a science fair and provided baby-sitting. This year, the district plans another event for April 15. A recent reassessment will not help their case, Dr. Hacker said, adding that the community has ''huge outrage about that.'' 
 What educators are up against was illustrated at Cherry Hill's school board meeting in early February. Voters have very different interests. Stuart Chaifetz, a parent and member of the Cherry Hill Special Education Alliance, got up to express concerns about special education cutbacks. 
 Nick Naum, 86, a Cherry Hill resident for 53 years, complained about high taxes. ''I don't want to leave Cherry Hill,'' he said. Mr. Naum said he has voted no on two of the past three budgets but doesn't know how he will vote in April. ''I hate to see young people fighting the seniors,'' he said. ''I want some help.''

HEADLINE: The Big Commute, in Reverse

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
ON most days, Matthew Davis, a 28-year-old portfolio manager, can count on spending about two hours getting to work and another two hours getting home. That's going against the tide of commuters going into New York City for work. Mr. Davis, who rented an apartment in Park Slope in Brooklyn when he landed a job in the securities industry in New York, found himself not on Wall Street, but in Ronkonkoma, working for a financial services management company. 
 He starts his morning with a stop for tea and a bagel at his neighborhood delicatessen, and walks 30 minutes or takes the subway to the Flatbush Avenue terminal of the Long Island Rail Road. In Jamaica, Queens, he changes trains and settles in for a 60-minute ride to his company's office near MacArthur Airport, deep in Suffolk County. There, he keeps a car for the last leg of the commute, a total of two hours each way. ''Usually, until I get to Mineola, I have to stand, but then I find a seat and read the paper,'' he said. ''I tried to find an apartment closer to work, but after 20 minutes of driving, I still wasn't anyplace that was close to anything. I really like living in the city.'' 
 Mr. Davis is among the some 300,000 people who live in New York City and make their way to jobs in the suburbs every day, part of a fast-growing segment of the work force that has turned the traditional idea of bedroom communities on its head. The group includes young workers in high-skilled professions, as well as tens of thousands of others up and down the income spectrum who prefer city living or cannot afford the suburban dream.
 Planners and business groups across the region have increasingly come to realize that these commuters are a critical part of their economic prospects and are vigorously promoting transportation initiatives to encourage them. But they face considerable obstacles.
 Many who travel to work against the tide have arduous commutes -- long drives on crowded highways, or, for those who do not want or cannot afford cars, combinations of trains, buses, car pools and taxicabs cobbled together on transit systems that were not designed to accommodate them.
 In spite of that, the number of city residents working in the suburbs grew 12 percent from 2000 to 2005, according to census figures calculated by the Queens College sociology department for The New York Times. About one in 11 city workers has a job in the suburbs, and the number is growing faster than any other segment of commuters.
 The reason: A lot of jobs are in the suburbs. Whether they are at the upper end of the skill-and-income spectrum or the more modest-paying jobs in retail, health care or personal services, there is a labor demand in the suburbs. ''Labor just simply flows to where the need is,'' said Christopher P. Bruhl, president of the Business Council of Fairfield County, Conn. ''We have more jobs than people, and we have to get people from somewhere.''
 With many companies that signed leases for Manhattan office space during the stock market boom in the late 1990s now facing renewals at much higher rents, there could be more opportunities for the suburbs to gain jobs.
 ''There certainly are jobs in Manhattan, but there are more in the suburbs for me,'' said Jonathan Berenbom, an actuary who left a job in the city for another one with a reinsurance company in Greenwich, Conn. ''A lot of companies are moving, because the costs are less.'' He traded a 35-minute subway ride for a 90-minute commute by subway and train.
 Unemployment rates in the suburbs are remarkably low, 3.8 percent on Long Island and 3.7 percent in Westchester, compared with 5.2 percent in New York City in December. But the number of jobs declined faster than in the city in 2007, suggesting that businesses are having difficulty finding workers, say economists.
 ''Eighteen- to 34-year-olds are leaving the suburbs because of housing prices,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. ''It's hard for companies to bring people here from North Carolina or Ohio, because you can get a dynamite house for $250,000 in North Carolina, and here you get a shoe box.''
 So business groups have been encouraging transportation projects that make it easier to import workers from elsewhere, including the city. On Long Island, they have backed the construction of a third track on the Long Island Rail Road, which would move more people both ways.
 ''Long Island is going to have to draw work force from the city because our younger work force is declining,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, a business group. ''Without it, we're going to have a serious problem in the future.''
 In Westchester, where a third track on Metro-North Railroad's line to White Plains was completed two years ago, business groups are lobbying for a new Tappan Zee Bridge to bring workers from Rockland County.
 ''We have a system that gets them effectively to White Plains and Yonkers and other places along the train lines, and when a new Tappan Zee Bridge is built, we will get people in from the West,'' said Marsha Gordon, the president of the Business Council of Westchester.
 Most reverse commuters drive, according to census figures. But with highways saturated at rush hours and cars expensive to maintain in the city, more attention is focusing on mass transit. 
 ''As congestion on the highways has mounted, there has been a resurgence of interest in and use of transit in the suburbs,'' Mr. Bruhl said. ''Now building next to train stations is the hot button.''
 Among the suburban regions, Long Island has the greatest number of New York City residents in its work force, but Westchester and Connecticut have seen the fastest growth recently, the census figures show. 
 The number of New York City residents who work on Long Island grew 5 percent from 2000 to 2005, to 111,826 from 106,487, according to the census. The number of city residents commuting to jobs in the Westchester and Connecticut suburbs is up 32 percent, to 72,487 in 2005 from 54,875 in 2000. In New Jersey, the number of reverse commuters has grown 14 percent, to 89,559 from 78,293. 
 ''Riders from the city to the suburbs is the fast-growing part of the market, and Metro-North and New Jersey Transit have been able to take advantage of it,'' said Christopher Jones, vice president for research at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit organization that monitors transportation and development issues.
 Metro-North runs several trains an hour on the reverse commute on its three lines. From 7 to 8 a.m., for instance, Metro-North runs 12 trains from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal and 5 trains in the opposite direction.
 New Jersey Transit started carrying passengers on trains that it once sent empty on the reverse route at rush hour, said James P. Redeker, assistant executive director of the agency. Ridership on the reverse commute grew 72 percent from 1996 to 2006, when the number of riders over all increased 48 percent.
 On the Long Island Rail Road, reverse commuting increased steadily through 2003, but has not grown since. Railroad officials say it is because they cannot add more trains -- 14 trains operate eastbound on the Main Line in the morning rush, compared with 146 operating westbound. Supporters, including interest groups across the spectrum from business to environmental, think adding 10 miles of third track from Floral Park to Hicksville will make Long Island more competitive for reverse commuters: If you build it, they will come, they say. The communities along the line have fought bitterly against the idea.
 ''You create demand by creating more frequency,'' said Lisa Tyson, the director of the Long Island Progressive Coalition, which supports the third track because it could reduce automobile pollution and increase job options for lower-income workers.
 But there are other impediments for reverse commuters, as the predicament of Mr. Davis and others aboard the 7:39 from New York to Ronkonkoma illustrates. Commercial development in the suburbs is not always close to rail lines, and getting from the train station to workplace can be a challenge.
 ''The time from 1980 to 2000 was the era of growth for suburban office parks,'' Dr. Hughes said. They were developed along highway routes and drew workers in cars from the surrounding suburbs, not mass transit commuters.
 Anthony Parker, 28, used to take the subway from Jamaica to Astoria, where he worked as an insurance adjuster. But his company moved the operations to Melville in Suffolk County, and his company is in a classic low-density suburban office park of two- and three-story buildings with vast parking lots spread out along a busy multilane roadway.
 Mr. Parker drove to the new office in a car pool for a while, but after its other members were laid off, he started taking the 7:39. It takes him 20 more minutes to get to work than when he was driving, including a 15-minute bus ride when he gets off in Farmingdale -- if he is lucky.
 ''If you miss the bus, that's a problem, because the buses run about one time an hour,'' Mr. Parker said.
 ''The office parks are difficult to get to,'' said Mr. Redeker of New Jersey Transit, where planners have rerouted bus lines, sponsored shuttle vans and organized van pools to help get workers from trains to workplaces. ''Middlesex County has a lot of towns looking at developments that are near, but not on, the train lines.''
 Dr. Hughes said companies whose Manhattan leases are running out are finding that the rents have doubled, and they are looking at suburban alternatives that are substantially cheaper. ''There's going to be some repositioning,'' he said. ''Where are they going to go? I think Connecticut has the edge. Stamford has rail access, and that's critical.''
 Other cities in Westchester and Connecticut are poised to take advantage of the potential, Dr. Gordon said. ''A lot of the new development in Westchester is in the downtowns, and it's because of the availability of the train,'' she said. ''White Plains and Yonkers and New Rochelle are right there in creating development around transit.''
 Long Island grew as a bedroom suburb and has little historic downtown development. ''We're going to have to be more intelligent about how we access our railroad stations,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association. ''We will need jitneys or minibuses running to our major employment centers.''
 In Farmingdale, where about half of the riders on the 7:39 get off, some companies have already taken the initiative. OSI Pharmaceuticals, which develops cancer drugs at a plant in the Route 110 corridor, runs two vans a day during each rush hour.
 ''We like being in New York and we enjoy being in Long Island,'' said Kathy Galante, vice president for marketing. ''We have access to a lot of the academic world -- Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is very important to us -- and we also need access to Wall Street. Being on Long Island is the best of both worlds.''
 She said the company decided two years ago to try to tap the labor pool in New York City, and now a dozen of its 250 Farmingdale employees ride the train and take a shuttle from Farmingdale, and vice versa.
 Dan Sherman, 39, a medicinal chemist, is one of them.
 ''I don't have a car, and I don't want a car,'' said Mr. Sherman, who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens. ''I don't want to live on Long Island, but this kind of business is never in a place where I want to live.
 ''Company buses are a big perk,'' he said. ''I would have been reluctant to take this job without that.''

HEADLINE: Miho Walsh and Roy Prieb

BYLINE: By DEVAN SIPHER

 BODY:
IT started with shrimp dumplings.
 Miho Walsh was in New York's Chinatown enjoying a dim sum brunch in November 2003 with two Japanese girlfriends and Roy Prieb.
 ''I was hoping for a girls' brunch, but this guy, Roy, was crashing,'' said Ms. Walsh, 35, the executive director of the Institute for Medieval Japanese Studies, a research organization at Columbia. 
 Mr. Prieb had, in fact, been invited by one of Ms. Walsh's friends, but he was largely ignored as they counseled her about her love life. They were speaking half Japanese and half English, said Ms. Walsh, who was born in Virginia but grew up mostly in Tokyo. 
 ''I was trying to piece together what was going on,'' said Mr. Prieb, 34, who has held top management posts in several start-up businesses he has invested in. ''I focused mostly on the food.'' 
 And that's where the dumplings came in. ''I was intrigued that Roy kept choosing items from the dim sum carts that I really liked,'' said Ms. Walsh, whose cravings range from onion rice cakes to cheeseburgers. ''I find it hard to meet someone who has a similar palate.'' 
 What he noticed was her laugh, describing it as ''full-bodied and round and warm,'' and her personality, which ''lights up a room,'' he said. But he didn't think she was interested since they had barely spoken and ''most of her conversation was about other guys.'' 
 He was surprised when she sent an e-mail message days later. He reciprocated with a nonchalant invitation to a barbecue the following Saturday at the apartment he shared in New York. When she couldn't attend, he changed the date. 
 ''The guy is moving around the schedule for 8 or 10 people just for me,'' she said. 
 So much for nonchalance. 
 At the barbecue she was impressed by his skill in preparing the salmon, but not by his post-dorm lifestyle. ''Next to books on economics and history were light sabers,'' she said. And then there was his passion for video games, which he played on a wall-size screen.
 Mr. Prieb relinquished his game controller long enough to take Ms. Walsh on an official movie date a week later. ''He's a really great listener,'' she said, appreciating the careful thought he gave to what she said. ''There was a gentle, reflective, Midwestern pace about him,'' she said of Mr. Prieb, who grew up in Illinois and spent summers with his family in Thailand, where his parents were born.
 But his mellow way was a source of agitation when he gave her a hug instead of a goodnight kiss at the end of the date. ''I wanted to get to know her and not put stress on myself,'' he said. 
 She left the next day for a trip to Tokyo, where her confusion was compounded. ''I got an e-mail saying 'I had a great time at the movie, and I'm moving to Chicago,' '' she said.
 Mr. Prieb had been offered a job that required him to relocate immediately. But he liked her and didn't want to ignore his budding feelings, so he invited her to Chicago.
 ''I thought that was kind of strange,'' she said, since they had gone on only one movie date. ''There was no way I was going to Chicago until I got to know him better.''
 More e-mail messages followed, as did long, easy-flowing phone calls. ''There was no awkwardness or pause or searching for subjects to talk about,'' she said. 
 By February 2004, he was falling for her, but afraid his ardor would be unrequited. He decided to visit her, thinking ''At least I was acting on what I felt.'' 
 Both described feeling anxious ahead of his arrival. But once there, he swiftly put all doubts to rest. ''The first thing I did was kiss her.'' he said. ''It was one of my proudest moments.''
 ''Thanks for getting that out of the way,'' she responded. After a year and a half of long-distance dating, Mr. Prieb moved into Ms. Walsh's New York apartment, and by last May they were engaged. 
 On Jan. 26, they donned kimonos in Tokyo during the first of four wedding celebrations in three countries. Three days later they walked down the aisle, Western style, at the Peninsula Bangkok, where they also had a Thai water ceremony, in which each of their 328 guests poured water from a conch shell over the couple's cupped hands as they sat wearing traditional wedding garb and flower garlands. 
 Finally, on Feb. 8, they made it official at the New York City Municipal Building, where Soraida Burgos of the city clerk's office declared them husband and wife. 
 Afterward, the very married couple headed to the restaurant where it all began. They sat at that same table, sharing dumplings and memories and cherishing the words engraved on Mr. Prieb's wedding band: ''You win some, you dim sum.''

HEADLINE: It's the Mileage That Moves You

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
TESTED 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid 
 WHAT IS IT? Car-based crossover S.U.V. with a hybrid powertrain for better fuel economy.
 HOW MUCH? $27,170 with front-wheel drive, including destination charge. As tested, $31,060 including $2,695 for navigation system and $1,195 for a package with heated front seats and leather upholstery. (All-wheel-drive version starts at $28,920.) A $3,000 federal tax credit is available. 
 WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A 2.3-liter 155-horsepower 4-cylinder engine assisted or temporarily replaced by an electric motor. Batteries are recharged as the Escape is driven. Transmission is a continuously variable automatic. 
 HOW MUCH CAN IT HOLD? Five people in theory, but disharmony is likely unless three are children.
 HOW THIRSTY IS IT? For a small S.U.V., not very. The E.P.A. estimate is 34 m.p.g. city and 30 m.p.g. highway, which compares with 20/26 for a conventional front-drive Escape with a 4-cylinder engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission. In one 608-mile stretch of generally flat Interstate I cruised between 55 and 65 m.p.h. and averaged 29 m.p.g. 
 ALTERNATIVES Saturn Vue Green Line ($25,995) or the Escape Hybrid's close relatives: the Mercury Mariner Hybrid ($27,860) and Mazda Tribute Hybrid ($25,945; sold only in California).
 FORD introduced the Escape Hybrid as a 2005 model and it was a landmark, the first hybrid S.U.V. In addition, it was (and is) a full hybrid, meaning that the electric motor was powerful enough to move the vehicle on its own -- at least for a while. 
 For 2008 Ford has given the Escape a new look, redone the interior and retuned the suspension.
 The interior has a lot of hard plastic, so it feels like a project undertaken by a company desperately trying to save money. That is, of course, exactly the case. In addition to the powertrain, another environmentally friendly feature is what Ford says is standard seat upholstery made of recycled materials.
 As with most hybrids, the key to good fuel economy is a small engine that gets a boost from an electric motor when more power is needed. For 2008 Ford says it tried to make the interaction more seamless, and indeed the electric motor's comings and goings are unobtrusive.
 At times, however, the 4-cylinder works hard despite its little electric buddy. Traveling at 65 m.p.h. through the hills of northern Pennsylvania, I found the gas engine often churning away at 4,300 revolutions a minute, too high for good fuel economy. 
 Over the last decade, Ford has generally turned out vehicles that are responsive and fun to drive. But that Blue Oval magic eluded the '08 Escape Hybrid. It comes across as amenable and competent -- but not dynamically charming.
 Ford boasts that the Escape Hybrid has so much standard safety equipment that ''it bolsters its safety leadership.'' Yet the Escape is one of the few S.U.V.'s that lack -- even as an option -- an important life-saving feature, electronic stability control. Still, it has valuable items like side-impact air bags and air curtains that cover the side windows to provide head protection.
 The navigation system was easy to use and did a fine job of giving directions not just across Pennsylvania to Michigan, but back to New Hampshire through Canada, which is almost like a foreign country. 
 But I found an important feature of the nav system to be a joke. Well, it wouldn't have been a joke had I actually paid almost $2,700. While crossing Pennsylvania, I asked the system to search for hotels. Several times it told me nothing was available within a 40-mile range. Then, two or three minutes later, the little prankster would announce that a hotel was within a mile or two. 
 I finally stayed at a one-year-old hotel that the navigation system didn't know about. I am not ruling out the possibility that I was deluded, but it seems more likely that the system's information was already outdated. 
 Of course, it costs money to buy the newest data, and Ford appears not to have done so. 
 When Ford introduced the 2005 Escape Hybrid it broke new ground. Unfortunately, the automaker didn't continue that tradition with the 2008 update, which comes across not as hot stuff, but as barely warmed-up leftovers.
 Still, there's no denying that for a small S.U.V. the fuel economy is great, which is actually the point.

HEADLINE: A Pollution Scorecard for New Cars

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
A LIST released last week of what are said to be the 12 greenest vehicles sold in the United States includes nine made by Japanese automakers, two by Europeans and only one from the Detroit companies.
 The list was compiled by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a Washington-based nonprofit group financed by foundations, other nonprofit groups, electric utilities and state and federal agencies, as part of its 2008 Green Book Online. The book ranks models from the worst polluters to the most environmentally friendly, by measures including tailpipe emissions, greenhouse gases and fuel economy. 
 The council also tries to take into account environmental impacts like air pollution from manufacturing. However, there are so many vehicles and so many assembly plants that Therese Langer, transportation director of the council, acknowledged that rating individual vehicles required both averaging and estimating. The guide has been released since 1998. 
 The council's greenest vehicles of 2008 largely remain a mix of small cars or hybrids. 
 Honda and Toyota have four vehicles each. The only domestic vehicle is the Ford Focus.
 The greenest of the green is the Honda Civic GX, which runs on compressed natural gas. Honda sells about 1,000 GXs a year, with many going to corporate or government fleets. The Civic GX, like some other highly rated vehicles in the guide, is not available everywhere, and this exclusivity is not always clear in the rankings. (For example, individuals can buy GXs only in New York and California.)
 Four of the top 12 are hybrids. The only midsize sedans are hybrid versions of the Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima (which is available in only a few states), plus the Toyota Prius. The other green vehicles are the Honda Civic Hybrid, Smart ForTwo, Toyota Yaris, Toyota Corolla, Mini Cooper and Mini Cooper Clubman, Honda Civic and Honda Fit.
 The list of worst vehicles includes high-performance sports cars, huge trucks and vehicles with diesel engines. Ms. Langer said there were still many dirty diesels this year. While they may get good fuel economy, the diesels emit too many pollutants, she said. 
 Despite the report's conclusions, all of the light-duty diesel vehicles currently offered in the United States use new technology designed for the low-sulfur fuel that is now available. Diesels are generally not offered in California or other states that follow its emissions rules. Later this year, several automakers intend to offer clean diesels that will be legal in all states.
 The Europeans dominated the mean-to-green list. The worst vehicle was the Volkswagen Touareg with a 5-liter 10-cylinder diesel. Mercedes had the most models on the bad list. There were four, including two that are diesel versions of S.U.V.'s: the ML320 CDI and the GL320 CDI. The other two are the diesel R320 CDI and the high-performance sport utility, the G55 AMG. Robert Moran, a Mercedes spokesman, said the council was ''not seeing the forest for the trees.'' He said the company's diesel engines were very fuel efficient, which is an ''inherently green benefit.'' In addition, he said, this fall Mercedes diesels will use the new emissions system, making them as clean as some gasoline cars.
 He also said that the G55 was a niche vehicle, with only about 500 sold in the United States last year.
 Other European vehicles on the naughty list were the Bugatti Veyron supercar, Lamborghini Murcielago, Bentley Azure and Bentley Arnage RL.
 Domestic vehicles were not left out. The diesel version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee made the list along with the Hummer H2 and the GMC Yukon 2500, both with 6-liter V-8s.
 More information is available at www.greenercars.org. There is a charge for the full report.

HEADLINE: For Rowland, Second Chance Of a Lifetime

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Waterbury 

 BODY:
 THEY say there are no second acts in American life. They also say that you can't go home again.
 You probably don't want to say either of those things around John G. Rowland, the former three-term governor of Connecticut who is trying to resurrect his career as the economic development coordinator for Waterbury, the city where he was born.
 Mr. Rowland was hired for the job by Mayor Michael J. Jarjura, an appointment that didn't make everybody happy. But more on that later. 
 For Mr. Rowland, 50, who assumed his new position on Feb. 1, the challenge is to rehabilitate his home city -- and thus redeem himself. Mr. Rowland resigned his governorship in the face of a corruption investigation in 2004, pleaded guilty to one charge and spent 10 months in a federal correctional institution. 
 On a bitterly cold February morning, as he moved about his hometown, alternately walking or driving his Chevrolet Impala, the former governor expounded on his vision for the city. He stopped and chatted with at least 25 people over a three-hour period, from security guards and nuns to artists and community organizers to old friends and neighbors. He knew all of their names, and they knew his. 
 If there was a cloud hovering over his head, you would never know it. For a politician who was in a federal prison only a year ago, Mr. Rowland is an amazingly hopeful kind of a guy.
 ''It's good to be home,'' he said after exchanging bon mots with a police officer in front of the Palace Theater on Main Street. ''He was two years behind me in school,'' he added, referring to Holy Cross High School. 
 ''This whole area, Main Street, was the pits of the city,'' he continued. ''You can't believe how bad it was. Everything was vacant.'' 
 Now a regional branch of the University of Connecticut sits on the former site of a decrepit department store. Across the street is the beautifully restored theater, a former vaudeville house, with its grand lobby, ornate domed ceiling and plush orchestra seats.
 ''My legacy as governor was UConn and the cities,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''This is my passion. When I was governor, I would call Waterbury the center of the universe.'' During his two-plus terms as governor, investment in the University of Connecticut exceeded $2 billion. And restoring downtown theaters to their old splendor was a special interest of his administration. 
 ''The idea is to get people downtown,'' he said. For that you need something for them to come to, things to do. He cited a need for more restaurants. ''My vision is to have an ESPN Zone in downtown Waterbury,'' he said, referring to the national chain of sports bars. He would also like to see apartments and condominiums lining the blighted Naugatuck riverfront.
 It may not be so easy. Like many industrial towns in the Central Naugatuck Valley that runs along Route 8, Waterbury, once known as the Brass City, has found itself caught in a long, downward economic spiral. The last brass factory closed in the 1970s. Waterbury remains a town of broken windows -- block after block of red brick buildings, begrimed by time. 
 Here and there you see aimless young men in hoodies nonchalanting it on street corners. Waterbury has long been perceived as a dangerous place.
 ''The reality is that it's safe,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''The problem is that perception is reality.''
 Serious crimes are down to their lowest level since 1980, according to the Waterbury Police Department, with sharp declines in homicide and rape. (There were five homicides in 2007, in a city of about 107,000.)
 Even though it has millions of square feet of factory space -- in the sort of unused structures that artists, design firms and dot-com entrepreneurs have transformed throughout the Northeast -- much of the soil around them has been contaminated, from the effluvia of generations of brass production, metal plating and other industrial uses.
 ''The folks you are going to get to live downtown are artist types,'' Mr. Rowland said, but ''the investment cost of bringing the old loft buildings up to code can be high.'' He is working on expediting brownfield projects, an Environmental Protection Agency program that provides seed money for cleanup and reuse. 
 ''It's a work in progress,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''We're hoping to get $75 million statewide freed up for remediation.''
 On the plus side, Mr. Rowland notes, is Waterbury's accessibility. The city sits at the junction of Routes 8 and 84 -- 40 minutes from New Haven and Hartford, an hour and a half from New York. A prime area for development of warehouse-distribution businesses, Mr. Rowland said, is Freight Street, a kind of chain-link-fence no-man's land right at the junction of Routes 8 and 84. 
 Waterbury also has a large pool of skilled and unskilled workers. The downtown area has been designated as an Information Technology Zone, with high-speed hookups. Real estate prices, both residential and commercial, are very affordable compared with, say, Stamford or lower Fairfield County. 
 After two weeks on the job, Mr. Rowland said he is getting 100 phone calls a week, many from developers wanting to buy in while the market is low. Unlike his days as governor, where he wielded a huge checkbook, he now has to rely on his skills at bringing people together and making things happen. 
 Mr. Rowland is being paid $95,000 in his new position, and editorialists around the state have been howling. Some have writtten that Waterbury is the last place on earth he should be working. However, others say that a Democrat in similar circumstances would be appearing on ''Oprah.'' 
 ''It is not about the money,'' said Mr. Rowland, a Republican appointed to the job by a Democratic mayor. ''It's the public service aspect. Absolutely, I think it has qualities of redemption. The city gets a second chance. I get a second chance.''

HEADLINE: Diesel-Sipping Motorcycle For the Marines

BYLINE: By DEXTER FORD

 BODY:
THE United States Marine Corps, legendary for doing more with less, has used dual-purpose motorcycles for scouting, messenger service, convoy control and military police work. 
 But the motorcycles sold today for use on-road and off have a big drawback for military service: they use the wrong fuel. 
 Other American and NATO military machines, from diesel generators to stealth bombers, run on JP-8 to simplify fuel supply logistics. While JP-8, a formulation of jet fuel similar to kerosene and diesel fuel, works fine in those engines, commercially available motorcycles require gasoline. 
 That situation presented an opportunity for Fred Hayes, chief executive of Hayes Diversified Technologies, a military contractor in Hesperia, Calif., that has built specially adapted motorcycles for the Marines and the Army Special Forces for more than two decades. The bikes are modified to run in the harshest environments on earth with special lighting and more rugged suspensions and tires. 
 When the Marines requested a motorcycle that would run on JP-8, other military contractors proposed outlandish turbine-powered machines. But the Marines wanted a bike that would actually work, and soon, at a reasonable cost. Hayes won the contract.
 The resulting HDT M103M1 uses the chassis, a few engine components and all the internal transmission parts of the Kawasaki KLR650, a workhorse capable of anything from daily commuting to Sahara exploring. But the Marine machine's major engine components are all new, built for diesel service.
 The difference was apparent the instant I thumbed the starter button. In place of the gasoline-powered KLR's anxious idle, the Marine machine came to life with the low clatter of a London taxi. 
 In contrast to a gasoline engine, which responds instantly to the throttle, a blip of the twist grip resulted in -- well, not much. It took a good three seconds for anything significant to happen. 
 On a half-hour test ride, the M103M1, though sluggish at first, gathered speed with dogged insistence. The footpegs and handlebars buzz as the engine revs -- the counterbalancer that controls vibration in the stock KLR has been omitted to save weight and reduce complexity. Shifting through the five-speed gearbox gets the M103M1 past 90 miles an hour, a speed it will hold, apparently, until the end of time. 
 One of the great advantages of the M103M1's diesel engine is its efficiency. At a steady 55 m.p.h. it gets 96 miles a gallon, according to Hayes, about twice the mileage of the gasoline engine. 
 This high-mileage machine is also coveted by civilians who crave the fuel economy of the world's only production diesel motorcycle. But being a small, family-run company, Hayes is already working overtime to satisfy the Marines' need for the M103M1. So if you want to pilot this diesel machine anytime soon, your local Marine recruiter is the only person who can help you.

HEADLINE: A Capitalist Jolt for Charity

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
IN the summer of 2005, Miles Gilburne and Nina Zolt had long talks over dinner in their Washington home about what to do next. For more than six years, Mr. Gilburne, a former AOL executive, and his wife, Ms. Zolt, a former lawyer, had supported a philanthropy that used books and online tools to enhance skills of inner-city students.
 The program, which Ms. Zolt directed, had been moderately successful. Students liked writing online about books and sharing their ideas with Internet pen pals, including adult mentors. Many teachers embraced the project, called In2Books, and participating students outscored their peers in standardized tests. 
 Still, the costly venture grew only gradually, classroom by classroom. The couple had put $10 million into the charity, a ''meaningful portion'' of the family wealth, Mr. Gilburne says. ''It was enough money that I did lie awake at night thinking about the size of the checks,'' he recalls. 
 As philanthropy, the couple's efforts, however worthwhile, weren't sustainable. But their vision of using the Internet for communication and collaboration to improve education has taken on a new life -- as a business. 
 Today, the once-struggling venture has morphed into a primarily for-profit enterprise. And the striking transformation of In2Books is emblematic of a larger trend: charities are changing their spots and making use of some of capitalism's virtues. 
 The process is being pushed forward by a new breed of social entrepreneurs who are administering increasing doses of bottom-line thinking to traditional philanthropy in order to make charity more effective. 
 To make a fresh start, Mr. Gilburne attracted like-minded angel investors, and at the end of 2006 the group bought a for-profit company, ePals Inc., to expand on the original mission and support the foundation. The ePals company has grown and now offers classroom e-mail, blogs, online literacy tools and Web-based collaborative projects on subjects like global warming and habitats. 
 EPals says 125,000 classrooms around the world are using at least some of its free tools, reaching 13 million students, and its ambition is to become a global ''learning social network.'' 
 National Geographic is to announce this week that it is investing in ePals, based in Herndon, Va., and will supply educational content for the ePals learning projects. Worldwide distribution should get a lift from Intel, which will soon ship its Classmate laptops, designed for students in developing nations, with the ePals icon on the screens. And ePals is also offered for use on the low-cost computers from One Laptop Per Child, a nonprofit group trying to bring the content and experience of the Internet to children in developing countries worldwide. 
 Various versions of efforts like this are appearing across the philanthropic landscape as business-minded donors, epitomized by Bill and Melinda Gates and their foundation, have treated their charitable contributions more like venture capital investments. They seek programs that can be catalysts for broad changes in fields like health, education and the environment, they measure performance and results, and they encourage nonprofits to become more self-sustaining. 
 Yet to have the greatest possible impact, a further step down the capitalist road is sometimes needed, analysts and others in the field say. Muhammad Yunus, the microfinance pioneer and Nobel laureate, calls this next step the ''social business.'' The goal, according to Mr. Yunus, is to create ventures that more than pay for themselves -- in other words, turn a profit.
 Social business entrepreneurs, he writes, can help ''make the market work for social goals as efficiently as it does for personal goals.''
 PHILANTHROPIES are discovering that for-profit status and financing can be a useful tool. For example, many microfinance lenders, modeled after Mr. Yunus's project, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, aim to make the crossover to profit-making institutions. 
 Mozilla, the nonprofit foundation that developed the open-source Web browser Firefox, decided that it needed a for-profit unit to accelerate its business activities and gain market share against Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The business unit is freer to spend on marketing, charge for software service and technical support, and pay to compete for engineering talent in Silicon Valley. 
 Likewise, Google.org, the search giant's corporate foundation, chose for-profit status to be able to easily make investments in for-profit companies including alternative energy start-ups like eSolar and Makani Power. 
 ''Capitalism is a very mutable, flexible beast, and what we're seeing is social entrepreneurs addressing some of these social challenges in profoundly different ways than traditional nonprofit organizations,'' said John Elkington, co-author with Pamela Hartigan of ''The Power of Unreasonable People: How Social Entrepreneurs Create Markets that Change the World,'' a new book that was handed out last month to attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
 Even among its hybrid peers, ePals has evolved into an unusual combination of a business and a social venture. When Mr. Gilburne and Ms. Zolt established the for-profit arm in 2006, they attracted like-minded investors, acquired ePals Inc. and began hiring talented staff. They gave the original education foundation a 15 percent stake in the ePals company, and its endowment will grow if the business prospers. The nonprofit division is focusing on educational research and bringing technology into classrooms.
 But the company is where the action is. ''This needs to be a large business to have a really significant social impact,'' Mr. Gilburne said. ''We couldn't do what we're doing as a nonprofit.''
 Very few nonprofits get big. Only 144 of the more than 200,000 nonprofits established since 1970 had grown to $50 million or more in revenue by 2003, according to a study published last year by the Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit consulting firm that advises philanthropies. 
 With the rising influence of social entrepreneurs in philanthropy, many nonprofits have sought to generate revenue to become more self-sustaining. But it is still rare for a nonprofit to cross the chasm to become mainly a profit-seeking business, as in the ePals experience.
 ''It's tricky, but it makes sense when the business is highly aligned with the mission of the social entrepreneurs,'' said Jeffrey L. Bradach, a managing partner of Bridgespan.
 As a for-profit business, ePals can more easily attract financing for growth. But outside investors raise the risk that the original social ideals will be lost in a single-minded pursuit of profit. Mr. Gilburne has tried to avoid that pitfall by gathering a stable of angel investors among his longtime business friends, who bring not only money but also a shared belief in the promise of the Internet to improve education.
 The group includes Stephen M. Case, the former chief executive of AOL; Mitchell Kapor, the founder of the early spreadsheet maker Lotus Development and an open-source software supporter; and Yossi Vardi, an Israeli Internet entrepreneur.
 ''None of our investors are interested just in making another financial score,'' Mr. Gilburne said.
 AFTER pooling their money, the angel investors bought the ePals company in December 2006 for an undisclosed price. Mr. Gilburne had watched ePals for years, starting when he was at AOL in the 1990s, and he saw it as the foundation on which to build an educational social network.
 EPals started as a Web-based electronic pen-pal service in 1996, offering point-and-click tools that teachers could use to control how students use e-mail. A teacher in California, for example, set the controls so her class could communicate online only with a class in China that was engaged in a joint cultural exchange project.
 Since the angel investors came aboard in 2006, the ePals work force has more than doubled, to 43, and the company continues to hire. It has improved the e-mail and blogging software and added links to outside resources, like National Geographic's digital library, to its Web-based software for online projects. 
 ''We were a small company with little capital,'' said Tim DiScipio, a founder of the original ePals, who is the chief marketing officer of the revamped company under its new ownership. ''But now we have the resources to really pursue the vision of social learning over the Internet.'' 
 Until last fall, ePals charged $3 to $5 a year for each student e-mail account, but the service is now free. The effect of free distribution was immediate and dramatic. The number of registered users has nearly doubled, to 13 million, since September.
 The growth and ambition of ePals have impressed National Geographic enough to make an investment and forge a partnership.
 ''We're looking at them as a global network to distribute National Geographic content,'' explained Edward M. Prince, the chief operating officer of the venture arm of the nonprofit scientific and educational organization. 
 The ePals team is betting that it can build a worldwide social network in education -- a serious, controlled version of Facebook, for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. ''When markets go digital, they go collaborative and sharing,'' said Edmund Fish, the chief executive of ePals and a former executive of AOL, where he oversaw online education offerings. ''That can happen in education, too. A learning social network is not an oxymoron.''
 Even the basic social networking of ePals e-mail exchanges, teachers say, helps improve writing skills and stirs curiosity about other cultures. Mirjana Milovic, a teacher in Kragujevac, Serbia, says ePals has helped the 120 students in her school with their English-language skills. Their correspondents in Alabama and Kansas have also learned that jeans and Nike shoes are popular in Kragujevac but that the McDonald's in town closed for lack of business.
 ''We usually prefer our domestic food,'' wrote Marija, an 18-year-old.
 Candace Pauchnick, who teaches English and sociology at Patrick Henry High School in San Diego, has been using ePals for what she calls ''virtual field trips.'' In their online exchanges with students in Italy, China and the Czech Republic, her students have learned about family life and political systems in foreign lands and improved their writing skills.
 ''If they were just writing for me, they wouldn't be as careful,'' Ms. Pauchnick said. ''But they're writing for a student in another country. It's not drudgery for them. They buy in and they enjoy it.'' 
 Ms. Zolt, the chief program architect of ePals, endorsed the for-profit route but insisted that the digital network also provide a free searchable database for educational research.
 ''The promise here is to be able to study, with vast amounts of real-time data, how children learn,'' she said.
 Scholars are enthusiastic. ''Its potential is very exciting,'' said Linda B. Gambrell, a professor of education at Clemson University, who is one of the academic advisers of ePals. ''This should help us quicken the pace of translating innovative research into best practices in the classroom.''
 Like many start-up companies, the revamped ePals is still working on its business model. Mr. Gilburne, the chairman, says it will pursue corporate sponsors for certain project areas. These could be part of a company's community and social responsibility activities, providing approved adult experts to help students online. For example, General Electric might sponsor ePals' global warming section by providing environmental experts as online mentors, Mr. Gilburne said, or perhaps Intel or I.B.M. would help in engineering projects.
 There are commerce opportunities, Mr. Gilburne added, for education publishers who might want to market books or curriculum materials for home-school students over ePals.
 Eventually, Mr. Gilburne said, advertising will be part of the mix. ''But we'll go gingerly to figure out what is appropriate and doesn't impose on the classroom,'' he said.
 The failure rate for entrepreneurs -- whether social or purely capitalist -- is high. Still, ePals' backers are betting that it is worth the risk. ''These kinds of opportunities to do well and do good at the same time don't grow on trees,'' said Mr. Kapor, the ePals investor and a philanthropist. ''But I do think that ePals could be one of them.''

HEADLINE: Rent or Buy? It's Complicated

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
PEOPLE who are looking to buy their first homes typically keep renting during slow real estate markets in hopes that purchase prices will drop, and the current market is no exception. But real estate and mortgage industry executives said today's ''rent versus buy'' decision is more complicated than in years past.
 For one thing, mortgage executives say, even people with good credit face difficulties in getting mortgages these days. 
 Matthew Hackett, underwriting manager for Equity Now, a Manhattan mortgage lender, said buyers who need ''jumbo'' loans -- those above $417,000 -- must typically have enough savings after the purchase to carry them through at least six months of mortgage payments. ''And if you want a good rate,'' Mr. Hackett said, ''it's more like 12 months.'' 
 That could change in July, depending on how the lending market reacts to mortgage-related elements of the economic stimulus package signed this month, when the jumbo threshold is expected to rise to about $600,000 -- the exact figure still must be set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
 Banks are not the only ones scrutinizing buyers. Sellers, Mr. Hackett said, are less likely to accept offers from buyers who cannot document their incomes, because they know lenders are reluctant to lend money to such people.
 Prices in the rental market in the New York area have remained steady, according to Lawrence Rich, a vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman, a Manhattan brokerage firm.
 But Mark Obrinsky, chief economist at the National Multi Housing Council, a trade group in Washington, said that rents could rise, given the growing demand among people who cannot qualify for mortgages or those waiting out the declining market.
 That is partly dependent on what happens on the flip side of the rent-versus-buy equation -- those who bought investment or vacation homes and who are trying to decide whether to sell now or rent out their property.
 Mr. Obrinsky said the so-called shadow rental market of unsold homes and condos put up for rent was rising, although no good data exists on the extent of that phenomenon. Nearly 3 percent of the homes currently for sale are vacant, he said, a number that far exceeds historical highs.
 Sam Heskel, the executive vice president of HMS Associates, a real estate appraisal and consulting company in Brooklyn, said he had seen ''a lot of developers changing from condos to rentals, just to weather the storm.''
 Some homeowners are doing the same. Mr. Heskel said he had appraised a home for ''more than $500,000'' in Massapequa, on Long Island. The owner had renovated and had initially planned to sell it for a profit. Now she will try to rent the house until prices rise.
 It remains to be seen, of course, whether inexperienced real-estate investors can graduate into successful landlords. 
 Many investors risked little cash in buying those homes, mostly by taking out adjustable-rate loans that may grow more expensive in coming years.
 And even if, after accounting for the mortgage's tax benefits, the landlord can charge enough rent to cover the mortgage, Mr. Obrinsky of the housing council said, property maintenance costs can run from 1 to 1.5 percent of a home's purchase price.
 ''Most of the time, if you can sell something for more than you bought it for,'' said Michael L. Moskowitz, president of Equity Now, the mortgage lender, ''you're better off selling it and walking away.''

HEADLINE: Serbia Seeks Rioters Who Set Fire to the U.S. Embassy

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo 

 BODY:
Serbia's top state prosecutor said Saturday that the authorities were hunting for the rioters who attacked the United States Embassy and other diplomatic missions last week. 
 ''We are collecting evidence and are identifying the culprits,'' the official, Slobodan Radovanovic, said in a statement. 
 The police said they had arrested nearly 200 rioters involved in Thursday's protests, in which demonstrators, outraged at American support for an independent Kosovo, stormed the United States Embassy in Belgrade and set several rooms on fire. It was the worst violence to engulf the capital since pro-democracy demonstrators overthrew Slobodan Milosevic eight years ago. 
 The missions of Britain, Germany, Croatia and Turkey also were attacked, while looters went on a rampage across the Serbian capital. American officials said nonessential personnel from the embassy had been relocated.
 One person died and 150 were injured. The Serbian daily Blic on Saturday reported the victim was a 21-year-old student who was originally from Kosovo. 
 For the past six days, Serbs have demonstrated across Serbia and Kosovo in an emotional and sometimes violent outpouring of anger at what many regard as the theft, sanctioned by the West, of their medieval heartland. The Serbian government has condemned Thursdays' attacks, calling them the work of ''isolated vandals.'' But Serbia's minister for Kosovo, Slobodan Samardzic, blamed the United States. 
 ''The U.S. is the major culprit for all troubles since Feb. 17,'' Mr. Samardzic told the state news agency Tanjug, referring to the date of the declaration of independence by Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leadership. ''The root of violence is the violation of international law.'' 
 Earlier, he said the torching of United Nations border posts in northern Kosovo by several hundred Serbian protesters reflected ''government policy.'' He indicated that it was part of the Serbian government's wider goal of entrenching its control of the Serb-majority northern part of Kosovo and creating a de facto partition of the territory. 
 That aim seemed to be strengthening Saturday as Serbs in northern Kosovo erected a metal container and hung Serbian flags on electrical posts on a main road between Zubin Potok, a Serbian town, and Mitrovica, a city divided between ethnic Albanians and Serbs. 
 Meanwhile, reports were growing here that Serbian officers were deserting Kosovo's multiethnic police force and pledging their allegiance to the government in Belgrade. The attack on the American Embassy, just days after the attacks at the border between Serbia and Kosovo, has raised alarms in the West that Serbia is fomenting violence in a campaign aimed at making international support for an independent Kosovo untenable. 
 The attack has been condemned by the United Nations Security Council, and the European Union has warned that a failure to stop further violence would damage Serbia's prospects for forging closer ties. 
 While few Serbian analysts say they believe that Belgrade masterminded the attack during demonstrations that were meant to be a peaceful venting of anger against Kosovo's independence, the Serbian defense minister, Dragan Sutanovac, of the Democratic Party, which supports closer ties with the European Union and Washington, has blamed nationalist politicians for encouraging the rioters. 
 Concerns about the government's role also have been fanned by increasingly strident speech from other leading politicians, including Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who helped lead the revolution that overthrew Mr. Milosevic in 2000. But in recent days, the prime minister has co-opted the nationalist language of his former nemesis. 
 The Serbian government is deeply split between the pro-Western president, Boris Tadic, who wants Serbia to join the European Union, and Mr. Kostunica, who is determined not to go down in history as the Serbian leader who lost Kosovo. The scenes of Serbian mobs suit Mr. Kostunica's domestic political aim of punishing the West, analysts said. 
 The prime minister has been abetted by Tomislav Nikolic, the leader of Serbia's far-right Radical Party. Mr. Nikolic had a strong showing in recent presidential elections and has adroitly exploited anger over Kosovo to argue that Serbia should look to Moscow instead. 
 ''We will not rest until Kosovo is again under Serbia's control,'' Mr. Nikolic told the demonstrators on Thursday night as a mob gathered near the United States Embassy. ''Hitler could not take it away from us, and neither will today's Western powers.'' 
 While few doubt that the strident language played a role in stirring the violence, leading Serbian and Western analysts say that it does not appear to have been a premeditated coordinated attack, though they have not ruled it out. 
 Many European and American diplomats have criticized the lack of police presence at the embassy before the attack, suggesting a degree of passive complicity. 
 But officials in Belgrade said that a majority of the attackers were young and drunk, and that the embassy attack did not appear to be well organized. Such a view is backed by the indiscriminate violence on Thursday, including attacks on journalists from Russia, Serbia's most ardent supporter.
 The most widely held view is that the attack was carried out by a fringe of staunch nationalists, many of them poor and from Serbia's rural heartland, whose economic disillusionment, coupled with raw and real anger over Western backing of Kosovo's independence, has boiled over into violent opposition to the United States and the European Union, which are viewed as the architects of the ''false state.'' 
 The rioters, analysts say, are ''the losers of the transition'' -- those who have not benefited from Serbia's transformation since Mr. Milosevic fell in 2000. Unemployment hovers around 21 percent, while Serbia's annual per capita gross domestic product of about $7,400 makes it one of Europe's poorest countries. 
 Misha Glenny, a prominent Balkan expert, argued that the protests had allowed Serbian nationalism and anger over the loss of Kosovo to vent itself. 
 Kosovo's independence has made Serbia's European path more difficult, he said, but attaching Serbia to the European Union will remain the dominant opinion inside the country.

HEADLINE: Working All Corners In a Global Talent Hunt

BYLINE: By KELLEY HOLLAND. 
E-mail: newmanage@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MALTE VON PUTBUS has a mission. As global recruitment manager for the International Finance Corporation, the investment banking arm of the World Bank, he oversees efforts to find new employees around the world. 
 But successfully recruiting, say, a senior investment officer in Rio de Janeiro, an operations analyst in Cairo or an investment analyst in Riyadh can sometimes feel close to impossible. That's because the I.F.C. is facing stiff competition for the most qualified job candidates in many emerging markets. 
 Investment banks are vying for local talent to help them win lucrative corporate finance and merger work. Manufacturing and consumer products companies are also recruiting in rapidly expanding emerging markets. And as these economies develop, local companies are looking for people as well. 
 ''There's a general shortage in the emerging markets,'' Mr. von Putbus said.
 The I.F.C. is not alone as it hunts for recruits in developing economies. Many companies also believe that their best chances for growth lie in these markets. But in many countries, onrushing capitalism is colliding with educational systems and cultures that are still struggling to adapt. As a result, there are simply not enough qualified candidates to go around.
 ''It's very challenging to attract and retain talent in emerging markets,'' said Douglas R. Conant, chief executive of Campbell Soup, which is expanding in China and Russia. ''You'll hire someone, you'll train them and then someone else will offer them twice as much money to join them. There's a limited supply, and there's explosive growth. It's all supply and demand.''
 True, developing countries produce millions of college and university graduates every year. But many of the top graduates choose to emigrate. And many of the rest are not fully prepared to work for multinational companies and organizations, several recruiters and executives said. 
 A report by McKinsey & Company found that in 2003, China had a total pool of 9.6 million young professional graduates with up to seven years of work experience. But then the firm surveyed 83 human-resources professionals who said that fewer than 10 percent of those job candidates, on average, would have all the necessary training, language skills and cultural awareness to work for a large foreign company in nine categories it studied.
 When asked about India, human-resources professionals said they would consider hiring only 10 to 25 percent of the country's roughly 14 million university graduates, for largely similar reasons. 
 Local business schools are ramping up, Mr. Conant said. But for now, some managers are going beyond traditional recruiting tactics and looking for creative ways to land qualified candidates. 
 I found dozens of executives circulating at a project competition held in New York last October by Students in Free Enterprise, a group that promotes socially responsible business leadership. Teams from universities around the world had developed and put into motion community outreach projects, like teaching Tibetans in remote villages how to participate in ecotourism. Then the organization held a competition, known as the World Cup, where the top projects were judged by a panel of corporate leaders. 
 The winning team got the limelight, but all the contestants were able to meet with at least one senior executive. I listened to two students from the National University of Malaysia describe to Michael Polk, president for the Americas at Unilever, a plan for educational day care centers in Kuala Lumpur. 
 William V. Hickey, chief executive of Sealed Air, which makes Bubble Wrap and other packaging, said that his company has had students from the program working as interns in Shanghai and in Mexico, and that some of the Shanghai interns are now candidates for permanent jobs there. 
 ''When you're doing business around the world, it can be hard to find free-market-oriented recruits,'' he said. ''These kids will be talented people in their own countries. Even if they are not working for us, they will be customers or suppliers.'' 
 For its part, Campbell is working closely with members of Students in Free Enterprise at a Chinese university, said Mr. Conant, who is chairman of the organization's board.
 Another strategy is to hire people who are from developing countries and living elsewhere. Sometimes these people can be found at Western business schools and in economic centers like London or New York.
 In response to the hiring challenge, the I.F.C. has introduced a program to reward employees who refer successful job candidates. Mr. von Putbus said that about 20 percent of the corporation's midcareer hires now come through that program. The corporation has also been trying to differentiate itself from the often higher-paying investment banks by stressing that it is an employer with a social mission.
 Mr. von Putbus said he had managed to add roughly 1,000 people to the organization's staff over the last couple of years. But the need for employees -- and the competition for them -- remains strong. ''I hope recruiting will get a bit easier again with what's happening in the financial markets,'' he said. 
 ''There is no miracle solution.''

HEADLINE: From the New Deal, a Way Out of a Mess

BYLINE: By ALAN S. BLINDER. 
Alan S. Blinder is a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He has advised many Democratic politicians.

 BODY:
THE question of the day seems to be this: Are we in, or heading for, a recession? But so much attention is focused on that question that we may be losing sight of an even greater danger: the possibility that powerful headwinds may prevent a strong recovery from any slowdown. 
 Most of the potential headwinds stem from the housing slump and related financial crises that began -- but, unfortunately, did not end -- with the subprime mortgage debacle. Wounded financial markets are supposed to cure themselves: asset prices fall, bargain hunters rush in and markets return to normal. But so far, that doesn't seem to be happening much. Instead, house prices keep dropping, the mortgage-foreclosure problem grows and new strains in the financial system keep popping up like a not-very-funny version of Whack-a-Mole. 
 While the problems are multifaceted, I have several reasons for focusing on just one aspect of the mess: the potential tsunami of home foreclosures. First, it strikes home, literally. Foreclosures throw families -- some of whom were victims of deception -- into the streets. They erode home values, damage neighborhoods and reduce the values of other properties, thereby intensifying the decline in housing prices that underlies many of our current problems. And they might even cut into consumer spending, which would really throw us into recession.
 A second reason is that reducing the wave of foreclosures would mitigate the closely related financial crises in home mortgages and the alphabet soup of financial creations based on them (M.B.S., S.I.V.'s, C.D.O.'s, etc.). If those markets perked up, other beleaguered credit markets probably would, too.
 A third reason for focusing on foreclosures is that we've seen this film before. During the Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress dealt with huge impending foreclosures by creating the Home Owners' Loan Corporation. Now, a small but growing group of academics and public figures, including Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, is calling for the federal government to bring back something like the HOLC. Count me in.
 The HOLC was established in June 1933 to help distressed families avert foreclosures by replacing mortgages that were in or near default with new ones that homeowners could afford. It did so by buying old mortgages from banks -- most of which were delighted to trade them in for safe government bonds -- and then issuing new loans to homeowners. The HOLC financed itself by borrowing from capital markets and the Treasury.
 The scale of the operation was impressive. Within two years, the HOLC received about 1.9 million applications from distressed homeowners and granted just over a million new mortgages. (Adjusting only for population growth, the corresponding mortgage figure today would be almost 2.5 million.) Nearly one of every five mortgages in America became owned by the HOLC. Its total lending over its lifetime amounted to $3.5 billion -- a colossal sum equal to 5 percent of a year's gross domestic product at the time. (The corresponding figure today would be about $750 billion.) 
 As a public corporation chartered for a public purpose, the HOLC was a patient and even lenient lender. It tried to keep delinquent borrowers on track with debt counseling, budgeting help and even family meetings. But times were tough in the 1930s, and nearly 20 percent of the HOLC's borrowers defaulted anyway. So the corporation eventually acquired ownership of about 200,000 houses, nearly all of which were sold by 1944. The HOLC closed its books in 1951, or 15 years after its last 1936 mortgage was paid off, with a small profit. It was a heavy lift, but the incredible HOLC lifted it.
 Today's lift would be far lighter. And a good thing, too, because our government is far more timid and divided than Roosevelt's. 
 Contemporary mortgage finance is also vastly more complex. In the 1930s, banks knew all of their customers, and borrowers knew their banks. Today, most mortgages are securitized and sold to buyers who do not know the original borrowers. Then mortgage pools are sliced, diced and tranched into complex derivative instruments that no one understands -- and that are owned by banks and funds all over the world. 
 But this complexity bolsters the case for government intervention rather than undermining it. After all, how do you renegotiate terms of a mortgage when the borrower and the lender don't even know each other's names? This is one reason so few delinquent mortgage loans have been renegotiated to date.
 Details matter, so here are a few: First, any new HOLC should refinance only owner-occupied residences. Speculators can fend for themselves -- or go into default. Similarly, second homes or vacation homes should be ineligible, as should very expensive real estate. (Precise limits would vary regionally.)
 Third, mortgages obtained via misrepresentation by borrowers should be ineligible for HOLC refinancing, but cases of fraud or deception by the lender should be treated generously. Fourth, as the original HOLC found, not all bad mortgages can be turned into good ones. Where families simply can't afford to be owners, the new HOLC should not be asked to perform mortgage alchemy.
 What about the operation's scale? Based on current estimates, such an institution might be asked to consider refinancing one million to two million mortgages -- proportionately less than half the job of its predecessor, and maybe less than a quarter. If the average mortgage balance was $200,000, the new HOLC might need to borrow and lend as much as $200 billion to $400 billion. The midpoint, $300 billion, is one-seventh the size of Citigroup and would rank the new institution as the sixth-largest bank in the United States. 
 Given current low interest rates, a new HOLC could borrow cheaply and should find it easy to earn a two-percentage-point spread between borrowing and lending rates, for a gross profit of maybe $4 billion to $8 billion a year.
 What about loan losses? A 10 percent loss rate, or $20 billion to $40 billion, spread over the life of the institution, seems incredibly pessimistic. (The original HOLC experienced a 9.6 percent loss rate during the Depression.) So the new HOLC seems likely to turn a profit, just as the old one did. But even if it loses a few billion, we must remember its public purpose: to help the economy recover, not to make a buck. By comparison, the new economic stimulus package has a price tag of $168 billion.
 It is said that history never repeats itself. But sometimes there are sequels. Now is the time to re-establish the Incredible HOLC.

HEADLINE: Once Immune, Utah Is Feeling Economic Dip

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
In the economic boom that thundered through Utah over the last few years, many people saw a kind of perfect chemistry at work. 
 What demographers call Utah's special story -- its population is the youngest in the nation by far and one of the fastest growing, mainly from large Mormon families -- was paying off, melding with a surging engine of growth in Utah's backyard and throughout the world.
 Between November 2006 and November 2007, Utah created more jobs than Pennsylvania, a state five times the population. Construction spiked at the same time as a giant wave of 20-somethings -- another wrinkle unique to Utah, a baby boom echo long after the rest of the country's -- entered the worlds of work, housing and family. 
 But economists, employers and residents now say the very forces that made Utah roar -- in the types of jobs that grew, especially construction and manufacturing -- also pulled the state more firmly into the national and global economic web. And some of the distinctive traits that looked like strengths, like the low numbers of retirees, now seem like chinks in the armor. Retirees, who have flocked to places like Montana and Idaho, are likely to have interest and investment income to spend no matter what happens, while wage earners, who dominate Utah's economy, could suffer in a downturn. 
 Utah's unexpectedly sharp knock is a reminder of how global and local are intertwined and how delicate the balance can be.
 ''We're no longer insulated,'' said Pamela S. Perlich, a senior research economist at the University of Utah. ''Utah still has a special story, but it got blurred by the engine of economic growth.''
 Even as the rest of the nation's economy began stumbling last year, Utah's immunity seemed secure. The global shocks to housing, credit and the stock market would remain distant echoes, many economists said. The dismal picture of boarded-up, foreclosed houses that can be seen in places like Las Vegas or Riverside, Calif., would not happen here, business leaders said with a touch of smugness, because Utah, marching to its own fiscally prudent drummer, had not overbuilt.
 But in December, the number of single-family housing permits issued here fell 32 percent, the steepest one-month decline since 1980, and sales of existing homes plummeted, off nearly 34 percent in the fourth quarter of last year -- the sixth worst record in the nation, according to the National Association of Realtors.
 Job growth projections for 2008 were recently cut by a third, in the state's own analysis, to 2 percent from 3 percent or more only a month ago. New housing starts are expected to fall nearly 60 percent in Utah in 2008, a worse hit than Nevada or Arizona, which have become national symbols of the housing mess, according to a recent national forecast by Moody's Economy.com. 
 Utah does not have the same magnitude of problems that other states are facing, and if history is a measure it will weather a recession better than many other regions. Only twice since the early 1960s, even as the nation endured numerous recessions, has Utah had fewer jobs at year's end than it did the year before.
 People like Dawn Updyke and Rick Draper, who helped bring Utah to its new place, are feeling the effects. 
 Ms. Updyke relocated from Ohio last year when her employer, the packing materials company Third Dimension, opened its first Western outpost in the southern Salt Lake City suburbs. Mr. Draper was local, with roots deep in Utah pioneer history, and took a job as Third Dimensions' plant coordinator. She adjusted to Utah life as the production control manager; he adjusted to having bosses in the Midwest.
 But after 11 months, the company is still at only 30 percent capacity. Finding and keeping employees was a problem in the beginning, Mr. Draper said. Now the bigger problem is demand. The company's biggest customer, the Ohio cabinet manufacturer KraftMaid Cabinetry, which broke ground for a big factory in the Salt Lake Valley in 2005, has struggled to gear up its production and is not buying as many polyfoam and fiberboard shipping boxes as projected.
 ''I don't foresee any large growth as of now,'' Mr. Draper said.
 A spokeswoman for KraftMaid, Kim Craig, declined to comment on the company's projected hiring or production. She said in an e-mail message that the Utah plant, which serves the Western states and Canada, could employ up to 1,300 people, ''when manufacturing reaches full capacity.''
 Historically, the West has moved to a different beat. Manufacturing was never much of a factor to consider, but commodity prices for things like copper and gold were. Government spending on the military -- a huge force through the cold war as cloistered desert bases and depots expanded -- was usually a better economic indicator than the Dow Jones Industrials.
 But the Rocky Mountain region has evolved since the last national recession in the early 2000s. Real estate and construction has increasingly supplanted mining and military. Recreation, with foreign visitors increasingly important, dwarfs ranching. 
 And the wave of affluent retirees, except for Utah's southwest corner in St. George, has mostly gone elsewhere, remaking towns like Grand Junction, Colo., and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. In the five states that are Utah's immediate neighbors -- Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and Arizona -- Utah's economy is least dependent on -- or in a downturn, least helped by -- the ''nonwage'' income that retirees have to spend from annuities and investments, according to Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit research group in Bozeman, Mont. 
 And in what is perhaps the cruelest paradox of all, Utah spends less on health care than its neighbors, according to Headwaters, with healthy habits, fewer old people and abstention from alcohol and tobacco by practicing Mormons the biggest factors. Health care spending is usually one of the most stable sectors of all in a downturn. 
 Economists say the nation's economic turmoil is hitting differently around the country. Parts of the Midwest connected to the auto industry are getting smacked by continued troubles in Detroit, but are expected to be hurt least in the decline of new housing starts in 2008, according to Moody's Economy.com. 
 The Rocky Mountain West, partly led downward by Utah, is expected to have the biggest percentage decline in construction jobs and housing starts this year, while the Southeast is likely to suffer least in total job growth. The Northeastern states, the company's 2008 projections say, will take the biggest hit in total value of goods produced, called gross state product.
 But some important old differences remain in Utah, too. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will spend more than $1.5 billion in Salt Lake City over the next few years on a complete renovation of several downtown blocks. That is going to happen no matter what, said Mark Knold, the senior economist for the Utah Department of Workforce Services. ''The Mormon Church is recession-proof,'' he said.
 And so, it would seem, is Ari Bishop. Mr. Bishop, a 27-year-old sales executive, has ridden the wave of economic life. He went into real estate when Salt Lake City was exploding with growth. He bought and sold a house and had two children with his wife, Bene.
 Now he sells training packages to people learning to work a new growth sector: foreclosures and bank-owned properties. It was boom times here before, Mr. Bishop said, and now boom times again, sort of. 
 ''It's a little different angle,'' he said. ''But we're just going with the market.''

HEADLINE: A Detour to Homeownership

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
IT took Enrico Gomez and Kevin Moore a long time to prepare for homeownership. Four or five years ago, when interest rates sank to historic lows, everyone at work began talking about buying a home, Mr. Gomez said. So he and Mr. Moore began talking about it, too.
 Before they could actually do it, though, they needed to eliminate their debt and save for a down payment. So they hunkered down and bought the guidebook that accompanied Suze Orman's book ''The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom.''
 ''We did those exercises for couples,'' Mr. Gomez said. ''I thought it was corny, but we were desperate, looking down the barrel of credit card debt and not paying attention to dinners and CDs and movie nights and whatever else.''
 The two took the guidance to heart and made drastic financial changes. They sold stock to pay off debt and stuck to a weekly allowance of $140 each for discretionary spending. By last spring, they were ready to hunt for a one-bedroom condo. 
 Mr. Gomez, who is from Phoenix, and Mr. Moore, from the suburbs of Philadelphia, met a decade ago when both were living in Seattle. Five years ago, they moved to a rental in the East Village. Mr. Gomez, a painter, and Mr. Moore, an actor, have day jobs as waiters. They fit right in with the classic joke, Mr. Moore said: ''You're an actor? What restaurant?''
 Their price range began around $600,000, because that was what one-bedroom condos seemed to cost, but fell to around $400,000 once they learned more about common charges, closing costs and general upkeep. 
 They were initially interested in Olive Park in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, near an art studio that Mr. Gomez rents at Metropolitan and Graham Avenues. They could afford the $360,000 for a one-bedroom, but it seemed small and pricey for the lackluster neighborhood. 
 ''We were green, so we weren't really noticing the square footage was low,'' Mr. Moore said. ''We were noticing the price was low.''
 In nearby Williamsburg and Greenpoint, there was no shortage of new condo buildings, but few were affordable. Then they encountered a renovated walk-up building on Montrose Avenue in Bushwick. Refreshingly, it wasn't the usual gleaming glass and metal construction. ''We are more into character than newness,'' Mr. Moore said. The ground-floor one-bedroom had a basement that could house Mr. Gomez's art studio; it also had a yard for their dogs, Scrapple and Roosevelt.
 But Mr. Moore noticed a fuzzy dark spot on a wall. And the basement smelled musty. While they contemplated the purchase, they were told the unit had been taken. A similar unit across the hall, however, was available. They negotiated the price to $435,000 from $445,000. Though this basement didn't smell, they hired a mold inspector anyway.
 The inspector pointed out moisture in the basement. Tests showed an ''elevated mold condition exists.'' Worried, they withdrew their offer. 
 ''This is the warning I got from my friends: 'Don't fall in love with any place,' '' Mr. Gomez said. ''But that's what happened. I was heartbroken. We backed out of the deal, but in my heart I was having a hard time letting go.''
 He decided to explore a place he had stumbled upon earlier in the year. Returning on a red-eye flight from Phoenix, he had taken a taxi home from Newark Liberty International Airport. The driver took a detour through downtown Jersey City.
 There were sunny brownstone blocks filled with ''people walking their dogs and pushing their baby carriages and shopkeepers waving,'' Mr. Gomez said. ''It seemed like Sesame Street. I saw a station called Grove Street and was, like, this is not the Jersey City painted in my mind. I had this image of burned-out buildings and barbed wire.''
 One day last summer, he took the PATH train to Grove Street. For-sale signs were everywhere. ''I didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing,'' he said. ''I don't know if I had this rose-colored expression on my face, but people were actually smiling and saying hi. A lady asked if I was lost and needed help. It seemed so sweet.''
 He spent the day walking and talking, filled with ''that kind of rosy enthusiasm you have when you're new to a place,'' and called home.
 ''We were both kind of depressed, but Rico was happy on the phone,'' Mr. Moore said. ''He said, 'You are not going to believe where I am.' ''
 No way would Mr. Moore ever move to New Jersey. If he did, he wouldn't be able to vote for the mayor of New York. ''One of the beauties of living in the city is I get to vote for the leader, for the person who is going to make New York better than it already is,'' he said. But he wasn't so inflexible that he wouldn't check out Jersey City.
 One of the agents whom Mr. Gomez called, Rachelle Migdal from Weichert Realtors in downtown Jersey City, offered to set up an itinerary and drive them around. In Jersey City, ''you can say, 'This is my price point, around $400,000,' and you actually have choices,'' Ms. Migdal said.
 The couple ended up with three good possibilities. A ground-floor one-bedroom with a nice backyard was near Hamilton Park. But the seller was unwilling to lower the price, which at $439,000 seemed high.
 A one-bedroom for $409,000 on Mercer Street had a separate dining room. But the flight of stairs would be difficult for Scrapple, elderly and arthritic. ''We agonized over it,'' Mr. Gomez said. Should they decline a place on the basis of their dog's health? They decided they should.
 They chose a one-bedroom in Dixon Mills, once the factory where Dixon Ticonderoga pencils were made, converted in 1986 to rental apartments and last year to condos. Four of the five buildings are connected with catwalks. It was different from anything they had seen. 
 They especially loved the Romanesque Revival style of the one free-standing structure: the Ticonderoga building. ''It was a hard decision because there are so many different floor plans,'' and they kept wanting to see more, said Michele Messina, the Dixon Mills sales representative.
 They chose an 800-square-foot one-bedroom for $363,190, with a common charge of around $450 a month. Taxes, not yet determined, are likely to be around the same. 
 A parking spot would be helpful if they ever resold their apartment, Ms. Migdal told them, and in the meantime, they could rent it out. So they bought a spot for $24,000 and then bought an S.U.V. ''It is such an expanded existence if you have a car in New Jersey,'' Ms. Migdal said.
 The two arrived in November. Though Mr. Moore regrets his inability to vote for New York's mayor, he is becoming increasingly interested in Jersey City politics.
 As a touch both decorative and practical, he bought two dozen Dixon Ticonderoga No. 2 pencils and set them in a cup on the windowsill.
 ''We got custom closets installed, and that was thrilling to me because we got to design them and determine what would work best,'' Mr. Moore said. 
 Now, he added, ''we are ribbing each other for being a suburban couple. We go outlet shopping.'' The two often visit his parents in Pennsylvania, where Scrapple swims in the Brandywine River. Roosevelt attends puppy obedience class at the Elks Club in Hoboken. 
 ''That's a great thing,'' Mr. Gomez said. ''We can just throw our ever-growing Great Dane in the back of our S.U.V.''
 The neighborhood ''is a little patchy, a little rough in spots, which is exciting,'' added Mr. Gomez, who plans to hunt for studio space in Newark. ''It's changing and growing and that's cool.''

HEADLINE: Teamwork's Rewards

BYLINE: By DAN SCHULMAN; As told to PATRICIA R. OLSEN. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I WAS born with social activism in my DNA. My grandfather was a union organizer in the garment district in New York City. My mother took me to a civil rights demonstration in Washington in my stroller. My father was worried that I'd be the youngest person to have a photograph in an F.B.I. file.
 My mom was an associate dean at Rutgers, and my dad was a scientist. I rebelled against academics and was drawn to sports instead. I was captain of the football, tennis and lacrosse teams at Princeton High School in New Jersey. 
 When I applied to college, I wasn't accepted immediately because of my grades, so I drove a truck for Princeton University for six months. I was accepted by Middlebury College for the spring semester.
 When I graduated, I struggled with what I wanted to do. I saw an ad for an account executive with AT&T that described the position as the quarterback for the marketing team. I started at the company at the lowest management rank, making $14,200. I tried to negotiate for $16,000, but it didn't work. I had to wear the same suit for three months until I could afford another one.
 Several years later, my sister, who was just 20, died unexpectedly of a brain aneurysm. Her death turned my world upside down. I stopped caring about getting ahead. The project team I was leading rallied around me and ensured that we were successful. When I gave a report to my boss, I told him point blank I was not responsible for the current project's success. It was the team. It doesn't matter how good the quarterback is if the team isn't behind him.
 After that, my career took a whole different trajectory. I found that giving credit to my teammates made my teams much stronger and consequently more successful, which in turn propelled my career. Eighteen years later, by the time I was 39, I was the youngest member of the operating group, the top 10 officers. As president of the consumer division, I supervised 40,000 people.
 I saw that technology was moving from the classic telephone company narrowband service to broadband and the Internet. Priceline.com recruited me after going public, and the company grew from less than $20 million in revenue to over $1 billion. We witnessed the rise of the Internet bubble and then its burst and rebound.
 A couple of years later, Richard Branson called to ask if I'd start a new company using the Virgin brand and focus on wireless technology for the youth market. I realized I could take all I had learned and create something from the ground up. 
 I started the company out of my house in 2001 and then moved to an office with a dead plant in the corner in a strip mall. We now have five million customers.
 Last summer I spent 24 hours on the street in New York with Rick Koca, whose nonprofit, StandUp for Kids, we support. It distributes survival kits and a hot-line number to homeless teenagers. Rick suggested that I see how they live, to know what it's like. I didn't shave for a week and wore dirty jeans, a ragged shirt and a blanket around my shoulders. I couldn't bring a cellphone or watch. If we wanted to eat, we had to beg for money.
 There's a certain amount of deference paid to a C.E.O. No one paid attention to me on the street. I consider myself a good communicator and a good salesman. It took me five hours of begging to raise less than a dollar. My entire concept of what is important changed. Time is usually my most valuable commodity, but for that 24 hours I had too much time. Forget Starbucks and a $4 latte -- I walked two miles to find a 25-cent cup of coffee. We slept on concrete in an abandoned skate park. 
 Being out on the street was a life-altering experience. If more people would get involved, we could all be a powerful force for change.

HEADLINE: Upstate Race Transformed By Interest From Albany

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE

DATELINE: FULTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The chill in the air was biting, snarling across the snow-swept farming towns and old shuttered factories in the north country. 
 Grizzled men in flannel shirts, work-worn boots and jeans stumbled in from the cold, drawing close to the counter at Mimi's Drive Inn, where the talk is just as likely to be about the messy work of muck farming as the messy business of politics.
 And ever since James W. Wright, a Republican in the State Senate, announced in December that he would resign, opening up a seat he has occupied for 15 years, politics here have been messier than ever. The 48th Senate District, in the upper reaches of the state, almost irrelevant in state politics for so long, has become the Fort Sumter of a multimillion-dollar war between Democrats, led by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, and Republicans, for control of the Senate.
 ''Not a day goes by that you don't get mail from one candidate or the other,'' said Chris Sachel, who called himself the ''manager, owner, chief cook and bottle washer'' of Mimi's. 
 He added: ''This place must be important to somebody.''
 Indeed, voters in this icy swath of hinterland along Lake Ontario, including Oswego, Jefferson and St. Lawrence Counties, will have a big say over whether a balance of power shifts in Albany for the first time in 40 years. 
 The Republicans hold a two-seat majority in the Senate. If they lose this seat, their dominance could be seriously imperiled, and the party is already worried about several aging senators who face robust Democratic challengers in the fall. 
 Thus, the no-holds-barred fight for Mr. Wright's seat. The special election to fill the seat on Tuesday pits Assemblyman Darrel J. Aubertine, a Democrat and farmer from Cape Vincent, in the northern part of the district, against William A. Barclay, a Republican assemblyman and lawyer from Pulaski, in the south. 
 Both parties have shoveled millions of dollars into the race, much of it for television and radio advertisements and mailers. Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, has pledged more than $2 million from Senate Republicans for Mr. Barclay. The state Democratic Party has pledged about as much to Mr. Aubertine. Most of the money is coming from outside the district. Of about $722,000 raised by Mr. Aubertine in the latest filing period, 3.5 percent came from within the district, according to the New York Public Interest Research Group, as did 1.4 percent of the $699,000 raised by Mr. Barclay. 
 ''The Republicans have come on lean times in New York in terms of statewide offices and are very worried about the statewide majority,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ''The margins are very slim and can only get slightly slimmer. And looking ahead to November, it starts to become, in what will be a presidential election year and a good Democratic turnout in New York, somewhat worrisome for the Republicans, independent of Spitzer's low standing at the moment.''
 The race has been bitter, with class lines drawn between the bookish and wealthy Mr. Barclay, 38, and Mr. Aubertine, 54, the farmer in jeans who appears in TV ads baling hay.
 On separate occasions in recent weeks, both candidates were at Mimi's, discussing what so far has been the biggest campaign of their lives. 
 ''You don't get into a race like this with the intention on losing,'' Mr. Aubertine said, over a tuna salad sandwich on white bread and a Pepsi. ''It's not a hobby. I bring the same work ethic to this job that I took to the barn with me.''
 Mr. Barclay's father, Hugh D. Barclay, once held the district's seat in the Senate and was also United States ambassador to El Salvador. The younger Mr. Barclay is well known and well liked in the southern part of the district, where eight generations of his family have lived. As a boy he went along with his father, then a senator, to state fairs and watched his father on the stump. 
 With so much riding on the race, he said, it is not surprising that the campaign has been fiery.
 ''I think there is a lot at stake here not only for central and northern New York but for the entire state,'' Mr. Barclay said. ''When you have this much at stake, the pressure increases and you'll see more intense campaigning.''
 Both men said the hoopla has obscured why they are running: to serve their constituents. 
 ''It has not escaped a lot of people, the importance of this race and the impact it could have on the political dynamics of this state,'' Mr. Aubertine said. ''But for me it's not about some power struggle that exists down in Albany or somewhere else in the state. For me this race is about what's going on right here.'' 
 What's going on, he said, is a loss of jobs because of outsourcing, business closings and crippling taxes. Unemployment in the 48th District is among the highest in the state, according to the Department of Labor. The average unemployment in the state in December was 4.7 percent. In Jefferson County, Mr. Aubertine's home county, it was 6.3 percent.
 Mr. Aubertine looks the part of an outdoorsman. He has deep, sun-beaten lines etched in his face and his hands tell the tale of a lifetime's worth of farm work. Six generations of his family have farmed in the Cape Vincent area, and he bought his first farm, next to his family's, at 17.
 He said he and Mr. Barclay had a ''collegial'' relationship. They entered the Legislature on the same day and sit a couple of seats away from each other. Since the campaign began, they have run into each other at pancake breakfasts and chicken dinners at community centers and firehouses in little towns like West Monroe, Hannibal and Waddington.
 Both say they represent the workers, farmers and people who feel disenfranchised in this part of the state, where jobs are scarce, many residents are poor and property taxes are high.
 The similarities end there.
 Mr. Barclay supports abortion rights. Mr. Aubertine is an anti-abortion Democrat. But both described abortion as a nonissue, saying that their working-class constituents care more about creating jobs. 
 Mr. Barclay spends many of his days away from Albany at the Syracuse office of Hiscock & Barclay, a firm with 160 lawyers, where, like his father before him, he is a partner.
 Mr. Aubertine owns Triple-A Farms, where he has raised fallow deer and dairy and beef cows. 
 Each candidate has tried to fault the other as toeing the line for downstate interests.
 ''I think you can look at my record and see what I'm fighting for in the Assembly,'' Mr. Barclay said. ''And I think it fits in nicely with what the constituents of the 48th District want.'' 
 There is no doubt that both men have fought hard to win this election (and have been urged to fight even harder by the party machines). But polls taken in the last week suggest that the men are in a statistical dead heat, a promising sign for Mr. Aubertine, given the lopsided advantage Republicans have in registration: 78,454 Republicans to 46,824 Democrats, with a few thousand independents and third party members. 
 Like the district, the crowd at Mimi's is diverse: laid-off workers, farmers, those lucky to have a job at all.
 Mr. Sachel, the owner, said he was voting for Mr. Barclay. He said he was a ''local boy'' and, though he is wealthy, he is just like everyone else who shows up at the diner.
 ''We're kind of a melting pot of the whole town,'' Mr. Sachel said. ''It's a blend. A lot of factory workers. But a lot of that has gone out. A lot of people lost their jobs. We just hope we get some of these people back to work.''

HEADLINE: Adding Risk (Carefully) to Your Bond Portfolio

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
FIXED-INCOME investors are starting to find that the relative safety of Treasury bonds is coming at a hefty cost. Aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have driven up the prices of Treasury bonds, leaving them with razor-thin yields.
 Lower interest rates might induce some bond investors to diversify away from ultra-safe Treasury bonds, said Tad Rivelle, the chief investment officer at Metropolitan West Asset Management, a firm in Los Angeles that specializes in bonds. But he said moderation should be the rule. ''The theme here is to incrementally increase the risk level of your bond portfolio, without going too far out on a limb,'' he said. 
 Mr. Rivelle advised those who own Treasury bonds, or mutual funds that focus on Treasuries, to diversify fixed-income portfolios with some investment-grade corporate bonds. He now favors those issued by large financial companies, like JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America, which have been buffeted by the financial crisis of recent months. ''The financial sector has largely been repriced because of the credit squeeze, but nobody seriously questions the long-term viability of those franchises,'' he said. 
 Mr. Rivelle also noted that many municipal bonds, which already offer tax advantages, now had excellent yields. But two reasons for those yields, he said, are that ''the finances of most state and local governments will probably worsen'' and that many bond investors were worried about the finances of some insurers of municipal bonds. 
 Because many individual investors would have a hard time knowing the insurance-company risk in a municipal bond fund, he said, this may be a good time to build a portfolio of munis from highly rated issuers. Mr. Rivelle is a co-manager of the firm's flagship mutual fund, Metropolitan West Total Return Bond, which returned 6.5 percent last year, according to Morningstar.
 He said that careful investments in triple-A-rated mortgage-backed bonds, or similar bank loan funds, could be a good way to bolster the yield of fixed-income portfolios.
 Adam Topalian, a fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers, agreed that there were some opportunities in mortgage-backed bonds, specifically ''high-quality mortgage-backed securities that have gotten dragged down with subprime,'' he said. But Mr. Topalian preferred municipal bonds to high-grade corporate bonds now, particularly when held in taxable accounts.
 Martin J. Mauro, a fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, also emphasizes the municipal bond markets. ''The yields on munis are unusually high compared with Treasuries, so munis are attractive for a lot of investors now, not just high-income people,'' he said. In fact, he recommended that investors in the 28 percent federal tax bracket or higher invest 90 percent of their taxable bond portfolios in munis. 
 He noted that there were further tax advantages to owning municipal bonds issued in investors' home states, particularly if they live in high-tax states.
 Another option for those seeking higher yield is to invest up to 10 percent of a taxable bond portfolio in foreign government bonds, he said, particularly those from countries in the euro zone.
 John Donohue, chief investment officer in the fixed-income group of JPMorgan Asset Management, also favors euro zone government bonds; he predicted the European Central Bank would eventually have to cut interest rates.
 ''The fact that they've held out so long might even make the cuts greater later on,'' he said. Bond holders make money when rates are falling, because bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions.
 But Mr. Donohue had some concern about the currency risk of owning these bonds, because the dollar has already fallen so sharply against the euro. A strengthening of the dollar, he said, could cut into profits for dollar-based investors. So he advised individual investors to ask their brokers to hedge the currency risk from owning foreign bonds.
 He also favors keeping a somewhat larger-than-usual portion of a bond portfolio in cash.
 ''You want cash on hand later, if the market gives you opportunities to invest again in things like high-yield,'' he said.
 Treasuries with maturity dates from two to five years generally have yields in the 2 to 2.8 percent range, compared with average yields in the low 3 percent range for money market mutual funds (though some of the top-yielding funds are near 4 percent). 
 Mr. Mauro of Merrill Lynch recommends holding somewhat longer-maturity bonds, ranging from 5 to 15 years, because he says he expects rates to go lower.
 That is largely based on his relatively gloomy outlook for the nation's economy. ''I think we could very well be in a recession now, or if not, soon,'' he said. And he predicted that even after the economy emerged from recession, growth could be relatively weak for some time.
 Mr. Mauro said he thought that the Federal Reserve was far from finished with its rate-cutting. He predicted that it would lower the federal funds rate, now at 3 percent, to 2 percent by year-end, and to 1 percent by the end of 2009. He does not anticipate rising interest rates -- which would hurt existing bond holders -- for a couple of years.

HEADLINE: A Sign Of Hope For Stocks

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FROM at least one perspective, the stock market peak of last October was not accompanied by the speculative excesses found at the height of previous bull markets. This raises hope that the market decline that began in the fall may not turn out to be severe -- and that it may have already run its course.
 The indicator in question focuses on corporate money-raising. Considerable research has shown that when companies turn aggressively to the equity market for their financing needs, through new issues or secondary offerings, it is a sign that the stock market is overvalued. Though there is no easy way to interpret the data, current trends in corporate finance appear no worse than neutral for the stock market's intermediate-term prospects. And the data may actually be painting a bullish picture. 
 Owen A. Lamont, a former finance professor at Yale and now a fellow at its International Center for Finance, has studied shifts in companies' use of the equity market to raise money. He has constructed a gauge, which some have called the new-list indicator, based on the percentage of all publicly traded shares that began trading in the trailing 36 months. This proportion increases as new companies go public or already-public companies issue more shares, and decreases as companies engage in stock repurchases or mergers and acquisitions.
 Professor Lamont, who is also a portfolio manager at DKR Capital, a hedge fund in Stamford, Conn., has calculated the new-list percentage back to 1929. Its all-time high was nearly 15 percent, at the beginning of the Depression. Its second-highest level, almost 11 percent, was in March 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst. (He published these results in 2002 in an academic working paper.)
 Where does the new-list percentage stand now? In an interview, Professor Lamont said it was at 5.1 percent, or right in line with its long-term average. When the market hit its high in October, he said, his indicator stood at just 5.6 percent. That was only marginally higher than where it finished the year, and about half its level at the market top in March 2000. By this measure of speculative activity, the current market is markedly less overheated than it was before the bursting of the Internet bubble. 
 A RELATED and even more encouraging indicator focuses on the relative proportion of new corporate cash that comes from equity as opposed to debt. Researchers have found that in past periods when stocks were overvalued, companies greatly preferred equity over debt. The opposite tended to be the case when stocks were undervalued.
 Two researchers who have studied these patterns are Malcolm P. Baker, a finance professor at Harvard Business School, and Jeffrey Wurgler, a finance professor at New York University. For each year from 1927 through 1996, the professors calculated the share of total capital raised by publicly traded corporations that came from issuing stock -- what they call the equity share.
 Over the 12 months after the quartile of years with the lowest equity shares (when this proportion was no higher than 14 percent) the stock market returned an average of 14 percent, according to the professors. In contrast, the market had an average net loss of 6 percent following the quartile of years with the highest equity shares (when this proportion was no lower than 27 percent). Their results were published in the October 2000 issue of the Journal of Finance.
 Where does the equity share stand now? In an e-mail message, Professor Wurgler said it was 6.1 percent for 2007 through September, the latest date for which data are available. Because this puts the current market solidly in the quartile of past years that were followed by above-average returns, he says the data are sending ''a bullish stock market signal.''
 In separate interviews, he and Professor Baker hastened to add that this bullish signal by no means justifies throwing caution to the wind. They pointed out that companies have had far easier access to cheap debt financing in recent years than they did in earlier decades. As a result, they argued, the current low equity share may not be strictly comparable with similarly low previous readings -- and thus may not be as bullish as it otherwise would appear.
 But judging from how companies have been raising new money, Professor Baker said, there was little evidence of extreme levels of speculation at the recent stock market high. At least to this extent, he said, this means that ''there is less downside risk in the market today than there was in March 2000.''

HEADLINE: Come Back, Little '50s, Even With The Clouds

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
THIS spring at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center a young, radiant and unmistakably American woman will proclaim proudly in song that she is ''as normal as blueberry pie.'' And when audiences listen to Kelli O'Hara deliver this assertion as Nellie Forbush in the musical ''South Pacific,'' they will most likely believe, at least for that moment, that all-American normalcy is a wonderful state of being.
 That was presumably the feeling in April 1949, when Nellie first trilled from a Broadway stage the joys of being corn fed, healthy and hopeful. Embodied by Mary Martin, the spunky sweetheart of the American musical, Nellie seemed like an emblem for the decade to come in the United States, a nation stretching its muscles and feeling its oats after emerging victorious and newly powerful from World War II.
 Which happens to be the era on which Broadway is lavishing much of its attention this season, with revivals of at least three major plays from the 1950s, two new musicals inspired by movies set in the 1950s and, as a bright centerpiece, the first full-scale Broadway revival of ''South Pacific'' since it ended its long maiden run on Jan. 16, 1954. 
 But theatergoers who crave heaping helpings of comfort food from the days when voters liked Ike and father knew best are likely to go away hungry. If the first of these productions to arrive -- the Manhattan Theater Club's loving but clear-eyed revival of William Inge's ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' which opened last month -- is any indication, the 1950s will be recalled less as a land of sunshine than one of shadows. Even Nellie Forbush, in case you've forgotten, was forced to acknowledge that cockeyed optimism can lead to blindness.
 It's rare that the New York theater demonstrates the kind of thematic convergence that it's showing in the second half of its 2007-8 season. Trends on Broadway in recent years have tended to spring from purely (some might say cynically) commercial motives. Shows inspired by popular movies; musicals assembled from Top 40 songbooks; plays starring actors with little stage experience but lots of exposure via tabloids and television: these fads are all rooted in the belief that brand-name familiarity reduces the daunting risk factor of producing on Broadway.
 Yet now Broadway is delivering the square center of the 20th century: a decade that has not, to my knowledge, been identified in marketing surveys as one that audiences are dying to shell out big bucks to relive. And not only is Broadway offering a full slate of 1950s-style offerings, it is also, unusually, in sync with the trends in clothing that have been walking the runways in recent weeks. What gives?
 On the surface there is an obvious answer. When life gets messy -- as it definitely seems to be in a country shadowed by explosive foreign entanglements and a possible recession -- people long for tidiness. And the mainstream dramas of the 1950s are, for the most part, as neatly tailored and unassuming as a cloth coat worn by Pat Nixon, the vice presidential wife for most of that decade.
 There is something reassuring about the visibility of the dramaturgical seams in this impeccable production of ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' starring the excellent S. Epatha Merkerson. This low-key portrait of a middle-class Midwestern marriage lets you know that it was written according to strict and orthodox rules as to what a play should be.
 As the introduction to a published version of a later Inge work, ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs,'' has it, attending one of his plays is ''like going next door to call on a well-liked neighbor.'' But audiences are in for a surprise: ''William Inge the playwright, like William Inge the gentleman from Kansas via St. Louis, uses his good manners for their proper dramatic purpose, which is to clothe a reality that is far from the surface.''
 Those words, by the way, were written by Tennessee Williams, the dominant American playwright of that era, whose ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' (1955), his biggest commercial hit during his lifetime, opens next month in a revival starring Terrence Howard and James Earl Jones. 
 Williams's affectionate appraisal of Inge elicits another trait common to the dramas of the 1950s, including his own: a strong sense that mendacity -- to use the watchword of ''Cat'' -- begins at home, among families that seem pretty and happy only from a distance. In a decade of unprecedented prosperity, when television shows like ''Leave It to Beaver'' portrayed housewives happily vacuuming in pearls and starched skirts, Broadway and the grittier, smaller Hollywood movies of the middle of the decade were probing the raw spots among those who failed to measure up to the gleaming ideals of domesticity.
 This examination process was jumpstarted by the two great American dramas of the early postwar years, both from the late 1940s: Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' and Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' two very different but equally harsh portraits of shattered illusions.
 I don't think of Miller and Williams as ''1950s playwrights''; their work is too big to be confined to period-piece pigeonholes. But they set the tone for many of the studies in disenchantment by lesser, more sentimental writers who followed, including Inge (school of Williams) and Paddy Chayefsky (school of Miller). The latter's television dramas and screenplays about blue-collar folks under strain included ''Marty'' and ''TheCatered Affair,'' which has been adapted by Harvey Fierstein and John Bucchino as a musical starring Faith Prince and Mr. Fierstein, opening on Broadway in April. 
 ''A Catered Affair,'' set in the Bronx in 1953, measures the toll taken by a working-class couple's disagreement over whether to give their daughter a fancy wedding they can't afford. ''Little Sheba,'' ''Cat'' and Clifford Odets's backstage drama ''The Country Girl'' (also opening in April in a production directed by Mike Nichols and starring Morgan Freeman, Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher) are all centered on men who turn to drink to numb the sting of failure. They all also consider, to sometimes subversive effect, the traditional balance of power within families, particularly between husbands and wives.
 Perhaps when the outside world seems unbearable and uncontrollable, it's natural to refocus on life at home, where problems, if exposed, might at least have a chance of being solved. Certainly a taste for vintage domestic drama has already surfaced with the popular ''August: Osage County,'' Tracy Letts's super-size dysfunctional-family soaper, which, as a friend of mine put it, gives you ''five William Inge plots for the price of one.'' And the new Off Broadway musical ''Next to Normal,'' which opened this month, sets the tribulations of a fractured American family to a power-ballad beat.
 As for theatergoers for whom a return to the fraught home fronts of the '50s feels like putting on a straitjacket, there's always ''Cry-Baby,'' an adaptation of John Waters's 1990 movie about how the rock 'n' roll spirit rips apart staid old Baltimore in 1954. Think of it as a signal of the sexual revolution to come, which Broadway will also pay tribute to this season with the revival of Marc Camoletti's ''Boeing-Boeing,'' a French farce about a triple-timing swinger (who juggles affairs among three stewardesses) from the early 1960s. And the Public Theater has promised to restage this summer its fleetingly seen revival (from last summer) of the decidedly uninhibited tribal-love-rock musical ''Hair,'' first produced seven years and a cultural millennium after the 1950s ended.

HEADLINE: Maybe Microsoft Should Stalk Different Prey

 BODY:
OVER the years, Microsoft has pummeled countless rivals, including the superheavyweight I.B.M. But it has never faced a smaller foe as formidable as Google. The tale of the tape gives Microsoft a $100 billion advantage in market capitalization, but it counts for little: Google appears to be its superior in strength, speed, smarts.
 Having exhausted its best ideas on how to deal with Google, Microsoft is now working its way down the list to dubious ones -- like pursuing a hostile bid for Yahoo. Michael A. Cusumano, who has written several books about the software industry and about Microsoft, is not impressed with Microsoft's rationale for its Yahoo offer. He said the bid seemed to be a pursuit of ''an old-style Internet asset, in decline, and at a premium.''
 Determined to match Google in search and online advertising, Microsoft has managed to overlook a plain-vanilla strategy, the oldest one in the book: build on its own strengths. What it does best is to sell software to corporations, for all sorts of applications, visible and not so visible, at a handsome profit. 
 If Microsoft thinks this is the right time to try a major acquisition on a scale it has never tried before, it should not pursue Yahoo. Rather, it should acquire another major player in business software, merging Microsoft's strength with that of another. This is more likely to produce a happier outcome than yoking two ailing businesses, Yahoo's and its own online offerings, and hoping for a miracle. 
 For an illustration of how Microsoft could select targets more judiciously, Mr. Cusumano, who is a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pointed to the Oracle Corporation's strategic acquisitions and its prudent use of capital to ''roll up firms with similar products and customers to its own.'' With impressive regularity -- 13 strategic acquisitions in 2005, another 13 in 2006 and 11 in 2007 -- Oracle has picked up key products and customers while avoiding an ''oops'' slip, venturing too far away from its core business, or paying too much. At no point along the way has it acted in a fit of desperation.
 Last month, Oracle pulled in another major prize, BEA Systems, a leading software company, for about $8.5 billion. You've probably never heard of BEA: it's doubly obscure, producing the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that large companies use to build behind-the-scenes software systems for their entire business, or ''enterprise software.'' Both Oracle and BEA are based in Silicon Valley, but their side of the street is not lit by klieg lights and does not get the same attention as the Googles and Yahoos.
 And, to be honest, it's not much fun hanging out on the enterprise side of the software business. BEA says its software helps organizations ''ensure that business processes are optimally defined, managed, executed and monitored.'' Unless you're playing Business Jargon Bingo, it's hard to sit still and remain attentive. You have to admire Oracle's ability to remain focused on the business that serves business and to not be distracted by the buzz of the Web crowd gathered across the street. 
 Microsoft does business software well. Approximately half its revenue comes from business customers for its e-mail infrastructure, database systems, developer tools, Office productivity applications and other mainstays. It has also assembled, through acquisitions, a fledgling line of enterprise software that it calls Microsoft Dynamics. Microsoft would like Dynamics to be viewed as competing head to head with the No. 2 name in enterprise software, Oracle, or the No. 1, SAP of Germany. For the moment, however, Microsoft Dynamics' parity with those big names is nothing more than wishful aspiration.
 Professor Cusumano has a suggestion: Rather than acquire Yahoo, Microsoft should pursue SAP.
 It's not an outlandish idea. The two companies held merger talks in late 2003, and perhaps since then, too. Microsoft is in an enviable position: it is a nearly universal presence in corporate data centers, and large enterprise customers are arguably the best customers a software company can have. Clients pay very dear prices for the complex, semicustomized software that runs their business. And once they've got their systems running -- a process that can take years to complete -- they aren't inclined to change vendors lightly. 
 A few dozen well-paying Fortune 500 customers may actually be more valuable than tens of millions of Web e-mail ''customers'' who pay nothing for the service and whose attention is not highly valued by online advertisers. 
 Today, SAP's market capitalization is about $59 billion, and a sizable premium to get a deal done would send its price well north of that. Microsoft cannot put both SAP and Yahoo in its shopping cart, deals that together might run well over $120 billion. Microsoft must pick one or the other.
 Suppose that Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, were the head of Microsoft and was doing the shopping. Which deal would he choose? Past experience suggests that it would not be Yahoo. That acquisition would bring little but duplication headaches -- and no large enterprise customers.
 It's amusing to note that the most Larry-like choice, Microsoft's acquiring of SAP and leaving it alone as an autonomous division to avoid a cross-cultural integration fiasco, is the course that would be most discomfiting to Oracle. Frank Scavo, president of Computer Economics, an information technology research firm, in Irvine, Calif., said that ''a Microsoft-SAP combination would be Oracle's worst nightmare.''
 Google would not be happy with a conjoined Microsoft and SAP, either. It has made a pro forma expression of its own opposition to a Microsoft-Yahoo merger, but we can speculate that it may be cheering that deal on. Working in Google's favor are the hostile nature of Microsoft's bid, the colossal potential for integration problems, and organizational paralysis in, and exodus of talent from, Yahoo. 
 But were Microsoft to turn and head in SAP's direction, Google would have reason for concern. Whatever strengthens Microsoft is bound to influence, later if not sooner, its continuing competition with Google. For its own part, Google is keen to expand its foothold inside large companies. Last year, it acquired Postini, whose software filters corporate e-mail. Google has not done so well with corporate customers on its own, however. Google Apps has conspicuously failed to win adoption quickly. 
 If Microsoft is to rededicate its attention to its most valuable assets, business customers, a prerequisite is dropping its ill-advised bid for Yahoo. And to find the best acquisition strategy, ask, ''What would Larry do?''
 If Microsoft tries to fight Google with wobbly legs, scared witless, it will lose.
