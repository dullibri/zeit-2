HEADLINE: Wall Street Paychecks May Wither

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
It is one thing when the best-paid people seem to be the smartest and the most accomplished. Those who make much less may not like it, but the differential seems understandable. It is another thing when those people are shown to have committed huge blunders that would have driven their companies out of business, and them into the unemployment line, but for government bailouts.
 So it is now with Wall Street. In both Europe and the United States, antipathy toward the bailout is rising amid complaints that the money has not helped the economy by encouraging loans, but has kept the bankers in Champagne and caviar.
 Are financial workers overpaid? And if so, will it continue? 
 The answers, according to a new study by two economists, are yes, they are overpaid, and no, it will not last.
 ''Wages in finance were excessively high around 1930 and from the mid 1990s until 2006,'' wrote Thomas Philippon of New York University and Ariell Reshef of the University of Virginia, in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper released this week, ''Wages and Human Capital in the U.S. Financial Industry, 1909-2006.'' 
 They forecast that up to half the wage differential observed in recent years ''can be expected to disappear.''
 They won't disappear overnight, of course. The sad story of how Merrill Lynch bosses handed out bonuses just before the Bank of America takeover was completed -- and just before about $15 billion in losses materialized from Merrill's portfolio -- reinforces the suspicion that Wall Streeters see themselves as entitled to outsize paychecks even if their companies are failing. 
 But even in the Depression the adjustment took time. The professors calculate that relative financial wages, taking into account education and other demographic factors, declined sharply in the 1930s and then at a slower pace until about 1980, when there was virtually no difference. Then, in a new era of financial innovation, ''The financial sector became once again a high-skill, high-wage industry,'' Mr. Philippon wrote on the N.Y.U web site this week.
 It may be no accident that New York City, the country's financial capital, went broke in the 1970s as financial industry wages approached their low point. Nor is it surprising that Manhattan real estate prices soared in the 1990s and early in this decade, as multimillion-dollar Wall Street bonuses pushed up demand for high-end apartments. If relative wages are set to decline, the pain in New York could be greater than in other regions.
 The authors offer several reasons why financial salaries soared in the 1920s and again since 1980. It isn't computers, they argue, because there were no computers the first time, and it is not just a strong stock market. Instead, they attribute it in part to strong demand for financial analysis at a time when technical revolutions were leading to an explosion of new stock offerings and loans to young and risky companies. Before 1930, that was the electrical revolution. More recently, it was information technology.
 There is also the lure of increasing financial innovation, which they say is least likely to occur when there is more regulation. ''Highly skilled labor left the financial sector in the wake of Depression-era regulations, and started flowing back precisely when these regulations were removed.''
 The authors note that risky debt was popular in the 1920s, then all but disappeared until the 1970s brought junk bonds. Such debt, they note, is used to finance companies with high growth potential, but skilled analysis is required.
 ''This explains the dynamics of rating agencies, which were important players in the interwar period, small and largely irrelevant in the 1950s and 1960s, and growing fast from the 1970s until today,'' they write.
 By the peak of the credit boom, rating agencies were essential to financial innovation; they had developed models that somehow proved that there was little risk for investors who put up most of the money for very risky loans. The models turned out to be very wrong. 
 As a result of the current crisis, much of that innovation now seems foolish or even criminal. Without the innovation, banks could never have issued subprime mortgages with teaser interest rates that would later soar. Nor could such mortgages have been bundled into securitizations financed largely by AAA-rated investments.
 Nor could regulators have been persuaded that the banks' own risk models should be used to evaluate the safety of the banks. ''In retrospect,'' the authors write, ''it is clear that regulators did not have the human capital to keep up with the financial industry, and to understand it well enough to be able to exert effective regulation. Given the wage premia that we document, it was impossible for regulators to attract and retain highly skilled financial workers.''
 ''Of course,'' they add, ''regulators will be able to hire cheap skilled labor in 2009, just as they were able to in the 1930s.'' 
 Just how much the demand for financial innovation will fade is unclear, of course. ''These things come in waves,'' Mr. Philippon said in an interview. ''If for the next 10 years, we go back to a '60s-style economy, where big firms make investments without taking too much risk, finance will shrink.'' But, he added, if the green revolution, alternative energy and biotech ''turn out to be like electricity, then we will need them.''
 He is convinced that less financial innovation could be good for a time, and that this crisis has shown to all that much more regulation is needed. ''Some of the financial innovations we have seen are obviously inefficient,'' he said. ''A good chunk of innovation has to do with tax and regulation arbitrage. That is really a waste for the society.''
 And, he added, the society could benefit from a flow to other industries. ''As a society, do we want to put a third of our best brains in the financial sector?'' he asked, pointing to a study indicating Harvard graduates from the early 1990s were far more likely to go into finance than were those who had graduated a decade earlier.
 That generation has grown accustomed to the idea that investment banks, not to mention hedge funds and private equity funds, pay far better than companies in other industries. There is no guarantee that at least some of the advantage will not continue, but as I read the study, I recalled a passage from the recently published history of Goldman Sachs, ''The Partnership,'' by Charles D. Ellis.
 ''Goldman Sachs was fighting for its life all through the Depression and World War II and was profitable in only half of the 16 years from the 1929 crash to the end of the war,'' Mr. Ellis wrote. ''Most of the partners owed the firm money because their partnership income was less than the moderate 'draws' that their families needed to get along.''

HEADLINE: State Jobless Rate Soars; Benefits Extension Seen

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Unemployment in New York State rose last month at the fastest pace on record, as some companies laid off workers at a rapid clip while others refrained from their usual hiring around the holidays, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday. 
 The state's jobless rate, which is adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, was 7 percent in December, up from 6 percent in November, according to the report. That increase -- the largest in any month in 32 years of state record-keeping -- will set off another extension of benefits for many New Yorkers who have been looking for work for more than half a year, labor market experts said.
 New York City's unemployment rate, after seasonal adjustments, rose even more, jumping to 7.4 percent from 6.3 percent, the Labor Department said. The city's count of private jobs declined by 8,500 in December, compared with a normal increase of almost 20,000 jobs in that month.
 ''We have a job market that has markedly deteriorated,'' said James P. Brown, who analyzes employment trends in the city for the State Labor Department. ''Employers are nervous enough about the situation that they are pulling back from normal patterns of hiring. And that's beyond the industries, like banks and brokerage firms, that we know are downsizing.''
 The national unemployment rate, which, at 6.8 percent in November, was considerably higher than the state and city rates, rose to 7.2 percent in December.
 ''While New York State lagged the nation in entering the recession, we are catching up with a vengeance,'' said James Parrott, deputy director and chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group.
 Across the state, more than 670,000 people were reported as unemployed in December, a record one-month increase of 89,800 from November. More than 500,000 New Yorkers are currently collecting unemployment benefits and about half of them have already exhausted the standard allotment of 26 weekly checks. 
 Those who failed to find work before their standard benefits ran out have been able to collect up to 20 weeks of additional benefits. Now that the state's unemployment rate has averaged more than 6 percent for the last three months, an additional extension of 13 weeks of benefits will become available on Feb. 22, according to Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for the unemployed.
 That extension will help thousands of New Yorkers who have already used up 40 weeks of benefits, but it will also put additional strain on the state's insolvent unemployment insurance fund. The state has been borrowing about $90 million each week this year from a federal fund to cover the shortfall in the unemployment fund.
 State officials project that the fund's deficit will grow to more than $2.5 billion by the end of 2010 unless changes are made to the relatively low payroll tax system that feeds the fund. On Thursday, labor unions and advocates for low-wage workers called for legislation to overhaul the system and increase unemployment benefits. New York's maximum weekly unemployment benefit of $405 is lower than those of all of its neighboring states.

HEADLINE: Profit Decline at Nokia Comes With a Warning

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, sharply lowered its industry sales forecast on Thursday as it announced declines in profit, job cuts and a rare dividend reduction.
 The company, based in Espoo, Finland, said it expected the volume of handsets sold globally this year across the industry to fall 10 percent in 2009 from the estimated 1.18 billion handsets sold last year. Last month, Nokia had forecast a 5 percent decline this year.
 Nokia's outlook was more pessimistic than that of Ericsson, the Swedish maker of wireless networking gear. Ericsson said Wednesday that consumers were more likely to give up their fixed-line phones than their cellphones to save money amid the current downturn. 
 The Nokia chief executive, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, said the company planned to cut an unspecified number of jobs this year and trim expenses. Nokia employs about 128,000.
 For the first time since 2001, and only the second time since it entered the handset business, Nokia cut its dividend. The 2008 dividend will be 40 euro cents a share, down from 53 cents.
 ''These are challenging times,'' Mr. Kallasvuo said. ''We are seeing a truly global downturn, one that crosses all geographies and industry segments.''
 Profit for Nokia fell 69 percent, to 576 million euros, or $748.8 million, in the fourth quarter. Sales fell 19 percent to 12.7 billion euros. In its core handset business, Nokia's sales fell 27 percent, led by double-digit declines in Asia, North America and emerging markets.
 ''The warning of a worsening situation was not expected,'' said Mats Nystrom, an analyst at SEB Enskilda Bank in Stockholm. ''What we don't really know at this point is whether this is temporary or a bottomless pit.''
 Nokia shares fell 9.9 percent.
 Beside slowing global demand for handsets, Nokia is struggling to sell high-end smartphones as rivals Apple, Research in Motion and HTC gain market share at its expense, especially in the United States.
 Nokia said the global volume of smartphones it sold during the fourth quarter fell 32 percent. Its global share of the handset market over all fell to 37 percent in the fourth quarter, from 40 percent a year earlier.
 ''I think part of Nokia's trouble is the global environment, but another is a problem of its own making, namely that its smartphone lineup has been fairly lackluster,'' said Neil Mawston, director of global wireless practice at Strategy Analytics, an industry research firm, in London.
 Nokia had recently helped its global market share by outpacing competitors in fast-growing economies like China, India, Latin America and in southeast Asia. But the global slowdown has caused many emerging-market currencies to decline steeply against the dollar and euro, eroding consumer buying power.
 The volume of handsets Nokia said it sold in China plummeted by 36 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Volumes also fell by 23 percent in the Middle East and Africa and by 20 percent in North America.
 Still, Nokia is in good company. On Friday, Sony Ericsson, a handset maker owned by Sony and Ericsson, the Swedish mobile network equipment maker, reported a loss as quarterly sales for the venture plunged 24 percent. Ericsson announced plans to cut 5,000 jobs, about 6 percent of its work force, but posted a better-than-expected profit, even as it fell 31 percent.
 Rick Simonson, Nokia's chief financial officer, said he expected the industry decline to be more severe in the first half of the year than the second, but added he did not think the downturn would be short-lived. ''We do not expect a quick snap-back,'' Mr. Simonson said.

HEADLINE: Boise Region Grapples With Smog, a Growing Threat

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho 

 BODY:
The Caldwell Express sprints between this high-desert capital and its outermost exurb. The express bus seats 40 people, but sometimes it is standing room only for the 23-mile trip. And there is no reason to wait for the next bus: the Caldwell Express runs each way just once a day. 
 ''If you don't make it,'' said Sonia Johnson, waiting at one of the main downtown bus stops on a recent day after work, ''you're toast.'' 
 Despite the limited system, public transportation is taking on a greater role in Boise, with ridership way up. And remarkably for this once unspoiled corner of the West, it is not just volatile gasoline prices that have gotten people out of their cars. Air pollution, and longterm economic concerns, are playing a major role.
 After years of growth and suburban development, the region that includes Boise and its suburbs, known as the Treasure Valley, is on the brink of violating federal clean air standards, and experts say the only real solution is one that might seem awfully un-Idahoan: persuading people to drive less.
 ''We're encouraged to ride the bus to keep pollution down and to keep costs down,'' said John Hurst, 63, who has commuted to work in Boise on the Caldwell Express since the route was established four years ago.
 As the region struggles economically along with the rest of the nation, the declining quality of its air threatens to undermine central aspects of its formula for economic growth. The Treasure Valley's sales pitch has long been that it is a quiet, clean and less restrictive place to live and do business. 
 The population of the Treasure Valley has doubled, to more than 600,000 people, over the last two decades, growth built largely on the region's combination of sun, mountains and semirural appeal. Along with the people, however, has come traffic congestion, particularly on the region's sole expressway, Interstate 84, which links Boise to suburbs like Caldwell and Nampa that border dusty ranch land and sagebrush. 
 Auto emissions have risen, as has pollution from the increased business activity. In turn, the region's distinctive weather patterns, called inversions, often trap polluted air in the valley. 
 Faced with the prospect of expensive and unwanted federal regulations, some local leaders, including conservatives not typically drawn to environmental issues, are exploring unconventional ways to keep the federal government at arm's length by getting cars off the road.
 The suburb of Nampa is considering letting city employees move to a four-day workweek. Caldwell recently adopted a policy requiring city employees to scrape ice from windows rather than let city vehicles idle to warm up. Employees also are encouraged to walk on city errands. 
 The initial goal of some of these policies was to reduce fuel costs, but now that gas prices have come back down, emissions must still be addressed, officials said.
 ''We don't want a yellow alert permeating the news and drawing attention,'' said David J. Ferdinand, chairman of the county commission in Canyon County, referring to a layer of smog that had settled over the Treasure Valley on a recent winter weekday.
 East of Canyon County, in more liberal Boise, local officials are considering a streetcar line downtown, and there is talk of one day converting a rail freight line for commuter use.
 The relationship between traffic and the region's struggle to control ozone crystallized last summer, when gas prices were more than $4 a gallon. People suddenly began leaving their cars at home, choosing instead to use the region's limited bus system and, in the process, shrink the number of so-called vehicle miles traveled by as much as a 9 percent. That, coupled with favorable weather, led to notably lower ozone levels than the summer before. 
 ''We went from a year that was terrible to a year that was great, and the only variables were weather and vehicle miles traveled,'' said Leonard Herr, the air program manager for the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. 
 Along with this apparent evidence that driving less really can improve air quality, a change in state law has also added pressure on the region to change. The measure, passed last spring, requires local governments in the Treasure Valley to have vehicle emissions testing or find other ways to reduce auto emissions. More than a decade ago, the federal government began requiring Ada County to test auto emissions. Ada County officials have urged their more conservative and less affluent counterparts in Canyon County to join them, but local residents there largely oppose testing.
 ''They think it's government interference,'' said Mr. Hurst, the bus rider from Caldwell. ''They feel like they still live in the country and that they don't have pollution.'' 
 Given the public resistance to emissions testing, Canyon County leaders are hoping to cut emissions through efforts like the four-day workweek proposed in Nampa, promoting no-idling policies or perhaps requiring the trapping of fuel vapors at gas stations. 
 Canyon County is not alone in its skepticism. Gov. C. L. Otter, a Republican, made no mention of public transportation in his lengthy discussion of transportation challenges during his State of the State address this month. 
 And the Republican-controlled Legislature, where rural, antigovernment interests have strong influence, has so far refused to give growing cities like Boise and its suburbs the power to impose special taxes, common in other states, to raise money for things like public transportation.
 Whether the Legislature eventually shifts its position or not, experts say the Treasure Valley must change its habits if it hopes to hold on to its distinctive appeal in the changing West.
 ''Idaho's always considered itself very rural,'' said Mr. Herr, the state air quality official, ''and we found out we're not.''

HEADLINE: The First Test

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
There is a strong case to be made for a short, sharp stimulus package to restrain the collapse of the American economy. This would involve big, simple programs with immediate impact -- a temporary cut in the payroll tax, big aid to the states, expanded unemployment insurance and food stamps. 
 There's also a very strong case to be made for long-term government reform. America could fundamentally rethink its infrastructure policies -- create a new model adapted to new modes of community-building. It could fundamentally rethink human capital policies -- create a lifelong menu of learning options, from pre-K programs to service opportunities for the elderly. 
 But the stimulus bill emerging in the House of Representatives does neither of these things. The bill marked up Wednesday in the Appropriations Committee is a muddled mixture of short-term stimulus haste and long-term spending commitments. It is an unholy marriage that manages to combine the worst of each approach -- rushed short-term planning with expensive long-term fiscal impact.
 The bill has three essential failings. First, it lacks any strategic vision. This $825 billion bill has to be passed within weeks. There's no time for fundamental rethinking or new approaches. Instead, there's a sloppy profusion of 152 different appropriations -- off-the-shelf ideas that mostly create costlier versions of the status quo. 
 The committee staff took the kernel of President Obama's vision -- infrastructure programs to create jobs -- and surrounded it with an undisciplined sprawl of health, education, entitlement and other spending. There's money for nurse training, Medicare, Head Start, boatyard support, home weatherization and so on. Eleven of the programs in the bill account for the vast majority of the actual job creation. The rest may be worthy or not, but they have little to do with stimulus. The total package is so diffuse, it costs $223,000 to create a single job. 
 Second, the bill has relatively modest short-term impact. Many parts don't even pretend to be stimulus measures, like funding for basic research, or special ed programs. But even the parts of the bill that aim to stimulate will have modest near-term impact. A study by the Congressional Budget Office found that less than half of the money for infrastructure and discretionary programs would be spent by Oct. 1, 2010.
 According to The Washington Post, of the $30 billion devoted to highway spending, only $4 billion will be spent in the next two years. Less than $3 billion of the $18.5 billion for renewable energy and less than half the financing for school construction will be spent by 2011. 
 The Appropriations Committee chairman, David Obey, fulminated against the C.B.O. Wednesday, and the uselessness of economists in general, but he had no answer to these findings.
 Third, the spending measures in this bill have no sunset. In the middle of the Appropriations markup, the ranking member, Jerry Lewis from California, asked his chairman the crucial question: What happens when the economy recovers? Does this new spending disappear?
 Chairman Obey refused to answer, but he didn't have to. The entire argument for these measures over the previous hours had been that they were good in themselves. The commitments in this bill will constitute the new budget base line. They will contribute to the coming $2 trillion deficits. Worse, these new structures, and the lobbyists they attract, will create more impediments to the innovation that Obama may seek in the years ahead.
 On Tuesday, President Obama was inaugurated and vowed a new era. On Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee met and showed the old era was very much alive. Democratic subcommittee chairmen sat like potted plants because all power was wielded by Chairman Obey. Republicans were in the dark because of an information embargo placed on the majority staff.
 President Obama is clearly going to have to show the hard way that he meant what he said about bringing change. He didn't run for president just to sign whatever bills the Old Bulls put on his desk.
 He's going to have to prove the hard way that he meant what he said about being pragmatic and evidence-based. That means he won't sweep a C.B.O. study under the rug simply because the findings are inconvenient. 
 He's going to have to show that his plans have credibility, that a stimulus bill is really a stimulus bill, and not a Christmas tree for every special interest desire.
 If he can do that, we'll look back on this stimulus as a timely, temporary and targeted success. If not, we'll just remember it as the sprawling mess that kicked up dozens of scandal headlines about $200 million programs to lay grass around the Jefferson Memorial. 
 The glow of the inauguration lingers, but the precedent-setting tests are already at hand.

Reservations required.
 'THE SNOW QUEST' (Saturday) This show, with live music, song and dance, takes place in an enchanted kingdom where it hasn't snowed for a hundred years.

HEADLINE: Volunteer to Save the Economy

BYLINE: By BRUCE REED and JOHN BRIDGELAND. 
Bruce Reed, the president of the Democratic Leadership Council, was President Bill Clinton's domestic policy adviser. John Bridgeland, who held the same position under President George W. Bush, is the chief executive of a public policy firm.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THIS week, President Obama called upon all Americans to volunteer, to pitch in and give back. We hope that the president is serious about this challenge, because providing more opportunities for national and community service won't just lift the nation's spirit, it could help save the economy. 
 In fact, an investment in service as part of the economic recovery plan could add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the four million the Obama administration has proposed. And because jobs at nonprofit groups pay so little, they would cost the government less than many other stimulus measures. 
 The economic crisis has hit hospitals, nursing homes, nursery schools, centers for the elderly and soup kitchens with a triple whammy. The evaporation of wealth has depressed charitable donations; the state and local budget crunch has deprived nonprofit groups of their most dependable revenue stream; and, even as resources shrink, more Americans need assistance. In Michigan, for example, more than 70 percent of nonprofit groups have seen increased demand for their services, while half report that their financial support has dropped. 
 It's important that charities remain able to help those in need. But the nonprofit plunge also seriously endangers the nation's job market. Nonprofit enterprises have 9.4 million employees and 4.7 million volunteers nationwide -- together, that's 10 percent of the American work force, more than the auto and financial industries combined. Yet nonprofit groups have been almost completely overlooked during the economic debate. That's a mistake.
 There is, however, a bipartisan solution ready to go: during the campaign, both Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, endorsed the Serve America Act, which would greatly expand national and community service. 
 By including key provisions of that bill in the economic recovery package, Congress and the administration would enable 250,000 Americans to do full-time service over the next two years. We can invest in a new generation of volunteers as well: if federal work-study programs were doubled, over half a million part-time opportunities a year would be created for college students. All this could be done through existing nonprofit groups, charities and faith-based organizations, not a new government bureaucracy.
 The total two-year cost? Less than $8 billion -- adding not even 1 percent to a $825 billion recovery package. 
 As Americans have proven in times of crisis, what we ask of ourselves matters a great deal. If we want to create the most jobs for the lowest cost with the least bureaucracy and foster the spirit of sacrifice that the president envisions, the economic recovery plan should find a place for more Americans to do good works in hard times.

HEADLINE: On Plane to Texas, Critiques of the Speech

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On the plane, no longer Air Force One but now Special Air Mission 28000, they talked about the speech. George W. Bush, the former president, was heading home to Texas with his inner circle, having just left the Capitol, where his successor first thanked him for his service and then proceeded to discredit it.
 The Bush team had worked assiduously to make the transition smooth for the incoming President Obama and stayed out of the way as he used the postelection period to take leadership of the economy even before being sworn in. And now, as far as some of them were concerned, the new president had used his inaugural lectern to give the back of the hand to a predecessor who had been nothing but gracious to him. 
 ''There were a few sharp elbows that really rankled and I felt were not as magnanimous as the occasion called for,'' Karen Hughes, a longtime Bush confidante, said in an interview. ''He really missed an opportunity to be as big as the occasion was and, frankly, as gracious as President Bush was as he left office.''
 Dan Bartlett, another top adviser, used similar language. ''It was a missed opportunity to bring some of the president's loyal supporters into the fold,'' he said. Marc A. Thiessen, the chief White House speechwriter until this week, added: ''It was an ungracious inaugural. It was pretty clear he was taking shots.''
 The hard feelings represent the first public schism between the camps since the Nov. 4 election. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama made a point of cooperating during the transition and putting the rancor of the election behind them. Mr. Bush hosted a luncheon for Mr. Obama with all the living former presidents, and the new president did not even complain when it turned out that Blair House, the government guest mansion, was not available to his family until five days before the inauguration.
 But that did not mean that Mr. Obama was not intent on signaling a sharp break from his predecessor, and on Thursday his aides fired back at Mr. Bush's advisers for complaining. 
 ''On both style and substance,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the new White House chief of staff, the new president is ''turning the page.'' 
 Mr. Emanuel mocked Bush advisers for bristling at the message of the Inaugural Address. ''If they didn't know that was the judgment of people, then their subscription to the newspapers were canceled over the last three years,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama never directly mentioned Mr. Bush's name after the ritual thank you at the beginning of his speech, but the context of some of his remarks was lost on no one. He criticized ''our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.'' He promised to ''restore science to its rightful place.'' He rejected ''as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.'' He assured the rest of the world ''that we are ready to lead once more.''
 Some analysts said it was the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt took over from Herbert Hoover in 1933 that an incoming president used his Inaugural Address to so evidently repudiate his predecessor as he headed for the door. When Mr. Bush took office in 2001, he called for ''personal responsibility'' and lauded ''private character'' in his Inaugural Address, which struck many as a slap at Bill Clinton, but the speech as a whole was not seen as a wholesale denouncement of the departing president.
 Mr. Bush took it in stride, according to those who saw him on Tuesday. ''He grabbed me and said, 'That was a hell of a speech,' '' Mr. Emanuel said. Ms. Hughes said Mr. Bush had said ''not a word'' disparaging the speech during the plane ride to Midland, Tex.
 But his advisers did. Among those on board were his most loyal confidants. Mark McKinnon, his media strategist, said there were good wishes for Mr. Obama and ''an absence of malice one normally sees among the constituencies of the vanquished.'' But on The Daily Beast, a Web magazine, Mr. McKinnon noted ''some critical reviews of the speech, complaints about taking unnecessary shots and grousing about borrowed ideas.''
 Ms. Hughes said they took offense at suggestions that Mr. Bush had avoided hard decisions and had not helped people around the world, noting increases in foreign aid and his campaign to fight AIDS in Africa. ''That statement, I felt, was fundamentally unfair and dishonest,'' Ms. Hughes said.
 Not every Bush loyalist was offended. Peter H. Wehner, a former White House official, said Mr. Obama ''could have struck a classier and more unifying tone, but I didn't think he crossed any lines.'' Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary, said, ''I didn't take umbrage'' because, after all, Mr. Obama won on a promise ''to make a break from the Bush years.''
 But others are pushing back. Mr. Thiessen wrote a column in The Washington Post criticizing Mr. Obama for reversing Mr. Bush's terrorism policies. ''If Obama weakens any of the defenses Bush put in place and terrorists strike our country again, Americans will hold Obama responsible,'' he wrote.
 Karl Rove wrote in The Wall Street Journal that as his former boss departed, ''in a last angry frenzy his critics again distorted his record, maligned his character and repeated untruths about his years in the Oval Office.'' Mr. Rove said Mr. Bush had cut taxes, expanded Medicare, improved schools, liberated Iraq and protected the country.
 ''He didn't get everything right -- no president does -- but he got the most important things right,'' Mr. Rove wrote.
 The shots signal a sustained debate in coming months between Bush and Obama partisans over the former president's record. Mr. Bush says he will let his successor govern without criticism. His defenders took no such pledge. They understand victors write history, but they are determined to try to help shape that narrative themselves.

HEADLINE: Blair Pledges New Approach to Counterterrorism

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Dennis C. Blair, the retired admiral who is President Obama's choice as the nation's top intelligence official, pledged in testimony on Tuesday that he would require counterterrorism programs to operate ''in a manner consistent with our nation's values, consistent with our Constitution and consistent with the rule of law.''
 During a hearing that occurred as President Obama signed new executive orders rolling back Bush Administration detention and interrogation policies, Mr. Blair signaled a new approach on such controversial issues as eavesdropping without warrants and harsh interrogation methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
 ''The intelligence agencies of the United States must respect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people, and they must adhere to the rule of law,'' Mr. Blair said in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
 The sixth generation naval officer did not face particularly difficult questioning, and is expected to be easily confirmed by the committee. 
 He said that the Obama administration would carry out a review of interrogation policy, and that both military and intelligence interrogators would follow a uniform standard. Under questioning, however, he said he believed that some interrogation procedures and methods ought to remain secret so potential adversaries cannot train to resist them. 
 ''We don't want to provide open intelligence support for those who are coming after us,'' he said. 
 Addressing complaints that the intelligence agencies have evaded Congressional oversight and skirted the law, Mr. Blair promised a different approach.
 ''I do not and will not support any surveillance activities that circumvent established processes for their lawful authorization,'' he said in the testimony. ''I believe in the importance of independent monitoring, including by Congress, to prevent abuses and protect civil liberties.''
 In an unusual comment from a man who will head the most secret agencies of government, he said, ''There is a need for transparency and accountability in a mission where most work necessarily remains hidden from public view.'' 
 He said that if confirmed, he would ''communicate frequently and candidly with the oversight committees, and as much as possible with the American people.''
 On the issue of detainee treatment, perhaps the most divisive security issue since 2001, Mr. Blair called torture ''not moral, legal or effective'' and said any interrogation program would have to comply with the Geneva Conventions, the Convention against Torture and the Constitution.
 Though he is not a career intelligence professional, Mr. Blair served for two years as a senior C.I.A. official. He referred indirectly to the flawed intelligence before the Iraq war, when the Bush White House pressed the agencies for information on the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. 
 ''There is an obligation to speak truth to power,'' he said, adding that he would honestly present ''unpleasant'' facts to the president.
 He said he would seek an ''extremely important balance'' for the 16 intelligence agencies, which employ about 100,000 people, suggesting that he would emphasize the soft power of diplomacy and economic development as well as the tougher counterterrorism efforts that got most attention under President Bush.
 He said that in addition to backing the military and intelligence operatives in hunting down terrorists, the agencies should support ''policymakers who are looking for opportunities to engage and work with Arab and Muslim leaders who are striving for a progressive and peaceful future for their religion and their countries.''

HEADLINE: Geithner Hints At Harder Line On China Trade

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Timothy F. Geithner, who moved closer to confirmation as Treasury secretary on Thursday, told senators that President Obama believed China was ''manipulating'' its currency, suggesting a more confrontational stance toward that country than under the Bush administration.
 Mr. Geithner's comment was made in writing to the Senate Finance Committee hours before it voted 18 to 5 to recommend that the full Senate confirm him. The statement, which is certain to anger the Chinese government, comes at a particularly sensitive time, with economies in both the United States and China weakening and tensions already rising around the globe over trade. The United States, moreover, is increasingly dependent on China to finance its ballooning deficit. 
 An administration official said that Mr. Geithner was only repeating what Mr. Obama had said during the campaign, and pointed out that his statement also emphasized that the president intended to use ''all the diplomatic avenues available to him'' to address the currency question. 
 It remained unclear whether Mr. Geithner was signaling that Mr. Obama would officially declare later this spring that China was engaging in currency manipulation, when the administration is required by a 20-year-old trade law to report to Congress on exchange rate issues. Such a finding would begin a legal process that starts with diplomacy and could end with the imposition of trade barriers like tariffs. The objective would be to persuade China to let the value of its currency, the yuan, freely float -- a move that would let its value rise and would increase the cost of its exports. 
 ''President Obama -- backed by the conclusions of a broad range of economists -- believes that China is manipulating its currency,'' Mr. Geithner wrote. He stopped short of charging that China is manipulating its currency intentionally to gain an unfair trade advantage, as the 1988 law requires for an official citation of currency ''manipulation.'' 
 Even so, the Obama administration's restatement of that position in writing on its second day was immediately seen as significant. The Bush administration purposely did not use the term ''currency manipulator'' to avoid antagonizing the Chinese, even when it was criticizing China's trade policies. 
 The more aggressive position will be popular with organized labor in the United States, a major supporter of Mr. Obama's presidential campaign, and with many manufacturers who say China is purposely keeping its currency devalued against the dollar and leaving American exports at a competitive disadvantage against lower-priced Chinese goods. 
 ''It's huge,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund who is now a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''I'm very supportive in general and I think China needs to be called to account and the I.M.F. has not done it,'' he said.
 But, he added, ''I have to say this is really a bit of an issue for Mr. Obama's internationalist sort of theme for his foreign policy because this is going to be at least a spat with China, and if we don't back down it's then a row, and you know how that goes.'' 
 Prices of Treasury debt fell modestly after news of Mr. Geithner's comments, reflecting worry among investors that China might be less willing to buy United States debt if the new administration pushed the country to further revalue its currency. The yield on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, climbed to 3.247 percent from 3.159 percent on Wednesday afternoon. 
 Even before, yields on long-term government debt had been moving up in the last three weeks, as investors anticipated a significant increase in government borrowing.
 The Obama official, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of Mr. Geithner's confirmation process, cited the Treasury nominee's earlier oral testimony to the Finance Committee. ''As Tim Geithner said, it is important for the United States and the world economy that our major trading partners operate with a flexible exchange rate system,'' the official said, ''in which market forces determine the value of exchange rates. The new administration is committed to using a fully integrated approach to bring this about in the current economic environment.''
 As a senator, Mr. Obama supported legislation as recently as last year that would open the door to trade sanctions against China for currency manipulation. 
 Mr. Geithner's statement was in response to a written question about the new administration's stance that was submitted by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, a vocal critic of China's currency policies.
 On Thursday, Mr. Schumer welcomed Mr. Geithner's reply. ''For the first two days, this is a big step'' from the Obama administration, he said in an interview. ''And I think it's an indication: They are not going to be anti-free trade; they are not going to be for putting artificial barriers in the way. But when other countries do, they're going to be much tougher on them.''
 The National Association of Manufacturers, whose members have pushed previous administrations to get tougher with China, was pleased, but also cautious given the potential for a confrontation that could exacerbate global woes.
 ''You know the world has changed a lot with the financial crisis and China has a lot in U.S. Treasuries,'' said Frank Vargo, vice president for international economic affairs at the manufacturers' association. ''This needs to be done in a cooperative, not a confrontational, way.''
 Some market strategists said Mr. Geithner's statement inflamed a contentious issue unnecessarily given that China's exports and economy were slowing significantly.
 ''Things have changed quite a bit since Hank Paulson made an issue of this,'' said one, Edward Yardeni, an independent analyst, referring to Henry M. Paulson Jr., the just-departed Treasury secretary. ''The Chinese trade surplus is shrinking dramatically and China's economy is falling into recession. I think it really wasn't necessary. It doesn't accomplish anything.''
 Mr. Paulson initiated a round of strategic talks with the Chinese and, on his watch, the Chinese allowed the yuan to depreciate nearly 20 percent. 
 Mr. Geithner would be as aware of China's sensitivity as anyone, and no one has suggested that he made his statement in error. Before taking his current post as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. Geithner was a policy director at the I.M.F. Before that, he was the under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs in the Clinton administration, a crisis manager during the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s and a Treasury attache to Japan. By his own description, Mr. Geithner's expertise is in matters of currency exchange rates and monetary policy.
 In his written statement to the Senate panel, Mr. Geithner further noted Mr. Obama's support as a senator for ''tough legislation to overhaul the U.S. process for determining currency manipulation and authorizing new enforcement measures so countries like China cannot continue to get a free pass for undermining fair trade principles.'' 
 ''The question is how and when to broach the subject in order to do more good than harm,'' he added. ''The new economic team will forge an integrated strategy on how best to achieve currency realignment in the current economic environment.''
 The full Senate is expected to confirm Mr. Geithner, 47, as Treasury secretary on Monday. Some Republican senators blocked a vote for this week, given lingering objections about Mr. Geithner's failure until recently to pay about $34,000 in payroll taxes on his income at the I.M.F. from 2001 to 2004. 
 He was roundly criticized in his Finance Committee hearing on Wednesday, but its bipartisan vote reflected members' opinion that Mr. Geithner's expertise outweighed his personal tax lapses. Those were ''completely unacceptable,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota. ''In normal times that alone would lead me to oppose his nomination. These are not normal times.''
 All the panel's Democrats and five of the 10 Republicans voted for Mr. Geithner. 
 ''I'm convinced he's a person of great integrity even though he's made these mistakes,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. But another Republican, Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, said, ''I'm really disappointed that we're even voting on this,'' given that other nominees had been disqualified for less.

HEADLINE: Senate Undertakes Bipartisan Ways

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A real debate over wage policy on the Senate floor. Envoys of a Democratic White House briefing Republicans about terrorism detainees. The House Appropriations Committee hashing out an economic recovery bill, in a daylong public session.
 On Capitol Hill, members of both parties are trying to adjust to the new order in Washington and figure out whether they can ease the partisan warfare that has infected Congress.
 Perhaps nowhere was the new dynamic more striking than in the Senate on Thursday. Here were members of both parties, proposing and disposing of amendments before they voted 61 to 36 to approve a pay equity bill in line to be the first measure signed by President Obama. 
 ''It is a good start,'' said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia. ''It is healthy for the country that the debate is two-sided, not one-sided.''
 For the past two years, majority Democrats often denied Republicans the chance to alter legislation on the floor, mainly so they could not force politically charged votes or scuttle important legislation. 
 Now, heeding Mr. Obama's call for cooperation, Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, is tentatively testing the notion of letting Republicans offer amendments to legislation and having the parties engage in a battle of ideas on the floor. The fact that Democrats now have a majority of 58 seats rather than the 51 seats they previously held makes the concession far less painful.
 ''It helps,'' Mr. Reid acknowledged with a wry grin this week.
 The approach seemed to work Thursday as the Senate, after rejecting a series of Republican proposals, passed the measure granting women more leeway to sue over wage discrimination. That same legislation died last year in a Republican filibuster, one of dozens that created legislative gridlock in the past two years. The bill must go back to the House but is quite likely to be on Mr. Obama's desk next week.
 Republicans say that giving them a voice on the floor is crucial to advancing the new administration's initiatives quickly since they still -- barely -- hold enough votes to employ the procedural stalling tactics that have plagued the Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said his party did not intend to abuse the process to score political points but simply wants an opportunity to push its alternatives.
 ''It doesn't mean we are going to go out there and offer 100 amendments and have a bunch of gun-control amendments,'' he said. ''We want to offer amendments related to the subject matter and have them voted on. If we are not able to, I think we will have 41 Republicans who will not allow the bill to be finished.''
 Both parties have incentives to be more agreeable. Democrats want to be seen as responsive to Mr. Obama's push for bipartisanship and to win wider backing for their priorities. Republicans realize their backstop in the White House is now gone and their sole chance to help shape legislation is in Congress. Both parties know the public is tired of fighting and wants action.
 The roots of the Congressional tension go back many years. House Republicans who gained control in 1994 chafed at 40 years spent in the minority and, as they solidified their hold, marginalized Democrats. When Democrats regained the House in 2006, they promised to treat the minority with more respect, but found that promise hard to fulfill in practice. 
 In the Senate, where power changed hands more frequently, Republicans who took control in 2002 grew incensed at Democratic filibusters against judicial nominees and threatened to revoke that right. Then when Democrats regained the majority in 2006, they saw Republicans as obstructionists, determined to halt any accomplishment.
 As a result, Mr. Reid employed a device known in Senate parlance as filling the tree to prevent amendments -- a tactic that outraged Republicans and often brought the Senate to a standstill.
 No one expects complete harmony. Republicans are already doing what they can to slow some of Mr. Obama's nominations. And they are clearly taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether Mr. Reid allows amendments on future bills. They credit Mr. Obama with setting the right tone and say he will need bipartisan support on the big issues he hopes to tackle, like health care.
 Senate Democrats are watching to see if Republicans keep their amendments relevant. One proposed Thursday by Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, was viewed by Democrats as a way to torpedo the bill with antiunion language. The amendment was defeated easily, 59 to 38 -- an outcome that illustrates the new Democratic muscle.
 There are other signs of change, as well. Rather than the Democratic leadership's springing an economic stimulus bill on Republicans, House Democrats held a full Appropriations Committee '''markup'' session to consider the measure -- a type of public meeting held infrequently of late. A handful of Republican amendments were accepted though Republicans seem inclined to oppose the House bill.
 And the Obama administration dispatched a top official to brief Congressional Republicans before the president issued executive orders on terrorism detainees -- communication not often seen between the Bush administration and the minority party.
 Some Democrats said they were more than ready to move beyond the procedural fights that have consumed Congress. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said that if she could not explain her position on the votes Republicans might force, she should not be in the Senate.
 ''I came here to the Senate to debate hard stuff,'' she said. ''Let's debate. I think it will go a long way toward us learning to cooperate with each other.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Pleads for Sustenance, Not Cuts, From the State

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
In tones both emphatic and empathetic, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pleaded with state legislators on Thursday to refrain from cutting $656 million in state aid to New York City over the next 18 months, saying that such cuts could force the city to raise taxes and slash programs.
 Mayor Bloomberg said he understood that the recession, coupled with the state's projected $15 billion budget deficit, required sacrifices by all residents, and that ''the city can't be exempt.'' But he warned that the city had already done a lot to ''stretch every dollar,'' noting that he issued a directive last month to city agencies to identify an additional $1.4 billion in spending cuts in the next fiscal year. 
 ''I understand all localities are being asked to take a bitter pill,'' he said, testifying at a joint legislative budget hearing. ''I don't think it's fair that New York City is being asked to swallow an entire bottle.''
 If the city does get not its fair share, he continued, he will probably have to suggest painful cuts in education and personnel, as well as tax increases, which he later declined to specify.
 ''We have got down to a level at this point where all the cuts from now on will be in the classroom,'' he said.
 In an annual ritual, New York's mayor heads up to Albany in the dead of winter, just as the state budget process is getting under way, to ask for more money and reinforce the argument that the city is not being treated fairly. The city delivers almost half of all state tax revenues, but makes up only 40 percent of the population.
 But this year is different, Mr. Bloomberg noted, because of the recession, the prospect of drastically lower tax revenues for years to come, and the state's projected deficit. So instead of heaping criticism on the governor -- as he did when the governor's last name was Pataki or Spitzer -- Mr. Bloomberg took pains to leaven his criticism of Gov. David A. Paterson's budget proposal with praise.
 ''We have a great deal of sympathy,'' he said at a news conference after the hearing. ''We're going to have to make choices, none of which will be easy or cost-free or painless. I just want to make sure that New York City is treated fairly.''
 At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg said, he found that the legislators sitting in on the hearing had been a bit more hospitable than usual.
 ''It was a lot less contentious,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''I think there is an understanding by those people that were sitting on that panel that they're going to have to face similar kinds of problems, and it's not business as the same old ways. We are fundamentally in a different world today than we were 12 months ago and each of the preceding years. The time for grandstanding or the time for politics as usual has come and gone.''
 It was an assessment that legislators did not dispute.
 In a statement after the hearing, Senator Carl Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said legislators had agreed that ''we need to reform the way we think about money, along with the way we've grown accustomed to spending it.''
 Mr. Bloomberg estimated that Mr. Paterson's budget proposal, if enacted, would result in an overall drop of $1.6 billion in revenue for the city. Of that figure, $656 million would come from the city's share of a state program called Aid and Incentives for Municipalities, while $770 million would be cuts in financing for education, Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg used the hearing to touch on an education issue that is sure to dominate politics in Albany later this year: mayoral control over the city's schools, which he won in 2002.
 ''To go back would be a sin,'' he said.
 Mr. Bloomberg also discussed measures to control rising pension costs. One new proposal that could save millions of dollars without costing a single job, he said, would place 21,000 employees enrolled in the Board of Education retirement system into a larger system, like the ones used by teachers and civil servants. Another plan, already mentioned by Mr. Paterson, would reduce benefits for newly hired state and local workers by creating a new pension category, and would require employees to work longer and retire later to receive pension benefits.
 ''If you don't do it now, you're never going to do it,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
 Mr. Bloomberg also spelled out a group of proposals that have already been mentioned, or are perennial favorites of his. These include tort reform, rooting out Medicaid waste and fraud, a charge of five cents for every plastic bag shoppers use at New York City stores, and reducing or eliminating the unincorporated business tax.
 Still, there were also moments when Mr. Bloomberg displayed his trademark exasperation in dealing with Albany. He urged the Legislature, for instance, to force the Public Service Commission to spend $175 million for projects intended to improve energy efficiency. The financing was approved by the commission in June, but is being held in escrow. 
 ''It's just the most ridiculous thing,'' the mayor said.

HEADLINE: Environmental Issues Slide In Poll of Public's Concerns

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
A new poll suggests that Americans, preoccupied with the economy, are less worried about rising global temperatures than they were a year ago but remain concerned with solving the nation's energy problems. 
 The findings are somewhat at odds with President Obama, who has put a high priority on staving off global warming and vowed Tuesday in his Inaugural Address to ''roll back the specter of a warming planet.''
 In the poll, released Thursday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, global warming came in last among 20 voter concerns; it trailed issues like addressing moral decline and decreasing the influence of lobbyists. Only 30 percent of the voters deemed global warming to be ''a top priority,'' compared with 35 percent in 2008. 
 ''Protecting the environment,'' which had surged in the rankings from 2006 to 2008, dropped even more precipitously in the poll: only 41 percent of voters called it a top priority, compared with 56 percent last year.
 In contrast, dealing with the nation's energy problems ranked sixth in the poll -- just behind education and social security -- with 60 percent of voters endorsing it as a top priority.
 The declining interest in global warming and other environmental issues might be unsurprising at a time when Americans face far more imminent threats to their jobs and homes. ''Strengthening the nation's economy'' was the top-ranked concern of voters in the Pew poll. A relatively cool year and a harsh winter in North America and Europe have not helped, inspiring some commentators and a small cluster of scientists to make skeptical remarks about ''global cooling.''
 Social scientists say that environmental concerns are often the first to fall off the table when any more immediate threat surfaces. Andrew Kohut, the president of the Pew Research Center, said a similar pattern was seen in the Pew poll after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when second-tier issues faded in voters' minds. 
 ''Concern for terrorism overshadowed all else,'' Mr. Kohut said.
 The public's waning interest in global warming poses a challenge for Mr. Obama, who emphasized climate change throughout his campaign and pledged to seek a cap on emissions in the United States of heat-trapping gases, led by carbon dioxide, which come mainly from burning coal and oil. Such a cap, even if it includes various mechanisms intended to ease the cost, would by design raise the price of energy coming from those fossil fuels, which still underpin the American and the global economies.
 Mr. Obama's political foes have already seized on the cooling of public concern. 
 Marc Morano, the communications director for the Republican minority on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has been sending out e-mail alerts, sometimes several a day, highlighting stories on winter weather and other surveys suggesting a shift in public attitudes.
 But some experts in climate and energy policy say, given Americans' continuing concern about filling their gas tanks and lighting their homes, Mr. Obama might still succeed in shoring up public support by packaging his climate policy as part of a larger push for a safer, cleaner menu of energy choices.
 ''Obama can effectively tie conservation, efficiency and renewable energy to jobs, sustainable growth and national security,'' said Riley E. Dunlap, a sociologist at Oklahoma State University who studies public and political discourse on climate. 
 ''This will be easier with energy efficiency and independence than with climate change,'' Dr. Dunlap said. But, he said, ''I think he can 'legitimate' climate change and the need to act on it to a considerable degree.'' 
 Richard C. J. Somerville, a climate scientist at the University of California, San Diego, said there was plenty of evidence that a sustained push on improved energy technology and energy efficiency, including public education by scientists and political leaders, could pay off politically and environmentally.
 ''France, a country of 60 million people, went from near zero to 80 percent nuclear electricity in about three decades,'' Dr. Somerville said. The shift, he added, ''was done smoothly and effectively, and public education was a big part of it.''
 David Goldston, a former chief of staff of the House science committee, noted that no American president had previously made global warming a central issue, ''so we don't know what will happen when that occurs.'' 
 ''We'll see,'' Mr. Goldston added, ''but I think it's wrong to assume too much about the future based on our current prolonged torpor.''

HEADLINE: The President Orders Transparency

 BODY:
President Obama wasted no time in moving to roll back the Bush administration's disgraceful strictures on open government. 
 In a welcome series of orders, Mr. Obama directed federal agencies to err on the side of transparency, not the Bush-era default of secrecy and delay, in releasing records to the public. He also undid the executive order signed by President George Bush that lets past presidents and vice presidents sit indefinitely on potentially embarrassing records that belong in the public domain. 
 And Mr. Obama issued some of the toughest limitations yet on the power of lobbyists to influence government from within. Under the new rules, anyone who leaves the Obama administration will be barred from lobbying the executive branch for the remainder of Mr. Obama's time in office, rather than the yearlong ban Mr. Bush employed. In addition, no one may serve in the Obama administration if he or she lobbied an executive agency in the preceding two years.
 The new president's actions provided a burst of executive sunshine that Washington badly needs. Unfortunately, Mr. Obama already wants to make an exception for William Lynn, a former lobbyist for the defense contractor Raytheon, to become deputy secretary of defense. Mr. Lynn, a respected Pentagon official in the Clinton administration, has the right resume -- except that he was a lobbyist until last year. This clearly violates the mint-new standard, especially since the Pentagon job is so wide-ranging that recusal on specific issues is impossible. 
 The White House is hoping for Senate approval nevertheless, arguing that while the president sought the firmest ethics rules, he also believes that ''any standard is not perfect,'' that ''a waiver process that allows people to serve their country is necessary.'' Maybe the Senate will concur that Mr. Lynn is ''uniquely qualified'' and a waiver is justified. But this is not an ideal first test of Mr. Obama's exemplary rules. Voters who heeded the president's campaign message of openness must demand any exceptions to be few and far between. 
 This is particularly true for Mr. Obama's order reversing a memo from Mr. Bush's Department of Justice that hobbled agencies in fulfilling the Freedom of Information Act's promise of accountability. A healthy democracy needs to know what is going on in its government. Small wonder historians instantly hailed Mr. Obama's reversal of Mr. Bush's order, which gave veto power to past presidents, vice presidents and their heirs over which executive archives are made public.
 President Obama's new orders go well beyond the standards of his predecessors, particularly in shutting, not slowing, the revolving-door path from well-connected government veteran to high-salaried corporate lobbyist. The promise of transparency is heartening (though the Obama White House's initial opening day action in crimping photographers' traditional access to ceremonies was not). The president has vowed ''a clean break from business as usual,'' with transparency at the core. The nation welcomes this promise and will be tracking its fulfillment.

HEADLINE: A Stimulus Package for the World

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. ZOELLICK. 
Robert B. Zoellick is the president of the World Bank.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 WITHIN his first 100 days, President Obama will attend his inaugural global summit meeting: an April gathering of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in London. The president, with bipartisan backing in Congress, should send an audacious signal of hope. Starting with the United States, Mr. Obama should call for each developed country to pledge 0.7 percent of its stimulus package to a vulnerability fund for assisting developing countries that can't afford bailouts and deficits.
 The United States could begin by pledging some $6 billion of its own $825 billion stimulus package -- just 4 percent of what was provided to American International Group. With this modest step, the United States would speed up global recovery, help the world's poor and bolster its foreign policy influence. 
 There is no time to waste. The economic crisis has already pushed an estimated 100 million people back into poverty. Slumping exports have helped imperil the jobs of workers around the world. In many places foreign and domestic investment is frozen. So far we have avoided the currency collapses of 1997 and 1998, but 2009 will be a dangerous year.
 The good news is that if Mr. Obama sends the right signal, many countries are likely to contribute to a vulnerability fund. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has expressed interest in the idea. Last year President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called for an increase in aid, and has taken a particular interest in Africa. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wants to help finance construction projects in poor countries.
 Japan has already pledged to help the World Bank recapitalize banks in poor countries. Australia and Russia have supported a food vulnerability fund that we created last year. Canada has been increasing its aid; the European Commission has been debating over contributing more assistance. Last year, Saudi Arabia gave an emergency $500 million grant to the World Food Program.
 Italy, as the host of the Group of 8 industrialized nations finance ministers' meeting next month, should pave the way for the Group of 20 meeting by making the drive for a vulnerability fund a priority. The World Bank, with the United Nations and regional development banks, could then manage the fund to facilitate fast and flexible aid delivery, backed by safeguards to ensure that the money is well spent.
 There are three priorities for vulnerability fund investments. First, we need safety net programs that are aligned with the developing country's ability to put them to good use. Over the past year as food and fuel prices soared, the World Bank worked with United Nations agencies to increase food-for-work programs, seed and fertilizer projects, maternal and child nutrition programs and other assistance. We have committed nearly $1.2 billion for projects like a school meals program for more than 30,000 children in Haiti, a cash-for-work program in Sierra Leone for road work and drainage, and grants for farmers in Rwanda to buy fertilizer. These investments in health, education and nutrition are more than just temporary poverty relief. They are investments in human capital. The vulnerability fund would help expand these modest shock absorbers for the poor. 
 Second, investments in infrastructure can yield huge benefits. Just look at China, which demonstrated 10 years ago that wisely chosen infrastructure projects can create jobs while building a foundation for productivity and growth. The World Bank is increasing support for such projects to $15 billion a year over the next three years. This includes financing for low-carbon technology projects as well as public-private partnerships that will create jobs while improving the delivery of basic services. 
 Third, the vulnerability fund would help support small and medium-sized enterprises and microfinance institutions. Small businesses are the most dynamic and flexible employers, and the best safety net is a job. Small businesses operate where Wall Street, and even Main Street, give way to villages with no streets. The credit contraction squeezes out small businesses and their lenders, while state-owned enterprises and big companies get bailed out. The World Bank has already responded to the global crisis with plans to recapitalize small banks in developing countries, as well as by providing credit lines for microfinance institutions that serve the poorest people. The vulnerability fund would continue these initiatives.
 The conventional wisdom is that Congress can't be bothered with foreign assistance. In reality, prodded by churches, schools and community groups, both Democrats and Republicans have generously backed well-run programs to improve nutrition and fight hunger, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Congress has supported microfinance and small business development worldwide. There is an additional incentive for America to help: building projects abroad are likely to increase demand for American-made equipment.
 Poor people in Africa should not pay the price for a crisis that originated in America. The total aid from developed countries is about $100 billion a year, a modest sum in light of developing countries' needs. The United Nations target for aid is 0.7 percent of an economy. The United States contribution is about 0.2 percent, although polls consistently show the American public is willing to contribute much more. 
 Support for a vulnerability fund can help limit the depth and length of the international downturn, prevent the contagion of social unrest and help save a generation from a new poverty trap. For less than 1 percent of America's stimulus package, President Obama can lead the G-20 in London and reintroduce America to the world.

HEADLINE: Where Obama's Speech Got Harsh Reviews

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On the plane, no longer Air Force One but now Special Air Mission 28000, they talked about the speech. George W. Bush, the former president, was heading home to Texas with his inner circle, having just left the Capitol, where his successor first thanked him for his service and then proceeded to discredit it.
 The Bush team had worked assiduously to make the transition smooth for the incoming President Obama and stayed out of the way as he used the postelection period to take leadership of the economy even before being sworn in. And now, as far as some of them were concerned, the new president had used his inaugural lectern to give the back of the hand to a predecessor who had been nothing but gracious to him. 
 ''There were a few sharp elbows that really rankled and I felt were not as magnanimous as the occasion called for,'' Karen Hughes, a longtime Bush confidante, said in an interview. ''He really missed an opportunity to be as big as the occasion was and, frankly, as gracious as President Bush was as he left office.''
 Dan Bartlett, another top adviser, used similar language. ''It was a missed opportunity to bring some of the president's loyal supporters into the fold,'' he said. Marc A. Thiessen, the chief White House speechwriter until this week, added: ''It was an ungracious inaugural. It was pretty clear he was taking shots.''
 The hard feelings represent the first public schism between the camps since the Nov. 4 election. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama made a point of cooperating during the transition and putting the rancor of the election behind them. Mr. Bush hosted a luncheon for Mr. Obama with all the living former presidents, and the new president did not even complain when it turned out that Blair House, the government guest mansion, was not available to his family until five days before the inauguration.
 But that did not mean that Mr. Obama was not intent on signaling a sharp break from his predecessor, and on Thursday his aides fired back at Mr. Bush's advisers for complaining. 
 ''On both style and substance,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the new White House chief of staff, the new president is ''turning the page.'' 
 Mr. Emanuel mocked Bush advisers for bristling at the message of the Inaugural Address. ''If they didn't know that was the judgment of people, then their subscriptions to the newspapers were canceled over the last three years,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama never directly mentioned Mr. Bush's name after the ritual thank you at the beginning of his speech, but the context of some of his remarks was lost on no one. He criticized ''our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.'' He promised to ''restore science to its rightful place.'' He rejected ''as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.'' He assured the rest of the world ''that we are ready to lead once more.''
 Some analysts said it was the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt took over from Herbert Hoover in 1933 that an incoming president used his Inaugural Address to so evidently repudiate his predecessor as he headed for the door. When Mr. Bush took office in 2001, he called for ''personal responsibility'' and lauded ''private character'' in his Inaugural Address, which struck many as a slap at Bill Clinton, but the speech was not seen as a wholesale denouncement of the departing president.
 Mr. Bush took it in stride on Tuesday, according to those who saw him. ''He grabbed me and said, 'That was a hell of a speech,' '' Mr. Emanuel said. Ms. Hughes said Mr. Bush had said ''not a word'' disparaging the speech during the plane ride to Midland, Tex.
 But his advisers did. Among those on board were his most loyal confidants. Mark McKinnon, his media strategist, said there were good wishes for Mr. Obama and ''an absence of malice one normally sees among the constituencies of the vanquished.'' But on The Daily Beast, a Web magazine, Mr. McKinnon noted ''some critical reviews of the speech, complaints about taking unnecessary shots and grousing about borrowed ideas.''
 Ms. Hughes said they took offense at suggestions that Mr. Bush had avoided hard decisions and had not helped people around the world, noting increases in foreign aid and his campaign to fight AIDS in Africa. ''That statement, I felt, was fundamentally unfair and dishonest,'' Ms. Hughes said.
 Not every Bush loyalist was offended. Peter H. Wehner, a former White House official, said Mr. Obama ''could have struck a classier and more unifying tone, but I didn't think he crossed any lines.'' Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary, said, ''I didn't take umbrage'' because, after all, Mr. Obama won on a promise ''to make a break from the Bush years.''
 But others are pushing back. Mr. Thiessen wrote a column in The Washington Post criticizing Mr. Obama for reversing Mr. Bush's terrorism policies. ''If Obama weakens any of the defenses Bush put in place and terrorists strike our country again, Americans will hold Obama responsible,'' he wrote.
 Karl Rove wrote in The Wall Street Journal that as his former boss departed, ''in a last angry frenzy his critics again distorted his record, maligned his character and repeated untruths about his years in the Oval Office.'' Mr. Rove said Mr. Bush had cut taxes, expanded Medicare, improved schools, liberated Iraq and protected the country.
 ''He didn't get everything right -- no president does -- but he got the most important things right,'' Mr. Rove wrote.
 The shots signal a sustained debate in coming months between Bush and Obama partisans over the former president's record. Mr. Bush says he will let his successor govern without criticism. His defenders took no such pledge. They understand victors write history, but they are determined to try to help shape that narrative themselves.

HEADLINE: Stuck In the Muddle

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Like anyone who pays attention to business and financial news, I am in a state of high economic anxiety. Like everyone of good will, I hoped that President Obama's Inaugural Address would offer some reassurance, that it would suggest that the new administration has this thing covered.
 But it was not to be. I ended Tuesday less confident about the direction of economic policy than I was in the morning. 
 Just to be clear, there wasn't anything glaringly wrong with the address -- although for those still hoping that Mr. Obama will lead the way to universal health care, it was disappointing that he spoke only of health care's excessive cost, never once mentioning the plight of the uninsured and underinsured. 
 Also, one wishes that the speechwriters had come up with something more inspiring than a call for an ''era of responsibility'' -- which, not to put too fine a point on it, was the same thing former President George W. Bush called for eight years ago.
 But my real problem with the speech, on matters economic, was its conventionality. In response to an unprecedented economic crisis -- or, more accurately, a crisis whose only real precedent is the Great Depression -- Mr. Obama did what people in Washington do when they want to sound serious: he spoke, more or less in the abstract, of the need to make hard choices and stand up to special interests. 
 That's not enough. In fact, it's not even right. 
 Thus, in his speech Mr. Obama attributed the economic crisis in part to ''our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age'' -- but I have no idea what he meant. This is, first and foremost, a crisis brought on by a runaway financial industry. And if we failed to rein in that industry, it wasn't because Americans ''collectively'' refused to make hard choices; the American public had no idea what was going on, and the people who did know what was going on mostly thought deregulation was a great idea.
 Or consider this statement from Mr. Obama: ''Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed.''
 The first part of this passage was almost surely intended as a paraphrase of words that John Maynard Keynes wrote as the world was plunging into the Great Depression -- and it was a great relief, after decades of knee-jerk denunciations of government, to hear a new president giving a shout-out to Keynes. ''The resources of nature and men's devices,'' Keynes wrote, ''are just as fertile and productive as they were. The rate of our progress towards solving the material problems of life is not less rapid. We are as capable as before of affording for everyone a high standard of life. ... But today we have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle, having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand.''
 But something was lost in translation. Mr. Obama and Keynes both assert that we're failing to make use of our economic capacity. But Keynes's insight -- that we're in a ''muddle'' that needs to be fixed -- somehow was replaced with standard we're-all-at-fault, let's-get-tough-on-ourselves boilerplate.
 Remember, Herbert Hoover didn't have a problem making unpleasant decisions: he had the courage and toughness to slash spending and raise taxes in the face of the Great Depression. Unfortunately, that just made things worse.
 Still, a speech is just a speech. The members of Mr. Obama's economic team certainly understand the extraordinary nature of the mess we're in. So the tone of Tuesday's address may signify nothing about the Obama administration's future policy.
 On the other hand, Mr. Obama is, as his predecessor put it, the decider. And he's going to have to make some big decisions very soon. In particular, he's going to have to decide how bold to be in his moves to sustain the financial system, where the outlook has deteriorated so drastically that a surprising number of economists, not all of them especially liberal, now argue that resolving the crisis will require the temporary nationalization of some major banks. 
 So is Mr. Obama ready for that? Or were the platitudes in his Inaugural Address a sign that he'll wait for the conventional wisdom to catch up with events? If so, his administration will find itself dangerously behind the curve.
 And that's not a place that we want the new team to be. The economic crisis grows worse, and harder to resolve, with each passing week. If we don't get drastic action soon, we may find ourselves stuck in the muddle for a very long time.

HEADLINE: Google Beats Forecast Even as Its Profit Tapers

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Google's search advertising business continues to show resilience in the face of the deepening global recession.
 Google said Thursday that its net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 fell 68 percent from a year earlier largely because of one-time charges related to the declining value of two investments. But its revenue grew 18 percent, to $5.7 billion, beating Wall Street's recently lowered expectations. 
 The charges masked an otherwise good quarter for Google, in which strong sales and continued efforts to cut expenses pushed the company's profitability above forecasts. Analysts said the results indicated that while Google's growth continued to slow, its business model, often called ''paid search,'' appeared to be weathering the downturn. 
 ''Paid search is holding up far better than all other forms of advertising,'' said Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
 Google also said it would offer its employees the opportunity to exchange their stock options for ones with a lower exercise price -- the price employees would pay to convert an option into stock. The company said that plan was intended to retain workers as the value of Google's stock plummeted near 60 percent since its November 2007 peak.
 In a conference call with analysts, Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, said about 85 percent of the company's workers had stock options with an exercise price higher than the current price of Google's shares. Vesting of the new options will be delayed by one year, which should help Google retain employees, he said. 
 The total number of options would not change, Mr. Schmidt said, but the number that would ultimately be exercised and converted into stock would probably rise. ''It is a good deal for shareholders and for employees as well,'' he said. Google will take a charge of about $460 million over five years to account for the changes.
 The compensation research firm Equilar said that stock option exchanges and plans to reset the price of stock options were becoming increasingly common, as companies try to insulate workers from the declining value of the stock market. In January, 25 American companies announced repricing or option swap plans, half as many as in all of 2008, Equilar said.
 Mr. Schmidt said that he was pleased with the company's results and remained optimistic about Google's long-term prospects. 
 ''The business is quite healthy, especially given the tough economic climate,'' Mr. Schmidt said. But saying that the fourth quarter may have been the ''easy part,'' he noted that Google would not be immune to what appeared to be worsening economic conditions. 
 ''We don't know how long this period will last,'' he said.
 Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., said net income for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 was $382 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $3.79 a share, a year ago. It included one-time charges of $1.1 billion to account for the declining value of Google's investments in the wireless broadband provider Clearwire and the AOL unit of Time Warner. 
 Profit, excluding those charges and items like stock-based compensation, was $5.10 a share, up from $3.79 a share a year earlier. Analysts had expected Google to report profit on that basis of $4.96 a share.
 Google's net revenue, which excludes commissions it pays to marketing partners, jumped nearly 25 percent, to $4.22 billion, from $3.39 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected net revenue to be $4.12 billion. The company said that paid clicks, the number of times that users clicked on advertisements, grew 18 percent from a year earlier. 
 Despite the strong results, some analysts saw signs of weakness in Google's business, including a decline in the prices that marketers were paying for clicks. 
 ''It was a holiday season in which retailers were desperately trying to move inventory and consumers were searching for discounts,'' said Todd Greenwald, an analyst with Signal Hill Capital Group. Mr. Greenwald said those dynamics might have helped Google, as they encouraged retailers to buy search ads and users to click on them. Mr. Greenwald said current Wall Street forecasts for 2009 might be too high.
 Google's results were helped by the company's continuing efforts to control expenses. For example, Google added only 99 workers in the quarter, to end the year with 20,222, the lowest rate of hiring since the company went public in 2004. 
 The cost-cutting efforts, meager compared with what many other companies are doing, appeared to have broadened in the last three months. Google scaled back its use of contractors and cut annual holiday gifts to employees. In recent weeks, the company also canceled several small projects that were unsuccessful and said it would lay off 100 recruiters because it had slowed its hiring pace. 
 Asked whether Google planned to make deeper cuts in its work force or to cancel bigger projects, Mr. Schmidt said in an interview: ''It is highly unlikely.''

HEADLINE: Microsoft Slashes Jobs As Sales Fall

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- With sales of computers deteriorating by the day, the PC industry's dominant players -- Microsoft and Intel -- have arrived at the stark realization that the slump in sales could last a long time, perhaps years.
''We are certainly in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime set of economic conditions,'' Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, told investors Thursday in a conference call to discuss the company's dismal second-quarter financial results. ''Our model is not for a quick rebound. Our model is things go down, and then they reset. The economy shrinks.'' 
To help it cope with that lower base of demand, Microsoft said that it would lay off up to 5,000 employees, or about 5 percent of its work force -- the first significant cuts in the company's 34-year history. The layoffs follow a rare decline in sales of Microsoft's Windows operating system for personal and business computers in the second fiscal quarter. Net income for the period, which ended Dec. 31, fell 11 percent to $4.17 billion.
Other major players in the personal computer industry are reporting similar drops in demand and paring their work forces to adjust.
Intel, the leading maker of chips for PCs, said Wednesday that it would lay off 5,000 to 6,000 workers and shut production at some plants after revenue dropped 23 percent and net income fell 90 percent in the fourth quarter.
Advanced Micro Devices, also a large supplier of PC chips, reported a 33 percent decline in fourth-quarter revenue Thursday to $1.16 billion, while posting a $1.42 billion loss. Earlier this month, A.M.D. said it would reduce its work force by close to 9 percent.
Weakening sales for technology companies are hardly unusual in an economic downturn. Even Google, which reported a big increase in fourth-quarter revenue and operating profit on Thursday, has seen its growth slow. Microsoft executives suggested Thursday that this downturn is different from previous slumps, like the collapse in tech spending that followed the 2001 dot-com bust.
Rather than a recession, companies are witnessing a fall in consumer and business spending that could last for years and set a new low base for sales, Mr. Ballmer said. ''The economy is resetting to a lower level of business and consumer spending,'' he said.
Mr. Ballmer also said Microsoft would take a wait-and-see approach about acquisitions because company executives thought the price of potential targets would fall further. That gloomy assessment offers little hope to investors trying to figure out when tech stocks, which have plunged with the overall market, will hit bottom.
Both Microsoft and Intel, which are generally conservative in their public outlooks, declined to provide forecasts for future sales, saying they were uncomfortable with the proposition in an erratic economy.
''That's especially unusual for Microsoft,'' said Brendan Barnicle, a software analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. ''Historically, they have had some of the most accurate gauges of PCs, and they didn't even try to offer guidance.''
Analysts expect PC sales to fall about 8 percent in 2009, marking just the second time in the last two decades, including 2001, that PC sales will have declined for the year. Analysts at the research company Forrester say that surveys show people are putting off PC purchases and spending less on systems they do buy.
Other PC component makers like Nvidia, Seagate Technology and Western Digital have also grappled with evaporating sales and significant layoffs.
The reports from all of the component and software makers have set an ominous mood for Hewlett-Packard and Dell, the largest PC manufacturers, which report their financial results next month.
Some of Microsoft's immediate issues stem from changing trends in the PC market as well as missteps as it has tried to move into newer markets like Web search and Internet-based software delivery, or cloud computing.
Microsoft's revenue for the second quarter rose 2 percent, to $16.63 billion, and its earnings of 47 cents in the quarter missed the consensus forecast from Thomson Reuters by 2 cents. While sales of business software and Xbox gaming consoles aided the results, revenue from Windows dropped 8 percent, to $3.98 billion from $4.33 billion last year.
One factor that hurt sales of Windows was the rise of netbooks -- a type of cheap, compact laptop that is growing in popularity, especially in Asia. The devices use less powerful chips than typical PCs, and as a result, Microsoft must offer the less bulky Windows XP instead of Vista on the netbooks and sell it at a discount in order to remain competitive with the open-source Linux operating system.
Looking long term, Microsoft's traditional PC software business could face even more pressure because 30 to 40 percent of the revenue comes from corporate subscriptions that stretch over a number of years. Layoffs and reduced capital spending mean that Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., may see fewer subscriptions when renewal periods come up for customers.
With so much dependence on the Windows and Office franchises, Microsoft has been trying to diversify its business. Most notably, the company made a failed bid for Yahoo to try to bolster its online search business and compete better against Google.
Microsoft said Thursday that it would replace some of the fired workers with new hires, many of them to handle search, as it tries to grow new businesses.
''They have never dealt with a situation where PCs didn't just keep going up, and there's this sense that now is the time to start and write its next chapter,'' Mr. Barnicle said. Microsoft's online business continued to lose money in the quarter, placing added pressure on the company to do something more drastic.
Richard Williams, an analyst at Cross Research, complained that Microsoft's layoffs and other cost cuts appeared cosmetic because it employs 94,000 people.
''Microsoft really needs to materially boost its effort in the Web,'' he said. ''The match with Yahoo makes even more sense now.''

HEADLINE: It's Not Their Money

 BODY:
What is it with American bankers and their sense of entitlement? 
 After losing billions, taking billions from taxpayers and avoiding disaster only by selling itself to Bank of America, Merrill Lynch was still ready to give a multimillion-dollar ''performance'' bonus to its chief executive, John Thain. It refrained only after a storm of protest that reached from Main Street to Capitol Hill. 
 As it turns out, the outrage was not enough to stop the flow of money to other executives. According to a report in The Financial Times on Thursday, Merrill granted $3 billion to $4 billion in bonuses in December -- part of a total compensation budget of $15 billion for the year that was just slightly less than that of 2007.
 The year-end bonuses were approved by Merrill's compensation committee just days after shareholders approved the merger and days before Bank of America was made aware of Merrill's stunning fourth-quarter losses. The news of the rushed bonuses almost prompted Bank of America to pull out of the deal and ultimately required the Treasury to provide an extra $20 billion, as well as a guarantee on billions more in potential losses. 
 Mr. Thain stepped down on Thursday. But the problem is not one banker. The entire financial industry must be made to understand that the billions it has gotten from the public purse are not a reward for the havoc it wreaked on the financial system and the lives of so many Americans.
 The $700 billion federal rescue package was meant to shore up the banks' balance sheets and revive moribund lending to consumers and corporations. But banks have mostly refused to increase lending. Some healthy banks have used government money to buy their more sickly brethren -- which might raise their standing but does the economy little good. 
 Many have been lavishing dividends on their shareholders. JPMorgan Chase has maintained its dividend despite plunging profits, squandering needed capital. Citigroup and Bank of America cut their dividends only when they got a second helping of rescue funds.
 Though the Obama administration has not set specific criteria for the next chapter of the bank rescue, President Obama insisted he would toughen the restrictions. Clear rules are needed to limit dividends and give the government the option to block mergers between banks receiving taxpayer funds. 
 The vague rules on executive pay in the rescue legislation must also be tightened. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed banning bonuses altogether for the top 25 executives of a bank that is getting money from the Treasury rescue package. The banking rescue package was meant to serve the American economy. It's not the bankers' money.

HEADLINE: Once a Boon, the Euro Is Now a Burden for Some

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: ATHENS 

 BODY:
''The Italians, the Spaniards, the Greeks, we all have been living in happy land, spending what we did not have,'' said George Economou, a Greek shipping magnate, contemplating his country's economic troubles and others' from his spacious boardroom. ''It was a fantasy world.''
 For some of the countries on the periphery of the 16-member euro currency zone -- Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- this debt-fired dream of endless consumption has turned into the rudest of nightmares, raising the risk that a euro country may be forced to declare bankruptcy or abandon the currency.
 The prospect, however unlikely, is a humbling one. The adoption of the euro just a decade ago was meant to pull Europe together economically and politically, ending the sometimes furious battles over who could devalue their currency the fastest and beggar their neighbor. 
 For the Continent, the currency signaled the potential to one day rival the United States. For its poorer countries, winning admission to the euro zone was a point of pride, showing that they had tamed their budget deficits and set their financial houses in order.
 Now, in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the euro's birth, a new view is emerging -- especially as the creditworthiness of Greece, Spain and Portugal, one after the other, has been downgraded. The view is that the balm of euro membership allowed these countries to gloss over serious economic problems that have now roared to the fore.
 ''Membership is not a panacea for a country's social and economic problems,'' said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. 
 ''In fact, there has been a huge divergence in competitiveness that shows up in massive trade imbalances,'' he said, comparing Greece with the wealthier euro countries. ''While Greece may have been insulated from the risk of a currency crisis, there is also the risk of a credit crisis and a collapse of confidence in its solvency.''
 While sharing a currency with some of the mightiest economies in the world helped Europe's poorer nations share in the wealth, a boon during boom times, in hard times the rules of membership are keeping them from doing what countries normally do to ride out economic storms, including enormous spending. 
 So Germany, France and the Scandinavian countries are mounting billion-dollar stimulus plans and erecting fences to protect their banks. But the peripheral economies are being left to twist in the market winds.
 With the need for stimulus to deal with the severe downturn, these countries find themselves caught in an awful policy bind: credit is available, but only at punitive rates; and further borrowing not only breaks with European Commission dictates but raises broader questions about their solvency.
 Bond and currency speculators have demonstrated that they intend to punish countries with dubious economic prospects, just as they have punished banks. Yields are skyrocketing on the debt of peripheral European economies with growing deficits. The British pound has plummeted because of a lack of confidence in plans to shore up British banks.
 Few experts expect Greece or the other Mediterranean countries to run out of money or leave the euro. But the widening gap between the interest rate that Greece and larger economies like Germany have to pay to borrow reveals the first cracks in what so far has been a fairly solid fortress Europe.
 Standard & Poor's has also downgraded the debt of Spain, another growth stalwart, because of the toll taken by its housing crisis. 
 In Ireland, once the high-growth darling of the European Union, the economy continues to reel from a housing collapse and a defunct banking sector with liabilities that surpass the country's gross domestic product. 
 As with Greece, bond yields there are diverging from those in Germany. The apparent suicide of a prominent real estate developer, Patrick Rocca, is but the most recent reminder of the fear and shock gripping the country.
 But Greece's problems are probably the worst. The country has been an easy target for the vigilantes of the European bond market, and recently it has been shaken by a wave of violent protests.
 The omnipotent hand of the Greek state produced a public debt of more than 90 percent of Greece's total economic output. The relentlessly rising demand of its consumers, who were able to put off the day of reckoning because they enjoyed the shelter of the low-inflation euro, has created a current-account deficit of 14 percent of its gross domestic product -- estimated to be the highest in Europe. 
 The current account measures the difference between a nation's exports and imports of all goods and services.
 Last week, Standard & Poor's downgraded Greek debt to A--, and the gap between the interest rate it pays on its bonds, versus what richer countries like Germany pay, is nearly 3 percentage points, the widest in the euro zone.
 Mr. Economou, the Greek shipping company operator, is caught in the crossfire. The stock of his company, DryShips, is down 90 percent; banks in Europe that once clamored for his business no longer do so.
 ''The psychology is shattered,'' he said with a rueful smile as he considered the blow to his business and net worth. ''I have already cried -- now I have dried up.''
 While a shock to many Greeks, who had become accustomed to the relatively recent comfort of buoyant economic growth and a strong currency, some others, who lived through the country's past financial and political crises, say the current shakiness is to be expected.
 ''We knew this couldn't last,'' Vassilis Karatzas, a fund manager based in Athens, said as he sipped Greek coffee at an outdoor cafe in the city center. ''There is fear about the euro zone, but I don't think the commission will allow its periphery to go down. United we rise, divided we fall.''
 Yannis Stournaras, an economist who was a top economic adviser to the previous government of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, says that after a long period of convergence, the recent Greek divergence from northern Europe is to be expected.
 Adding to the pressure, surpluses from countries like Germany are no longer being recycled back to Greece and other less prosperous countries. Moreover, Germany, the largest exporter in the world, tends not to encourage its consumers to buy more from the rest of Europe.
 But Mr. Stournaras scoffed at the prospect of a bankruptcy like those once common in Latin America. Nor did he accept the idea that Greece might leave the euro zone and try to devalue its way back to recovery.
 ''Bankruptcy? No, no, no,'' he said with a vigorous shake of his head. ''Since the beginning of the 20th century, we have never had problems with our arrears.''
 But others are not prepared to rule out such an event, though they concede it is highly unlikely. 
 One of the few politicians in Greece who has not shied from addressing these issues is Stefanos Manos, a gregarious former economic minister who in the early 1990s ushered in a drastic, and ultimately successful, privatization program.
 He has founded a new party and is considering a return to Parliament in the hope of joining a new government that would heed his longstanding message: Greece needs to stop running deficits and address the issue of global competitiveness.
 ''We need money to finance our deficits and I see difficulty in us attracting such funds from abroad,'' he said, as he received a string of admirers in the Old World splendor of the Hotel Grande Bretagne in Athens. ''I am not sure that this won't spiral out ofcontrol, and that makes me saddened and frustrated.''
 As for the rest of Europe, particularly its weaker links, he also has doubts.
 ''I don't think Europe is up to it,'' he said. ''It expanded too rapidly without fixing its institutions.''

HEADLINE: Surviving in a Financial World With Limits

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Sympathy for Wall Street is in short supply at the moment, particularly when it comes to bonuses. With the unemployment level at a 16-year high of 7.2 percent, most Americans are happy if they have a job. And this is particularly true in financial services, where the most storied names seem as stable as dot-com companies in 2001. 
 Yet after years of plenty, the early word on compensation is striking. One Goldman Sachs executive who was paid bonuses in excess of $10 million for several years was told total compensation for 2008 would be $1.5 million. Bonuses at Citibank have fallen anywhere from 20 to 100 percent for some in investment banking, while base salaries have been frozen. Financial advisers at Merrill Lynch spent this week sweating out whether promised retention packages would show up in their bank accounts on Friday or get derailed as news worsens about the merger with Bank of America. And then there are the directors and managing directors at Credit Suisse who are going to receive a portion of their bonus in illiquid securities created by their co-workers. 
 ''They're saying that's not our fault,'' one recently departed Credit Suisse banker said of his former colleagues. ''They say that was the traders. Why should we punished by that?'' 
 Ah, but this is a year when the sins of a few are being paid for by many. And few people are going to cry for the investment banker or corporate lawyer who has to sell his beach house on Nantucket -- especially when billions in taxpayer money are propping up their firms. Still, this sudden austerity coming after such a flush run is shocking the once-wealthy. If the next 12 to 18 months turn out to be as bad as many predict, this is not a time for self-pity: it is a moment to adopt survival techniques. 
 ''The goal is not to win, but in this environment to live to fight another day,'' said S. Alexander Haverstick II, managing partner at Boxwood Strategic Advisors in New York.
 And the lessons learned are useful not just to those who once got seven- and eight-figure Wall Street bonuses but also to anyone overextended and struggling to keep up with monthly payments.
 RE-EVALUATE The first thing on your list should be to take a long, hard look at what you have, what you need and what you can afford. This may seem like an odd exercise for someone who has been earning a lot of money for many years. But the combination of a precipitous drop in income and a decrease in the value of your portfolio -- particularly for those with concentrated positions in bank stocks -- has upended household balance sheets. One rule of thumb is that when liabilities dwarf assets, it's time to cut and run. 
 Robert Elliott, senior managing director at Bessemer Trust, says people need to realize that bonuses were always discretionary and that they are unlikely to return to their high levels anytime soon. ''What are my core expenditures? What are my discretionary expenditures?'' he asked. If you can't cut back and get down to your base salary, he added, ''Then you've geared your lifestyle way beyond your needs.''
 GOODBYE BEACH HOUSE The first thing to go should be the secondary residence. If you bought a summer house by pledging stock that has lost more than half its value, you are looking at a serious margin call. When a private bank lent you $10 million and you had bank stock worth $100 million, that was a conservative loan on the bank's part -- only 10 percent of your net worth. Now that your stock is worth $50 million, the loan-to-value ratio on your beach house is not looking as solid for the bank. 
 While it may crush you to sell your mansion in the Hamptons in such a depressed real estate market, it is better than going through a forced restructuring. ''People have to be prepared for three to four years of diminished expectations,'' Mr. Haverstick said. 
 REFOCUS This is no time for assets that don't produce income -- particularly those with high carrying costs. Second and third homes fall into this category. But so do multiple nannies, yachts and horse farms. People who are overextended need to act as if the good old days are gone forever. In this economy, covering living expenses from your cash flow will leave you better positioned for when the economy picks up. 
 (And what should you do with money freed up from selling those assets? The consensus is cash and municipal bonds will help you get reoriented.)
 DON'T DOUBLE DOWN Believing Wall Street has run out of ways to make lots of money is like betting against Tiger Woods: you'll most likely lose. But you have to think like Mr. Woods as he recovers from knee surgery: the key now is patience. If your portfolio has lost 45 percent, putting what you have left into investments that could yield 25 percent but could also go bust is not a wise decision. This may seem obvious, but in tough times people get desperate. 
 DOUBLE WHAMMY. Your bonus may have left you scrambling to reorganize your assets and liabilities. Shares in your company may be cheaper than a Starbuck's latte, but be thankful if you are not required to own company stock pegged to your compensation. 
 Robert Barbetti, managing director and executive compensation specialist for J.P. Morgan Private Bank, says many high-ranking executives are required to own stock in their company worth five to six times their annual compensation. It doesn't take a hedge fund wizard to do the math here: if a company's share price has plunged 50 percent, top executives are going to have to double their holdings to reach the required level. 
 One way that companies help executives meet this requirement is to increase the percentage of their compensation that is in stock. Mr. Barbetti says that for some, this could be as high as 70 percent of their compensation this year, which means these executives could find themselves dealing with the same personal liquidity issues. On this, the Wall Street executives who made a show of declining their bonuses may again be ahead of the game: by not taking the bonuses, they are lowering the percentage between compensation and the stock they hold.
 RAY OF HOPE Here is one bit of good news. People who had deferred compensation plans before 2005 may be able to access them now. The 2004 American Jobs Creation Act froze the account values in existing plans on the last day of that year. If your old plan allows it, you can withdraw the money you accumulated up to that point. You will have to pay a 10 percent penalty -- as well as ordinary income tax on the amount you take out -- but it is a quick cash fix. Consider it the high-net-worth equivalent of tapping your 401(k) plan for a low-interest loan. It is not desirable but it works as a stop gap.
 While the gloom in the financial system is unlikely to abate before the second half of this year, making tough decisions now could salvage what is left. ''The message is resonating and it's uncomfortable,'' Mr. Elliott said. But uncomfortable now is better than insolvent down the road.

HEADLINE: Now Hip-Hop, Too, Is Made in China

BYLINE: By JIMMY WANG; Wang Yao contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
A week before Americans tune in to the Super Bowl, another televised mega-event will kick off on the other side of the globe. On Sunday more than half a billion people here are expected to watch the annual Chinese Lunar New Year gala. Organized by the state-owned China Central Television, the marathon event showcases the country's musical diversity with an extensive lineup of Chinese pop stars performing hit songs. But one genre audiences are unlikely to see is Chinese hip-hop, despite its growing popularity among the country's urban youth. 
 Over the last decade many students and working-class Chinese have been writing rap as a form of self-expression. Rougher and more rebellious than the well-scrubbed pop that floods the airwaves here, this kind of hip-hop is not sanctioned by broadcast media producers or state censors but has managed to attract a grass-roots fan base. 
 ''Hip-hop is free, like rock 'n' roll -- we can talk about our lives, what we're thinking about, what we feel,'' said Wang Liang, 25, a popular hip-hop D.J. in China who is known as Wordy. ''The Chinese education system doesn't encourage you to express your own character. They feed you stale rules developed from books passed down over thousands of years. There's not much opportunity for personal expression or thought; difference is discouraged.'' 
 While American rappers like Eminem and Q-Tip have been popular in China since the 1990s, home-grown rap didn't start gaining momentum until a decade later. The group Yin Ts'ang (its name means ''hidden''), one of the pioneers of Chinese rap, is made up of global nomads: a Beijinger, a Chinese-Canadian and two Americans. 
 ''The big change was when rappers started writing verse in Chinese, so people could understand,'' said Zhong Cheng, 27, a member of the group who was raised in Canada but born in Beijing, where he returned in 1997. ''Before that, kids listened to hip-hop in English but maybe less than 1 percent could actually begin to understand.''
 Yin Ts'ang's first hit was ''In Beijing,'' from the band's 2003 debut album, ''Serve the People'' (Scream Records); the title is a twist on an old political slogan. It sets a melody played on a thousand-year-old Chinese fiddle called the Erhu against a hip-hop beat that brings Run D.M.C. to mind. The song, an insider's look at Beijing's sights and sounds, took the underground music scene by storm, finding its way into karaoke parlors, the Internet and even the playlist of a radio station in Beijing. 
 ''There's a lot of cats that can rap back home,'' said Jeremy Johnston, a member of the group and the son of a United States Air Force captain. ''But there's not a lot of cats that can rap in Chinese.'' Mr. Johnston, 33, moved to Beijing in the late '90s because, he said, it was ''the thing nobody else was doing.'' 
 Since ''In Beijing,'' the Chinese hip-hop scene has quickly grown. Hiphop.cn, a Web site listing events and links to songs, started with just a few hundred members in 2007; in 2008 it received millions of views, according to one of the site's directors. 
 Dozens of hip-hop clubs have opened up in cities across the country, and thousands of raps and music videos by Chinese M.C.'s are spreading over the Internet. But making Chinese hip-hop is still a relatively profitless -- and often subversive -- activity. Some Chinese rappers address what they see as the country's most glaring injustices. As Wong Li, a 24-year-old from Dongbei, says in one of his freestyle raps:
 If you don't have a nice car or cash
 You won't get no honeys
 Don't you know China is only a heaven for rich old men
 You know this world is full of corruption
 Babies die from drinking milk.
 He often performs in a downtown Beijing nightclub and uses Chinese proverbs in his lyrics to create social commentary. 
 Mr. Wong, who became interested in hip-hop when he heard Public Enemy in the mid-'90s, said rapping helps him deal with bitterness that comes with realizing he is one of the millions left out of China's economic boom. 
 ''All people care about is money,'' he said. ''If you don't have money, you're treated like garbage. And if you're not local to the city you live in, people discriminate against you; they give you the worst jobs to do.'' 
 In the recent hit ''Hello Teacher,'' Yin Tsar, one of the hip-hop scene's biggest acts (its name means ''The Three Shadows'') rails against the authority of unfair teachers: ''You're supposed to be a role model, but I've seen you spit in public.''
 Shuo chang, the Chinese word for hip-hop, translates to ''speak sing'' and is a loaded term. It also describes a contentious subject for musicians, producers and fans in China. Hong Kong, mainland and Taiwanese pop stars who have their own spin on hip-hop dominate the mainstream here. Many tack high-speed raps onto the end of their songs, even ballads, and consider themselves rappers. 
 They rap about love ''and call it hip-hop when it isn't,'' said Wang Liang, the D.J.
 Jay Chou, a popular pop singer turned rapper from Taiwan who has been featured in advertisements for Pepsi, Panasonic and China Mobile, is the archetype of a mainstream performer here. Clean-cut and handsome, he appeals to a sense of nationalist pride. His hit song ''Huo Yuanjia'' is based on a patriotic Chinese martial artist glorified in Chinese textbooks for traveling the country to challenge foreigners in physical combat. Fans of Mr. Chou vehemently assert that his music is hip-hop, while denigrating groups like Yin Tsar. 
 ''I don't know what groups like Yin Tsar are trying to do,'' said Hua Lina, 35, an accountant. ''They dress like bums, and sometimes they take off their shirts at performances, screaming like animals. Their lyrics are dirty -- why would I want to pay to see that?'' 
 While Beijing's underground music scene is generally under the authorities' radar -- hip-hop, indie rock and reggae groups perform regularly at nightclubs here -- the producers representing broadcast media in China avoid musicians perceived as threatening. 
 ''There are pockets of freedom here,'' said Wong Miao, 24, the director of Acupuncture Records, which doubles as a collective of D.J.'s. ''Anyone can play what they want in clubs, and as long as you aren't insulting the party, generally you'll be left alone. But if you want to take the next step to becoming mainstream, you hit a wall. If you aren't singing their type of stuff or aren't incredibly rich, they won't sign you.''
 Additionally, because of rampant music piracy, the corporate support of artists approved by powerful producers is one of the few ways to generate revenue for musicians here. Because corporate advertisers almost always seek out pop stars who have been given the blessing of producers representing state-run media, the underground music scene has had to live off the enthusiasm of young music aficionados without ever being able to gain backing to spread beyond nightclub walls.
 After seven years together, Mr. Zhong and Mr. Johnston of Yin Ts'ang still struggle to pay the bills, but they haven't stopped making hip-hop, which they now do under their own independent label, YinEnt.
 In a nondescript apartment on the west side of Beijing, Mr. Johnston nodded his head to a song playing on his computer while Mr. Zhong explained how the group started: 
 ''When I got here and met Jeremy, we were both so inspired by these people, we were like, 'Let's drop some Chinese rhymes for the locals,' and our Chinese friendswere like, 'There are no Chinese rhymes!,' and we were like, 'That's crazy!' From that day, we haven't stopped rhyming.''

HEADLINE: In Europe, a Former High School Star Sends Home a Warning

BYLINE: By RAY GLIER

 BODY:
Perhaps white sails will one day appear on the horizon behind Brandon Jennings, a flotilla of high school basketball stars trailing him to Europe eager for a payday. But Jennings does not want anyone to get shipwrecked overseas just because he made the trip.
 He issued that warning this week from Italy, where he is playing for Lottomatica Virtus Roma, a top professional team. He fears that top high school players may be seduced by visions of instant riches, fame and success in Spain, France, Italy, Greece or some other destination. 
 ''I've gotten paid on time once this year,'' Jennings said in an e-mail message. ''They treat me like I'm a little kid. They don't see me as a man. If you get on a good team, you might not play a lot. Some nights you'll play a lot; some nights you won't play at all. That's just how it is.''
 Jennings, a 6-foot-2 point guard who was regarded as the nation's best high school player at his position a year ago, signed a $1.2 million deal in salary and endorsements to head to Europe in August instead of staying in the United States to play college basketball. Some analysts suggested that other elite players would follow the same path because of the rules requiring prospects to be a year removed from high school before becoming eligible for the N.B.A. draft.
 The deal for Jennings allowed his mother and his half brother to live with him in Italy, and he said it still made economic sense. Yet he said he wanted others to know about his experience. 
 ''I don't see too many kids doing it,'' his e-mail message said. ''It's tough man, I'll tell you that. It can break you.''
 Lottomatica Virtus Roma officials did not respond to requests for comment submitted through Francesca Mei, the team's media director.
 Jennings does not resemble the pioneer some envisioned when he left for Europe as a dynamic player who could create his own shots and score 20 points or more a game. In Italy, he said, he has been stifled offensively. He is averaging 8 points a game.
 ''My role is to play D and take open shots -- that's it,'' he said. ''And I've accepted that role.''
 He acknowledged that the journey had helped him mature, and he said the rigors of playing in Europe may benefit others.
 An N.B.A. assistant coach who has been to Europe and has watched Jennings play said his potential draft standing had not been harmed. The coach requested anonymity because he was discussing a player currently ineligible for the draft.
 ''I think it is good for him,'' he said. ''He was getting a defensive component that he needed. If I was a scout and I needed a point guard, I would be extremely impressed with what he has done over there.'' 
 Several of the top-rated players in the high school class of 2009 said they would not follow Jennings to Europe: 
 Derrick Favors, a 6-9 forward from South Atlanta High School in Georgia who is considered by some to be the nation's top prospect, has announced he will sign with Georgia Tech this spring. ''I'm definitely going to college,'' he said.
 DeMarcus Cousins, a 6-10 forward who plays for LeFlore Magnet High in Mobile, Ala., said he also would attend college. His father, Jessie Cousins, said the family had not had contact with European teams.
 Renardo Sidney, a 6-10 forward at Fairfax High in Los Angeles, intends to play in college, said Harvey Kitani, his coach.
 Lance Stephenson, a 6-5 guard at Abraham Lincoln High in Brooklyn, wants to play in college, according to his coach, Dwayne Morton. 
 And Xavier Henry, a 6-6 guard at Putnam City High in Oklahoma, has announced he will attend Memphis.
 Bob Gibbons, a North Carolina-based recruiting analyst, said all of those players would be considered N.B.A. draft prospects this year were it not for the league's eligibility requirements. That does not mean they should rush to audition for European teams, he said.
 ''Myself, among others, thought there would be a revolution and players going to Europe,'' Gibbons said. ''I'm not so sure now after what I have been hearing with Jennings and all the cultural obstacles there are.''
 Michael Reddick, who coaches Favors at South Atlanta, described Europe as ''a man's league.''
 ''There are a lot of things you have to consider to do something like that,'' Reddick said. ''I played over there 12 years, and it is not easy.''
 Paul Hewitt, the Georgia Tech coach, said high school players needed to understand the cultural differences, including language barriers, and the challenges of being homesick and of having to manage daily affairs. If a high school star does skip college for the pros in Europe, Hewitt said, he should negotiate for the team to pay for college in case of an injury or lack of development.
 Sonny Vaccaro, the former sneaker company executive who brokered Jennings's deals with Lottomatica and the sponsor Under Armour, said he had been in contact with high school players and their parents who were interested in Europe.
 But Vaccaro said there had been a change from last summer, when he worked on the deals for Jennings. Economic conditions in Europe are just as difficult as they are in the United States, and he said he underestimated the emotional strength a player needed to compete overseas.
 ''A less-driven kid would have come home,'' Vaccaro said. ''They practice twice a day, and the Europeans play everybody. It is not like one of these silly college games where the same seven guys play every minute of every game. When it's over, the fact he was able to handle it is going to be more landmark than him just going over there.''
 Pete Babcock, the former general manager of the Atlanta Hawks and the Denver Nuggets, said high school players in the United States had grown up watching college basketball. Their dreams are to play for those programs, he said, not in obscurity in Europe.
 ''There is not going to be a mass exodus,'' said Babcock, now a scout for the Cleveland Cavaliers. ''I don't see it happening.''

HEADLINE: Manhattan Is So Close, and Yet So Far

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
The Chocolate Factory Theater unveils its experimental performances in the shrewdly chosen locale of Long Island City, Queens: post-industrial enough to lure Manhattan culture mavens in search of grit, yet reassuringly just a single subway stop from Grand Central Station. 
 That is, unless the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is working on the tracks. 
 A few weeks ago, as the theater directors worked on a new show that opens Feb. 12, they learned that their section of the No. 7 line, Queens's lifeline to Manhattan, would be closed on weekends through early March. The shutdown of four stops -- Grand Central and three Long Island City stations -- cuts off the most direct link between Times Square and the Queensboro Plaza hub, marooning Long Island City riders and complicating many commutes between Queens and Midtown. 
 M.T.A. shuttle buses will run from the Long Island City stops to Queensboro Plaza, where riders can take the N line to Manhattan (and with a bit of a walk to transfer, the E), but the trip to Grand Central, ordinarily about five minutes, can now take closer to 40. And the theater's founders know from experience that the slightest complication is enough to scare away 50 percent of their audiences, who were not that confident about finding their way to Queens in the first place.
 ''Part of how this neighborhood is being sold is on its convenience,'' said Sheila Lewandowski, the theater's executive director, who has lived in Long Island City for 11 years. ''You have to do maintenance. But there's no forward thinking that includes the community. If I knew a year ago, we could have rescheduled our opening.''
 It is the latest episode in what Queens residents have come to think of as an annual rite. 
 ''It happens every single year: 'Happy New Year, we're going to have to cut your train off,' '' said City Councilman John C. Liu, who mounted a vociferous battle last year to force the authority to speed up and finish track work before the Asian Lunar New Year, the busiest weekend of the year for Flushing's Chinatown, at the end of the line. 
 ''They always say it's for 'signal and track work,' the same excuse,'' Mr. Liu said.
 City Councilman Eric N. Gioia said the transit agency and its riders had become so inured to conflict that they did not push for creative solutions, like sending the shuttle buses through the Queens-Midtown Tunnel or offering free Long Island Rail Road rides to Pennsylvania Station.
 ''The public has gotten used to the M.T.A. doing the bare minimum, and the M.T.A. has gotten used to being criticized,'' Mr. Gioia said. ''They no longer get the benefit of the doubt when they say, 'Trust us on this, we're doing the best we can.' ''
 Transit officials, reacting to the annual barrage of complaints, sounded put-upon.
 ''I've been riding the 7 line for the majority of my 40-plus years on this God-given earth,'' said Paul J. Fleuranges, a spokesman for the authority. ''Is it inconvenient? Yes. That said, if you don't work on the railroad, the railroad doesn't work.''
 Lou Brusati, a group general manager who oversees the repairs on the No. 7 line, said the authority suffered, too: ''It's a burden on us to get the buses, drivers, transfer the people -- it becomes chaotic.'' 
 The authority has a tough maintenance job. Many lines are a century old. Tracks deteriorate because the subway works around the clock; other cities close subways at night, allowing more routine maintenance. On lines like the No. 7, with only two tracks, there is no option to reroute trains past the work area. 
 And then, transit officials -- like the unfortunates in charge of parades and alternate-side parking rules -- have to deal with New York's myriad constituencies.
 The No. 7 line, an artery to Shea Stadium, cannot close during the baseball season, they explained in weary tones. It cannot close between Thanksgiving and Christmas. It cannot close during peak hours. 
 Crews cannot work only overnight, said Deidre Taylor, the line's deputy general manager, because they are replacing a curved section of elevated track. Work on curves requires more time, she said, and night work on the elevated is too dangerous.
 In 2007, Mr. Gioia, whose district includes Irish areas along the No. 7 line, fought to keep it open on St. Patrick's Day. Mr. Liu followed suit for the Lunar New Year. 
 Doris Nowillo Suda, a neighborhood activist, said the inconvenience would slow the flow of ''city people'' who buoy new restaurants and growing cultural institutions in Queens, like the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center. And real estate agents trying to lure Manhattanites to Queens do not relish explaining the circuitous alternate route as they show apartments on weekends.
 But lest anyone think that this year's offended parties include only artsy and gentrifying Queens, there is also Andres Tobon, 18, who works weekends at Sage General Store, a restaurant on Jackson Avenue -- which, in a turn of bad luck, this month began opening on weekends. He often goes from work to weekend classes at Baruch College in Manhattan, he said, but canceled this semester's classes because the longer commute could have made him late.
 Then there are weekend shift workers who commute to Manhattan: technicians at hospitals, doormen, janitors for whom a taxi ride home would eat several hours' wages. They will find long waits in the cold especially frustrating given the prospect of a fare increase during an economic downturn, Ms. Suda said. 
 Josh Grisetti, 27, moved to Long Island City for the relatively affordable rents, but now finds the East River divide wider than usual.
 ''There's no reason it should take me 45 minutes,'' he said. ''I live right across the water.'' 
 The inconvenience is especially irritating now that Mr. Grisetti is starring in ''Enter Laughing,'' a Mel Brooks-style musical at the Theater at St. Peter's on Lexington Avenue. Rehearsals started just after the weekend shutdown began on Jan. 3. The play, with most of its shows on weekends, opened on Wednesday. It closes March 8, just before the line resumes regular service.

HEADLINE: In Rhode Island, Hoping a Tall Ship Can Help a Sagging Economy

BYLINE: By ARIANA GREEN

DATELINE: NEWPORT, R.I. 

 BODY:
Among the luxury yachts and commercial fishing boats in this city's famous harbor rests a giant steel hull that officials hope will be an economic engine in troubled times.
 As Rhode Island struggles with one of the nation's highest unemployment rates, city and state officials hope that turning the hull into a tall ship will create jobs, attract tourists and spur interest in the state's maritime history.
 Tall Ships Rhode Island, a nonprofit group based here, bought the hull last year for $339,000 from a group in Canada that could not afford to finish building a replica of an 1812 ship. The tall ship will be named the Oliver Hazard Perry, after the naval hero of the War of 1812 who was born in Rhode Island. 
 The ship, which is expected to set sail in 2011, will be a reproduction of a square-rigged warship with three masts. At 207 feet long and 13 stories tall, it will be the nation's largest tall ship besides the Eagle, a Coast Guard bark, said Capt. Richard Bailey, who will command the Oliver Hazard Perry.
 Gov. Donald L. Carcieri has been urging Rhode Islanders to consider working in the marine industry, long a staple of the state's cultural identity and economy. A recent report by the Rhode Island Marine Trade Association showed 450 job vacancies in the field and estimated that the state would need to fill 2,400 maritime jobs in the next 5 to 10 years.
 Considering the state's 10 percent unemployment rate, the vacancies are striking. But such jobs are highly specialized.
 ''You need a significant amount of technical knowledge,'' said Dennis Nixon, a dean of the University of Rhode Island who helped found the International Marina Institute, ''because some of the boats built in Rhode Island are among the most sophisticated in world.'' 
 After the design phase, the Oliver Hazard Perry will be transferred to a commercial shipyard to finish construction. The project is expected to cost almost $5 million, said Bart Dunbar, chairman of Tall Ships Rhode Island and president of the Bowen's Wharf Company, which owns a lot of harborside property.
 So far, about a third of the money has been raised through contributions from Bowen's Wharf, individuals and corporations like Bank Newport, which contributed $25,000.
 Mr. Dunbar said he expected that the organization would get up to $2 million in a bank loan, $500,000 in federal grants and donated equipment in exchange for sponsorships. Mr. Dunbar said he hoped the remaining costs would be covered by private gifts.
 When the American Sail Training Association first published its directory of tall ships in 1990, there were about half as many as there are today. In the last few years, several states have undertaken tall ship projects; Michigan launched the Friends Good Will; South Carolina, the Spirit of Carolina; and Virginia, the Spirit of Virginia. 
 ''Today cities realize they benefit from having a flagship for their community,'' said Timothy Walker, who teaches maritime history at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. ''It's a way to be really visible and make an impression that can travel. It can literally fly the flag for a community.''
 But Jeff Bolster, a professor of maritime history at the University of New Hampshire, said officials should not overestimate the economic contribution a ship project would make.
 ''A vessel of this scale is not going to be a huge help to the ailing economy,'' Mr. Bolster said. ''It has a modest operating budget, so it alone can't solve the state's fiscal problems in a major way.''
 Newport's ship is scheduled to spend at least 40 weeks a year at sea, with port calls in New England, Canada, the Great Lakes and the Caribbean. It will ferry day passengers, as well as groups of high school and college students on educational excursions. It will spend the rest of the year docked in Newport, which pleases local businesses.
 ''I run a company that is highly dependent on high-quality tourism coming to Newport, and I think a ship like this really adds to the historic allure and the maritime appeal,'' said Paul O'Reilly, chief executive of the Newport Harbor Corporation, a local hospitality company. ''We cannot compete with large convention hotels, so our special niche is our maritime history.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 31, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Saturday about efforts to build a replica of an 1812 ship in Rhode Island misstated its relative size among the nation's tall ships. Several museum ships are larger than the new ship; at 207 feet long and 13 stories tall, it would not be ''the nation's largest tall ship besides the Eagle, a Coast Guard bark.''

HEADLINE: Xerox 4th-Quarter Profit Falls to Nearly Nothing

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation said fourth-quarter profit shrank to nearly nothing, hurt by restructuring costs and a decline in demand from Russia. 
 Higher manufacturing costs resulting from an increase in the value of the Japanese yen also caused the company, a leading provider of digital printers and document management services, to forecast a first-quarter profit short of analysts' targets.
 Revenue from developing markets fell 14 percent, in contrast to growth of 17 percent in those markets in the first three quarters of the year. Xerox cited soft currency exchange rates and the rapid weakening of Russian and eastern European economies.
 Xerox said fourth-quarter net income was $1 million, or nil per share, down from $382 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding special items, including litigation charges, profit was 32 cents a share, a penny below the average Wall Street forecast.
 Late last year, Xerox announced a restructuring plan, including the elimination of about 3,000 jobs, aimed at saving $200 million in 2009. In the fourth quarter, restructuring charges were 27 cents a share.
 Revenue fell 10 percent, to $4.37 billion, from $4.88 billion. Revenue from sales of supplies and services fell 8 percent, to $3.1 billion. Equipment sale revenue declined 15 percent, to $1.3 billion, reflecting ''weakened economic conditions around the world,'' Xerox said.
 Xerox predicted first-quarter earnings of 16 to 20 cents a share, below the 24 cents analysts said they expected.
 Stock in Xerox, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., fell 53 cents, or 7 percent, to $7.06 a share.

HEADLINE: Credit Crisis Is Leaving Charities Low on Cash

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
SCO Family of Services, a nonprofit agency based on Long Island, started the year with a $25 million credit line at its bank, which it planned to use to pay its bills while awaiting government reimbursements and donations.
 Now, after its bank has cut its credit line twice and withdrawn a promise to support a critical bond offering, the organization is worried about whether it can pay its employees this month.
 ''I spend a good part of my day every day just trying to manage cash flow,'' said Johanna Richman, chief financial officer at SCO, which provides services to children with developmental disabilities.
 SCO is one of hundreds of charities caught in the credit crunch as skittish banks reduce their lines of credits or cut them off entirely at a time when the need for their services is climbing sharply, nonprofit leaders say. 
 ''While nonprofits are working feverishly to accommodate increased demand, they are facing severe financial constraints that are threatening their ability to go on, much less expand their services,'' said Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of Independent Sector, a nonprofit trade association.
 Almost three-quarters of nonprofits in the United States receive some type of government financing, according to new research by the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago, and about half of those count on that aid for at least half of their budgets.
 As a growing number of states delay payment, nonprofits must rely on lines of credit to help them get by. In Illinois, the state is running as much as 150 days late in making reimbursements, and California has told nonprofits to expect i.o.u.'s in lieu of payment starting next month.
 ''You can just imagine a nonprofit walking into a bank with this tattered envelope from Sacramento saying that some day the state government will pay it,'' said Thomas Peters, chief executive of the Marin Community Foundation in Marin County, Calif. ''How's a bank to make a loan against that promise?''
 The Marin foundation has been providing emergency and short-term grants to keep organizations like SCO alive, but Mr. Peters said it could not meet the demand for such money.
 Independent Sector has asked Congress to have the federal government make payments for social services directly to nonprofits, rather than funneling the money through state governments, as is the current practice. It is also seeking a $15 billion bridge loan program for nonprofits that can no longer tap banks for short-term loans.
 Nancy Biberman, president of the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, or Whedco, which provides services like child care and low-income housing in the Bronx, endorsed the idea of a bridge loan fund.
 ''We don't see any economic recovery money that's clearly flowing into poor communities,'' Ms. Biberman said. ''Infrastructure projects are not really where it's at when basic survival is at stake for so many people.''
 Whedco has just finished building what it calls the largest low-income ''green'' housing development in the country. The project was financed with a $39 million loan from a major bank.
 Last summer, New York City committed to provide $2 million more to the organization to underwrite additional amenities at the site, but the bank's risk managers turned down its request to increase the loan by that amount because Whedco did not yet have the money in hand.
 ''They were essentially challenging the full faith and credit of New York City,'' Ms. Biberman said.
 Moreover, in December the bank froze a $500,000 reserve fund held to guarantee interest payments, even though the project was 95 percent complete. ''That's our money,'' Ms. Biberman said, adding that, at most, Whedco would owe the bank 10 percent of that amount when it completed the project in the next few weeks.
 The inability to access the reserve fund has forced Whedco to ask some vendors to extend payment terms, a juggling act many nonprofit leaders are now performing. 
 Despite such complaints, Ms. Biberman and other nonprofit leaders declined to identify their banks for fear of further souring relations with them.
 Keith Leggett, a senior economist at the American Bankers Association, said banks were applying the same tighter credit assessment standards to nonprofits as they were to businesses. ''Donations and gifts are down, and that affects nonprofit creditworthiness,'' he said, adding that ''diminished or delayed payments'' from state and local governments were also having an impact.
 Chicago Commons, a social services group with an annual budget of $17 million, was lucky to have a $700,000 line of credit at ShoreBank, which is known for its support of community-based nonprofits, when the state of Illinois fell $2.5 million behind in its reimbursements in December.
 ''If we hadn't had that credit line,'' said Dan Valliere, the executive director, ''we would have missed payrolls, which probably would have meant service cuts.'' 
 Nonetheless, the agency is postponing repairs to its facilities, including a new roof for a day care center.
 This month, the state borrowed $1.4 billion to pay for services provided last summer and in the early fall, which reduced the amount it owed Chicago Commons by about half. Mr. Valliere said the organization used the money to pay down its credit line and catch up with some bills, ''but the comptroller's office told us not to get used to this.''
 Moreover, Mr. Valliere said that use of the credit line was likely to increase the organization's expenses by as much as $30,000, money that could be used to pay an employee or buy a new roof.
 ''Try getting a donor to pay your interest expenses,'' said Paul S. Castro, executive director of Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles, which racked up roughly $70,000 in interest costs while California legislators wrangled over the state budget. 
 Now, the bank has told Mr. Castro that it will not allow any withdrawal from Jewish Family Service's $3 million credit line without collateral -- and it does not consider the promise of state payment sufficient collateral.
 ''That's a real burden for us,'' Mr. Castro said. ''All we really have as assets are contracts with the public sector.''
 At least that bank is willing to negotiate. SCO's bank simply informed the organization one day that it would not provide a $12 million letter of credit needed for a bond offering for a new school for disabled children and renovations on other facilities.
 That forced the organization to borrow that money from its credit line, which the bank has cut to roughly $16 million, from $25 million.
 Kids Hope United, a nonprofit offering services in different states to support needy children and families, recently sought bids from 11 banks to handle virtually all of its banking needs. Seven declined to even make a proposal, ''including two that have been taking me to lunch for years hoping for business,'' said David McConnell, the organization's chief financial officer.
 ''There's a triple-witching effect,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''You simply have less money to run operations and the government is paying more slowly than ever on top of that, which means you need the bank's money more, and that makes banks more nervous about lending it to you.''

HEADLINE: As Mergers and Other Work Dry Up, Bankruptcy Becomes Lawyers' Oasis

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
There sure do seem to be a lot of bankruptcy lawyers around these days. 
 Law firms, scrambling to keep up with changing client needs in a weakening economy, are rushing to pump up their bankruptcy departments by shifting around staff and having lawyers study up on restructuring, as more people abandon the big deals of boom times to take on desperate negotiations of companies on the brink.
 At some firms, seasoned bankruptcy partners hold seminars and host brown bag lunches to introduce Chapter 11 proceedings to associates more accustomed to carefully planned mergers than to corporate fire sales. Some firms have poached bankruptcy experts from rivals in a bid to bolster business and to bring in a source of knowledge for lawyers new to dark times. 
 ''What firms are trying to do here is provide some ability to people to move,'' said Bradford W. Hildebrandt, president of Hildebrandt International, a consulting firm that often advises law firms. ''Frankly they're trying to avoid layoffs.''
 The shifts happen less frequently at the level of partners. Partners command higher prices and clients may be unwilling to pay those prices when the partner is just learning the details of bankruptcy law. And the most experienced and sought-after advisers are the ones with a range of experience across different areas of law, several lawyers said.
 ''The people who are most successful are the counselors, who know a little bit about everything,'' Said Kenneth A. Lefkowitz, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed in New York. 
 But for the more junior lawyers being shifted around, working on bankruptcy matters should help them become advisers to corporate chiefs, said Douglas P. Bartner, head of the bankruptcy group at Shearman & Sterling in New York.
 ''We are adding proportionately more junior lawyers to the bankruptcy area than we did before,'' he said. In addition, he said, over the last year senior lawyers who have had some bankruptcy experience have also held regular, informal meetings to discuss restructuring cases, so that when they need to be pulled into a restructuring case, they are up to speed. 
 A greater number of junior lawyers also want to work on bankruptcy cases, said Richard F. Hahn, co-chairman of the bankruptcy practice at Debevoise & Plimpton. Young lawyers might have more opportunities to learn in a division that is growing, as the bankruptcy area is.
 ''They want to be where the action is,'' Mr. Hahn said. (They may also want to hang onto their jobs, Mr. Hildebrandt noted, by keeping busy.)
 In November, Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm known for its bankruptcy practice, held the first in a series of seminars for its lawyers on restructuring issues, said Richard M. Cieri, a partner in the firm's New York office. 
 ''We know there's going to be continuing need for additional capacity,'' Mr. Cieri said. The firm has more than 100 lawyers in its bankruptcy group, making it one of the biggest in the country, but the current downturn means the firm may need to tap more of its people, he said. 
 In some cases law firms have hired bankruptcy lawyers from rivals to add to their mix of offerings. Earlier this month, Greenberg Traurig announced that it had successfully lured away Bruce Zirinsky and John Bae, senior bankruptcy lawyers at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft. 
 ''The addition of Bruce and John is particularly exciting now, with the challenges in the U.S. and global marketplaces and the need for major law firms to adjust rapidly to change,'' said Richard A. Rosenbaum, president of Greenberg Traurig, in a statement at the time.
 But law firms rushing to expand their bankruptcy practices face certain risks. If a firm hires or trains too many lawyers in a restructuring department, for example, it might find itself lacking people to handle securities offerings and mergers when the economy recovers while at the same time paying bankruptcy experts with nothing to do.
 ''The great challenge is coping with supply and demand and revenue expense,'' said Ralph Baxter, chairman of Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe. ''You can't overdose on one thing, and you can't simply -- because something has turned down today -- abandon it, if odds are it's going to be back.''

HEADLINE: Helping States Make Good Choices

 BODY:
The rapidly deteriorating economy has confronted states with their toughest budget decisions in years. This month, about 45 states reported budget gaps for the present fiscal year and most expect to struggle with shortfalls over the next two years. 
 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that these deficits could reach $350 billion. Individual budget gaps could be quite large -- at least a 10 percent difference between income and spending in New York and five other states this year. Since a majority of state constitutions require balanced budgets, the only alternatives are to raise taxes or cut spending. 
 To cope, many states are spending less on health care and education, which take up a large percentage of most state budges. But the bottom line is that there are few good choices and a lot of very bad ones, since services would be cut at the moment of greatest need. 
 President Obama has promised federal help, and the $825 billion stimulus package being considered in Congress contains more than $250 billion in badly needed aid to states. It is hard to see how essential state programs can survive without it. 
 New Jersey, to take one example, is cutting funds for charity care in hospitals; Massachusetts has trimmed spending for Head Start. Tennessee's health care reductions could deprive 30,000 to 40,000 sick people of needed care. 
 Federal help also could keep states from rushing into short-term fixes that could have bad long-term consequences. Pre-kindergarten programs save enormous amounts of money later on because as the students age they are less likely to repeat a grade, need special education or get involved with the justice system. 
 On the plus side, the fiscal crisis may force states to think creatively and, for once, use plain common sense. States burdened with billions of dollars in soaring prison budgets, like California, may no longer be able to afford the three-strikes-and-you're-out laws that lock up nonviolent offenders for decades for minor crimes. 
 The common itch to build new prisons must also be controlled; even Texas is beginning to make distinctions between chronic violent offenders who need long-term incarceration and those who don't. Utah, meanwhile, has put its full-time employees on a four-day workweek. This has saved on energy bills and, surprisingly, in reduced sick pay. Some hard choices can be wise ones.

HEADLINE: A Mayor's Lie Throws a City Into Turmoil

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
Tom Wood did not break stride as he shouted his sentiments at City Hall here this week.
 ''He's a liar,'' Mr. Wood said. ''He told a kid to lie so that he could get elected. He shouldn't be our mayor.''
 He was railing about Sam Adams, who three weeks ago became Portland's first openly gay mayor, thanks, in part, to people like Mr. Wood, a 46-year-old environmental lawyer who voted for Mr. Adams last year. 
 In a city that likes to be liberal, Mr. Adams's homosexuality was rarely an issue in his campaign for mayor. (One city commissioner said it was more of an asset than a liability.) Mr. Adams, who won 59 percent of the vote, has been admired for his youthful energy and plans to expand and promote Portland's progressive and green identity.
 Now, however, Mr. Wood is among a loud new constituency saying that the mayor's tenure should end immediately. A state investigation is pending. Newspapers and the local police union have called for him to step down, while some elected officials and other community leaders have urged him to stay in office. Debate has erupted in the city's gay population. 
 Mr. Adams, 45, has considered resigning, even though supporters who have spoken with him recently say they believe he will decide to keep his office. 
 The developments stem from the mayor's admission this week that in 2005, when he was a city commissioner, he had a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old male intern at the State Legislature and that he had lied repeatedly about the relationship when he ran for mayor. His admission followed new scrutiny of the relationship by an alternative newspaper, Willamette Week. The mayor has not returned to City Hall since the admission, on Tuesday.
 Many people, gay and straight, say they are upset with Mr. Adams because of his deceit, unrelated to his sexual orientation. But sexual orientation has been part of the debate, with some people saying Mr. Adams's actions encourage stereotypes of gay men and hurt their efforts at acceptance. Others say there has been a rush to judgment.
 ''Sam's private life is Sam's private life,'' said Charles Hinkle, a lawyer who has specialized in First Amendment issues and who on Friday attended a City Hall rally in support of the mayor at which most of those present were prominent gay or cultural figures. ''People lie,'' Mr. Hinkle said. ''I have lied. You have lied.''
 Dan Saltzman, one of five city commissioners and the only one to attend the rally, called on Mr. Adams to stay in office. Mr. Saltzman cited the need for leadership as the city seeks federal help to pay for stimulus projects during the economic downturn. Mr. Saltzman said he wanted to see the matter investigated but, ''in the meantime, there are very important issues to tackle, and we need Sam Adams.''
 Mr. Adams was beginning his run for mayor in 2007 when a political rival suggested that his relationship with the young man, Beau Breedlove, had been sexual. At the time, Mr. Adams strongly denied it, saying he had acted only as a mentor to Mr. Breedlove. 
 Besides admitting that he had lied, Mr. Adams also said that he had asked Mr. Breedlove to lie about the relationship. He said he was concerned that because Mr. Breedlove was 17 when they met people might not believe they had waited until he was 18, the age of legal consent, to have sex. Mr. Breedlove issued an apologetic statement this week for not being honest about the relationship but disclosed few details.
 The Oregonian and The Portland Tribune have published editorials calling on Mr. Adams to resign, as has a gay publication, Just Out. 
 At the request of the City Council and other agencies, the state attorney general, John Kroger, has agreed to investigate, potentially including issues like Mr. Breedlove's age at the time of the relationship and whether Mr. Adams abused his power by asking the teenager or others to conceal the relationship. 
 While the possibility that the mayor committed a crime has angered many people, others said they were stunned that a middle-age man holding a high city office would have a secret romantic relationship with a teenager. 
 In 2005, Willamette Week won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting that Neil Goldschmidt, who had been a widely admired mayor in the 1970s and later was elected governor, had a sexual relationship with his children's 14-year-old baby sitter. (In the wall of photographs in Mr. Adams's office showing former mayors, the photograph of Mr. Goldschmidt is the only one obscured, by a table lamp.)
 Even if Mr. Breedlove was of legal age and even if no crime was committed, several people said Mr. Adams was out of bounds.
 ''Where is the outrage?'' said Rondine Ghiselline, holding a sign outside City Hall on Friday that said, ''Protect Interns from Our Mayor.''
 Still, although there have been prominent calls for the mayor to resign, including from the local police union, many people continue to show strong support. One woman said Friday that Portland was ''too smart'' to lose Mr. Adams over a sex scandal. 
 Christopher Stowell, the artistic director for the Oregon Ballet Theater, said that while he and others were upset with Mr. Adams, letting him resign would let him off too easily.
 ''Instead of allowing him, I think we should force him to do the job,'' Mr. Stowell said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 28, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about Sam Adams, the mayor of Portland, who is under fire after admitting that in 2005 he had a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old intern, included a quotation from Christopher Stowell, the artistic director for the Oregon Ballet Theater, who attended a rally in support of the mayor. Mr. Stowell said that while he was upset with the mayor, he believed that instead of allowing him to resign, ''I think we should force him to do the job.'' 
 After the article was published, several readers reported that Mr. Stowell and the mayor had had a romantic relationship; Mr. Stowell confirmed that they did, for a few months in 2004. If The Times had turned up the information earlier, it would have been included in the article.

HEADLINE: As Israeli Bombing Stops, Gazans Get Busy Rebuilding Damaged Tunnels

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Nadim Audi contributed reporting.

DATELINE: RAFAH, Gaza 

 BODY:
It was Friday, the Muslim day of rest, but Gaza's border with Egypt was a hive of activity. Men scraped sandy soil out of holes that had served as tunnels for smuggling, and were one of the main targets of Israel's war in Gaza.
 Now, less than a week after it ended, Gazans were back, plunging deep underground with lamps to carry rocky loads of soil out on pulleys. 
 ''Everybody's busy rebuilding now,'' said a manager of one digging team. ''In a month, it will be back to normal.''
 The defiant pose seemed surprisingly brazen in light of recent events: Israel said smuggling tunnels were a prime concern, after Hamas rockets, in attacking Gaza, and it hit dozens of them in airstrikes during the war. But the tunnels are the principal livelihood for many people here, and as soon as the bombing stopped, they were right back in them with their shovels.
 The revival may challenge what Israel sees as one of its main accomplishments in the war, crushing Hamas's ability to rearm, and has drawn bitter reactions from residents, who say it is proof the war was a useless enterprise.
 ''The war was for nothing,'' said Mahmoud Abu Adnan, a grocery store owner.
 But Israel argues that very soon the tunnels, restored or not, will not matter as much. It has secured agreements with Egypt and the United States that will make this smuggling route far less important. The details have not been made public, but Israel says it is confident they will work.
 ''What is different today is that there is a good international commitment to prevent the link-up between Iran and Hamas,'' said Mark Regev, the spokesman for the Israeli government. ''We believe that Hamas will not be allowed to rearm.''
 That commitment has yet to be tested. While Israel said that about 80 percent of the tunnels were out of commission after the bombing, Gazans seemed skeptical that anything would change.
 ''They can destroy as much as they want, but the tunnels will just come back,'' Mr. Abu Adnan said.
 That spirit of defiance is at the center of the Gazan psyche. Many people here do not condemn Hamas rockets, arguing vociferously that they are the only way Gaza can protect itself from Israeli aggression. The economic blockade, they argue, and the Israelis' unwillingness to lift it, is justification for the attacks.
 ''Do you think we'd be busy digging underground if there was no embargo?'' said Ahmed, a tall man in a leather jacket who was overseeing work on his tunnels on Friday. ''If there was no embargo, we'd have real jobs.''
 Ahmed, who did not want his last name to be used out of concern for his safety, voiced the assertions of others interviewed Friday, saying that his business had nothing to do with guns, and that his main imports were Pampers and cigarettes.
 Israel says it does not believe that, and argues that a lot of the tunnel business is contraband weapons. Maj. Avital Leibovich, the spokeswoman for the Israeli military, said that before Hamas took power in a violent struggle with its Palestinian political rival Fatah in 2007, only four tons of explosives a year were smuggled in. Since Hamas took power, the number has risen to 100 tons, she said.
 ''This definitely became an industry of smuggling,'' Major Leibovich said. 
 Gazans argue it is out of necessity. Israel imposed an economic blockade with Hamas's takeover, limiting the flow of goods -- particularly snacks like chocolate and chips and sodas -- and tripling prices. The industry also soaks up a portion of this city's unemployed young men, who earn $100 for every meter they dig. 
 ''You have 25,000 kids who have no work,'' Mr. Abu Adnan said, ''so they go to work in the tunnels. It's an important source of income here.''
 The tunnels are located under dozens of giant plastic tents that look like greenhouses. Those who came for the first time since the war did not recognize the area, the bombing was so extensive. The explosives made the tunnels smell strange.
 ''This will give us greater skills,'' said one digger. ''We'll become artists.''
 Israel has contended that the bombing is a way to drive a wedge between the people and Hamas, but it seems to be having precisely the opposite effect. A tunnel manager in his 30s named Mahmoud said he had felt closer to Hamas since the war, because, however flawed, Hamas was the one group that stood up to Israeli aggression. 
 Palestinians, he said, standing in a striped sweater and brown pants, feel like second-class citizens in Israel, and contraband goods can help them feel first class. 
 ''When I bring a salad, I see that my son eats it and finds it good, it makes me happy,'' said Mahmoud. ''It makes me feel human.''
 The tunnels do not address the more important question of reconstruction aid. Though the focus internationally has been on who will receive the money -- the West does not want Hamas to get any -- here in Rafah, a far more urgent question is whether the Israelis will let materials through official crossings. Tunnels, managers said, will not work. 
 ''Reconstruction now depends on the Israelis' good will,'' said Jabbar Qeshta, deputy mayor of Rafah, and a member of Hamas. 
 The municipality has 3 bulldozers and about 30 cement mixers, Mr. Qeshta said, but the most basic ingredient was missing.
 ''Tell them I want cement,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Video Games, Mainstream Success Comes With a Price

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
So there I was Friday morning, listening to the customary locker-room banter on WFAN, the sports-talk pioneer, as conversation turned to the betting odds on the best picture Oscar. As a few of the numbers were listed, Craig Carton, the bawdy provocateur who is one of the morning show's hosts, dismissively cut off the segment and started talking about how he had an appointment that evening to play NBA 2K9 online against a friend in upstate New York.
 In a fascinating generational twist, Boomer Esiason, the 47-year-old former N.F.L. quarterback who plays the straight man on the program, made a halfhearted attempt to mock Mr. Carton for his Friday night plans. Mr. Carton, a married father of three who turns 40 next week, shut him up with a line very much like: ''What am I supposed to do? Dance the night away?'' 
 It was a pitch-perfect moment that summed up why in 2009 video games are poised to become an even more established and central component of mainstream culture. Like Mr. Carton, the first generation to actually grow up playing video games is turning 40. As a group, they aren't in the basement and they're not maladjusted. They are responsible middle-aged parents, and many are coming into the full flower of their professional lives. People who play video games (most of whom probably do not consider themselves ''gamers'') are moving into positions of power all over our society, even in the White House.
 When Bill Burton, a deputy White House press secretary, tried to explain this week just how antiquated Obama staffers found the Bush computer systems, he used an analogy that should have made immediate sense to anyone under the age of, oh, 40. ''It is kind of like going from an Xbox to an Atari,'' he told The Washington Post. 
 As recently as five years ago, video games were in danger of disappearing into the same cultural netherworld that comic books fell into many decades ago. In the United States (unlike, say, in Japan), it remains an act of fairly extreme cultural deviance to tell your friends that you are going to stay home on a Friday night reading comic books.
 The great lurch toward grudging respectability that began a few years ago will almost certainly continue in 2009, if only because of the continuing popularity of mass fare like Wii bowling, Guitar Hero and Rock Band, not to mention Madden. And so video games are becoming acceptable in the manner that watching reality shows or sports on TV all night is acceptable. Bravo. But that can't be all games are capable of. The real test of 2009 is whether games with a bit more intellectual and artistic ambition can continue to flourish.
 I have to admit that by Christmas I was a little burned out on video games. Playing games for hundreds of hours a month can do that to you. 
 So I got away, in the hope that taking a refresher course in other media would help me understand games more thoroughly. I read Hermann Hesse. I saw Alan Gilbert conduct a program of Schubert, Brahms and Schumann at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. I watched Clint Eastwood's first major film, ''A Fistful of Dollars,'' back to back with his latest, ''Gran Torino.''
 It worked, because at times in all the reading and watching and listening -- in all the merely consuming -- I chafed at how little control I had, at my inability to affect the narrative, at being taken on a joy ride by someone else. At those moments I longed to be able to make a decision, to solve the problem myself, to take responsibility for what would happen next -- all the elements that make a game.
 But more important, it also worked because all of that reading and watching and listening proved to me just how far most games have to go before they rival traditional media in two important areas: emotional depth and eliciting an intellectual engagement with one's own place in the world.
 From a narrative perspective, there have certainly been a few games that provided those qualities; historically, Planescape: Torment and BioShock come to mind. More recently, so have games like Fable II, Fallout 3 and Grand Theft Auto IV. And setting aside narrative, I find many of those qualities in the unscripted vastness of Eve Online. 
 But the artistically deflating, if commercially inspiring, truth is that with the exception of a few mega-franchises, the biggest bucks in the game business now come from providing casual party and family games that are little more than interactive cartoons.
 The four top-selling games of last year all fall into that category, more or less. Yes, Wii Fit is helping people in a real-world way, and of course almost every Nintendo game is a jewel of polish and design. But Nintendo games aren't generally trying to elucidate anything meaningful about the human condition. And neither are lucrative popcorn shooters like Gears of War and Call of Duty.
 It is hardly a bad thing that it seems to be working. Even as the economy faltered and traditional entertainment segments from Broadway to the music business continued to reel, the overall game industry grew by 19 percent last year in the United States, to $21.3 billion, including $11 billion in software sales. Nintendo claimed responsibility for 99 percent of that growth, mainly because of Wii and the portable DS unit. So the morning-radio shock jocks are playing football and basketball games, and most everyone else is playing Wii bowling. There are a fair number of people getting shot with virtual machine guns. Here and there something approaching art is happening and actually making money.
 Let's focus on that last category in 2009, whether they arrive as new games in established franchises like Resident Evil, Mass Effect, God of War, BioShock or StarCraft, or as new properties revealing new worlds.

HEADLINE: Firms That Got Bailout Money Keep Lobbying

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and CHARLIE SAVAGE; Ron Nixon and Kitty Bennett in Washington and Charles Duhigg in New York contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The financial giant Bank of America says it is no longer lobbying the federal government about its unfolding bank bailout. After receiving $45 billion in bailout money, lobbying was just too unseemly.
 ''We are very sensitive to the fact that we have taxpayer money,'' said Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for the company.
 Citigroup, recipient of another $45 billion, made the opposite call. While trying to keep a low profile, the company is still fielding an army of Washington lobbyists working on a host of issues, including the bailout. In the fourth quarter, it spent $1.77 million on lobbying fees, according to its lobbyists' filings. 
 The different approaches from the two banks that have received the most money underscores the growing dilemma facing private companies, which increasingly deal with the federal government not only as rule-maker but also as shareholder, lender and trading partner.
 Pressing federal policy makers risks the appearance of recycling public money to advance a private agenda, while staying on the sidelines could put a company at a comparative disadvantage.
 Citigroup and Bank of America are hardly the only two financial firms to confront the issue. During the last three months of 2008, at least seven other firms receiving bailout funds -- American Express, Capital One, Goldman Sachs, KeyCorp, Morgan Stanley, PNC and Bank of New York Mellon -- all lobbied the government about the bailout, according to a review of their most recent disclosure reports.
 The automakers that received billions under the same program lobbied as well: including General Motors; its financing arm, GMAC; and Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm that controls Chrysler. Other recipients of federal financing also lobbied Congress, the Treasury or both about other matters. 
 The American International Group, taken over by the government during an injection of more than $40 billion last fall to prevent the company's collapse, has discontinued all its federal lobbying; it is now in effect government-owned. But its former executives continue to lobby.
 Its former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, ousted a few years ago amid allegations of securities fraud, is leading a group of shareholders lobbying for a chance to renegotiate the terms of the government takeover or buy back a bigger stake in the company.
 According to a recent filing, A.I.G. shareholders paid $90,000 in the fourth quarter to a lobbying team at Ogilvy Government Relations that includes the Republican lobbying powerhouse Wayne L. Berman, a former assistant secretary of commerce under the first President George Bush and a major fund-raiser for the second.
 The group also includes three Democrats who had been top aides to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi; Senator Edward M. Kennedy; and the former House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt. (Mickey Kantor, secretary of commerce under President Bill Clinton, has advised the group as a lawyer as well.)
 Lawmakers, troubled by the prospect of taxpayer-subsidized influence-peddling, are threatening to crack down. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican, are pushing legislation that would explicitly bar companies from using bailout funds for lobbying or campaign contributions.
 Although hard to enforce, the measure puts banks on notice that aggressive lobbying could set off a Congressional backlash. 
 ''That taxpayer dollars intended to stabilize the economy could find their way into the bank accounts of lobbying firms'' is ''completely unacceptable,'' Ms. Feinstein said in a speech supporting the measure.
 On Friday, President Obama issued his own call for more oversight and transparency, citing ''companies that have received taxpayer assistance then going out and renovating bathrooms or offices, or in other ways not managing those dollars appropriately.'' This was an apparent allusion to reports of office renovations by the former chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a recent acquisition by Bank of America whose heavy losses led to an expanded bailout for the bank. 
 Bankers, though, defend their right to a voice in public policy debates about the industry's future. ''Nobody mentioned that you are giving up your Constitutional right to petition the government'' when accepting federal money, said Edward L. Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association.
 He acknowledged, however, that Citigroup and Bank of America were in a more ambiguous position than the rest of the roughly 200 banks that accepted money from the Treasury and agreed to pay it interest as part of the bailout program. While most banks are required to demonstrate financial health to qualify for the deal, the two giants received $90 billion in emergency measures to prop them up and agreed to give the government a larger say in management.
 The two banking behemoths had entered a ''middle ground,'' Mr. Yingling said, between the other private banks accepting federal investments and the three financial firms under full federal control: A.I.G. and the failed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. ''I would expect that institutions in that middle ground would be well aware that they need to be careful about the tone and manner in which they lobby,'' he said.
 Citigroup and Bank of America say internal policies prohibit the use of any bailout money for lobbying. Neither, however, has stopped pressing its interests in Washington, albeit more quietly.
 Though Bank of America says it has stopped lobbying about the bailout legislation -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP -- it continues to lobby on other matters. The bank spent about $1 million on federal lobbying in last year's fourth quarter, including $820,000 for its own lobbyists, according to filings.
 Ms. Norton, the spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether Bank of America was lobbying on other financial crisis proposals, such as creation of a government-controlled ''bad bank'' to take over toxic securities.
 Nicholas Calio, Citigroup's top lobbyist, handled Congressional relations for both the first and second President George Bush. Its team of outside lobbyists has also included a former Congressional liaison for President Clinton, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a former deputy assistant Treasury secretary and the veteran Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf.
 The two banks' dilemma is an increasing problem for the industry, said Scott Talbott, top lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable. ''There is a TARP blowback problem,'' he said.

 South Africa's Unlikely Rebel
 When Edwin Cameron, above, a revered high court judge, disclosed that he was H.I.V. positive in 1999, he became the first -- and remains the only -- senior officeholder anywhere in southern Africa, and perhaps in all of Africa, to announce he had H.I.V. And he used his status to challenge openly President Thabo Mbeki -- who held the power to decide whether to name him to the nation's highest tribunal -- on his ideas about AIDS. PAGE A6
 REPORT FAULTS RUSSIA AND GEORGIA
 A human rights group accused both Russia and Georgia of using indiscriminate force on civilians during the brief war in Georgia in August, and said Russia had failed to prevent South Ossetian forces from carrying out ''execution-style killings, rape, abductions and countless beatings.'' PAGE A6 
 DRONE ATTACKS CONTINUE
 Two missile attacks launched from remotely piloted American aircraft killed at least 15 people in western Pakistan, and the strikes suggested that the use of drones to kill militants within Pakistan's borders would continue under President Obama. The drones, operated by the C.I.A., have carried out more than 30 missile attacks since last summer against members of Al Qaeda and other terrorism suspects in the region. Page A6
 CHINA WORRIED ON TOUGHER STANCE
 Experts in China said there were several signs that the Obama administration could take a harder line toward Beijing, including Mr. Obama's emphasis on climate change and the environment in trade negotiations and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's focus on human rights. PAGE A7
 GUNMEN KILL 8 IN IRAQ
 Eight people were killed by gunmen in Diyala Province, northeast of Baghdad, according to provincial police officials. The killers' motives were unclear, but an official said a preliminary investigation had indicated that some of the victims might have been prostitutes. PAGE A7
 EBOLA CASE IN PHILIPPINES
 In the first known case of what may be transmission of the Ebola virus from a pig to a human, a pig handler in the Philippines has tested positive for a strain of the virus, world health officials and the Philippine government announced on Friday. But the strain -- Ebola Reston -- is not known to be dangerous to humans, and the worker, who was infected at least six months ago, is healthy, officials said. PAGE A8
 KIM MEETS WITH CHINESE OFFICIAL
 Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, met a senior Chinese Communist Party official, according to Chinese and North Korean media. The meeting in Pyongyang was Mr. Kim's first public meeting with a foreign visitor since August, when he is believed to have suffered a stroke, and is thought to be an attempt to show that Mr. Kim is in control of his government.

 EFFORTS AGAINST EVOLUTION DEFEATED
 An effort by conservative members of the Texas State Board of Education to undermine the teaching of evolution was defeated after the board voted to drop a mandate that science teachers explore the ''strengths and weaknesses'' of theories.

HEADLINE: G.E. Meets Expectations for Fourth Quarter, but Questions Persist for 2009

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The General Electric Company delivered a mixed performance in the fourth quarter -- and one that is unlikely to resolve the uncertainty about the outlook for the giant industrial and finance conglomerate.
 The company's profit from continuing operations fell 43 percent in the fourth quarter, to $3.9 billion, down from $6.8 billion in the year-earlier quarter. But the lower earnings, at 36 cents a share, were in line with Wall Street's expectations, which have fallen steadily since the credit crisis last fall and the sharp economic downturn.
 Industry analysts have questioned whether G.E. can maintain its generous dividend payments and its triple-A credit rating, given that its large finance business has been hit by credit woes and many of its industrial operations face a weakening outlook. 
 G.E.'s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, expressed confidence on both fronts, in a statement and during a conference call with analysts. He said that G.E. was committed to its plan of paying the full dividend of $1.24 a share in 2009, and that its management team ran the company to maintain a stellar triple-A rating.
 ''We're planning for a really tough environment, but I would say we've really prepared the company to perform in this environment,'' Mr. Immelt said. ''We've taken the actions to weather this storm.''
 Yet the cloud hanging over G.E. is that no one is certain how severe the financial storm will become or when it will end. G.E. is the largest nonbank financial company in the United States. Though sliding now, nearly half the company's profit in recent years has come from its finance arm, GE Capital, whose global portfolio spans aircraft leasing, commercial real estate lending, credit cards and home mortgages.
 The company has cut costs and quickly built up its cash, including selling $3 billion in preferred stock to the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffet in October.
 G.E., like other companies recently, has abandoned the practice of providing guidance to Wall Street analysts on its quarterly profits and sales. Instead, Mr. Immelt and his team have discussed the company's broad ''financial framework'' for the year ahead in sessions with analysts on Friday and last month. 
 G.E. said its finance arm over all should be able to earn $5 billion in 2009, despite assuming losses from bad loans totaling $10 billion, mainly on credit cards in the United States, home mortgages in Britain and commercial lending to businesses.
 Only last month, analysts note, G.E. projected this year's loan-loss provision at $9 billion. 
 ''It looks as if it's going to be very difficult to meet that $5 billion profit target,'' an analyst at Deutsche Bank, Nigel Coe, said. ''The problem for G.E. is that it is a key player in financial services, so they are in the eye of the worst financial crisis we've ever seen.''
 With the economy slipping, G.E. also faces challenges across the spectrum of its nonfinance businesses. Over all, the company's revenue for the quarter fell 5 percent, to $46.2 billion, well below the analysts' consensus projection of nearly $50.1 billion, as compiled by ThomsonReuters. 
 ''The trends show further deterioration,'' Stephen Tusa, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a report, after G.E. announced its results.
 Revenue of G.E.'s big technology group, which sells and services equipment ranging from jet engines to hospital M.R.I. machines to locomotives, rose 1 percent, to $12.6 billion. Sales for its NBC Universal unit slipped 3 percent, to $4.4 billion, as strong growth in earnings from cable television networks like MSNBC and CNBC were offset by declines in advertising at local television stations.
 The energy unit, which sells power generators, windmills for alternative energy and equipment for oil and gas production, reported a 21 percent increase in revenue. But with the global economy falling, some analysts say that trend cannot be sustained.
 ''For the company over all, revenue was clearly on the light side,'' an analyst at Sterne Agee, Nicholas Heymann, said. ''And the energy business, in particular, is facing a downtrend this year.''
 G.E.'s large stake in the deteriorating financial services sector and the prospect of weakness in other businesses has raised doubts about the company's ability to pay its sizable dividend and hold onto its triple-A rating. The Standard & Poor's credit rating service recently reduced its outlook for G.E. to negative from stable. Mr. Heymann says he expects G.E. to slip from a triple-A rating later this year, and the company may well be forced to trim its dividend. 
 In the finance business, G.E. executives say their statistical models have taken into account a falling economy, including employment rising to 9 percent in the United States. Its industrial businesses, they note, will experience weaker equipment sales, but those units have large, growing and profitable services operations, which provide steadier earnings than equipment sales, which can fall sharply when economies sour.
 When an analyst asked about the seemingly high dividend in uncertain times, Mr. Immelt replied that G.E. had decided it was both shareholder-friendly and affordable. ''We're investing in the future, we're not starving the company,'' he said. ''We're not straining to pay it.''
 G.E. shares closed down $1.45, or almost 11 percent, at $12.03 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Washington Confident It Can Forge Recovery Plan

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama and Congressional leaders from both parties pushed forward Friday with plans to pass a bipartisan economic recovery plan by mid-February, predicting that they would be able to settle their differences over the size and nature of the package.
 Mr. Obama hosted House and Senate leaders from both parties at the White House to hash out elements of a roughly $825 billion program. Republicans used the opportunity to press for more expansive tax cuts and questioned some spending in the latest plan. But both sides emerged expressing confidence that they would find consensus. 
 ''It appears that we are on target to make our President's Day weekend,'' said Mr. Obama, referring to the goal of passing the legislation by the next Congressional recess. He said that while ''there are still some differences around the table,'' everyone agreed ''that we are experiencing an unprecedented, perhaps, economic crisis that has to be dealt with and dealt with rapidly.''
 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Speaker of the House, told reporters outside the White House that ''we're on schedule for our timetable'' and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, agreed. ''I do think we'll be able to meet the president's deadline,'' he said.
 The meeting, the first involving the bipartisan leadership since Mr. Obama took office Tuesday, was intended to signal quick action at a time of continuing turmoil as well as a commitment by the new president to work across party lines. For the moment, both sides appear eager to appear, at least, on the same page, recognizing the deep public anxiety about spiraling job losses, unraveling banks and sinking stock and home values.
 But the harmony masked significant disagreement about the package. House Republicans presented their plan to Mr. Obama, proposing to scrap his $500 a worker tax credit in favor of cutting the lowest income tax rates, which they said would put more money in the pockets of most taxpayers. They also proposed tax breaks for small businesses, homebuyers and the unemployed.
 ''At the end of the day, government can't solve this problem,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader. ''The American people have to solve it. And the way they can solve it is if we allow them to keep more of the money that they earn.''
 Mr. Boehner also complained that some spending in the current plans would be wasteful and not related to jump starting the economy. ''How you can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on contraceptive?'' he asked. ''How does that stimulate the economy?''
 Mr. McConnell said the president was ''open to our suggestions'' and Ms. Pelosi said some tax breaks in the House Democratic plan were put in at the suggestion of Republicans, citing specifically a job-creation tax credit for businesses. 
 But that comment quickly triggered a sharp response from Mr. Boehner's office. ''That is simply not true,'' said his spokeswoman, Antonia Ferrier, saying that the job-creation tax credit was actually suggested by Mr. Obama, not Republicans, and has now been removed from the package.
 The concern over spending centers not only on how much but how fast it can be pumped into the economy. A Congressional Budget Office analysis questioned whether the spending would course through the system quickly enough to produce the jobs that the new administration forecasts. Peter Orszag, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, sent a letter to Congress addressing that concern, saying his staff's analysis of the overall package, including tax cuts, indicates that 75 percent would be spent or distributed over the next 18 months.
 The president also used the session to reassure Congressional leaders and Americans that money would be used wisely, promising to impose tight controls. He criticized companies that have used federal money they received under the financial bailout for low priority or wasteful purposes and promised not to let that happen.
 He cited ''reports that we've seen over the last couple of days about companies that have received taxpayer assistance, then going out and renovating bathrooms or offices, or in other ways not managing those dollars appropriately.'' 
 More accountability, he said, has ''to be part and parcel of a reform package if we're going to be responsible in dealing with this economic crisis.''

HEADLINE: Europe Wants U.S. to Join Carbon Trading Market

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
The European Commission will call on the United States to create a trans-Atlantic system of carbon trading to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to press for the establishment of similar markets in developed countries, according to a draft document seen Friday by The International Herald Tribune. 
 Under President Obama, the United States is entering a period of debate over whether to adopt such market-based systems or use a more straightforward tax to limit planet-warming gases from industry.
 Europe created the largest single market for trading carbon permits in 2005. Since then, Australia and some American states have begun initiatives. But the European system has come under fire for doing too little to stop pollution and for creating windfall profits for some industries that it was intended to target, like coal-burning utilities.
 European officials have insisted that their emissions trading system has become more effective after a pilot phase from 2005 to 2007, and they have put in place measures aimed at preventing lobbying by governments and industry from diluting its effectiveness.
 The document, which was circulating Friday, and which could change over the weekend, describes the stance of European officials as they prepare for talks in Copenhagen in December on a climate treaty to take the place of the Kyoto protocol. The first phase of the Kyoto treaty expires in 2012.
 A centerpiece of the commission's proposals is ''strategic bilateral partnerships with the United States, to create a trans-Atlantic carbon market,'' according to the document.
 The proposals also envision member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forming a single carbon market by 2015.
 Shipping and aviation, industries that were not part of the earlier Kyoto climate treaty, should be included in any successor treaty, according to the European proposals.
 The proposals also seek ways of helping developing nations cut emissions and finance ways of adapting to climate change. One suggestion is that rich nations raise billions of euros each year for the developing world through a levy on air and ship transportation, or by using part of the proceeds from the sales of pollution permits by governments.
 Past efforts at coordinated global action on climate change have been halted mostly because the United States has insisted on emissions limits for countries like India and China. Those countries resisted mandatory rules, saying they had the right to industrialize and improve standards of living.
 Some businesses that regard climate regulation favorably because it could promote new investment opportunities welcomed the European initiative.
 Adam Nathan, a spokesman for the Carbon Markets and Investors Association, praised ''the central role for the carbon market set out by the commission.'' But he warned that support from the United States and other nations was critical.
 ''Cooperation with the Obama administration must focus on leveraging comparable action from the United States and supporting developing countries in their efforts,'' Mr. Nathan said.

HEADLINE: Obama Pressing For a Quick Jolt To the Economy

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Peter Baker, Michael Falcone and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama on Friday stepped squarely into the fractious effort in Congress to assemble an $825 billion economic recovery package, seeking to quell criticism from both parties and to retain leadership on an initiative that could define his term.
 Through his budget director, Peter R. Orszag, Mr. Obama committed to seeing that three-quarters of the combined spending and tax cuts would be used within 18 months, to provide the fiscal jolt that economists say is needed to jump-start the economy. 
 Mr. Orszag's letter of assurance to Congress sought to rebut some Republicans' accusations that little of the spending in the House version of the package would get into the economy quickly enough to be effective.
 For the first time as president, Mr. Obama also met with the leaders of both parties in Congress, in keeping with his campaign promise of bipartisanship. 
 Yet in a polite but pointed exchange with the No. 2 House Republican, Eric Cantor of Virginia, Mr. Obama took note of the parties' fundamental differences on tax policy toward low-wage workers, and insisted that his view would prevail.
 At issue is Mr. Obama's proposal that his tax breaks for low- and middle-income workers, including his centerpiece ''Making Work Pay'' tax credit, be refundable -- that is, that the benefits also go to workers who earn too little to pay income taxes but who pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. Republicans generally oppose giving such refunds to people who pay no income taxes.
 ''We just have a difference here, and I'm president,'' Mr. Obama said to Mr. Cantor, according to Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, who was at the meeting.
 Mr. Emanuel said that Mr. Obama was being lighthearted and that lawmakers of both parties had laughed.
 Mr. Cantor, in an interview later, had a similar recollection. He said the president had told him, ''You're correct, there's a philosophical difference, but I won, so we're going to prevail on that.''
 ''He was very straightforward,'' Mr. Cantor added. ''There was no disrespect, but it was very matter-of-fact.'' 
 In a day focused on the economy, Mr. Obama also attended what is now a daily economic briefing at the White House, met with his staff about his first budget, due next month, and conferred privately with Timothy F. Geithner, his Treasury secretary nominee, who is likely to be confirmed by the Senate on Monday. 
 As for the stimulus package, the president told reporters, ''It appears that we are on target'' toward adopting the recovery plan before Congress recesses for Presidents' Day on Feb. 13. 
 As he opened their meeting, Mr. Obama told the lawmakers that ''there are still some differences around the table and between the administration and the members of Congress about particular details on the plan.''
 ''But what I think unifies this group,'' he said, ''is recognition that we are experiencing an unprecedented, perhaps, economic crisis that has to be dealt with and dealt with rapidly.''
 Having invited lawmakers to present their ideas for doing that, Mr. Obama is getting an earful. The process is shaping up as a first major test of his presidential leadership, with many of his campaign promises, as well as the livelihoods of millions of Americans, at stake. 
 Mr. Obama did not lay down a comprehensive plan but made clear his policy preferences, reflecting campaign promises on energy, education and health care, along with traditional stimulus proposals for aid to states and expanded unemployment compensation and food stamp benefits. 
 Mr. Obama left it to the Democratic-controlled Congress to fill in the details. His differences with his own party in the House are mostly minor, and the House Democrats' package is expected to be passed next week. But a new Senate plan diverges in several ways from what House Democrats and Mr. Obama favor.
 The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Max Baucus of Montana, unveiled a plan that omitted major health proposals in the House Democrats' plan that Mr. Obama supports -- $28.6 billion in subsidies under a law known as Cobra to help workers who lose their jobs keep their health insurance, as well as expanded Medicaid eligibility for laid-off workers whose employers provided no health benefits.
 The Senate bill would restrict states from using their federal relief to expand Medicaid to cover more people. And while the House version would provide a single extra payment to Social Security disability beneficiaries, the Senate version would give $300 to all Social Security recipients and to disabled veterans. 
 Democrats are eager to help Mr. Obama succeed, knowing that their success rides on his. Still, they are refusing to cede their status as leaders of a co-equal branch of government, as they say Republicans did under President George W. Bush. 
 Republicans, for their part, do not want to be seen as obstructionists of a popular new president in a time of national distress. Yet especially in the House, where most Republicans hail from ideologically conservative districts, the opposition members view the stimulus debate as an opportunity to rededicate their divided, demoralized party around the one idea that unites it: big tax cuts, even if that means opposing Mr. Obama.
 But House Republicans do not have enough votes to prevail. And events on Friday made clear they do not pose a united front with Senate Republicans. 
 In a speech, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, countered criticism from party conservatives, like many in the House, who oppose compromise with Mr. Obama.
 ''Anyone who belittles cooperation resigns him or herself to a state of permanent legislative gridlock,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''And that is simply no longer acceptable to the American people.'' 
 Senate Republicans have not signed on to the House Republican plan that Mr. Cantor and the House minority leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, presented to Mr. Obama. It omits the Making Work Pay tax credit, which Obama aides have called ''nonnegotiable,'' in favor of reducing the two lowest income-tax brackets, to 10 percent from 15 percent, and to 5 percent from 10 percent, a move that would benefit even the richest taxpayers.
 Those ''are not the right kinds of cuts,'' said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group. ''You want to put money in the hands of people who will spend it.'' And the poorest Americans are ''the only people we know will spend the money.'' 
 The House Democrats' plan calls for roughly $550 billion in spending and $275 billion in tax breaks. Republicans have said they are alarmed at the size of that package, but they have not specified what dollar amount or ratio of tax cuts to spending they prefer.
 Mr. Obama is likely to have to show some deference to Republican proposals, and there already are some under discussion that could gain traction. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said Friday that he would fight to include a provision to spare at least 24 million middle-class families in 2009 from having to pay the alternative minimum tax, which applies when tax filers do not pay enough taxes to meet minimum thresholds under the traditional income tax system. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about President Obama's efforts to win support for an $825 billion economic stimulus plan referred incorrectly to the Senate version of the bill. It would indeed provide subsidies (for up to nine months) to help workers who lose their jobs keep their health insurance coverage under a law known as Cobra; it would not exclude such subsidies.

HEADLINE: France Expands Its Financial Support for Newspapers

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France announced new financial aid for the country's newspapers on Friday, but stopped short of the overhaul that analysts say is needed to revitalize the sector. 
 Mr. Sarkozy promised a variety of aid, including tax breaks for delivery services. In an effort to help newspapers through the recession, Mr. Sarkozy said the government would double the amount of advertising it did in print and online newspapers.
 ''It is the state's primary responsibility to respond to an emergency,'' he said, ''and there is an emergency caused by the impact of the collapse of advertising revenue.'' 
 The French government's support, which totals about 280 million euros, or $362 million, a year, would be increased by about 200 million euros a year for three years under Mr. Sarkozy's plan.
 The proposal included one unusual measure aimed at attracting young people to newspapers: giving 18-year-olds free subscriptions to the printed publication of their choice. The program would to be financed jointly by the government and publishers.
 In the United States, media specialists are divided on whether the government could or should help the efforts.
 Support from the government could ''impugn the perception of the public about the coverage of that newspaper,'' said Scott Bosley, the executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ''Trust is all we have, and it's hard-earned and hard to keep now. It would add another degree of difficulty to that.''
 Alex S. Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, said the government had always lent support to newspapers, offering them discounted postal rates, for instance.
 ''A friendly postal rate is something that people don't pay much attention to, but a direct subsidy of newspapers, by buying every college student a newspaper, would raise hackles,'' Mr. Jones said, adding that he thought it was unlikely the federal government would create a program similar to France's. 
 While newspapers everywhere are facing difficulties, the state of the French press is particularly dire. According to the World Association of Newspapers, the per-capita circulation of paid-for dailies in France is about half that of papers in Germany or Britain. 
 The help may buy newspapers some time, but will not solve their problems, analysts said.
 ''This is not the great reform we were waiting for,'' said Emmanuel Schwartzenberg, a former media editor at Le Figaro and the author of a book on problems facing the French media.

HEADLINE: Costs and Tighter Rules Thwart Refinancings

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
As mortgage rates hit new lows every week, the number of homeowners seeking to refinance their homes has spiked to its highest level in five years. 
 But many have been unable to win approval for their applications. And even some of the homeowners who do qualify have backed off, once they found out how difficult it was to get the advertised rate. 
 So what should be a bright spot in an otherwise dismal economy -- throngs of homeowners locking in low, fixed-rate mortgages that will free them up to spend elsewhere -- threatens to become another example of how even the best government intentions do not always pan out. 
 That was the case when the government, through its Troubled Asset Relief Program, started pumping money into banks with the goal of shoring up their balance sheets and spurring lending. And it appears to be happening again as the Federal Reserve buys up mortgage securities. The Fed is pushing down interest rates, but that has not been enough to bring the housing market back to life. 
 While rates are falling, borrowers face higher costs every step of the way, from rising fees for mortgage insurance to added costs that drive up the mortgage rate. At the same time, lenders have become more cautious about whom they will lend to, as more people lose their jobs, watch their incomes decline and fall behind on their bills. 
 One of the biggest stumbling blocks for many people is their plunging property values, which have erased all or most of the equity in their homes. Others cannot meet the increasingly stringent credit requirements, which either disqualify them or increase their costs. 
 ''Refinancing is a very difficult proposition right now,'' said Mike Stoffer, president of Stoffer Mortgage in North Canton, Ohio. ''The loss of equity and tighter credit standards are making it difficult for a lot of people to refinance.''
 Major banks and mortgage brokers agree that the number of qualified borrowers has dropped significantly. By some brokers' estimates, only 30 percent of applicants in certain markets are actually closing on their refinancing applications. In contrast, in the first half of last year, about 60 percent of applications were approved, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 And only a select few borrowers with pristine credit can secure the most attractive rates: for the week that ended Jan. 15, rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage sank to 5.12 percent, the 11th consecutive weekly drop and the lowest rate since the big mortgage financer Freddie Mac began tracking them in 1971.
 Earlier in this decade, during the real estate boom, many borrowers purchased their homes with little or no money down, meaning that even a small drop in value could wipe out any home equity. Even homeowners who initially put down 20 percent or more have seen the value of their stake fall. As a result, many homeowners need to come up with a pile of money, essentially a new down payment, to raise their equity to at least 20 percent. Otherwise they have to buy private mortgage insurance. 
 Alternatively, consumers could just buy the mortgage insurance. But getting the insurance is no longer simple. Private mortgage insurers, which incurred large losses when the housing market collapsed, have become much more selective. They also are charging more for their service. Even if a borrower does qualify for insurance, the increased costs often wipe out any savings from refinancing, mortgage brokers said. 
 In Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, housing markets that are hardest hit, at least two insurers are now requiring borrowers to have at least 10 percent equity in their homes and a credit score of more than 720. About 48 percent of Americans have scores less than 699, according to Fair Isaac, the company that computes FICO credit scores. 
 In other markets, the insurers are requiring a credit score of at least 680 -- an indication of how the definition of a good credit score has changed as the economy has deteriorated. 
 On top of that, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two big mortgage guarantors now under government control, have raised the fees they charge lenders on loans that they insure or buy. Those fees -- in part the result of the two agencies' losses in the housing market -- are passed on to borrowers, with Fannie's latest increase about to go into effect. 
 While the agencies have always charged more for mortgages for riskier borrowers, their fee structure has steadily risen over the last year. Applicants with credit scores above 720 and equity of more than 20 percent in their homes still generally escape these fees. Other applicants may qualify for refinancing but must pay the higher costs. 
 All borrowers pay a fee known as an ''adverse market delivery charge'' of 0.25 to 0.50 percent of the loan amount. Fannie, for example, also imposes a fee of 0.75 percent on owners of a condominium or cooperative apartment with less than 25 percent equity. Borrowers with a home equity loan or line of credit may pay another Fannie charge of up to 0.50 percent, depending on a variety of factors. 
 And borrowers who want to take cash out of their homes when they refinance -- if they have enough equity -- are charged a fee ranging from 0.25 percent to 3 percent of the loan amount, depending on their credit score and amount of home equity.
 Borrowers have a choice of either paying these fees upfront or wrapping the fees into their mortgage rate. Currently, a fee of 1 percent would add roughly 0.50 percent to the mortgage rate, according to Kevin Iverson, president of the Reed Mortgage Corporation in Denver.
 ''Risk-based pricing makes sense, but at the same time people are not opting to take advantage of these lower rates because they are not getting much of a benefit,'' Mr. Iverson said. That, he said, is ''not making refinancing economically viable.''
 The cost of refinancing also varies greatly from lender to lender. ''Pricing on mortgages today is erratic,'' Mr. Stoffer said. ''This is due to banks pricing aggressively and then pulling back dramatically as they get more volume than they can handle.''
 Erratic pricing is particularly rampant in the jumbo mortgage market, but that is because there are no investors to buy these loans. The jumbo loan limit was raised to a maximum of $625,500, from $417,000, in certain higher-cost markets, like New York. 
 Loans for more than $625,500 are priced about 1.7 percentage points above loans for less than $417,000, said Keith Gumbinger of HSH Associates, a financial publisher. And the rates for loans that fall in between, or $417,000 to $625,500, are nearly a third of a percentage point more than for conforming loans. 
 Many people have been shut out of the market. Some borrowers have jumped at the drop in mortgage rates for fixed-rate loans in hopes of refinancing out of riskier adjustable-rate mortgages. Others would like to simply free up some cash just when they need it the most.
 Jim Cope, who runs his own kitchen remodeling business in Canton, Ga., falls into that category. Mr. Cope and his wife, Rose Doyle, recently tried to refinance the mortgage on their home, which they purchased two years ago for $229,000. Though the couple put down 30 percent, or about $70,000, their existing lender refused to refinance the loan, which currently carries a rate of 6.75 percent. Mr. Cope said they were rejected because their income had dropped along with the value of their home.
 ''I make my payments every month, and I am not late on anything,'' said Mr. Cope, who, along with his wife, lost his health insurance when they were laid off from the same building company two years ago. ''If people can't refinance, it will further slow down the economy.''
 Many borrowers with less than 20 percent in home equity have had better luck getting loans or refinancing through the Federal Housing Administration, which insures lenders that make loans that meet its guidelines. F.H.A. loans require as little as 3.5 percent down, though borrowers pay slightly higher interest rates, as well as an upfront mortgage premium of 1.5 to 1.75 percent.
 For some borrowers, F.H.A. loans have become a more cost-effective option. In fact, F.H.A. loans now account for 20 percent of outstanding mortgages, up from 3 percent in 2006. ''F.H.A. is easier to work with, while conventional loans are becoming more difficult,'' said Mr. Stoffer, the mortgage broker. ''They have kind of flipped.''

HEADLINE: Obama Reverses Rule On U.S. Abortion Aid

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from Berkeley, Calif.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama repealed rules on Friday that restricted federal money for international organizations that promote or provide abortions overseas, sweeping aside a pillar of the social policy architecture of George W. Bush's presidency.
 The executive order that Mr. Obama signed reverses one of the first measures enacted by Mr. Bush when he took over the White House eight years ago and capped an opening-week flurry of action intended to signal a sharp break from the past in domestic and foreign arenas.
 ''For the past eight years, they have undermined efforts to promote safe and effective voluntary family planning in developing countries,'' Mr. Obama said of the restrictions. ''For these reasons, it is right for us to rescind this policy and restore critical efforts to protect and empower women and promote global economic development.'' 
 In a written statement, Mr. Obama said he would work with Congress to restore financial support for the United Nations Population Fund. But he bemoaned the ''politicization'' of abortion and promised to reach out to all sides to initiate a new dialogue about reducing unintended pregnancies.
 ''For too long,'' he said, ''international family planning assistance has been used as a political wedge issue, the subject of a back-and-forth debate that has served only to divide us. I have no desire to continue this stale and fruitless debate.''
 The move touched off the anticipated torrent of praise and criticism from advocates in the highly polarized abortion debate. Supporters of abortion rights hailed the end of what they call the ''gag rule'' binding family health clinics from even talking about medical options in other countries, while opponents warned that it would effectively spread abortion to all corners of the world.
 The restrictions Mr. Obama lifted on Friday barred the United States Agency for International Development from providing money to any international nongovernmental organization that ''performs or actively promotes abortion as a method of family planning'' in foreign countries, and covered a wide range of activities, including providing advice, counseling or information regarding abortion. The restrictions did not apply to counseling for abortions in the case of rape, incest or danger to the life of the pregnant woman.
 The policy has become a symbolic and substantive football in Washington politics over the years. President Ronald Reagan first imposed the ban in 1984 when it was announced at a conference in Mexico City. President Bill Clinton lifted it a couple of days after taking office in 1993. Mr. Bush restored it a couple of days after he took office in 2001, and advocates on both sides expected Mr. Obama to lift it again.
 The only surprise was that Mr. Obama acted a day after the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion, rather than on the day itself as the last two presidents did. Mr. Obama did little to call attention to his move, issuing his comments only in writing and releasing the order after 7 p.m. Friday.
 Moreover, Mr. Obama did not move to lift restrictions that Mr. Bush had imposed on federal financing of embryonic stem cell research, another important issue in the abortion battle. Mr. Obama supports expanded stem cell research to find cures for diseases but it remains uncertain whether he will use his executive power or wait to let Congress write the policy change into law.
 Abortion opponents condemned Friday's order, calling it an unnecessarily divisive way for a president preaching unity to start his administration. ''President Obama will be remembered forever not just as a smart, savvy, gifted and eloquent leader -- but as the Abortion President,'' Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey and co-chairman of the House Bipartisan Pro-Life Caucus, said in a written statement.
 Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, called the order ''the first in an anticipated series of attacks on longstanding pro-life policies as the new administration pushes Obama's sweeping abortion agenda.'' 
 The effect, Mr. Johnson said, would be to redirect federal money ''away from groups that do not promote abortion, and into the hands of those organizations that are the most aggressive in promoting abortion in developing countries.''
 By contrast, the president's executive order energized abortion rights and family planning groups. ''President Obama's actions will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions and women dying from high-risk pregnancies because they don't have access to family planning,'' said Tod Preston, a vice president at Population Action International.
 Word of the order was received enthusiastically at a meeting on population trends at the University of California, Berkeley. Many of the gathered experts work for family planning organizations that face declining flows of government and private aid.
 ''It is actually a great day for those who oppose abortion,'' said Steven W. Sinding, a past director-general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and population adviser to the World Bank. ''This will help many of the most effective providers of family planning services to enable women to avoid unwanted pregnancies.''

HEADLINE: China Jittery About Obama Amid Signs of Harder Line

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Edward Wong contributed reporting from Beijing.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Whether it was a shot across the bow or a simple restatement of his boss's views, Timothy F. Geithner's assertion that China ''manipulates'' its currency has complicated a crucial front in President Obama's efforts to improve America's relations with the world.
 China experts here said there were several other signs that the Obama administration could take a harder line toward Beijing, including Mr. Obama's emphasis on climate change and the environment in trade negotiations and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's focus on human rights. 
 The Chinese Ministry of Commerce responded tartly to the charge by Mr. Geithner, Mr. Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary. ''Directing unsubstantiated criticism at China on the exchange-rate issue will only help U.S. protectionism and will not help towards a real solution to the issue,'' the ministry said late on Friday in a statement to Agence France-Presse.
 China starts off on weaker footing with Mr. Obama than it did with his predecessor, George W. Bush. Mr. Bush and his last Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., cultivated Chinese leaders and refused to call Beijing a manipulator. Mr. Obama has little personal experience of China, and lacks senior advisers with a deep interest in or knowledge of the country. With the American economy in a deep slump, and China trying to ramp up its exports to cushion a sharp slowdown there, experts worry that trade relations between the countries could deteriorate.
 If the United States repairs its image in many parts of the world, that could make it harder for the Chinese to present themselves as an alternative to American influence in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere.
 ''The Chinese are probably one of the few people in the world who were sorry to see President Bush go, and are nervous about his successor,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked on China policy for the Clinton administration.
 ''They saw the Inaugural Address as having some uncomfortable elements for them,'' Mr. Lieberthal said. ''They are uneasy about Hillary Clinton. She has, in their assessment, not been a friend of China.''
 The Chinese news media played down the significance of Mr. Geithner's remarks, which were made in writing to the Senate Finance Committee as part of the confirmation process.
 Rather than dwell on or analyze the reference to China's currency, the Chinese official newspaper, The People's Daily, quoted Mr. Geithner as saying that the currency manipulation issue would take a back seat to working with China to alleviate the global financial crisis. The headline said, ''U.S. Treasury secretary-designate vows to deepen U.S.-China economic ties.''
 American experts agree that the United States will have to work closely with China to engineer a global recovery, and the two countries have each embarked on costly programs to stimulate their economies. The Obama administration will also depend on China to continue buying Treasury bills and other government debt to finance its $825 billion recovery package.
 Yet several things could conspire to spoil that cooperation. The Treasury must decide later in the spring whether to label China a currency manipulator, under a law that requires the administration to report to Congress twice a year on the exchange rate practices of trading partners.
 In his written response, Mr. Geithner appeared to leave the administration plenty of wiggle room. ''The question is how and when to broach the subject in order to do more good than harm,'' he said.
 But as a candidate, Mr. Obama took a tough line on China's practices, saying that Beijing pegged its currency at an artificially low rate and pledging to use diplomatic means to force a change.
 ''This is not good for American firms and workers, not good for the world, and ultimately likely to produce inflation problems in China itself,'' Mr. Obama said in a campaign essay for the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
 Advocates for closer ties said they worried that unless the administration developed an overall framework for the relationship, individual events like the Treasury report could dictate the atmosphere.
 It is not clear that such a framework exists. Mrs. Clinton was careful to steer clear of currency issues in her testimony to the Senate. In that testimony, she demurred on the question of whether the Obama administration would continue the ''strategic economic dialogue,'' a semiannual meeting on economic issues between the two countries that was led by Mr. Paulson.
 Mrs. Clinton does not have the same extensive history with China that she has had with other countries. She is best known there for a speech she gave in 1995 in Beijing about women's rights, and some China experts said they worried that her positions on trade and human rights could be a problem. Mr. Obama's focus on energy and climate change, experts said, could cut both ways. If China and the United States could find ways to cooperate on stemming the growth of greenhouse gases, it could become the cornerstone of the relationship. If not, it could be dangerously disruptive.
 Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington, said the financial crisis had upended many of the assumptions about the relationship.
 China's currency, he noted, has increased in value in recent months because it is pegged to the dollar, which has risen as investors fled to safe investments. China's trade surplus with the United States has stopped growing, as American consumers stop buying so many Chinese imports.
 C. Fred Bergsten, the Peterson institute's director, said Mr. Geithner had another target in mind with his remark.
 ''It was a shot across the bow of Congress,'' he said. ''The administration is saying, 'We will be tougher on the Chinese on trade, so you don't need to pass protectionist legislation.' ''

HEADLINE: A Better Shade of Green

BYLINE: By J. WAYNE LEONARD. 
J. Wayne Leonard is the chief executive of the electricity company Entergy.

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
 DURING Senate hearings on his nomination as secretary of energy, Steven Chu, the Nobel laureate physicist, reiterated his and President Obama's support for a cap-and-trade program as a cost-effective method to address climate change. Under such a program, a limit is set on emissions, and polluters can emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases only by obtaining permits. 
 That's good policy. However, Dr. Chu may find the path to cap and trade made more difficult by the well-intentioned advocates of a national ''renewable portfolio standard,'' which would require energy companies to produce specific amounts of electricity largely from wind, solar and geothermal energy. 
 A renewable portfolio standard is said to be needed for creating and improving renewable energy technologies. In practice, however, it does little to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and makes energy production excessively expensive. 
 Coal-fired power plants produce more than 83 percent of the electricity sector's carbon dioxide emissions. But because coal is cheaper than natural gas or oil, it is the least likely to be displaced by solar or wind power. 
 Natural gas has a relatively low carbon content. But it is likely to be the first to be displaced by renewable sources of energy because it is more expensive than coal. That means that even a renewable portfolio standard as high as 20 percent would reduce emissions by only a small fraction of what is needed to lower the risk of catastrophic climate change. 
 This modest decrease in carbon dioxide emissions would come at twice the cost per ton of reduction that would come from a cap-and-trade strategy. Under cap and trade, in other words, we could double the reduction for the same money. And isn't a maximum decrease in emissions the ultimate goal? In this struggling economy, America's elected officials cannot afford to make expensive choices that do not solve our problems.
 And, most important, a renewable portfolio standard would do nothing to help develop the technology that's most urgently needed to address climate change: a method of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants -- which generate more than half of all electricity in the United States. 
 To replace all of America's coal-fired power plants with renewable sources of energy would cost nearly a trillion dollars. Even if the United States could pay such a price, China and other developing countries that rely on coal far more than we do could not. China is building more and more coal-fired power plants and, by 2020, will have three times as many as the United States has today. 
 Carbon-capture technology, much more than solar or wind power or other renewable forms of energy generation, is our most important potential green technology for export. And the fastest way to develop it is to create a market for it here in the United States by establishing a cap-and-trade program that puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions, and investing private and taxpayer money in research on carbon capture and storage. A renewable portfolio standard would only divert our attention from this vital mission. 
 Consider what it would mean for our company alone. At Entergy, less than 25 percent of the electricity we produce comes from coal-fired power plants, so our carbon dioxide emissions are already low. And we are researching retrofit technologies to capture carbon dioxide from the coal plants we do have. 
 Under a renewable portfolio standard, though, we would be required to spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually developing solar, wind and geothermal energy, but would have no incentive to continue our pursuit of carbon-capture technology. 
 Renewable forms of energy have their place in meeting our needs, and putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions will make them more economically appealing. But it makes little sense to institute a renewable portfolio standard to require their development. Instead, the new energy secretary should advise President Obama to create a strong cap-and-trade program and send a clear signal to the rest of the world that we are serious about addressing climate change.

HEADLINE: Economic Setbacks That Define the Bush Years

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
IT was a time of low inflation -- the lowest overall rate for any president since John F. Kennedy.
 Other than that, the economic record of President George W. Bush was largely a disappointing one. During his administration, the country grew at the slowest overall pace of any recent president, whether measured in gross domestic product or employment. The last president to preside while the stock market did worse was Herbert Hoover.
 Economic performance was actually good for much of the middle years of Mr. Bush's eight-year term, but it began and ended with recessions. 
 Some of the disappointment with Mr. Bush may stem from the fact that he took office at the end of a huge boom, in both the economy and the stock market.
 ''No matter who took office in 2001, they were destined to oversee dashed expectations regarding the economy, the markets and the geopolitical outlook,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''It was all captured in the lunacy of the $5 trillion surplus on the horizon. That vision required no wars, no recessions and a nonstop spectacular bull market for equities.''
 ''That said,'' he added, ''it certainly did not have to come to this.''
 During Bill Clinton's administration, the number of new jobs created was greater than the growth in the population of working-age Americans, something that had happened in only one previous administration since World War II, that of Lyndon B. Johnson. Job growth also sputtered after Mr. Johnson left office.
 President Bush's administration was marked by a recession that began two months after he took office and another downturn in his final year of office. In the end, the economy during his term added enough jobs to employ only 14 percent of the added number of working-age Americans, the lowest proportion of any postwar administration. Employment grew at a compound annual rate of only 0.3 percent, half the 0.6 percent rate that his father had recorded in what had previously been the worst post-World War II performance.
 The gross domestic product rose at a compound annual rate of just 2 percent during his administration, the lowest of any postwar presidency. But on a per capita basis, the 1 percent annual gain was a little better than during the administrations of his father or of Dwight D. Eisenhower.
 Those figures are likely to change, at least a little. They assume that the consensus forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, of a fourth-quarter G.D.P. decline at an annual rate of 5 percent, will be correct. That figure will be reported on a preliminary basis next week, and revised in later months as more data becomes available. The employment figures will also be revised.
 One set of numbers that will not change is that of the stock market. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell at an annual rate of 5.6 percent during the Bush years, exceeding the 4 percent decline during the administration of Richard M. Nixon. It did not, however, come close to the 31 percent rate of decline during the term of Herbert Hoover.
 On the brighter side, the Consumer Price Index climbed an average of only 2.4 percent a year, down from the 2.6 percent figure posted in the Clinton years.
 But that low inflation was a mixed blessing for the administration's record, as the national debt rose to 75 percent of G.D.P. Had there been more inflation -- and consequently a higher nominal G.D.P. -- the gain would have been smaller despite the large budget deficits.
 Barack Obama enters office with expectations almost the mirror opposite of those faced by Mr. Bush eight years ago. Share prices are depressed, the economy is shrinking and trillion-dollar budget deficits are expected.
 If it was virtually impossible for President Bush to exceed the high expectations that prevailed in 2000, it may be much easier for President Obama to see the economy get better on his watch.

GRAPHIC: CHART: G.D.P. figures include consensus estimate for fourth quarter of 2008, a decline at an annual rate of 5 percent. For stock prices, figures are from the day before a president took office until the day before he left. For Treasury debt, inflation and employment figures, figures include the month a president took office through the last full month in
 which he served. For G.D.P., figures include the quarter a president took office through the last full quarter in which he served. Per capita G.D.P. figures are based on total population. Employment growth figures reflect changes in population of people aged 16 years or over.(Sources: Haver Analytics, Standard & Poor's and Bloomberg) Chart details bar graphs.

HEADLINE: Doing the Right Thing by Paying the Nanny Tax

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
What hoops did you have to jump through to pay by the rules? Send e-mail to rlieber@nytimes.com or post a comment at nytimes.com/yourmoney.

 BODY:
The nanny tax issue simply won't go away.
 Ever since Zoe Baird, President Bill Clinton's first nominee for attorney general, withdrew her name from consideration because she had broken rules relating to household employees, the issue has tripped up public figures every couple of years. 
 This week, it became part of the chatter around Caroline Kennedy's decision to pull out of contention for New York's vacant United States Senate seat. This month, Timothy F. Geithner's nomination for Treasury secretary hit a snag over, among other mistakes, an issue relating to a housekeeper. 
 Every time this happens, it leaves a little pit in the stomach of hundreds of thousands of people who are breaking the law themselves. Various estimates put the tax cheat rate at 80 to 95 percent of people who employ baby sitters, housekeepers and home health aides. In 1997, taxpayers filed 310,367 household employee tax payment forms with the Internal Revenue Service. By 2006, the latest year for which data are available, the number was down to 225,441.
 Given the unease, why don't household employers pay the taxes and other costs that other larger employers do as a matter of course? 
 ''The chances of getting caught are slim,'' said Arthur U. Ellis, president of the Nanny Tax Company in Chicago, which helps clients pay on time. ''And why should I pay for something when the vast majority of people are not paying it?''
 Some employers don't want to pay the extra 10 percent or so on top of the employee's salary to cover the taxes and other costs. The employees often balk, too, because they don't want taxes withheld from their paychecks. They may demand higher wages to make up for money that an employer takes out, raising employer costs even more. 
 Perhaps the most daunting part of all of this, however, is how much effort and paperwork it takes to do the right thing. Just how complicated is it to comply? Let us count the ways in the list below, which I derived in part from I.R.S. Publication 926, the ''Household Employer's Tax Guide.'' What follows should serve as a good starting guide for anyone who's finally been scared straight by the news this month. 
 1. IMMIGRATION STATUS Employers must make sure an employee is eligible to work in the United States. Employees affirm this by filling out a form called the I-9. (I've linked to this form and others, which are often in PDF format, in the version of this column at nytimes.com/yourmoney.)
 Mr. Geithner got this right, but in an unusual twist, his housekeeper's authorization to work in the United States expired while he employed her. There isn't a general obligation to regularly check up on an employee's eligibility, according to David Grunblatt, a lawyer who runs the immigration practice for Proskauer Rose. But employers who review a new employee's authorization document and know that the worker's eligibility will end must review the employee's status later.
 2. EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER You'll need one of these to put on tax forms you file for your household employee. It's not the same as a Social Security number. You can apply for one on the I.R.S. Web site. 
 3. FEDERAL TAXES If you pay $1,700 or more in 2009 to a household employee, then you need to withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. That amounts to 15.3 percent of the worker's salary, which is generally split equally between employer and employee. If you pay more than $1,000 in any quarter to an employee, you must pay federal unemployment taxes of another 0.8 percent of wages up to $7,000 a year.
 4. INCOME TAX ISSUES You aren't required to withhold money for federal, state and city income taxes from employees' paychecks, but they may ask you to do so. Figuring out how much to withhold isn't easy. The paycheck calculator at 4nannytaxes.com can help. 
 5. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES You will probably have to pay them. The I.R.S. keeps a list of state unemployment agencies that starts on page 13 of Publication 926. Look yours up and seek guidance on the rules. 
 6. WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGE Many states require you to have it, in case your employee is injured on the job. You can find a list of the states that do on the Web site of Breedlove & Associates in Austin, Tex., another company that helps people pay household employee taxes and handles payroll. 
 Getting this wrong can cost serious money. My wife and I struggled mightily to get our workers' comp account set up through the entity that the state of New York forces you to use. It didn't happen until weeks after our baby sitter started working. Not long after, the state hit us with a $1,500 fine for our short period of noncompliance, an amount that was more than three times the annual premium. We appealed and ultimately paid $250, which is still insulting given all of our failed attempts to get the agency to return phone calls and answer e-mail messages during the application process. 
 Kathleen Webb, co-founder of HomeWork Solutions in Sterling, Va., another service for household employers, said we were actually lucky. ''I've seen penalties equal to the price of a small car,'' she said.
 Your home insurance policy may offer some coverage for household employees, too, so it's worth a call to check. 
 7. FORMS AND PAYMENTS Depending on where you live and your other tax obligations, you may have to make quarterly filings and payments to your state for unemployment taxes, as well as quarterly filings and payments to the federal government. You'll also have to file Schedule H, the household employment tax form, with your federal tax return each April. Miss a deadline, and you could owe penalties and interest. 
 8. RECORDKEEPING Given the potential for getting any of this wrong, it's a good idea to keep copies of every employee pay stub, every form you file and proof of all payments from your bank. The I.R.S. suggests keeping records for at least four years after the due date of your tax return or the date you actually paid the taxes, whichever is later. 
 Exhausted yet? ''All of the states and even the federal government make it fairly cumbersome for the average family,'' said Tom Breedlove, the director of marketing and business development at Breedlove. ''These are extremely busy professionals, usually with small children, and they don't have an H.R. department and a law team to chase all of this paperwork around between 9 and 5 when the government offices are open.''
 Amen, brother. The fact that this is all so hard is a national embarrassment, one that infuriates those who labor mightily to comply and causes many more to throw up their hands in disgust and flout the tax laws. This costs various governments untold millions in lost revenue at a time when they desperately need it. Someone ought to step up and find a way to streamline it all. 
 Until that happens -- and I'm not holding my breath -- consider a couple of reasons it may be wise for people who are not paying their taxes to reconsider. 
 Let's say you have to fire your housekeeper or baby sitter, as an increasing number of financially distressed people are doing. The job-seeking nanny may try to file for unemployment benefits. If you haven't paid into the system, you'll be in for trouble when the nanny names the former employer. ''The whole house of cards comes down,'' said Ms. Webb of HomeWork Solutions. ''The I.R.S. and the state agencies talk to each other.'' That means that you could end up owing back taxes, interest and penalties to multiple parties. 
 Also, consider the human side of this. Household employees who spend their working years laboring for employers who don't pay Social Security or Medicare taxes won't be eligible for those benefits come retirement time. Is that any way to repay someone for years of service, especially if you're not paying them enough to put away much money on their own?
 If you're ready to join the ranks of the tax compliant, it will take a dozen or so hours to get set up and then a couple dozen more annually to handle all of the paperwork and payroll duties. Or, you can hire companies like Breedlove, the Nanny Tax Company or HomeWork Solutions to do it for you. The cost ranges from roughly $400 to $1,300 a year, depending on the level of service. A company called NannyPay offers software for do-it-yourselfers for $97.95 a year. 
 Once you're paying on the books, you can use a flexible spending account through your employer to cover up to $5,000 in eligible child or elder care expenses each year. If you don't have access to such an account, you may also be eligible for the federal Dependent Care Tax Credit. 
 The tax savings probably won't make up for all the costs of following the many rules, especially when you factor in the value of your time. But the good feeling that comes from doing the right thing may soothe the financial sting. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 11, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Your Money column on Jan. 24, about paying employment taxes for nannies and other household workers, misstated the rule for paying federal unemployment taxes. You are liable for the tax if you pay total cash wages of $1,000 or more in aggregate in any quarter of a calendar year -- not $1,000 per employee. (A reader pointed out the error recently, discovered while preparing her taxes.)

HEADLINE: More Than Charisma

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: Boston 

 BODY:
 On a rainy October night in 2006, I took a cab to the John F. Kennedy library here to conduct a very public interview. As we pulled up, the driver asked, ''Who's on the program?''
 ''Barack Obama,'' I said. 
 ''Oh,'' he replied, ''our next president.''
 I mentioned this to then-Senator Obama during the program and he got a good laugh out of it. He hadn't yet announced that he was running. The capacity crowd in the auditorium was clear about what it wanted. It cheered every mention of a possible run. Obama-mania was already well under way, and it would only grow.
 I was back at the library this week to interview Gwen Ifill about her new book, ''The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama,'' and I wondered aloud about this continuing love affair with all things Obama -- the feverish excitement, the widespread joy and pride, and the remarkable surge of hope in an otherwise downbeat, if not depressing, period.
 Where was all this coming from? What was it about?
 Yes, as everyone agrees, Mr. Obama is handsome, fit, smart, and a great speaker. As Ms. Ifill noted in her book, ''Voters are attracted to youth, vitality and change.''
 And Americans tend to get giddy over winners, especially underdogs who take the measure of a foe thought to be impregnable -- in this case, the mighty forces carefully assembled over several years by the Clintons.
 And it's not just the president himself who looks good. Even the shameless purveyors of fantasy at central casting would blush at the thought of crafting a family as picture perfect as the Obamas. So, yes, there is an awful lot to like about the Obama phenomenon.
 But I've seen charismatic politicians and pretty families come and go like sunrises and sunsets over the years. There was something more that was making people go ga-ga over Obama. Something deeper.
 We've been watching that something this week, and it's called leadership. Mr. Obama has been feeding the almost desperate hunger in this country for mature leadership, for someone who is not reckless and clownish, shortsighted and self-absorbed.
 However you feel about his policies, and there are people grumbling on the right and on the left, Mr. Obama has signaled loudly and clearly that the era of irresponsible behavior in public office is over.
 No more crazy wars. No more torture, and no more throwing people in prison without even the semblance of due process. No more napping while critical problems like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, global warming, and economic inequality in the United States grow steadily worse.
 ''We remain a young nation,'' Mr. Obama said in his Inaugural Address, ''but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.''
 On Wednesday, his first full day in office, the president took steps to make the federal government more transparent, signaling immediately that the country would move away from the toxic levels of secrecy that marked the Bush years.
 ''Transparency and rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency,'' he said. It was a commitment to responsible behavior, and a challenge to the public to hold the Obama administration accountable. It reminded me of the wonderful line written into a federal appeals court ruling in 2002 by Judge Damon Keith:
 ''Democracies die behind closed doors.''
 This has been the Obama way, to set a responsible example and then to call on others to follow his mature lead. In Iowa, after his victory in the Democratic caucuses a year ago, he promised to be ''a president who will be honest about the choices and challenges we face, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we disagree, who won't just tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to know.''
 In a cynical age, the inclination is to dismiss this stuff as so much political rhetoric. But Mr. Obama carries himself in a way that suggests he means what he says, which gives him great credibility when he urges Americans to work hard and make sacrifices, not just for themselves and their families but for the common good -- and when he tells black audiences that young men need to hitch up their trousers and behave themselves, and that families need to turn off the TV so the kids can do their homework.
 Or when he says of the many serious challenges facing the nation, as he did in his Inaugural Address: ''They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.''
 The bond is growing between the nation and its new young leader. Let's hope it's a mature romance that weathers the long haul.

ELSEWHERE, U.S.A
 By Dalton Conley
 By 221 pp. Pantheon Books. $24
 Pity the poor Organization Man. Once upon a time, he ruled the American Century with his natty fedora and his quest for ''belongingness.'' Sure, everyone loves him in ''Mad Men,'' but these days his wife makes more money than he does, his kids take more meetings and the senior v.p. next door has started wearing age-inappropriate indie rock T-shirts. Even his shrink finds his preoccupation with the authentic self passe. And the sociologists can't stop writing his obituary. 
 Dalton Conley is the latest. ''A new breed of American has arrived on the scene,'' Conley, a professor at New York University, declares in ''Elsewhere, U.S.A.,'' his compact guidebook to our nervous new world. Instead of individuals searching for authenticity, we are ''intraviduals'' defined by shifting personas and really cool electronics, which help us manage ''the myriad data streams, impulses, desires and even consciousnesses that we experience in our heads as we navigate multiple worlds.'' The denizens of our ''Elsewhere Society,'' Conley argues, ''are only convinced they're in the right place, doing the right thing, at the right time, when they're on their way to the next destination. Constant motion is a balm to a culture in which the very notion of authenticity . . . has been shattered into a thousand e-mails.'' 
 But that constant motion doesn't quite take the form we might think. Americans, Conley argues, are no longer the geographically rootless nomads of our national mythology. These days, once we have children we change partners -- in a pattern he calls ''dynamic polygamy'' (basically serial monogamy, but kinkier) -- more often than we change locations. (Or jobs: the percentage of long-term workers at large firms has actually increased.) And for all our sense of rising insecurity, individual incomes are not more volatile than they used to be. It just feels that way, thanks to the two-earner household in which women enter and exit the work force according to shifting child-rearing demands. 
 What has changed, Conley argues, is our sense of time and value. In an ''economic red shift,'' the merely affluent feel themselves falling behind the superrich even as they pull ahead of the average worker. And so they clock endless hours in the online ''portable workshop,'' mindful of the opportunity cost of not working. Finally, the new ''price culture'' puts a dollar figure on everything while undermining confidence in our ability to know the value of anything, including ourselves. ''The division between price and value has increasingly collapsed under the weight of economic rationality that spreads like wildfire across sectors of our existence,'' Conley writes. ''In today's economy, many are dogged by the question 'What was my value added?' '' 
 The ''constant fear of being exposed, cut out or outsourced,'' he argues, ''is the principal pathos of the era.'' But he's not talking about assembly-line workers looking anxiously toward China. Instead, he cites the competition between ophthalmologists and ''community-college-educated technicians'' over Lasik surgery and a Harvard Business Review article about ''fraud anxiety'' among C.E.O.'s that was ''voted third best for 2005.'' And then there's the vanishing airline snack. Instead of complimentary peanuts, Conley laments, passengers are now given a sales pitch, capped with the announcement that ''American Airlines is happy to accept American Express or other major credit cards.'' How many billable hours were spent developing that cross-marketing deal, he wonders, and what was it worth? As with Amex, so with all of us. ''Value is elusive'' in our ''symbolic economy,'' he writes. ''So our own worth is therefore elusive, too.'' 
 For a big-picture guy, Conley seems strangely preoccupied with free food. Making the obligatory visit to Google headquarters, he's ''stunned'' by the no-charge cafeteria, not to mention the valet dry cleaning, roving massage therapists and giant employee sandbox (but no on-site childcare). Google ''epitomizes the Elsewhere Ethic better than any other company,'' except that the Googlers happily riding the Wi-Fi-enabled shuttle to their ''(n)office'' (as Conley hopes we'll start calling it) aren't anxious, fragmented or bitter about their leaders' private 767. ''I tried my best to foment discontent,'' Conley writes, ''but there was none lurking there. . . . I must admit it freaked me out, in the same way that zombies in a horror movie might.'' 
 Conley frets about the ''psychic violence'' of our increasingly unequal service economy, but his class-consciousness translates mostly into an acute sensitivity to embarrassment. Like an episode of ''Seinfeld,'' ''Elsewhere, U.S.A.'' tends to move from one baroquely awkward social experience to the next. At an upscale restaurant, Conley is mortified to discover that the waiter is an old dorm mate from his ''elite public university.'' He cringes when his sister gets bossed by the nanny. Recalling the time he went to see ''Do the Right Thing,'' he confesses to not joining the people who walked out in protest when the theater showed a commercial. ''I knew they were 'doing the right thing,' '' he writes. ''But I didn't want to miss the . . . movie. . . . I resolved the dispute between my multiple selves by giving in to the desire to see the film.'' In the Elsewhere Society, he explains, ''guilt is often the moral ax that serves to split our selfhood into intravidualistic fragments.'' 
 Conley is a lively if sometimes overheated writer, and his book usefully summarizes all sorts of far-flung academic research while repurposing the latest pop-sociological idea entrepreneurship, from Chris Anderson's ''long tail'' to Richard Florida's ''creative class.'' But what's Conley's value added? The parts of the book that feel true also feel very familiar, while the rest feels less like a coherent argument than a series of disconnected riffs on The Way We Live Now. Call it stand-up sociology: Conley is much exercised about T-shirts, bottled water, personal trainers, ''the proliferation of eating options at sports stadiums,'' and people who bus their own tables at McDonalds. Tip jars, he argues, threaten democracy and ''cheapen smiles in general.'' And ''the rise of Skymall'' is evidence that ''the very concept of public space is collapsing before our eyes.'' (He really must spend a lot of time on airplanes.) 
 Refreshingly, Conley doesn't tell us to smash our BlackBerrys, shred the takeout sushi menu and get back to the family dinner table. ''Do not hold yourself to a mythologized standard of the past,'' he writes in his conclusion, before falling prey to the same confirmation bias he mocked earlier in the book, when he chided social science research for ''magically'' confirming that middle-class child-rearing practices are best. ''The successful professional parents,'' he boldly predicts, ''will be the ones who manage to blend their child-rearing duties with their professional ones, making their children comfortable in high-pressure, high-status work environments.'' Follow the citation to some intriguing research conductedin the Conley home (n)office. ''Here I must confess to years of screaming at my wife for trying to involve the kids in her work life as well as yelling at her to turn off her cellphone during 'family time.' I was wrong, and she was right. . . . But I can't bring myself to apologize in the main text, so I am relegating this to an endnote.'' h

HEADLINE: Tear Down Stadium and Build Up the Bronx

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Months after its rousing and official farewell, old Yankee Stadium stands strong, proud and in one piece, shuttered but not altogether silenced.
 Twenty-two days until pitchers and catchers, its message board atop the outer wall reminded passers-by last week -- one day before the Yankees finally left the building. Humble sorts they are, they made a publicized show of an administrative schlep across the street Friday that was months overdue, like the demolition of a ballpark so beloved that it almost sounds sacrilegious to ask, why is it still here?
 A civic conscience trumps sentimentality, however. Enough is enough. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan: Tear down this stadium, Mr. Bloomberg! 
 ''That's going take at least two years because the city's priority is the Yankees, not the neighborhood,'' said Joyce Hogi, a member of the Community Board 4 parks committee.
 She and her colleagues fought a long, losing battle of preservation best evidenced by two stadiums at the expense of cherished parkland, to be replaced here and there and on terms mostly beneficial to a private enterprise already worth in excess of $1 billion. All while the old and the new stand side by side, towering over what is commonly called the nation's poorest Congressional district like some supersize baseball mall.
 From the press office of the mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, we received the city's estimated timetable of 16 months -- or spring 2010 -- for the dismantling of the old stadium, as well as explanations of why it has yet to begin (without a demolition company even chosen by the city).
 PART I ''The primary reason Yankee Stadium has not started demolition is that the new stadium and its offices have just now become available for occupancy.'' But if New York schoolchildren can learn in trailers when there is a shortage of building space, why couldn't the Yankees have conducted business in a temporary shelter for a few short months to expedite the demolition process?
 PART II ''The demolition of Yankee Stadium, with a lot of adjacent construction, utility work and proximity to the elevated subway structure, requires a complicated public procurement process.'' But if demolition is so complicated, how has Shea Stadium -- not as cramped but similarly flanked by a new stadium and an elevated subway -- been largely flattened, piece by piece, since October, with the job expected to be completed next month?
 Hogi's point about construction priorities is one that cannot be hammered home enough. When it is in the baseball team's interest to demolish a stadium so there will be enough parking by opening day, the old ballpark can't come down soon enough. When the existing stadium site has been designated for replacement park baseball fields, the community can wait -- in the case of Heritage Field on the existing old Stadium site, until at least fall 2011, or three years after the last major league pitch.
 We have heard many 11th-hour lamentations lately about tax-free bonds and infrastructure costs, about sweetheart deals handed to baseball teams when the city is swimming in the red ink of recession. No question, the entire business of public spending on pro sports has been sordid, and not just in New York. In New Jersey, state government can't slash budgets fast enough while hundreds of millions in public money pour into Meadowlands infrastructure that will be used by the Giants and the Jets to bilk their most loyal fans.
 These aren't the first megadeals cut by politicians that do not pass the smell test, but nobody has been swindled like the Yankee Stadium community. Nothing has been taken that can't be replaced except the centralized parkland the Yankees have wanted since they remodeled the old place in the mid-1970s and hung a blue sign on the fence of Macombs Dam Park that said: We Do Care.
 Having long ago learned that slogans are much cheaper than sympathy, now there is one on the River Avenue side of the new stadium. Building the Future of the Bronx, it says. All that is missing is Bombers after Bronx. The community's future is parkland in piecemeal, with taxpayers picking up the ever-escalating tab.
 The city and the Yankees say the area will benefit in economic development. Hogi said: ''The Yankees have been there for 80 years and what's been developed? The only thing they are building now is a fortress so the people coming in will never have to step foot in the neighborhood.''
 Hogi lives on the Grand Concourse, where she said drawn shades aren't enough to dim the nighttime light emanating from the new stadium, blocks away. She works at All Hallows High School on 164th Street, where she has watched sports teams load onto buses to play home games in the East Bronx. She cringed last summer at the sight of children jammed into an interim park on 161st Street and Jerome Avenue, while two stadiums cast long shadows on narrow streets, the epitome of Yankees shock, arrogance and awe.
 The community should not have to endure another two-stadium summer. Old Yankee Stadium should not be harder to take down than Barry Bonds. Do something about this, Mr. Mayor. Tear down this landmark now.

HEADLINE: They Warned You About Us

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WE sat in the editor's office trying to think of a less embarrassing name for the column. The Middle Ages? Generation B? Crossroads?
No one had the heart to say Boomers.
There are many ways I'm pleased to be introduced: father of three boys and a girl, ages 14 to 20; husband of 25 years; journalist; children's novelist; longtime Little League coach; jogger; snorkeler; biker; loud whistler.
But if someone said, ''Hey, meet Mike, he's a real baby boomer'' -- to tell you the truth, it sounds a little cheesy.
It ought to be a simple demographic fact, one of 78 million people born during the post-World War II population boom. 
But somehow -- mistakenly I would argue -- the term has become synonymous with greedy, spoiled, divorced, remarried mega-shopper.
Baby boomer doesn't give off the same nuance as ''The Greatest Generation.'' A thousand sun-dappled villas in Tuscany can't touch the rows of plain white crosses on the bluffs of Normandy.
Since the 1960s, when many of us were teenagers, Madison Avenue along with the news media have been polling, interviewing, analyzing, poking and sniffing us, and that continues to this moment, even as nearly 10,000 boomers turn 60 every day.
The consumer research firm Yankelovich knows, for example, that if boomers are asked to specify when old age begins, they will typically answer 79.5, a ridiculously sunny view, considering average life expectancy is 77.
In their 2006 book, ''Generation Ageless,'' J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich, and Ann Clurman, a senior partner, sum up the generation this way: ''For decades baby boomers have been chided for being self centered, self absorbed, self confident ... even narcissistic. There's no argument here. Guilty as charged. But so what?''
What a defense.
In the 1970s, Landon Jones, a onetime People magazine editor, tracked down the very first boomer, Kathy Casey-Kirschling, born in Philadelphia one second after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946. Since then, the news media have documented Ms. Casey-Kirschling's every move, from marriage to children to divorce to teaching career to remarriage, to grandchildren, to her 42-foot trawler docked in Chesapeake Bay, and last year, the happy ending, to becoming the first boomer to collect Social Security. (Michael Astrue, commissioner of Social Security, lavished extra praise on Ms. Casey-Kirschling for applying online.)
No generation was ever so studied, and yet, the more we got quantified, the punier we looked.
By the time Tom Wolfe wrote his Me Decade essay in 1976 for New York magazine (which begins with a 1,500-word description of an unnamed boomer at a spiritual gathering at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles trying to will away her hemorrhoids), there were nearly 29 million Americans ages 18 to 24, about twice as many as there had been in 1960.
As the father of three wonderful but self-absorbed males who are now in that age group, I can only say that having 29 million of them suddenly appear at your doorstep would be chilling. In retrospect, it makes perfect sense to me that Mr. Wolfe, then 45, slapped us down good.
Then in 1980 Mr. Jones wrote his boomer classic, ''Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation,'' and laid us to rest: ''Condemned to achieve its greatness en masse, the boom generation in the end has produced few leaders or even genuine individualists.'' At that moment, the median boomer was 25, and we were done for.
Let me just say this in our defense: Barack Obama (1961), Gen. David Petraeus (1952), Bill Gates (1955), Steve Jobs (1955), Spike Lee (1957), Meryl Streep (1949), Yo-Yo Ma (1955), Steven Spielberg (1946), Garry Trudeau (1948), Capt. Chesley B. Sullenberger III (1951). And six boomers who won Nobel Prizes in recent years before reaching the age of 60: Andrew Fire (1959) and Craig Mello (1960) for gene research; Roger Myerson (1951), Eric Maskin (1950) and Paul Krugman (1953) in economics; and Al Gore (1948) for environmental work.
Some would say Bill Clinton (1946) and George W. Bush (1946), though not I, at least not in our defense.
Over all, I would argue we were studied too much, too soon, hilariously caricatured, masterfully trivialized and sent packing before we got started.
Plus, our nickname is highly vulnerable to delicious irony: The baby's now on statins, the boomer's gone bust.
''Boomer'' has gotten such a bum rap that even our new president, who is a clear-cut boomer demographically (the boom years ran through 1964), has sought to link himself to a younger generation with a postboomer mentality, one that types with its thumbs to communicate and is not tainted by the cultural wars of the 1960s.
My response is that you can't go generation shopping; it may be good politics, but it's bad anthropology. You are what you are -- in Mr. Obama's case, a late boomer with a gift for forging consensus across many divides. He received his biggest boost from the youngest voters -- 66 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds supported Mr. Obama, according to national exit polls -- but when it came time for him to pick a Cabinet, 10 of his 14 designees so far have been boomers and three are older.
So boomers are still in the thick of it. And yet a substantial number of us are entering late middle age and finding it nowhere near as welcoming as expected. We face a future of diminished expectations because of the deep recession. Savings that were planned for retirement or to send kids to college or to help provide for aging parents have been decimated.
Time and money had always been the boomers' friends: a new job, a second marriage, a reconstructed knee, a fresh start. Now, says Mr. Smith of Yankelovich, boomers face the economic collapse with ''shortened timelines.''
Thanks to our parents, visions of the Depression still play in our heads.
My own mother grew up in an East Boston tenement, graduated from Girls Latin School, attended Radcliffe for two years, then, in 1934, dropped out to take a clerical job to help support her parents. My father and his brother Carl fought in the Pacific in World War II, and as Tom Brokaw says of the hero veterans in ''The Greatest Generation,'' they rarely talked about it, certainly never bragged (though my uncle had a leg blown off by a land mine). I remember my dad telling one story, about a frightening beach landing, Japanese bullets whizzing past, and a friend telling him later that the whole time my dad kept saying, ''Jesus Christ, this isn't funny.''
In 1946, 2.2 million couples married -- a record not equaled for 33 years -- including my parents, my Uncle Carl and Aunt Jeanne, my Aunt Irma and Uncle Billy.
The Greatest Generation made the greatest sacrifice -- 300,000 dead, 1.7 million wounded in World War II -- but they weren't always the greatest when they got home. My father worked an eight-hour shift, five days a week, and when he was done he was done -- never did anything around the house, never made himself or us a meal, and that did not change when my mother went back to work.
''Tilda, I need a cup of coffee.''
My wife and I both work 50- to 60-hour weeks, and these last half dozen years it has been my turn to anchor our household, do most of the shopping and cooking. My father, a newspaper copy chief, wrote freelance pieces for Editor & Publisher about how funny it was to have a woman working on his copy desk. More than half my editors have been women.
Mr. Brokaw's book notes that just one of six new marriages in 1940 ended in divorce, versus one in two in the 1990s, and he champions those lifelong relationships as part of that generation's greatness. I don't feel that way, though my parents were married a lifetime. My dad had a vicious temper, and he and my mom fought so often that my brother and I were afraid to take friends home. A few years after he died, I asked my mother if she missed his company. ''Not really,'' she said. ''It's so peaceful now.''
Nor do I believe the boomers are any more or less selfish than other generations. We do so much for our kids, we're accused of being helicopter parents (yet another favorite indictment). And that's only half of it: According to AARP, 18 percent of boomers -- 14 million -- are also helping care for aging loved ones.
It is true that boomers played a major role in the economic collapse: Lehman Brothers' Richard Fuld (1946); WaMu's Kerry Killinger (1949); Merrill Lynch's Stanley O'Neal (1951); the S.E.C.'s Christopher Cox (1952). But it's also true that boomers have been looked to for a way out: Henry Paulson (1946), Ben Bernanke (1953), Tim Geithner (1961), Mary Schapiro (1955).
And Bernie Madoff (1938) is not our fault.
So, for this time when we are all facing more challenges than we bargained for, a new column. While a few will be about my own boomer life, most will be reported. I welcome your thoughts.
Correction: February 8, 2009, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Generation B column on Jan. 25, about the achievements of baby boomers, referred incorrectly to the ages of Andrew Fire and Craig Mello at the time they won a Nobel Prize in 2006 for gene research. Mr. Fire was born in 1959 and Mr. Mello was born in 1960, as the column correctly stated, so they were in their 40s at the time, not their 50s.

HEADLINE: For Growing Ranks of the White-Collar Jobless, Support With a Touch of the Spur

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. 

 BODY:
The meeting could have been at any number of corporations across the country. Everyone present sat at tables around an LCD projector with their laptops open. 
 But the setting was a church conference room, not a board room, and the spreadsheets under discussion focused not on work but the lack of it. They documented how many hours each person had devoted the previous week to looking for a job. 
 ''Total hours I spent last week was 68,'' said Bob Roeder, 51, one of the group's co-leaders, going over his report on a recent Monday. ''Number of letters sent out was four. Total number of network contacts was 12.''
 This was the weekly meeting of a job search ''accountability'' group, organized by the Executive Network Group of Greater Chicago, an organization for executives ''in transition.'' 
 Membership in various networking organizations across the country for unemployed executives and other professionals has ballooned in recent months, leaders of several say, as the recession has continued its march, sparing not even the highly educated and skilled. 
 And job search support groups like this one have become quasi families for people like Mr. Roeder, who was laid off nearly two years ago from his job earning almost six figures as an area sales manager for Electronic Data Systems. 
 Providing a spur as well as solace, the groups offer glimpses in miniature at the travails of a swath of individuals in this recession whose lives had once seemed, if not charmed, at least quite comfortable as they carved out places in the middle and upper-middle class.
 ''A job loss in America is, psychologically, a real big hit,'' said Cathy-Ann Romero, 53, another co-leader, who lost her job as a human resources manager 10 months ago. 
 Ms. Romero, who holds two master's degrees, recently applied for a part-time job as a packer on the overnight shift at an online grocery store to help make ends meet. 
 The Monday morning meetings at a church in this Chicago suburb, she said, help the members realize, ''We're not in it alone.''
 Indeed, white-collar unemployment rose to 4.6 percent in December, up from 3 percent the year before. The figures still pale in comparison to the 11.3 percent unemployment rate for blue-collar workers. But Lawrence Mishel, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, said white-collar unemployment rose faster in the past year than in any other recession dating to at least the 1970s, even the devastating downturn of the early 1980s. 
 Moreover, white-collar workers also tend to form a disproportionate share of the long-term unemployed -- those who have been out of work six months or longer. 
 In the Chicago group, which has been meeting since April 2008, seven of nine members have been out of steady work for six months or longer; the other two are approaching the six-month mark. 
 Several in the group are now considering part-time ''survival jobs.'' Many are wrestling with whether, or how much, to draw down on their retirement accounts. Holding onto health insurance, with its high cost without an employer, has been a constant worry.
 Mr. Roeder, who has two young children, took a part-time job this winter plowing snow for his township to pay the bills. He was initially depressed at what he considered the indignity, but then he discovered that several others in his crew were unemployed professionals just like him.
 He jumped actively into his job search last February but said he had gotten fewer than 10 interviews in two years, despite averaging nearly 40 hours a week looking for work.
 ''I'm not getting any face time, and that is extremely frustrating,'' Mr. Roeder said.
 With his family's savings rapidly dwindling, he drove seven hours to Troy, Mich., last weekend in a snowstorm for a job fair organized by BAE Systems, a military contractor, standing in line for two-and-a-half hours to get an interview. 
 ''You can never turn down a job possibility in this economy,'' he said.
 Gregarious by nature, Mr. Roeder enjoys leading the group through its paces, enabling him to function, albeit briefly, in a corporate environment again. And he said he took special pleasure in compiling the members' weekly reports, which are due to him every Sunday. 
 ''I feel like I'm working again,'' he said. 
 Jim Moorman, who arranged for the group to meet at his church, lost his job 16 months ago as a senior engineer at Motorola, where he was making more than $100,000 a year, after working there for 33 years. 
 After months of scrambling, Mr. Moorman missed his first mortgage payment last month.
 ''I have some alternatives,'' said Mr. Moorman, who is also fretting about how to pay for a daughter going to college next year. ''But they're not ideal ones.''
 He said he had struggled to get interviews and wondered at the recent meeting whether he was spending too much time applying to jobs online. 
 ''I'm not doing something right yet,'' he said later.
 Nevertheless, the group's sessions are intentionally businesslike and upbeat. Griping and self-pity are discouraged. Meetings begin with members reporting two highlights from their job search -- even if they are hard to name -- as well as two activities they did besides looking for work.
 Mr. Roeder said he ''plowed snow for 15 hours on Saturday and slept afterwards.'' Tom Nolan, 54, who lost his job earning six figures as a chief financial officer of a midsize manufacturing company six months ago, reported seeing the movie ''Slumdog Millionaire'' with his wife. 
 But the urgency of their situations inevitably intrudes. Ms. Romero told others in the group that ''reality is checking in'' and that she needed cash, so she had applied for the part-time work. 
 The problem, she said, is that she was one of some 300 people applying for 15 jobs on the graveyard shift. So group members brainstormed ways she could gain some advantage. 
 The group meets on Mondays to provide structure for the week. Members' days are filled with a revolving door of networking meetings, applications and chasing down the all-important but elusive hiring ''decision-maker'' at their target companies. 
 The stress has taken its toll on not just the members but also their families. Ms. Romero's husband, Joseph, who is retired from his job as a public works supervisor, began seeing a psychiatrist for depression. 
 In an unheated workshop in the couple's basement, Mr. Romero has been lighting candles to the Virgin of Guadalupe, in front of a crucifix draped over one of his son's amplifiers. 
 ''I heard she does miracles to a lot of people,'' he said. ''I figure she can give us the miracle of Cathy finding a job.'' 
 For Jack Elliott, 58, who was laid off nine months ago from a six-figure job as director of franchise operations for Merlin 200,000 Mile Shops, a Chicago-area automotive maintenance chain, this is his third job search.
 ''Nowadays, you work someplace, you work there three years,'' Mr. Elliott said. ''Not only is this my third time, there will be a fourth time, more than likely.''
 Many in the group are dialing back their expectations, conceding they will most likely have to take a pay cut, or accept a step down in responsibilities. But Matt Zimmerman, 28, who was laid off five months ago as director of new business development for a home decor company and is the group's most aggressive networker, assured a new member at the meeting that this group was ''beating the odds.''
 Two former members of the group found jobs over the summer. And some have had success getting interviews. But it is not lost on members that no one in the group has landed a job since Lehman Brothers collapsed in September. Promising leads suddenly dried up. And their lives remain stuck.

HEADLINE: Deep in Debt, and Now Deep in Worry

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NOT long ago, a woman in California called me for advice. She is divorced, with two children, and has a series of interlocking financial problems.
 She lives in a lovely home in a stylish inland enclave. It has an interest-only mortgage of about $2.2 million that requires a payment of $12,000 a month, very roughly. It was last appraised at $2.7 million, but who knows if it's now worth anything remotely close to that price.
 The woman, whom I've known since she was a teenager, has no job or other remunerative employment. She has a former husband, an entrepreneur whose business has suffered recently. He pays her $20,000 a month, of which roughly half is alimony and half child support. The alimony is scheduled to stop this summer. 
 She has a wealthy beau who pays her credit card bills and other incidentals, but she is thinking of telling him she is through with him. She has no savings and has refinanced her home repeatedly, always adding to indebtedness and then putting the money into a shop she owns that has never come close to earning a dime. Now she is up all night worrying about money. ''Terrified,'' as she put it. She wanted me to tell her what to do.
 What could I say? I did the best I could, but I had to tell her that she was on very thin ice. 
 Ever since, I've been thinking of the troubles of this sweet woman, consumed with worry about money.
 These gloomy thoughts have been compounded by the holiday newsletters I have been getting from old pals and classmates. I have been getting them for about 45 years. This season, for the first time I can recall, the talk in the newsletters is not the usual tales of world-beating triumph by genius children, but of jobs lost, homes in jeopardy, children whose jobs have vanished and who are on the road looking for work.
 And all of this is compounded again because my handsome son, age 21, a student, has just married a lovely young woman, 20. You may have seen on television the pudgy, aging face of their sole means of support.
 I have been pondering what advice to give them about money. What I keep coming up with is this: Do not act like typical Americans. Do not fail to save. Do not get yourself in debt up to your eyeballs. Work and take pride and honor from your work. Learn a useful skill that Americans really need, like law or plumbing or medicine or nursing. Do not expect your old Ma and Pa to always be there to take care of you. I absolutely guarantee that we will not be. Learn to be self-sufficient through your own contributions, as the saying goes.
 This advice has served me well. It was propounded to me by my late father, who often said, ''Be prudent.''
 MY work as a freelance writer in Hollywood some time ago prepared me for extreme uncertainty. This is the most insecure existence imaginable. It mandates saving, ingenuity and nonstop work and creativity. Freelancers never have a day off. Never. They know that they can go months without a check. They absolutely have to save. They have to have five different levels of fall-back plans and financial escape hatches.
 I am well past that now. Decades past. (I hope.) But the habits of thought linger, at least a bit.
 I wish I could teach that work ethic to those close to me. I wish I could teach them that money is a scarce good, worth fighting for and protecting. But I very much fear that my son, more up-to-date than I am in almost every way, is more of a modern-day American than I am. To hustle and scuffle for a deal is something he cannot even imagine. To not be able to eat at any restaurant he feels like eating at is just not on his wavelength. Of course, that's my fault. (I have learned that everything bad that happens anywhere is my fault.) And I hope to be able to leave him well enough provided for to ease his eventual transition into some form of self-sufficiency.
 But I keep thinking of my friend in California, and what a perfect specimen of what we have become that she has become. I keep lecturing my son, as Pop lectured me, to learn prudence. I keep lecturing myself to learn it; I am far from a small player in the extravagance game. 
 Maybe, upon second thought, I did not learn well about prudence. Then I think that maybe it's too late for far too many of us. The age when money was a free good, available in unlimited quantities just for signing a note, may well be over. What the heck will we do when we have to start acting like mature adults? How will we cope with limits? With reality? 
 America, a nation of free-spending Peter Pans. Where are our moms and dads when we need them? It's their fault.

HEADLINE: What's Good for Beer Is Good for the Country

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Legally, at least, getting drunk was not an option at the onset of the Great Depression. Prohibition, in effect from 1920 through 1933, stopped hordes of unemployed Americans from lawfully getting sloshed. The forces of temperance needn't have bothered. As the world skids deeper into recession today, workers are resisting the temptation to drown their sorrows in booze. 
 SABMiller, the second-biggest brewer in the world, reported a surprise 1 percent drop in volume shipments in the last three months of 2008, compared with a year earlier. Its lager volumes in Europe fell 1 percent, led by a 22 percent drop in Russia. In the United States, volume sales of its MillerCoors joint venture with Canada's Molson dropped 2.3 percent.
 The Danish brewer Carlsberg announced it was cutting about 275 jobs in Europe. Diageo, which makes everything from Cuervo tequila to Guinness, put on hold an $840 million expansion of beer production in Ireland. The British Beer and Pub Association reported that pubs were struggling across the country as beer sales fell to their lowest in 70 years.
 Makers of other forms of tipple are getting worried too. Rob Sands, president and chief executive of Constellation Brands, the world's biggest wine company, warned this month that he was ''recalibrating our sales expectations'' to account for the weak macroeconomic environment. 
 I had expected booze to behave more like Big Macs or items sold at Wal-Mart, which do well in bad times because consumers trade down. Psychologists argue that people frequently turn to alcohol as self-medication to manage the stress caused by unemployment. 
 In fact, a 2006 survey of alcohol consumption among some 4,500 Scottish men found that the unemployed consumed about 40 percent more alcoholic beverages than the employed and were 75 percent more likely to be binge drinkers. In Russia, deaths by alcohol poisoning jumped by nearly 300 percent after the economy went into a tailspin in 1992. 
 Evidently, some other dynamic is muting our tendency for therapeutic inebriation. A study based on surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1987 through 1999 found that drinking in this country generally drops during economic hard times, especially among heavy drinkers.
 On balance, this is a good thing. It is probably best for us to face the economic downturn as soberly as possible. Still, the decline in our alcoholic intake is not necessarily all for the good. The study based on C.D.C. data suggested that alcohol sales were falling because workers' incomes were falling too. It's not about virtue but affordability.
 So here's another reason to hope the economic tailspin can be brought to a halt as soon as possible: more of us will be able to afford a drink.

HEADLINE: Renovation Road

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
FOR much of 2007 and 2008, Matthew Leaney was concerned about the ballooning cost of his apartment renovation.
 He could have been investing for retirement. Instead, he said, he was spending his money on kitchen appliances and bathroom tiles. And feeling like a spendthrift.
 But in the wake of last year's financial meltdown, he feels less conflicted. After all, he said, ''If I hadn't been spending the money here, I would have been putting it in the stock market.'' 
 Thanks to the market's decline, he said, ''the opportunity cost of my decision is a lot less. And I got everything I wanted.''
 Mr. Leaney, 32, sells financial information terminals to investment professionals. ''I don't earn enough to have this place,'' he said, surveying his duplex unit, with its custom-made steel stairway and huge windows opening onto a large roof terrace. ''It's kind of like a dream.''
 It's a dream he achieved through a combination of luck and savvy. 
 Mr. Leaney grew up in Sandford, a village in southwestern England with fewer than 100 people. (The houses there have names, he said, instead of numbers.) 
 After attending college in Nottingham, he went to work in London; in 2002, his employer, Thomson Reuters, offered him a job in New York. 
 Exploring the city, he decided that Harlem was ''the most obvious place to live.'' He liked the quick subway ride to his Times Square office, the beauty of the area's historic buildings, and the friendliness of the people he met. The small-town boy, he said, felt right at home.
 ''Harlem is a place I am proud to defend to people who have never been here but have plenty of opinions,'' Mr. Leaney said. His first Harlem apartment was in a new co-op building at 330 West 145th Street, called the Hamilton. He bought that place in 2003. 
 But the apartment wasn't as quiet as Mr. Leaney, who has trouble sleeping, had hoped. 
 So in 2007, he sold it for more than twice what he had paid. ''I made an absolute killing,'' he said.
 He set out to find a new home on a top floor, so there wouldn't be noise from above. He was also attracted to old buildings, and determined to find outdoor space to share with his Rottweiler, Bauer, named for the lead character on the television series ''24.'' (Mr. Leaney said the name sounds macho, which as a Brit he pronounces ''match-o.'') 
 When he saw his current place, it met every requirement on his list. Or, as he put it, ''it was gob-smackingly on point.''
 The space was atop a handsome limestone town house, on West 143rd Street between Amsterdam and St. Nicholas Avenues in the Hamilton Heights Historic District, that had been converted to three units. 
 The apartment Mr. Leaney liked encompassed the third floor and part of the fourth floor. All together, the place had about 1,200 square feet indoors, and another 600 square feet outdoors on the fourth-floor roof. Mr. Leaney paid $517,000. The maintenance was less than $200, although it was recently raised to $342, low even for a no-frills building. 
 When he first saw the space, it was chopped up into tiny rooms -- exactly the opposite of what Mr. Leaney had in mind. ''I wanted the eye to be able to travel the whole length of the space,'' he said.
 Word of mouth led him to Studio Sumo, a Long Island City architecture firm founded by Sunil Bald and Yolande Daniels. As redesigned by Sumo, the space is wide open and sleekly detailed, with reflective surfaces and gee-whiz electronics that suggest a 1960s bachelor pad. 
 The upstairs is reached by a steel stairway, which because of the narrow hallways had to be welded on-site. The shower is a glass cubicle that projects into the bedroom; the private areas can be closed off from the roof terrace with sliding panels.
 Mr. Leaney said he trusted the architects on almost everything, but stopped short of allowing them to paint the apartment's east wall. He said he liked its exposed brick as a counterpoint to the slickness of the rest of the apartment. 
 With its extensive built-ins, the apartment didn't need a lot of furniture. But Mr. Leaney invested in a giant pink sofa from Moroso (not the most sensible purchase, he said, when you have a 150-pound black dog that sheds) and a Pantalla ''lacquered crystal'' dining table from Moura Starr in SoHo. His desk, in a small office in the front of the apartment, is by Philippe Starck.
 He said the renovation went over budget, costing about as much as he paid for the apartment. But ''much of it,'' he said, ''was my own fault. The appliances didn't need to be Viking and Sub-Zero'' -- especially since his usual dinner is takeout.
 He also didn't need to furnish the apartment with expensive furniture, ''at least not straightaway,'' he said. By doing everything at once, he said, ''I put myself under a lot of financial pressure.''
 In December 2007, although the place was far from finished, he moved in. ''I was tired of paying for two places,'' he said.
 In June, the job was finally declared complete. But there is a still a punch list, which some days gets longer, not shorter. Recently, water damage in one corner of the living room led to an insurance claim. ''It's been drama after drama after drama,'' Mr. Leaney said.
 Many of the problems are with electronics -- Mr. Leaney wanted to avoid wall switches in favor of touch-screen controls, but the system doesn't always work as advertised. When it does, he said, ''it's just spectacular.'' He wakes to the sound of Howard Stern on the radio, the shades going up automatically, and the sun streaming in over the Upper Manhattan rooftops.
 Harlem, Mr. Leaney said, ''has provided an English guy with the American dream.''

 URBAN ANIMALS: The pink sofa and Bauer the dog may not be the best combination, but Studio Sumo's renovation pleased Matthew Leaney by replacing small rooms with loftlike spaces. The kitchen is top drawer and the sleek dining room seats a crowd, although Mr. Leaney says he rarely cooks. The lines of the upstairs bedroom follow the roofline of the building, an old town house.(PHOTOGRAPHS BY RICHARD PERRY/THE NEW YORK TIMES)(pg. RE4)

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Hollywood Seems a Conservative Investment

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 WHEN it comes to Hollywood financing, the sky doesn't fall so much as it just changes color.
 When the movie factory needed cash in the 1980s, it tapped individual investors through brokerage firms. That strategy ran its course, and in the 1990s German tax credits became the next sales pitch: Funnel money to our movies via a legislative loophole, Mr. Berlin Financier, and you can take immediate tax deductions.
 More recently, the likes of Goldman Sachs, along with giant hedge funds, poured billions of dollars into groups of movies called slates. The idea was that investing in a dozen or more movies at once, with the return calculated in aggregate after all had been released, was a sure-fire way to invest wisely. In many cases, though, it wasn't. 
 Now that the economic crisis has washed away much of that money, a new pickup line is starting to waft through the air in deal-making hot spots like the Sundance Film Festival. The new line is this: Wall Street, real estate, the art market -- all of those other supposedly stable investment areas -- are now such a mess that Hollywood is one of the safer places you can park money. Although the movie business has been hurt along with nearly every other industry, it's proving far more resilient to recession than most.
 ''I can legitimately say: 'Hey, wait a minute. My company is outperforming almost everything,''' said Jana Edelbaum, co-founder of an independent financing and production company called iDeal Partners Film Fund. ''I think that's a pretty strong selling point.''
 Ms. Edelbaum has been pressing a lot of palms lately in preparation for the premieres of two iDeal movies last week at the Sundance Film Festival. One of them, ''Motherhood,'' is a day-in-the-life comedy starring Uma Thurman, Minnie Driver and Anthony Edwards. The other, ''Arlen Faber,'' is a romantic comedy starring Jeff Daniels and Lauren Graham (of ''Gilmore Girls'' fame). Each cost less than $12 million to make and has multiple distribution offers.
 NOW three years old, iDeal operates out of New York, with financing to make about eight movies. It manages risk to investors through a variety of routes: preselling its films to foreign distributors, casting commercially tested actors, taking advantage of state tax incentives for filming. With that approach, Ms. Edelbaum at the outset was able to promise her investors a risk floor of 70 percent on the chance that none of iDeal's films succeeded.
 But as iDeal rounds the home stretch on its first batch of movies, Ms. Edelbaum is projecting at least a 15 percent return for her investors and -- if something big happens with ''Motherhood'' or ''Arlen Faber'' -- as much as 40 percent.
 ''Obviously, I want to make as much money as I possibly can,'' she said. ''But I am being dreadfully realistic and conservative given the current environment. It's the non-Madoff approach.''
 Ms. Edelbaum is far from the only independent producer promoting herself to investors with a calmer-waters pitch. The Exodus Film Group, a Venice Beach, Calif., production and financing company, focuses on animated films and has had a slow start, with its recent ''Igor'' selling a sluggish $19.5 million in tickets. 
 Coming Exodus entries like the animated ''Bunyan & Babe,'' featuring John Goodman as the voice of Paul Bunyan, are more promising. But John D. Eraklis, the company's founder and chief executive, says investors aren't waiting to find out.
 ''We have witnessed a surge of existing investors interested in upping their commitment as other opportunities have become less compelling,'' Mr. Eraklis said. ''I recently had an investor tell me that we no longer occupy the high-risk portion of his portfolio.'' 
 Anybody making the Hollywood-is-safer argument just six months ago would have been laughed out of town. Complex accounting methods, tremendous competition, soaring costs -- it wasn't exactly a safe part of the woods for even the most sophisticated investor.
 All of that terrain is still intact, of course, but compare it with imploding investment banks, plunging real estate prices, a whipsawing stock market, Warhols sitting unsold and Bernard L. Madoff. At least in the worst instance of Hollywood investing, you'll probably catch a glimpse of Angelina and eat some really good shrimp.
 ''Is investing in movies more attractive now because of what is happening elsewhere in the economy? Yes,'' said Daniel H. Black, a partner at Greenberg Traurig, the large entertainment law firm. ''Does that mean all the risk is gone? Absolutely not.'' 
 The big studios probably won't be able to rely much on this pitch. Their upfront needs are too big -- Universal's last round of private financing, which closed in September, totaled about $3 billion -- and Wall Street and the real estate market may sort themselves out before their current slate deals expire.
 The biggest players in the investment world have also soured on entertainment because they have been burned badly before, said Amir Malin, a partner at Qualia Capital, a media-focused investment firm.
 But for independent producers -- especially ones that operate in a transparent manner -- the strategy could offer a lifeline. They are in a particularly tough spot because they have almost no hope of tapping the debt markets, there is a dwindling number of buyers -- with outfits like New Line folding -- and costs are soaring. (Marketing an independent movie now costs more than $25 million, according to the Motion Picture Association of America).
 What do investors have to say? Daniel Crown, the former chief executive of Crown Theaters, his family's movie theater chain in the Northeast, said he recently put money into iDeal -- but not because he has cinema in his blood.
 ''If you can find the right film executives, people who consider themselves fiduciaries more than producers, it's one of the best bets you can make right now,'' Mr. Crown said.
 ''Just remember that it's over when you start taking yourself so seriously that the project stops becoming a commercial movie,'' he continued, ''and starts becoming an art project.''

HEADLINE: It's Time to Unravel a Financial Knot

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WITH a new administration in Washington, let us hope that there will be an interest in defining the origins of the financial crisis, its abettors and, most important, its resolution. 
 Any honest assessment must include the role that credit-default swaps have played in this mess: it's the elephant in the room, the $30 trillion market that people do not want to talk about. 
 Credit-default swaps are insurancelike contracts that Wall Street created in the early 1990s. They allow bondholders to protect themselves against losses if a company or a debt issuer defaults.
 There is a viable and legitimate use for C.D.S.'s, especially when they allow bondholders and corporations to limit their risks. But in recent years, these contracts became a haven for speculators who were doing nothing more than betting on whether a debt issuer would survive. 
 Buyers of C.D.S.'s pay premiums to companies issuing the contract. If a debt default occurs, the party providing the credit protection has to make the buyer whole on the amount of insurance bought. It is similar to payments that insurers pay to homeowners if their houses burn down.
 These arrangements, struck privately by parties on both sides of a C.D.S. contract, have been extremely profitable to the Wall Street banks and insurers that traded in them. 
 Sellers of C.D.S.'s spent years raking in premiums while underestimating or simply ignoring the possibility of rising defaults. Regulators let the market grow unchecked. 
 In the end, far too much of this insurance was written at way too cheap a cost. Now, with Wall Street and the economy in tatters, the fear that already-hobbled financial companies may have to pay off huge amounts on C.D.S. arrangements hangs like a cloud over the markets. 
 C.D.S.'s have already figured prominently in taxpayer bailouts. The $150 billion rescue of the American International Group, for example, came about because of swaps the insurer had written on mortgage securities. And the $100 billion taxpayer backstop handed to Bank of America on Jan. 16 had a good bit to do with soured credit-default swaps that the bank inherited when it acquired Merrill Lynch.
 ''Credit-default swaps written on companies that were presumed not to be in danger of collapse but that are now on the brink -- that is the overhang on the financial markets,'' said Sylvain R. Raynes, a mathematics professor at Baruch College in New York and an expert in structured finance at R & R Consulting. ''The financial system is frozen largely because of credit-default swaps.''
 C.D.S.'s have introduced other economic burdens as well. Christopher Whalen, managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics, argues that speculators who use credit protection to bet against financial institutions add instability to the system and cause the cost of taxpayer bailouts of the banks to escalate. 
 Normally, if a company goes bankrupt, a trustee steps in and helps it get back on its feet. The process can be brutal for creditors, suppliers and employees. But the ill effects of a bankruptcy are magnified if billions of dollars in insurance must also be paid out by companies that wrote protection on a beleaguered company's debt. 
 While the amount of credit insurance outstanding is around $30 trillion, Robert Arvanitis, chief executive of Risk Finance Advisors in Westport, Conn., says he believes fully half that amount isn't problematic because it consists of winning and losing stakes that offset each other.
 But that still leaves $15 trillion worth of contracts that may be in need of triage. 
 What if a company that wrote insurance can't produce the required payout when a default occurs? The buyer should take the hit, Mr. Arvanitis said. 
 ''If you live in a house and you don't buy reputable insurance and a fire burns it down, it's your fault,'' he said. 
 Yet as the huge A.I.G. rescue indicates, there's a risk that errant C.D.S. bets could end up being the taxpayers' problem anyway. 
 Obviously, something must be done to eliminate the possibility that taxpayers will wind up paying off entities that essentially bet against the American economy. And both Mr. Whalen and Mr. Raynes have ideas about how to do that. 
 First, a transparent and regulated exchange must be formed where swaps can trade and regulators overseeing the transactions can set margin requirements. Too many of the problems in the derivatives market stemmed from the fact that all the transactions occurred in a black box, which regulators chose not to open.
 Also, little money was required up front, as a good-faith measure of an insurer's ability to pay.
 Mr. Whalen suggests that insurers be required to put up 50 percent of their net exposure on a contract. By doing so, they eliminate doubts about financing of credit-default swaps, he said. 
 He also recommends that regulators bar underwriters of credit protection from selling new insurance on financial institutions participating in the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
 ''It is absurd for the government to allow private speculators to profit by trading against public-guaranteed liabilities of banks,'' Mr. Whalen said. 
 Mr. Raynes's resolution is more radical: unwinding all outstanding credit-default swaps through a process he calls inversion. 
 Under this plan, insurance premiums would be refunded to buyers of credit protection from the entity that wrote the initial contract. And the seller would no longer be under any obligation to pay if a default occurred. 
 The premium repayments would be made over the same period and at the same rate that they were paid out. If a contract was struck three years ago and charged quarterly premiums, the premiums would then be refunded quarterly over the next three years.
 Mr. Raynes's proposal would treat hedgers -- buyers who bought C.D.S.'s to protect themselves because they actually hold the underlying debt -- differently from speculators who bought C.D.S.'s simply to bet against a troubled company.
 Those guys, the gamblers, would receive only the premiums they paid to an insurer. Hedgers would have their premiums refunded, in addition to the difference between the underlying debt's face value and an independent assessment of its intrinsic value. 
 For mortgage-related securities, this value would be ascertained by third-party analyses using loan servicing data on delinquencies, defaults and performing mortgages. 
 ''If you stop the clock and reverse it, then the entire system will be able to breathe again,'' Mr. Raynes said. ''And over time, at the same speed that you got into the mess, you get out of it.''
 Mr. Raynes's proposal is online at creditspectrum.com, and Mr. Whalen's plan is at institutionalriskanalytics.com (the ''Institutional Risk Analyst'' link on the left leads to a post on the right that begins ''To Stabilize Global Banks'').
 Credit-default swaps clearly played a role in this debacle, and it is crucial that they are part of the solution. It won't be easy: Wall Street and other beneficiaries of the current setup will scream. But since they are among those who helped bring our economy to its knees, let's try ignoring their objections.

HEADLINE: Six Blunders En Route to a Crisis

BYLINE: By ALAN S. BLINDER. 
Alan S. Blinder is a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He has advised many Democratic politicians.

 BODY:
WHAT'S a nice economy like ours doing in a place like this? As the country descends into what is likely to be its worst postwar recession, Americans are distressed, bewildered and asking serious questions: Didn't we learn how to avoid such catastrophes decades ago? Has American-style capitalism failed us so badly that it needs a radical overhaul?
 The answers, I believe, are yes and no. Our capitalist system did not condemn us to this fate. Instead, it was largely a series of avoidable -- yes, avoidable -- human errors. Recognizing and understanding these errors will help us fix the system so that it doesn't malfunction so badly again. And we can do so without ending capitalism as we know it. 
 My list of errors has six whoppers, in chronologically order. I omit mistakes that became clear only in hindsight, limiting myself to those where prominent voices advocated a different course at the time. Had these six choices been different, I believe the inevitable bursting of the housing bubble would have caused far less harm.
 WILD DERIVATIVES In 1998, when Brooksley E. Born, then chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, sought to extend its regulatory reach into the derivatives world, top officials of the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission squelched the idea. While her specific plan may not have been ideal, does anyone doubt that the financial turmoil would have been less severe if derivatives trading had acquired a zookeeper a decade ago?
 SKY-HIGH LEVERAGE The second error came in 2004, when the S.E.C. let securities firms raise their leverage sharply. Before then, leverage of 12 to 1 was typical; afterward, it shot up to more like 33 to 1. What were the S.E.C. and the heads of the firms thinking? Remember, under 33-to-1 leverage, a mere 3 percent decline in asset values wipes out a company. Had leverage stayed at 12 to 1, these firms wouldn't have grown as big or been as fragile.
 A SUBPRIME SURGE The next error came in stages, from 2004 to 2007, as subprime lending grew from a small corner of the mortgage market into a large, dangerous one. Lending standards fell disgracefully, and dubious transactions became common. 
 Why wasn't this insanity stopped? There are two answers, and each holds a lesson. One is that bank regulators were asleep at the switch. Entranced by laissez faire-y tales, they ignored warnings from those like Edward M. Gramlich, then a Fed governor, who saw the problem brewing years before the fall. 
 The other answer is that many of the worst subprime mortgages originated outside the banking system, beyond the reach of any federal regulator. That regulatory hole needs to be plugged.
 FIDDLING ON FORECLOSURES The government's continuing failure to do anything large and serious to limit foreclosures is tragic. The broad contours of the foreclosure tsunami were clear more than a year ago -- and people like Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, were sounding alarms. 
 Yet the Treasury and Congress fiddled while homes burned. Why? Free-market ideology, denial and an unwillingness to commit taxpayer funds all played roles. Sadly, the problem should now be much smaller than it is.
 LETTING LEHMAN GO The next whopper came in September, when Lehman Brothers, unlike Bear Stearns before it, was allowed to fail. Perhaps it was a case of misjudgment by officials who deemed Lehman neither too big nor too entangled -- with other financial institutions -- to fail. Or perhaps they wanted to make an offering to the moral-hazard gods. Regardless, everything fell apart after Lehman. 
 People in the market often say they can make money under any set of rules, as long as they know what they are. Coming just six months after Bear's rescue, the Lehman decision tossed the presumed rule book out the window. If Bear was too big to fail, how could Lehman, at twice its size, not be? If Bear was too entangled to fail, why was Lehman not? 
 After Lehman went over the cliff, no financial institution seemed safe. So lending froze, and the economy sank like a stone. It was a colossal error, and many people said so at the time.
 TARP'S DETOUR The final major error is mismanagement of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the $700 billion bailout fund. As I wrote here last month, decisions of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, about using the TARP's first $350 billion were an inconsistent mess. Instead of pursuing the TARP's intended purposes, he used most of the funds to inject capital into banks -- which he did poorly.
 To illustrate what might have been, consider Fed programs to buy commercial paper and mortgage-backed securities. These facilities do roughly what TARP was supposed to do: buy troubled assets. And they have breathed some life into those moribund markets. The lesson for the new Treasury secretary is clear: use TARP money to buy troubled assets and to mitigate foreclosures.
 Six fateful decisions -- all made the wrong way. Imagine what the world would be like now if the housing bubble burst but those six things were different: if derivatives were traded on organized exchanges, if leverage were far lower, if subprime lending were smaller and done responsibly, if strong actions to limit foreclosures were taken right away, if Lehman were not allowed to fail, and if the TARP funds were used as directed.
 All of this was possible. And if history had gone that way, I believe that the financial world and the economy would look far less grim than they do today.
 For this litany of errors, many people in authority owe millions of Americans an apology. Richard A. Clarke, former national security adviser, set a good example when he told the commission investigating the 9/11 attacks that he wanted victims' families ''to know why we failed and what I think we need to do to ensure that nothing like that ever happens again.'' I'm waiting for similar words from our financial leaders, both public and private.

HEADLINE: 50 Years Later, Remembering a Lost All-Star Game

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and STU HACKEL

 BODY:
The N.H.L. All-Star Game on Sunday in Montreal commemorates the founding of the Canadiens a century ago, but another gathering of the league's best players a half-century ago is all but forgotten.
 It is, in essence, the N.H.L.'s lost All-Star Game. 
 But Bill Dobbyn, then a 23-year-old minor league player forced by injury to retire and for whose benefit the game was played, recalls it vividly.
 ''It was thrill to meet all those players,'' Dobbyn, now 73, said by telephone from his home in Waterloo, Iowa. ''I remember them all shaking hands with me, telling me I had a bright future.''
 Before the All-Star Game became a regular feature on the N.H.L. calendar in 1947-48, the league's top players got together for three games often noted in the league's official history: the Ace Bailey benefit in Toronto in 1934, the Howie Morenz memorial game in Montreal in 1937 and the Babe Siebert memorial in Montreal in 1939.
 The Siebert game marked the end of benefit All-Star matches -- until 1959. 
 Dobbyn, a highly regarded Rangers prospect playing defense for the Buffalo Bisons, lost an eye after he was accidentally clipped by a stick during an American Hockey League game. Jack Adams, the Detroit general manager, heard about the incident and resolved to bring his Red Wings to Buffalo for a benefit game. The N.H.L.'s five other clubs picked up on the idea, and a date was chosen.
 On Feb. 17, 1959, a capacity crowd of 9,368 filled Buffalo's Memorial Auditorium to see the N.H.L. All-Stars play the Bisons on Bill Dobbyn Night. Nine future Hall of Famers were in the big-leaguers' lineup: Bobby Hull, Ted Lindsay, Pierre Pilote, Glenn Hall, Johnny Bower, Andy Bathgate, Johnny Bucyk, Bill Gadsby and Bert Olmstead.
 ''Gordie Howe and some others from the Red Wings and Canadiens weren't there because they had a regular league game that night,'' Dobbyn said. ''But Detroit and Montreal sent some players anyway.''
 The All-Stars had Rudy Pilous, the coach of the Chicago Blackhawks, and Phil Watson, the coach of the Rangers, behind the bench. They won easily, 6-2. Lindsay scored twice and Olsmtead added a goal and two assists. Bill Dineen had the Bisons' goals.
 With services donated by everyone involved, right down to the ticket-takers and ushers, the game raised $25,000 for Dobbyn, a lot of money in those days.
 ''It was great,'' Dobbyn said. ''They gave me gifts -- golf clubs, a Polaroid camera I still have -- and they flew my parents in from my hometown, Melita, Manitoba. The players from the N.H.L. were all so encouraging.''
 And indeed, the loss of his eye and the benefit game were hardly the end of Dobbyn's hockey career. Fitted with a half-visor fastened by straps over his head -- he did not wear a helmet -- Dobbyn spent the next four seasons playing in Europe.
 ''I won either regular-season or playoff championships in five countries in five straight years,'' Dobbyn said. ''Vancouver in the Western League, Buffalo in the A.H.L., Streatham in England, Langnau in Switzerland and Vienna in Austria. Not even Wayne Gretzky can make that claim.''
 He returned to North America to play for the Waterloo Black Hawks of the semipro United States Hockey League, which unlike the N.H.L. and A.H.L. had no prohibition against one-eyed players, and was part of four championship teams. Dobbyn married there and spent 31 years working for a utility company. Today, he works for the Waterloo team as a minor official.
 ''My goal was to make the N.H.L., and I got pretty darn close,'' Dobbyn said. ''Still, I had a good career and I got to see the world. Hockey's been pretty good to me.''
 But never better than 50 years ago, when the N.H.L. All-Stars helped him out with a game that the league has forgotten, but that Dobbyn remembers as if it were yesterday.
 Fighting to Be Discussed
 Reverberations continue from the death this month of a senior-league player, Donald Sanderson, after his helmet came off during a December fight and his head struck the ice. Colin Campbell, the N.H.L.'s vice president for hockey operations, said last week that he would put the question of fighting's place in the league on the agenda at the next general managers' meeting in early March. 
 At least two general managers -- Montreal's Bob Gainey and Detroit's Ken Holland -- have publicly stated their support for revisiting the league's level of permissiveness toward fighting. But in a survey by the Canadian sports television network TSN, 16 of the 18 N.H.L. general managers who responded opposed stiffer fighting penalties.
 Players Retain Contract
 The N.H.L. Players' Association's 30 team representatives voted unanimously on Thursday against terminating the collective bargaining agreement that ended an 18-month lockout in July 2005. The vote assures that the agreement, which includes a salary-cap system the players had once opposed, will stay in place until September 2011. 
 Salaries were initially capped at $39 million a team, but leaguewide revenue growth has brought the cap up to nearly $57 million this season, with a floor of $40 million. With the poor economy threatening future revenue, commentators speculated that the players did not want to reopen the C.B.A. for fear that owners would demand further limits on salaries or an end to guaranteed contracts.

HEADLINE: A Hard Road Behind, a New Road Ahead

BYLINE: By BLAIRE BRIODY

 BODY:
ON a chilly Wednesday last fall at 5:10 a.m. at a homeless shelter in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Robert Fecu had to decide between black shoes or brown. He weighed a pair in each hand, moving his arms up and down as if he hoped that gravity would make the decision: Black? Brown? Black? Brown? Finally, he went with brown, to complement his blue-checkered shirt, dark slacks and red-dotted tie. 
 He had woken at 4 a.m., showered and eaten three granola bars before stepping out onto the empty streets. His interview at United Parcel Service, in Maspeth, Queens, was at 6 a.m. 
 It would not be his only trip to the U.P.S. office in his quest for a job. 
 Mr. Fecu, 23, who was born and raised in Flatbush, Brooklyn, had spent the past three and a half years in prison for robbery. He was released in September, and needed to find work.
 In many respects, he fits the profile of a young ex-offender; he comes from a troubled family and his older sister is in prison. But he has his G.E.D., he has applied to college, and he hopes to be a journalist someday. Today, though, he just wants a job. 
 It has never been easy for ex-offenders to find work, with many applicants weeded out after they reveal their conviction. During interviews, Mr. Fecu said: ''I don't even want to say the word 'robbery' because people get scared.''
 The economic downturn makes matters worse, especially in New York, where the financial sector is so troubled. ''There are fewer jobs and more competition,'' said James Brown, an analyst for the state Department of Labor. ''That would tend to work against someone who has any blemishes on their resume.''
 Angela Tolosa, the project director at Midtown Community Court, which helps about 300 ex-offenders a year with job training, said it now takes 30 percent longer for ex-offenders to find a job. 
 In a taxi, Mr. Fecu headed through the deserted streets toward Queens, past warehouses and barbed-wire fences. It was 5:45 a.m. when the taxi turned the corner and the U.P.S. warehouse came into view. ''Ten dollars,'' the driver said. Mr. Fecu handed over a bill. ''Sorry, I have no tip,'' he said. ''I'm trying to get a job.''
 Outside the U.P.S. office, which is just a trailer, five other job seekers were standing in line. All were wearing interview attire, and each sought the same work as Mr. Fecu: loading and unloading, starting pay $8.50 an hour. As a woman in a black U.P.S. jacket called out their names, one by one, they disappeared into the trailer.
 TWO hours later, the sun had risen and drivers wearing the company's signature brown uniforms had headed out from the parking lot in their trucks. Mr. Fecu emerged and blinked in the sunlight. As it turned out, that day's 6 a.m. appointment had been only for a group orientation. He had been asked to return the following morning at 4:30 for an individual interview. 
 After a restless sleep, Mr. Fecu arrived at the U.P.S. office at 3:30 a.m., an hour early. As Mr. Fecu recalls it, he tripped over his words on the first question posed by the young interviewer. ''I'm very nervous right now, so sorry if I'm stuttering,'' he said. Then came the question Mr. Fecu has been dreading: ''Have you ever been convicted of a crime?'' 
 As Mr. Fecu remembers, he took a deep breath and delivered the answer he had been practicing for months: ''When I was 19, I was convicted of a robbery, but don't worry about it because it was a different time in my life, and I'm working to make changes and doing positive things with my life.'' 
 The key, he said later, was not to go into details. Be brief, honest and show remorse. 
 The interviewer nodded. ''I've gone through some tough times in my life as well,'' Mr. Fecu recalled him saying. Mr. Fecu sensed that something in the room had changed, although whether or not this was true is unclear. After a few more questions, Mr. Fecu stood, thanked the man and left. 
 Mr. Fecu did not hear back for five days. On Tuesday, he walked into an Army recruiting office, ready to join. ''I feel pressure to do something, to bring in some income,'' he explained. ''This is my last resort.'' But the Army will not take him until he is off parole in five years, which would be in 2013. He telephoned his interviewer at U.P.S. again. ''I don't remember you,'' the man said. ''Come back tomorrow at 4:30 a.m.'' 
 So for a third time Mr. Fecu made the early-morning trek to U.P.S. He had already spent $50 on cab fare. The man in front of him was asked to return the next day for training. But Mr. Fecu was told something different: ''We'll call you,'' the man said. Mr. Fecu suspected this was not a good sign. 
 U.P.S. declined to comment about Mr. Fecu, but the company has hired ex-offenders in the past. And although it is illegal to discriminate solely on the basis of a criminal conviction, companies can consider factors like a crime's severity in making a hiring decision. Discouraged but not deterred, Mr. Fecu continued to send out applications. 
 Earlier this month, Mr. Fecu's persistence was rewarded with a job paying $8.25 an hour, no benefits, with an inventory-counting company called WIS International. In his new position, Mr. Fecu travels to stores throughout the city, such as the Toys ''R'' Us in Times Square. One of his first purchases with his paycheck, he said, will be new, much-needed eyeglasses.

HEADLINE: Caribbean Resorts Ready to Deal

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
THE Caribbean is on sale. Beachfront rooms from $78 a night. All-inclusive vacations at 70 percent off. Five-night cruises for less than $250. These are just some of the deep discounts on offer as the islands attempt to attract penny-pinching travelers with cut rates and islandwide promotions amid the depressing economy. 
 Normally, as the region enters the height of tourist season, which runs from now through March, sun-deprived travelers flock to the islands for the region's idyllic weather and alluring beaches, prices soar to peak levels and resorts fill up well in advance. Of course, the economy has changed all that this year. 
 Three of the biggest online travel agencies --Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz -- are all offering numerous Caribbean packages from 30 to 50 percent off across a broad range of vacations, including cruises, through peak season. Wimco Villas has introduced its Value Villas program, normally offered only during the low seasons of summer and fall, with average nightly rates starting at less than $200 a room. And Liberty Travel, the travel agency chain based in Ramsey, N.J., just rolled out a late winter and early spring sale with discounts starting at 45 percent off at more than 100 Caribbean properties.
 ''There's been a reality check,'' said Mark Benson, vice president of Caribbean product for Liberty Travel, noting that even just a few months ago resorts were still reluctant to cut rates. Now, he said, hotels are simply focused on putting ''heads in beds'' and ''fighting for market share.'' 
 Entire islands are on sale. The United States Virgin Islands, where visitors dropped 39 percent to 104,969 for the month of October, has an Extended Winter Escape promotion for travel through March that includes $300 in American Express traveler's checks, $100 in vouchers toward island attractions and restaurants and a fifth night free at various hotels including the Frenchman's Reef & Morning Star Marriott on St. Thomas and the Westin on St. John. Book by Jan. 31 at usvigetaway.com/winterescape. 
 Similarly, hotels on St. Kitts and Nevis (www.stkittstourism.kn), including the Royal St. Kitts Hotel & Casino and Mount Nevis Hotel, are offering a fifth night free and $75 resort credits. Bermuda (www.bermudatourism.com/400th--anniversary.aspx) is offering up to $400 credit at various hotels booked by March 27, based on length of stay. And Grand Cayman (www.caymanislands.ky/promotions) is advertising daily resort credits ranging from $25 to $100 a day, depending on the property and length of stay. 
 Few destinations rely as heavily on tourism as the islands of the Caribbean. Perhaps that's why some of the latest bargains are so aggressive, if not desperate. Expedia, for example, has five-night western Caribbean cruises as low as $239 a person on Carnival -- that's about $50 a day. A recent search for cheap hotels in Jamaica found room rates as low as $78 in Negril on Travelocity. And Liberty Travel is offering all-inclusive four-night vacations to Aruba from New York with airfare for $699 a person -- a savings of 70 percent. 
 For families, Club Med in Guadeloupe and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic are offering a Kids Stay Free special for vacations beginning Feb. 14 or 50 percent off the second guest for seven-night trips at those resorts as well as properties in Martinique and Turks and Caicos. 
 Even well-known luxury hotels, that are normally so hard to get into at this time of year that they don't need to discount, are throwing in extras. The luxurious Malliouhana Hotel & Spa on Anguilla is offering a four-night getaway for $4,715 per couple that includes daily continental breakfast, two massages per guest, a four-course dinner for two, and snorkeling off the hotel's 40-foot motorboat. 
 The exclusive Parrot Cay, on a private island in Turks and Caicos, has been offering four nights for the price of three or seven nights for the price of five. Dinner is included if booked by Jan. 31. Rosewood Little Dix Bay on Virgin Gorda is offering five nights for the price of four when guests book the Escape a Little Longer package. Guests who fly nonstop to St. Thomas and use the hotel's air taxi also qualify for up to $500 in resort credit. And the deluxe Carl Gustaf Hotel on St. Barts is cutting winter rates on one- and two-bedroom suites by 30 percent.
 The hope is such deals will spur bookings by travelers who have largely been hesitant to commit to a vacation. ''There is a tremendously shorter booking window now,'' said Hugh Riley, interim secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, which has committed to raising $60 million for a marketing campaign to help promote the region. ''Consumers don't seem convinced yet that whatever price they're looking at is the lowest it's going to be,'' he said. ''They keep looking for a better deal.'' 
 Another challenge is confronting the islands: airlines reduced service to the region by 14.5 percent in December, according to OAG, which tracks airline flight schedules. That helped keep airfares high and made it difficult for some travelers to get to the Caribbean for the holidays. While some of that service has come back, airline seats from the United States to the Caribbean are still down by about 9 percent in March. 
 Despite the cuts, there are some decent airfare bargains out there right now. Travelocity has been advertising American Airlines' new nonstop service between Grenada and Miami with four-night vacations to the island from $585 a person. And Liberty Travel has negotiated special rates of 20 percent off with some airlines. 
 ''Last year, if I had suggested that, they'd have slammed the phone down on me,'' said Mr. Benson, the Liberty vice president. ''But this year, they're playing.''

HEADLINE: No Creature Comforts, Just Hard Times

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

DATELINE: Bridgeport, Conn. 

 BODY:
 PRAIRIE dogs scamper on one side. A wolf prowls on the other. But the fenced-in slope between them at the Beardsley Zoo here is occupied only by snow and rocks. 
 And that most likely won't change any time soon. The space was supposed to house Andes Adventure, a $6 million project with spider monkeys, jaguars and anteaters, but difficulty raising money has scuttled plans for at least a few months.
 And that is not the worst of it for the zoo, which for generations has been a mainstay attraction in Fairfield County. Facing its first budget deficit since becoming a nonprofit organization in 1997, Beardsley recently let go three employees, more than 10 percent of its 28-person staff. 
 To further plug holes, the zoo may also eliminate its $100,000 marketing budget. And corporate sponsors of an annual golf tournament and wine tasting -- events that have reliably padded the zoo's coffers in the past -- are so far absent for this year. 
 ''It's a very anxious time for us,'' said the zoo's director, Gregg Dancho.
 Like other cultural institutions that sustain themselves with government money, admission fees and private donations, regional zoos are being squeezed hard by the recession.
 While many have weathered economic downturns before, the current one is prompting unprecedented cost-cutting measures, zoo officials say. Anticipating a bleak year, many of the half-dozen major zoos in the suburbs around New York City are canceling orders for new species, postponing upkeep and charging for attractions that for years were complimentary. 
 Complicating zoos' attempts at frugality is that they cannot really reinvent their core assets -- those scaly, clawed and feathered creatures who need to be fed, examined and cleaned in often pricey and particular ways.
 ''We're not a museum, so you can't just close down a wing,'' said Jonathan Meigs, director of the Trevor Zoo on the campus of the Millbrook School in Dutchess County. ''Even if you wanted to send your animals somewhere else, you couldn't if that zoo also doesn't have money.''
 Because the school, which is financially sound, chips in 85 percent of the Trevor's $440,000 annual budget, the zoo should be relatively insulated from hardship, Mr. Meigs said. Indeed, he has not let go any of his six employees, who tend to 180 animals over three acres. 
 Still, the Trevor may soon lose a $23,000 annual state grant that helps finance coral-reef preservation research. New York's Zoos, Botanical Gardens and Aquariums Program, which is the grant's source, had its financing slashed to $4 million from $9 million under Gov. David A. Paterson's revised 2008 budget. And the governor's 2009 budget proposes doing away with the program altogether, said Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the State Division of Budget. 
 ''It's one of many very difficult choices that had to be made,'' he said.
 Wholly state-owned zoos, like the Trailside Museums and Zoo complex at Bear Mountain State Park, in Rockland County, may be in more precarious spots because they are mostly government-financed. The state covers 80 percent of Trailside's $350,000 budget, with revenue from tickets ($1 for adults and 50 cents for children) and the $6 parking fee adding only a smidgen. 
 Despite last summer's high gasoline prices, the 2008 attendance was about 88,000, which was on a par with the previous year, when 87,500 visited the zoo, said its director, Ed McGowan. In anticipation of financial problems, the zoo, which has nine employees, has scaled back one worker's hours and reassigned two others to next-door Harriman State Park, he said. 
 Yet the 81-year-old complex, which focuses on native Hudson Valley species, is moving ahead with a new $150,000 otter exhibit and will modernize a 7,000-square-foot bear den.
 ''We survived the Great Depression,'' Mr. McGowan said, ''so we can get through this.''
 Infrastructure improvements like Trailside's could receive a boost from the anticipated Congressional economic-stimulus package. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums, an advocacy group in Washington, is lobbying lawmakers to add zoos to the list of proposed federally backed construction projects, along with highways and schools.
 ''A job resulting from concrete poured for a bear exhibit is worth just as much as a job from concrete poured for a sidewalk,'' said Steve Feldman, an association spokesman.
 But Melinda Novak, a co-owner of the Long Island Game Farm Wildlife Park and Children's Zoo, in Manorville, said that zoos were up against deep-seated shifts in taste, as air-conditioned destinations like Chuck E. Cheese's, a chain of video-game-themed restaurants, vie for customers. 
 ''People are more sensitive to heat and the chance of rain than they used to be,'' said Ms. Novak, whose business dates to 1970.
 So this season, her 25-acre park, which as a for-profit venture receives no government money, will try to make ends meet by closing early on overcast summer days. Ms. Novak may also shutter a gift shop and charge for miniature-train and giant-teacup rides, which the $15.45 children's ticket price used to cover.
 ''And maybe use tacks and rubber bands for repairs,'' she said, joking.
 Not every zoo is so bearish about 2009.
 For example, Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J., which offers a 1,200-animal drive-through seasonal exhibit, expects attendance and revenues to surpass last year's totals, as people stay close to home to save on travel expenses, said Sandra Daniels, a spokeswoman.
 Still, the park's parent company, which does not release statistics for individual properties, has lowered general ticket prices this year to $49.99, from $59.99.
 And the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo, in West Orange, N.J., which swung to profitability in 2008 after almost being shut down in the 1990s, is similarly upbeat. Having a separate corporate sponsor for each exhibit -- the $125,000 for the wolves, for instance, came from Wachovia -- is one reason for its success, County Executive Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr. said. 
 The park also charges visitors for bird seed, pony rides and a carousel, which together last year took in $400,000, at a park that costs $1.7 million to run.
 In fact, Mr. DiVincenzo is so optimistic that he just raised ticket prices, to $9 for adults, from $8. 
 ''People won't mind paying it, because it's for their kids,'' he said, ''and they want to see something nice.''

HEADLINE: Renovation of Former Westbury Theater Going Forward

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
RENOVATION of the former Westbury Theater from a movie theater into a performing arts center may begin as early as this summer, and Westbury Village officials say they can't wait.
 ''The theater is the last piece of our downtown revitalization,'' Mayor Ernest J. Strada said. ''It will anchor the community in terms of our image and how we are defined.''
 He said that there are many excellent restaurants near the theater, which is on Post Avenue in the village of 15,000, and that an arts center ''would enhance the identity of the community as one that has fine dining establishments.'' 
 ''The theater would be the icing on the cake,'' Mr. Strada said.
 The project has been in the works for more than four years.
 The movie theater ceased operations in 2001. Lowe Properties, of New York City, bought it for $1.7 million in September 2004 at a bankruptcy auction but did not proceed with renovation because of a lack of adequate parking. Parking is being resolved, and the developers expect to open sometime in 2011.
 Cyrus Hakakian of Roslyn, one of four brothers who own Lowe Properties, said he was unfazed by the prospect of building a $7 million performing arts center in a recession when other performing arts centers on Long Island are struggling. He said the recession made construction costs cheaper -- about 30 percent less.
 ''There is never a good time better than the present,'' Mr. Hakakian said. ''There are always ups and downs in the economy, and if you want to wait for the right time, you will always wait. In order to catch the top of the wave, you have to get in at the bottom of the wave.''
 The two closest performing arts centers are the Jones Beach Theater and the Tilles Center at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University. Movie theaters that have been modified to host live music, stage plays and comedy are in Patchogue, Huntington, Islip and Riverhead -- only one within 25 miles of the Westbury Theater.
 The Capital One Theater at Westbury, which has a capacity of about 2,800, puts on dozens of concerts a year and is about two miles from the Westbury Theater. 
 But Mr. Hakakian said his property would seek different kinds of performances. The building would be renovated so it could accommodate a theater -- with dinner theater, comedy shows and touring companies performing Broadway shows -- and a movie theater showing second-run and older films.
 ''We plan to do mostly live shows in the larger theater,'' Mr. Hakakian said. ''What we are trying to do initially is find out what would work in this community.''
 Using plans developed by Hoffman Grayson Architects of Huntington, Mr. Hakakian said a retractable wall would divide the theater's current space -- one large, 45-foot-high room and balcony. The balcony would be converted into a 300-seat movie theater. The large room could then serve as a dinner theater for 450 or a movie theater seating 700. For major events, the retractable wall would be opened.
 Mr. Hakakian said he was looking forward to opening after 18 to 24 months of work. 
 One obstacle has been parking.
 The theater was built without any associated parking in 1927 -- five years before the village was incorporated -- and was allowed to operate without conforming to village parking requirements. The new owner, however, must comply with all village zoning and codes -- not an easy task in a developed area.
 Lowe Properties has approached the owners of three adjacent parcels in an attempt to buy their property and erect a two-story parking garage behind the theater. Mr. Strada said the village would take the properties through eminent domain if no private sale was arranged. 
 In the meantime, Lowe Properties is seeking a parking variance because there would still be insufficient parking for the theater. Mr. Strada said the village was considering selling Lowe Properties the rights to build a second parking deck over the municipal parking lot a block south of the theater if more parking is needed.
 Peter R. Mineo of Mineola, the lawyer for the project, said Lowe Properties was working with Nassau County officials to seek tax abatements. 
 An economic analysis of the property, commissioned by the developer, said the idea of renovating abandoned movie theaters in downtowns emerged in the 1970s. The study was conducted by Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association, a business group.
 ''This type of entertainment creates nighttime activities to keep people in the downtown area beyond the traditional workday hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,'' the study said.

HEADLINE: New Restaurants Adapt to Economy

BYLINE: By SUSAN ALAI

 BODY:
THE first quarter of any year is typically tough for restaurants, but 2009 is proving especially tricky for owners of fledgling New Jersey restaurants, those that opened their doors in the last year or so. In interviews with such restaurateurs, they described strategies that included cutting prices; switching to alternative low-priced menus; adding deals like fixed-price dinners; and offering half-priced bottles of wine or beer. 
 Josh Bernstein, chef-owner of 9 North in Wayne, which opened last February, is trying to drum up business after a December that he described as ''awful for everyone in the restaurant business.'' 
 In mid-December he began offering a fixed-price menu of $30 for three courses, ''because people want to know what they are going to spend when they go out.'' 
 Mr. Bernstein can see the penny-pinching by his customers right before his eyes: Where tips typically used to be 18 to 20 percent, he said, now they may dip as low as 12 percent. 
 The restaurant still is attracting the same customers, he said, but they might come in once every other week instead of weekly. Mr. Bernstein is trying to lure them with a new seasonal menu; its current focus is on comfort foods like chicken potpie and braised lamb shank. ''People can recognize what they're eating,'' he said. ''There's nothing too confusing or too uncommon on the menu.''
 Stone House at Stirling Ridge in Warren, which is just over a year old, introduced four-course fixed-price meals this month on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays for $32. Jeanne Cretella, president of Landmark Hospitality, which owns the handsome, beamed-ceiling restaurant, said its older sibling, Liberty House in Jersey City, has started a similar promotion. Now on tap are half-price bottles of wine, cocktail and wine tastings, and more pasta and comfort food. ''We want to give people options so they can stay within a certain price point,'' Ms. Cretella said. 
 The current economy has been ''a bit like a slap in the face,'' she said.
 The former South City Prime in Little Falls, which opened a year ago, has changed its name, much of its price structure and its menu. The new name, Fire and Oak, introduced on Wednesday, is meant to connote a homey, comfortable feel, according to Errick Paragioudakis, one of the owners. 
 ''We're reacting and adjusting to what the customer tells us they want -- and to the economy,'' Mr. Paragioudakis said. He has added a $12 bacon cheeseburger with fries or coleslaw to the dinner menu and introduced promotions like dollar oysters on Monday and half-price sushi on Tuesday. The top entree price is now $20, except for a small group of steaks for $22 to $29. 
 Michael DiIonno opened Avenue Bistro Pub in Verona last month in the former Mangia Questa, a high-end Italian eatery that he and a partner, Andrew Durborow, have converted into a comfortable spot featuring American tavern food. That includes macaroni and cheese and lobster potpie, things he calls ''economy proof.'' (The casual feel includes tables covered with checked cloths and butcher paper.) The restaurant has introduced a bar menu and children's menu as well as a selection of wines dubbed ''20 for $20'' -- 20 bottles priced for $20 or less. 
 Backyards Bistro, which opened in Hoboken in August with an extensive menu of affordable choices like burgers and quesadillas in addition to pastas and more substantial fare, is holding its own, according to its owner, David Herling, though he described the year as having ''good weeks and bad weeks.'' Regulars have cut back dining out to once or twice a week rather than three or four times, he said, and deliveries are down. 
 Greek Taverna opened in Montclair five months ago, ''right before the crash,'' said Peter Hajiyerou, the owner with his wife, Wei. (The couple also has the four-year-old Greek Taverna in Edgewater.) Since then, dinner checks have shrunk because more people are sharing entrees and appetizers. To take up some of the slack, the restaurant has started a free delivery service in the Montclair area, which has provided a 10 to 15 percent boost in business, he said. Mr. Hajiyerou has trimmed entree prices for fresh fish dinners; they now cost $28 instead of $32 for a whole grilled fish of about a pound and a half. 
 Another newish Greek restaurant, Stamna in Bloomfield, which opened in February, is usually full at night, according to Vagelitsa Nissirios (known as Angela), the owner with her husband, Alexios. Large portions and modest prices mean that customers can afford to come in more regularly, she said. Mr. Nissirios and several of his brothers also own the Nevada Diner in Bloomfield, where Mr. Nissirios said he was hearing complaints about the economy from his regulars and business was down 10 percent.
 Though the recession is particularly hard for new restaurants seeking to gain a foothold, some established places confronting challenging times have also tried a change of identity. One that made an about-face was the five-year-old Bistro En, a French fusion restaurant in Teaneck that changed its name in November to Bistro Americain and began offering dishes like Southern fried chicken and burgers to appeal to those who crave basic American fare and low prices. 
 However, since customers complained and longed for favorites like lamb and duck breast, John DeFilippis, the general manager, said the restaurant went back to its previous name and was planning to return to its French/Asian roots. The restaurant is redoing its menu for a second time; ''nothing is set in stone,'' Mr. DeFilippis said, but burgers and sliders will remain. 
 Many of these restaurants are
 retooling menus, trimming prices or
 making other changes to attract customers in a difficult economy. The range of
 entree prices shown is for dinner.

HEADLINE: In Tough Times, A Debt Collector Sees the Pain

BYLINE: By PAT MARSHALL. 
As told to Amy Zipkin. E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I COLLECT medical debt in amounts from $20 to $100,000, mostly for hospitals and clinics. We serve some of the bigger hospitals in the country, and we call all over the United States. I have about 3,500 accounts -- in other words, people who owe money. 
 We shoot for making about 3,100 calls a month each. I'm in a cubicle with a headset on, and I'm connected to an automatic dialer system. I make contact, but there isn't always a person on the other end of the line. A lot of time it's answering machines. A lot of times it's dead air. 
 I say: ''I'm calling from State Collection Service, debt collection, attempting to collect debt. Any information obtained may be used for that purpose and we do record the calls.'' After that I identify where the balance is from. That's called a ''mini-Miranda.'' You have to identify yourself as a debt collector and why you're calling.
 After describing what they owe, I say, ''I'm calling to see if you could possibly pay that off today with check or credit card.'' The key is listening. In response, people might say, ''Yes, I know I owe that'' or ''No, that's my insurance'' or ''I never was there.'' You find out what their objection is. 
 Sometimes when people hear I'm a debt collector, they hang up or blame the hospital or blame their ex-wife -- everybody but themselves. It's frustrating, but I am pretty good at getting through to them. Most people find that we're on the phone to help them. What we're trying to do is resolve a problem.
 The best time of day to reach debtors is usually in the evening, when they are home from work. I try to be professional, but the worst is when somebody swears at you using every slur in the book or demeans you by saying: ''You're just a $5-an-hour bill collector. Why are you bothering me?'' A majority of the people out there are good people. Some of them have just been put in tough situations. 
 Recently, I called a woman in Florida who had lost her job. Her husband had also been downsized. They were making about $200,000 a year. I asked her if there was any way to take out a second mortgage. She said, ''We're already upside down on the mortgage.'' They were facing foreclosure. She was in shock from what had happened and needed time to look at her financial situation. 
 In the last year, I have been seeing that there aren't as many people paying the total amount of the bill in full, and that people are cutting down the amount they pay me every month. Things have become tighter. 
 I feel that I'm helping people see that there are options for getting out of their situations -- maybe by taking out a second mortgage or going to a finance company or borrowing from friends or relatives or just making some small changes in their budgets to have some extra money to start paying their bills.
 Sometimes if people who owe money really need help, there are church organizations and programs through the United Way. Some hospitals offer assistance to people who qualify. It's a matter of suggesting things.
 I've been in the business about eight years. Even though debtors on the phone can be upset, I enjoy what I do. I like to point out to them that things aren't as bad as they think they are. It's a great feeling to know you've helped someone out so they can consolidate a debt or call the insurance company to get a bill paid off. There's a way out of their problem, to get the debt down to a manageable size.
 When someone calls back and thanks you for suggesting they get the debt resolved with me before it appears on a credit report, I think, ''Wow, I did do good for someone.'' It's a great feeling to help someone out of a dire situation. I've helped young people just out of school and took time out to explain how bad credit could hurt them in the long run. They call back and say: ''Thanks for the advice. You've saved me years of heartache.''
 On the floor, everyone supports one another. We have very a extensive training program. We're constantly updated on new federal and state laws. We're always working on technique. I'm on a team of six people, and we work one another's files. One thing I tell my co-workers is to listen.
 ANYONE who has been through a divorce has probably dealt with debt. When I got divorced, I left with a suitcase of clothes and my 1981 Monte Carlo and started over. I didn't have a lot of money and I struggled. I was past due on a credit card and got a call from a debt collector. I didn't like it. 
 That was over 20 years ago. My current wife and I have experienced job loss and tough times. I use credit cards. I run a balance, but I think twice about it. After you've done this job, you learn that all it takes is one job loss or pay cut for things to turn down. Once you've been there, you've got empathy for the other person.
 People write letters to my supervisors about many collectors in my office and say things like, ''Without Pat's help we never would have gotten this resolved.'' I would say that if somebody from a debt collection agency calls, give him a chance. We're trained to try to solve problems. We're trained to try to work through this.

HEADLINE: In Financial Stronghold, Darkened Offices

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

DATELINE: STAMFORD 

 BODY:
 THE ill winds that capsized Wall Street have cooled commercial real estate in lower Fairfield County, creating a glut of office space, reducing rents and challenging municipalities as they try to balance their budgets. 
 After 9/11, when many financial firms were fleeing New York City, business districts here and in Greenwich boomed, and as the stock market skyrocketed, so did space for financial services. During those heady days for suburban financial centers, rents were climbing 2 percent a month and the value of office buildings doubled in two years, said Jim Fagan, senior managing director of the Fairfield and Westchester County region for Cushman & Wakefield, a worldwide commercial brokerage firm.
 ''The market was extra hot,'' he said. 
 But demand peaked in mid-2007, and the chill set in late last year as some of the world's elite financial institutions collapsed. Stamford is feeling the effects more than some cities to the east because of its high concentration of financial service jobs, and by 2010, about 22 percent of Stamford's premier office space will be empty, Cushman & Wakefield predicts. Currently, 18 percent is vacant, up from 14 percent a year ago. Empty office space across the county is about 15 percent. 
 ''We're dealing with a marketplace tied to the financial and international markets, and we're going to have to ride through a tough storm,'' said Michael W. Freimuth, director of the Stamford's office of economic development. Experts anticipate that commercial real estate will continue falling this year, as unemployment rises, but start to rebound in 2010.
 Because of their alliance to New York's imperiled financial firms, many companies that were in full-blown expansion mode are over-correcting and shedding excess office space, Mr. Fagan said at a recent news conference. Although the decline here will be less severe than the plunge in New York, small businesses that rely on a vibrant work force are already feeling the loss of income.
 At Pappas Pizza on Main Street, Juan Romero, manager, said he will probably dismiss one of his two delivery people because orders from corporations and hotels have dropped off. ''UBS used to call in a big order every week,'' he said. These days, the call for 15 to 20 large pies comes every two weeks. 
 At Montana for Men, a salon on Bank Street charging $45 to $60 for men's haircuts, monthly clients now come every six or seven weeks; others have defected to their corner barbershops. ''Some have been laid off, and others are watching their spending,'' said Michael Warde, the owner.
 Sublease space is plentiful as UBS and other companies that occupy so-called Class A space, the premier offices with top amenities, look for less-expensive space to cut their costs, said Bruce W. Sheldon, senior vice president of Pyramid Real Estate Group here. The priciest locations, downtown near the train station, rent for more than $50 a square foot. 
 ''There are major companies trying to sublet 20,000 square feet,'' Mr. Sheldon said. ''That will take some time.'' Meanwhile, ''the tenant is still on the hook for the duration of the lease,'' he said.
 Because so much of the office space becoming available is sublease space, landlords as a group have not been hard hit, said Robert Caruso, senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis's Stamford office. The crunch for commercial buildings will come around 2015 when many commercial mortgage-backed securities are due to expire, he said. 
 In Greenwich, one of the financial world's hedge-fund capitals, office rents averaged $70 a square foot last year, the top price in the county. As the pendulum swings back, Greenwich rents will likely plunge 25 percent, Mr. Fagan said. Its empty office space nearly doubled the last quarter of 2008, jumping to 11 percent from 6.2 percent a year earlier, although it is still low by comparison with Stamford and Hartford, which is about 18 percent.
 As vacancies increase and rents fall, so do property values. Sale prices dropped from an average of $285 per square foot in 2007 to $146 a square foot. Owners of office buildings with low occupancy or loans coming due ''could be in trouble because lending has come to a halt,'' Mr. Fagan said. 
 A flat real estate market is bad news for cities that rely on related revenue sources, like conveyance taxes and permit fees, to supplement their operating budgets. For the current fiscal year ending June 30, Stamford budgeted $4.5 million for conveyance taxes and $11 million for permit fees. It's unlikely it will collect more than $4 million in conveyance taxes, and the forecast on permit fees was revised to $6 million, said Mr. Freimuth. ''A couple of major projects just aren't getting started,'' he said. 
 ''There's a multiplier effect,'' Mr. Freimuth said. ''Employment comes down as more space is vacant, so discretionary income drops. Restaurants and theaters feel it, and corporate giving to the arts and local organizations is down.'' 
 At City Hall, budget projections are being revised daily, Mr. Freimuth said. Declines in state income taxes and sales tax receipts could translate into less state aid, he said. 
 Like other municipalities struggling to balance their budgets, Stamford is torn between raising property taxes or cutting services. ''Everybody's in this hold pattern,'' Mr. Freimuth said. ''The consequence of the drop in economic activity creates real pressure on the property tax. Or you can mitigate that with service cuts.'' 
 All over the city, landlords are eager to strike deals. Office rents in the central business district were averaging $42 a square foot, and in this tenant's market, Mr. Freimuth believes the average will drop to $40 or the high $30s. In less expensive areas of the city, a Summer Street property that would have leased for $18.50 or $19 a square foot two years ago just rented for an average of $17 a square foot over five years, Mr. Sheldon said. 
 Some owners are negotiating short-term leases and allowing tenants to rent for longer periods at lower prices. ''Having someone stay two years is better than having them leave,'' Mr. Fagan said. 
 What officials and real estate agents fear is that Stamford will look like less of a bargain as Manhattan landlords lower rents, and that keeping occupancy up for the next two years will be trying, they said. 
 But when capital starts to flow, opportunities will arise, brokers said. ''There's nothing wrong with these assets,'' said Mr. Fagan, who is confident that Wall Street will come roaring back. 
 ''Wall Street is going to reinvent itself,'' he said. ''The needs that were there haven't changed.''

HEADLINE: Bad Times Spur A Flight to Jobs Viewed as Safe

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
After years of struggling to get their wages up, the nation's workers are trying to find jobs that will simply last, at least through the deep recession. 
 Fearing layoffs, investment bankers at a Merrill Lynch or a Morgan Stanley are joining small Wall Street firms for less pay but with signed employment guarantees. Academics are migrating to community colleges, which are adding teachers as enrollment rises. And in Eastern Wisconsin, workers furloughed from a paper mill they fear will not reopen are training as truck drivers and welders. 
 ''Looking online and in newspapers and talking to my instructors, I've decided that trucking and welding stand out as jobs that are available and will continue to be available, and a lot of my friends agree,'' said Dan Geneen, who has picked up a truck-driving certificate and is learning welding since he was let go by the paper mill last fall. 
 Trucker and welder are hardly glamorous careers to most Americans. But there is a new allure developing around jobs likely to keep a person employed, at reasonable pay, through a prolonged downturn. Government employment once offered that promise, certainly in the Great Depression. But government hiring is less than robust now, at 181,000 additions over the last year, mostly at the state and local level. That is far from offsetting the 2.5 million jobs lost in the 13 months of recession. 
 With his economic recovery package now before Congress, President Obama promises to generate thousands of steady jobs, some of them in government. Until those positions appear in abundance, however, the hunt for safe work is occurring mainly in the private sector -- and the hunting is not easy. 
 ''The companies doing the least hiring right now are very often the companies that offer the safest jobs,'' said Susan Houseman, a senior economist and labor expert at the Upjohn Institute, a research group in Michigan.
 With employers shedding half a million jobs a month, some economists, like Nancy Folbre of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, liken safe jobs to high ground amid the turbulent flood waters of lost employment. 
 ''There is a danger in using the term 'safe jobs' for this perch,'' Ms. Folbre said. ''That makes them sound like sinecures, and they are not.''
 Such is certainly the case on Wall Street. The flow to the smaller boutique firms often involves top people at big but shaky investment banks. Fearful they will be laid off, they move on before the ax falls, said Cheryl Solit, a partner at Solit Tessler & Company, a placement firm in Short Hills, N.J., that helps such executives make the switch to jobs with less initial compensation but more security, although in these hard times, not that much more. 
 ''The no-layoff clauses in the contracts they sign are usually for one or two years,'' she said, ''and usually in the form of guaranteed compensation. The new employer is not likely to lay you off when he has to pay you anyway.''
 Community colleges are turning out to be a similar mecca as enrollment rises because of the recession. Laid-off workers are flocking to the schools to retrain for other occupations, and young people are enrolling in greater numbers to avoid the higher tuitions of a four-year college, said James Jacobs, president of Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich. 
 At 41,000 students, Macomb's enrollment is up 10 percent from last year, Mr. Jacobs said. With the recession driving enrollment, he is adding to his staff of 220 full-time teachers and 750 adjuncts. Most of the new hires are adjuncts, though the courses they teach there and at another community college often add up to full-time work.
 Since enrollment is rising, they are assured of work semester after semester, Mr. Jacobs said. The annual pay is $40,000 or less -- usually less -- and no benefits. Still, they are coming back.
 ''If you spent six or seven years and hundreds of thousands of dollars getting a graduate degree and you end up doing this, that is not a happy thought,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''But it is steady work.''
 That is precisely what Mr. Geneen, the displaced paper mill worker, seeks from his course work at Fox Valley Technical College in Appleton, Wis., where he earned a truck driver's certificate in December and is now learning to be a welder. 
 He was laid off in September as an operator of a coating machine when the NewPage paper company in Kimberly, Wis., shut -- a victim of plunging demand. Mr. Geneen, 47, had worked at the mill since high school. He says he is not even trying to match the $60,000, with overtime, he earned at NewPage. 
 Steady work, even in a recession, is his current goal, which makes him reluctant to exercise his recall rights even if NewPage reopens. ''I don't want to have the same thing happen to me again five years from now, when I'm older,'' he said. 
 Taking advantage of a federal subsidy to train for what he considers a safer occupation, he completed a 10-week course to become a commercial truck driver. Even though truck shipments are off sharply and drivers' employment has fallen, Mr. Geneen sees a need for truck drivers, in good times and bad. So do 34 others who were laid off at NewPage and took the same course.
 ''Two of my classmates just this week applied at a trucking company advertising for tractor-trailer drivers,'' Mr. Geneen said. ''They were hired on the spot and told to report for work on Feb. 1. They didn't even meet with the personnel people.'' 
 Mr. Geneen says he plans to drive a truck, preferably within Wisconsin. But with his wife, Kathy, earning $40,000 a year as a certified public accountant and with enough severance from his mill job to help carry the family for a while, Mr. Geneen has enrolled in a yearlong course to qualify as a welder. It is another occupation chronically short of qualified people, even in a recession. At $40,000 a year or so, welders' work would not match his old pay but would provide a backup plan for the future.
 ''I want options that will hold up in a failing economy,'' he said.
 As the recession deepens, the only industry in the private sector adding jobs in significant numbers is health care, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it is doing so across the board, from physician to bed pan attendant. 
 Government used to be a refuge, particularly postal work and public school teaching. But the post office has been shrinking its payroll for several years. Public school employment -- mainly kindergarten through high school -- rose through August to nearly 8.1 million jobs, but it has fallen each month since as declining tax revenue forces cutbacks. 
 Those cutbacks rarely apply to math and science teachers, who are often in short supply. ''Teaching math in a high school in an affluent suburb,'' said Tom Geoghegan, a labor lawyer in Chicago and a Democratic candidate for Congress, ''that is my idea of the ultimate safe job.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 8, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 25 about workers searching for better job security misspelled the surname of a Wisconsin man who picked up a truck-driving certificate and was studying welding after being laid off at a paper mill. He is Dan Geenen -- not Geneen.

HEADLINE: And the Blog Goes On

BYLINE: By SAMANTHA STOREY

 BODY:
KNOWING what your neighbor paid for his apartment is a juicy morsel of gossip, and in New York, gossiping about real estate is an obsession. It is so captivating that an entire niche of blogs was created to cover it.
 In the past four years, sites like Curbed.com, Brownstoner.com, UrbanDigs.com, TrueGotham.com and The Matrix have been scrutinizing the housing boom with pithy observation and, in some cases, snide commentary. 
 For readers, it was fun to pillory the design flaws of new offerings and to read about how one broker had trashed another in an overheard conversation in an elevator.
 But with the recession in full swing and the housing market waning, what will these blogs write about now? It's not entertaining to skewer a market where property values are falling and scores of people are losing their homes to foreclosure. 
 The guiding lights behind these blogs say that they are evolving, becoming more serious and focusing on the nuts-and-bolts details of the market. True Gotham, for instance, is writing about how long transactions are taking. Others are becoming more general sites for neighborhood news. Curbed's tip line once passed on information from a reader who said that there was a truck in the neighborhood giving out free meat. 
 For some blogs, the real estate slowdown has led to a leveling off in readership. But all of the bloggers say they are confident their services are not only in demand, but will be increasingly valuable as the market gets trickier.
 The reader community that formed as a result of these blogs is a fundamental part of their success. ''These sites are fulfilling the needs of people to connect with each other and stay on top of the ever-changing market,'' said Sarah Rotman Epps, a media analyst for Forrester Research. ''Real estate is a topic ripe for discussion -- it is competitive, emotionally charged and fast changing.''
 Nevertheless, the blogs' founders worry about declines in page views and advertising, and like the owners of other forms of media, they are trying to find strategies to deal with the recession.
 Jonathan Butler, the founder and owner of Brownstoner, said he laid off his sole employee in December and had gone back to writing the entire site himself. Profits have not gone down, he said, but he fears that with the economic downturn, they might. ''It is somewhat pre-emptive,'' he said. ''But I'd rather be safe than sorry -- I have two kids.''
 Curbed, the most popular of the New York City real estate blogs, with two million page views a month, has not had an increase in page views since September. 
 ''Traffic on Curbed has been flat,'' said Lockhart Steele, the president of the Curbed.com media company, speaking from a coffee shop in the East Village. ''I think we are seeing a little of the '401(k) syndrome,' '' Mr. Steele said, referring to people who are ignoring recent financial statements because they know they will present bad news. ''There are probably people who are thinking, 'I am not going to look at that for a few months.'''
 Although not radically so, the blogs are also becoming more tasteful. Curbed has a feature called Price Chopper that before the downturn was illustrated with a bloody ax. Now that some sellers are taking a bath, the ax has been axed. 
 In the spring of 2004, when Mr. Steele started Curbed.com, many of his posts picked up information about new buildings and commercial real estate from other publications, with links to their articles at the bottom. But as the site grew in popularity, Mr. Steele started to receive news tips from his readers and posted those.
 ''The thing that happened is the readers took over,'' said Mr. Steele, 35. ''I think what makes the site vital is the fact that we cannot be everywhere, but readers are everywhere, and people love to participate.''
 Mr. Steele said reader involvement had not declined even with the faltering market. He continues to get tips from readers; these are followed up by two full-time editors.
 Mr. Butler, who used to work in marketing for a hedge fund, is also optimistic about the future of Brownstoner and other blogs. ''I think real estate is the topic in New York,'' said Mr. Butler, 39, speaking from an architecture firm in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn where he rents cubicle space. ''You have plenty of people who couldn't tell you what the S.&P. 500 is, but they can talk about real estate values.''
 Brownstoner, which gets 1.2 million page views a month, was started in 2004. Initially, Mr. Butler wrote about brownstone homes on the market in Brooklyn, and linked to resources about renovating them. This was mainly because he was renovating a brownstone that he had bought six months earlier. 
 The posts were so well received that he started a forum specifically to discuss renovation of historic homes.
 These days Brownstoner has around 15 to 20 posts a day, covering community news, market analysis and new developments. But Mr. Butler still links to listings for interesting Brooklyn properties, and sometimes follows the entire selling cycle, from when a home is listed, through price cuts and the contract, to when the deed is transferred, giving the reader a sort of real-time play by play.
 Despite a shaky housing market, advertisers say that Curbed and Brownstoner are vital ways to find buyers.
 ''You will see us moving toward more Web-based, cost-efficient advertising,'' said Stephen Kliegerman, the executive director of development marketing for Halstead Property, a Manhattan brokerage firm that advertises on Curbed and Brownstoner.
 ''Blogs, in particular, have buyers and sellers who are sharing their stories,'' he said. ''As more people come to their sites to read about the market, we feel like we will reach more potential buyers than ever before.''
 Halstead started placing banner advertisements on both sites about nine months ago. ''We have backed off on the number of print ads we are doing,'' Mr. Kliegerman said, adding that Halstead would continue advertising on blogs at the same level this year.
 Although some people go to the blogs only when they are hoping to buy, sell or rent, for others they become a habit. 
 Louis Rosenfeld, who lives in Park Slope, started visiting Brownstoner last summer when he was looking for an apartment. He closed on a co-op in the fall, but is still reading the site.
 ''I find it interesting to use as a lens for what's going on in the borough,'' said Mr. Rosenfeld, a book publisher.
 He said he liked the site's broad approach. ''I can find out what is happening with the Atlantic Yards and in neighborhoods like Ditmas Park and Flatbush.'' He also said it was difficult to find news about these smaller neighborhoods in mainstream media.
 Some see the chance to comment as a way to promote their neighborhoods. On Brownstoner, one commenter used the log-in name Crown Heights Proud. 
 ''I would talk about the good things about Crown Heights and Bed-Stuy,'' she said. ''I liked to talk about the positive aspects of living in the community, the years of middle-class black people who raised their families there and were not afraid to go out on the streets. There is a history.'' Crown Heights Proud, who did not give her real name because she wants to protect her privacy, now posts as Montrose Morris. 
 While Curbed and Brownstoner are run by real estate entrepreneurs who derive income from the blogs, several are put out by people who have day jobs in the real estate business. 
 They are less interested in gossip and more oriented to exposing the wizard behind the curtain. Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan research and appraisal company, said that the blog genre had given the industry a great deal of transparency.
 With so much property information available online, ''most people do an extensive amount of research before they even call an agent,'' he said. ''The blogosphere has brought an in-your-face approach to housing, and as a result, the agent's role has changed from information provider to adviser.''
 He writes a blog called The Matrix (matrix.millersamuel.com), which has the tag line ''Interpreting the Real Estate Economy.'' He said his goal was to filter ''a lot of the spin consumers are given.'' He may write about what a change in federal policy could mean to housing demand, for instance.
 ''I learn a tremendous amount by researching topics, which makes me a better appraiser,'' he said. ''This is purely a selfish endeavor because it's like doing homework you like to do.''
 He doesn't think interest in blogs will wane. ''I think the influence of real estate blogs will continue to grow in this downturn,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I think they will become more and more mainstream. If you are a passionate real estate follower, people are craving quality and relevance, and these blogs are very fun to read.''
 Mr. Miller's blog receives around 60,000 page views a month, which is double what it got a year ago, he said. ''I have no way of correlating it to the financial crisis,'' he said, ''but it might be because of a thirst for information.''
 Douglas Heddings, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, started his blog, TrueGotham.com, in 2006, to burnish the image of real estate agents.
 ''I really wanted to fight the used-car-salesman stigma that real estate brokers have,'' said Mr. Heddings, who has been a broker since 1992. ''I was so sick of going into a relationship with a potential customer and having them be defensive the moment they met me because of the bad reputation of agents.''
 He started to write about the day-to-day intricacies of brokers' jobs and the things they should be doing for the buyers and sellers they represent. Initial posts had titles like ''A Broker's View of Unscrupulous Real Estate Brokers'' and ''Things You Can Overhear in a Real Estate Office.''
 But being forthcoming backfired, he said. ''At the beginning I took a self-righteous tone,'' he said. ''Airing the dirty laundry of an industry that already struggles with its reputation is not the most effective way to change its perception.''
 Mr. Heddings said that his blog had replaced more conventional forms of marketing, like sending postcards, and that as a result, most of his clients had found him through reading it.
 One of them was Naomi Novik, a fantasy fiction writer. She got the idea to search real estate broker blogs from thesavilerowtailor.co.uk, a blog run by a British tailor. Since she had come to know the tailor through his blog, she thought she could get to know brokers through their blogs, too. That's how she found Mr. Heddings.
 ''New York City real estate has a terrible and well-deserved reputation for being a nightmare,'' she said, ''and Doug's blog was endlessly valuable because he seemed like someone who was articulate and trustworthy. I live a good portion of my life online, in a way, and have always found people and services that way.''
 Noah Rosenblatt, a vice president of Halstead Property, writes UrbanDigs, which started in 2005. From the outset he has tracked macroeconomic indicators like unemployment rates and stock-market strength to gauge the housing market.
 On the blog, ''people can learn about me and how I view the markets,'' said Mr. Rosenblatt, who worked as a trader before becoming a broker in 2004. ''I tell it like it is, real time, ahead of the curve, as opposed to lagging quarterly reports that get spun by brokers.''
 As a result, he said, he has attracted a readership that over time has come to know him and to trust his opinion of the market. ''It takes a lot of time to build something from nothing,'' he said. ''You can't just launch a blog and get 5,000 visitors a day.'' Now, all of his clients are people who have found him online.
 Propertygrunt.blogspot.com, named in part for Grunt, a soldier in the G.I. Joe comic book series, is run anonymously by someone in the real estate industry. In an exchange of e-mail messages, he said he had no plans to change the tune or the tone of his four-year-old blog, which gives his perspective of the real estate market as a whole.
 A recent entry, he said, ''was about how brokers kept using the word 'confidence' after the dismal fourth-quarter market reports.'' He lampooned brokers' use of the word, and wrote seven sizzling paragraphs in boldface capital letters to get his point across.
 But whether gung-ho or down at the mouth, New Yorkers, so far, seem to have an insatiable appetite for real estate news.
 ''It just is, and maybe it always has been, the great New York obsession,'' Mr. Steele said. ''Maybe it's because Manhattan is an island, and from Minute 1 there has always been a fixed amount of space.
 ''Jeez, I don't know,'' he said. ''Real estate just makes people crazy.''

 BODY:
When I was out with a group of friends, a guy made it clear that he wanted to take me out. I hinted that I was seeing someone. Then, at the end of the night, while we were waiting for cabs, he offered me his coat. I declined, but he persisted, so I wrapped his scarf around my neck.
 The next day, in an e-mail exchange, he asked for his scarf back. When I told him that I had lost it, he said that we should go out for drinks instead. I did not reply. A few days later, he asked for $15 to replace the scarf. Do I have to pay him, or is he just bitter? 
 Tiffany M., Washington, D.C.
 Of course he's bitter! He's as bitter as Tom Cruise at an awards show. 
 What's more, he's manipulative -- pressing his winter woolens on you so he'd have an excuse to call -- and he's not much of a gentleman, either, proposing that you ''work off'' your indebtedness over drinks, like some $15 hooker.
 Still, this is a property-loving country, and when you took his scarf -- even to shut him up -- you assumed responsibility for its safe return. I mean, if we were obliged to repay only pleasant people, the whole housing crisis might have been averted.
 So write the measly check. It closes the book on this guy, and you're well rid of him. Can you imagine the anniversary gifts you'd receive from a man who wears a $15 scarf?!
 Cubicle Fever
 I share a cubicle with a co-worker who has twice come into the office very ill. She was concerned about tight deadlines, but working from home is easy. Last week, after throwing up in the middle of the day, she refused to leave. I don't want to be a snitch and tell our manager, but I've gotten sick twice. How do I handle this?
 L. G., Manhattan
 Do the words ''flu shot'' mean nothing to you and Typhoid Mary?
 No one likes to be out of the office in this economy, looking like a shirker. But we're still not entitled to disregard the welfare of others. So tell your colleague that you admire her work ethic, but infecting you is an unfair byproduct of her dedication. She should stay home when she's sick and work there, if she must.
 If that doesn't do the trick, rat her out to your manager. However much our employers want us meeting deadlines, they generally don't want us infecting half the work force to do it. 
 If all else fails, get Isaac Mizrahi to design you a surgical mask -- in simple gray flannel -- with latex gloves to match. 
 Fifth Wheel
 When my husband and I socialize with a particular couple, they often invite their single friend ''Sam'' to join us. We have occasionally invited Sam to our home when the couple is over. Now, he expects to be included every time, but we don't want to develop our relationship with him further. How can we tactfully request that the couple not mention our next gathering to Sam so as not to hurt his feelings? 
 Anonymous, Hoboken
 I applaud your sensitivity, but it's generally not a good idea to tell people what they should, or shouldn't, say to their friends -- unless you're confiding an extramarital affair or gossiping about someone else's. Secrets only make things more complicated than they need to be.
 You have no obligation to invite Sam every time you see the couple. I wouldn't even mention him when you issue your next invitation. Or if there's already a ''Five Musketeers'' quality to your dynamic, let the couple know you're not including Sam this time, and leave it at that.
 If they want to tell him, it's their decision. But unless they're vindictive, I don't see why they would. Newsflash: No one gets invited to everything -- except possibly Malia Obama. 
 Bore Thy Neighbors
 I've been as optimistic as Candide for my whole misguided life. But now, at 75, I want to change. I have boring, narcissistic, dim-witted neighbors who tell me every detail of their lives and diseases, and I want out. What can I say to avoid time-wasting conversations without revealing the misanthrope I've become?
 Marly Harris, 
 Simi Valley, Calif.
 A high-pitched ''Do you smell something burning?!'' -- eyes darting left and right -- generally works. Or you could become extremely lax in your personal hygiene.
 But if you'd like to incorporate some payback in your getaway scheme, start sharing every excruciating detail of your own maladies -- both real and imagined. Never deviate from this subject. Your neighbors will still flock -- but in the opposite direction.

 BODY:
BEGINNING a decade ago, bank branches started popping out like spring wildflowers in a mountain meadow. The economy was on fire. Now, with a chill wind blowing through the finance industry, many branches will certainly disappear. By contrast, after the crash of 1929, bank construction continued along Madison Avenue with a quartet of elegant little bank structures, from 64th to 78th Streets.
 As of 1930, only one bank stood on that stretch, the 1925 United States Mortgage and Trust Company at 74th Street, opposite the present Whitney Museum. But by 1934 there were four. 
 In 1930, the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company retained Cross & Cross, known for its sophisticated touch, to design a limestone branch bank just off the avenue at 35 East 72nd Street. The architects modeled their project after the designs of Robert Adam, the 18th-century Scottish architect. With muscular corner quoins -- blocklike forms -- and a gable over a projecting front, it could have been a men's clubhouse. Indeed, Cross & Cross was also known for private clubs like the Links, on 62nd Street near Madison. 
 In 1931, Schultze & Weaver designed a scrumptious little four-story building at Madison and 73rd Street for the Fifth Avenue Bank, finished in 1932. This refined Georgian-style building has a steep mansard, marble trim and a delicate swan-neck pediment over the door. With its soft red brick, it could have been a women's club. 
 Cross & Cross was also called on by the Fulton Trust Company in 1930 for its first branch bank since it was established in 1890. Built at 1002 Madison Avenue, near 78th, the subdued neo-Georgian in red brick has a bust of Robert Fulton at the top. 
 The chef-d'oeuvre of bank architecture along this stretch was begun in 1932 at the southwest corner of Madison and 64th Street by the Bank of the Manhattan Company, established in 1799. 
 The architect Morrell Smith made it three stories high, with gable ends, multipaned windows and molded brick, emulating a late-18th-century city house. Inside, there is a high barrel-vaulted front hall, scenic wallpaper and an elliptical stairway in line with the front door. Although pure reproduction, the rooms are some of the most elegant banking interiors in New York.
 The critic Lewis Mumford, writing in The New Yorker in 1933, was scathing of such historicism, and called Mr. Smith's work ''an impeccable and quite defunct Georgian'' built to ''glorify the Daughters of the American Revolution.'' 
 He did like the ''English type'' tellers' counter, open instead of protected by the usual metal grillwork. He scoffed at the upstairs conference room ''in which neighborhood meetings might be held if anyone could think of a reason for holding them'' and ridiculed the bank's decision to hide the adding machines away in a corner. 
 But Mr. Smith's design was exactly what the bank wanted. The bank's vice president, Raymond E. Jones, took control of the project, and wanted it to represent ''the best taste in planning and furniture of 1799, when the bank was chartered,'' according to an unidentified newspaper clipping. Mr. Jones was interested in Americana, and organized fund-raising for the Museum of the City of New York for its Georgian-style building of 1932 on upper Fifth Avenue. 
 Despite Mr. Mumford's contempt, the upstairs conference room found fairly regular use, with events like a League of Women Voters conference on ''Civil Rights in Wartime'' on Dec. 17, 1941, 10 days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
 A walk down Madison from 78th to 64th Street will amply repay an inquiring depositor. Fulton Trust is long gone; the building near 78th is now an HSBC branch. An interior vestibule shelters an A.T.M. But the bank's interior is small and intimate, and the intrusive structure eats up the space.
 At 73rd, the old Fifth Avenue Bank was until recently a branch of the Bank of New York. In that incarnation it was a wonderful room: high, light and chastely detailed, with free-standing desks for the officers. But Chase took it over a few years ago, and divvied it up with high corporate-style cubicle dividers and the usual massive plexiglass teller barrier. 
 On 72nd Street, also a Chase branch, it is hard to tell what is original and what is not, but the main hall is a noble space, perhaps a story and a half high. It still has an old-fashioned nickel-finish inkwell for endorsing checks, although now ballpoint pens are provided.
 Mr. Jones's creation at 64th Street, now a J. P. Morgan Private Wealth Management Office, is in near-original condition, and crews are carefully repainting the wooden trim and windows, which have magically rippling glass of the old style. An A.T.M. is hidden behind a screen, which would have annoyed Mr. Mumford, although the tellers' counter is open, just as the critic liked it. But it is a leftover: here, customers just go to an officer's desk, an old-fashioned kind of banking in a modern age.

HEADLINE: Why Did the Broker Cross the Bridge?

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q. What does it take to get Manhattan's most productive brokers to a new condominium development in a prewar building in far-off Brooklyn at a time of falling real estate prices and faltering sales? 
A. A $140 Apple iPod Nano.
That's the carrot that Ilan Bracha of the Bracha Group at Prudential Douglas Elliman dangled when he invited 300 top-producing Manhattan brokers for private tours of BellTel Lofts, a collection of 250 condominiums in a graceful 27-story prewar office building in downtown Brooklyn that once served as a headquarters of the New York Telephone Company.
After seeing sales start to slump last fall as the economic recession deepened, Mr. Bracha and the developers, Clipper Equity, decided in December to offer brokers who made the trip a little souvenir. It was, to quote the press release, ''a BellTel Lofts-branded iPod Nano in a custom-made and branded leather-bound portfolio containing video footage, images and updates'' on the project.
Since December, Mr. Bracha's sales team has handed out 180 iPods to Manhattan brokers, he said. By coincidence or not, Mr. Bracha said that offers and contracts had picked up.
With interest rates falling, buyers are now making ''two to three offers a week,'' he said, with six contracts signed in the last month, a respectable pace in a real estate market where several developments have simply shut their showrooms.
Mr. Bracha says he believes that success in real estate comes from a high-quality product and relationships with brokers, not the marketing magic of the Apple brand. But he found that the iPod offer -- a reminder of the building's role in the history of communications -- was a way to ''start the conversation.''
''We realized that when people walk into the building, we end up selling,'' he said. ''They love the value, they love the finishes, they love the 150 different layouts. So we asked how can we get more people from the city to walk in.''
Since the autumn of 2007, 123 of the 250 apartments have been sold, mostly on the lower floors, and the developers have recently begun marketing the more expensive apartments with big views, Mr. Bracha said. Prices range from $502,000, for a 566-square-foot studio with a terrace, to $1.8 million for a three-bedroom with a 50-foot wraparound terrace, according to the project's Web site.
The building, designated as a landmark in 2004 for its intricately patterned orange brick and Art Deco design, is at 365 Bridge Street on the corner of Willoughby Street in downtown Brooklyn, about 30 minutes by subway from Times Square.
In addition to the iPod promotion, the developers have been working with buyers to get better financing, and, according to property records, have given small discounts off the asking price. They are offering brokers another incentive -- paying half the commission as soon as a contract is signed, rather than at the closing as is customary.
But what about local Brooklyn brokers? They too can have a Nano, if they bring in five groups of buyers to visit the project. So far, 20 Brooklyn brokers have new Nanos in their pockets, Mr. Bracha said.

HEADLINE: Law and Disorder

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
LIKE any worthwhile journey through New York, the television drama ''Life on Mars'' takes a roundabout route to arrive at a familiar destination. In its first episode, a New York police detective named Sam Tyler is hit by a car. When Tyler, played by the actor Jason O'Mara, recovers from the accident, he finds he has woken up in the year 1973. 
 He is still an N.Y.P.D. detective, but much else has changed. John Lindsay is the mayor, the Knicks are a team with championship potential, and, perhaps most remarkable, the revitalized metropolis he thought he knew has returned to its dingier, more dangerous ways. 
 Within the context of ''Life on Mars,'' which had its premiere on ABC in October and returns to the air on Wednesday night after being on hiatus for nearly two months, it's up to the viewer to decide whether Tyler has actually traveled back in time or if this ghost of Gotham past exists only in his injured mind. Yet there is no mistaking the presence of the real-life New York throughout the show, one in which, with the help of the occasional bit of digital trickery, the modern city is deftly used as a stand-in for its earlier, more desperate self. 
 In one memorable scene from the debut episode, shot in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a perplexed Tyler wanders through an unattended construction site where a housing project he knew in 2008 has not yet been built in 1973. There, he glimpses an impossible sight across the East River: the twin towers still intact and gleaming resplendently. 
 Is this sequence meant to remind audiences of New York's shabbier, not-too-distant past, the limitless potential it once possessed or the innocence it lost? The makers of ''Life on Mars,'' it seems, would prefer to remain agnostic about such questions. 
 ''The city in 1973, visually, did tell you its story quite clearly,'' said Stephen Hendrickson, who as the production designer is the person responsible for the show's overall look. ''But the city by itself doesn't tell you that story today. You create the reality by what you decide to show.''
 ''Life on Mars'' tells the stories of three cities: the New York of 1973 as it really was, that city as the show's creators wish to remember it and the New York of today, a place whose legacy is still very much up for grabs. In merging these three perspectives, the show raises several tantalizing questions: Why is such an unsafe and often unhappy period in the city's history still fetishized by the same people who struggled through it? 
 Perhaps more to the point, will people continue to do so when the city feels as if it could be slipping back into those dangerous, crime-ridden days? In other words, will these people still want to look back at this era -- fondly or otherwise -- as the New York of 2009 increasingly comes to resemble its '70s-era ancestor in all the wrong ways? 
 ''LIFE on Mars,'' which takes its name from the David Bowie song playing on Tyler's radio when he has his accident, first aired on British television in 2006. The original version of the show took place not in New York but in the gritty industrial city of Manchester, England. An American adaptation produced by David E. Kelley, the creator of ''Ally McBeal'' and ''Boston Legal,'' was to be set in Los Angeles.
 But when the television producers Andre Nemec, Josh Appelbaum and Scott Rosenberg were put in charge of the American remake, they moved the setting to New York. This decision was partly a reflection of their New York roots (Mr. Nemec, 36, and Mr. Appelbaum, 35, both attended Riverdale Country School in the late 1980s, and Mr. Nemec studied at New York University), and partly a tribute to the many seminal crime dramas produced or set in New York during the '70s. 
 ''That was the era of 'Dog Day Afternoon' and 'The French Connection' and 'Serpico,' '' Mr. Nemec said. ''It inspired a lot of amazing things, so New York it was.''
 This nostalgia would seem to be contradicted by the historical reality of New York in 1973 (the city's brush with bankruptcy, and the Daily News headline ''Ford to City: Drop Dead,'' were a couple of a years away); entire neighborhoods were blighted by graffiti, plagued by arson and eventually abandoned; and few lives were untouched by crime or economic desperation. 
 Yet as time goes by, even the most hardened New Yorkers sometimes find themselves looking back at this period through a wistful, sepia-toned haze.
 ''It's almost like when somebody passes away,'' said James Nuciforo, a retired N.Y.P.D. detective and 23-year veteran of the force who now is a technical consultant for ''Life on Mars.'' ''Maybe they weren't the nicest person in the world, but once they pass away, suddenly they're a hero. You remember the good times.''
 In style and tone, ''Life on Mars'' tends to regard 1973 New York with a mixture of reverence and yearning. Though its story lines acknowledge the racial tensions and financial hardships that were unavoidable in that age, they also emphasize that this was a time of emerging countercultures and a rough-and-tumble camaraderie among police officers that would seem unattainable in the disciplined and self-conscious 21st century. 
 In perhaps the ultimate tip of the hat to the texture of those years, the show's no-nonsense lieutenant is played by the archetypal tough guy Harvey Keitel, who in 1973 was enjoying his cinematic breakthrough as an aspiring New York thug in the Martin Scorsese film ''Mean Streets.''
 Yet while the creators of ''Life on Mars'' take their visual cues from movies like ''Mean Streets,'' they aspire to a different aesthetic. 
 ''You could feel the cracked asphalt underfoot when you watch a movie like that,'' Mr. Nemec said. ''We have a romanticized version of that in our show. We tend to tread with a certain amount of humor and quirk. We didn't want this to be a historical piece.''
 Creating a version of the city that looks as if its clock has been turned back 35 years is the primary responsibility of Mr. Hendrickson, who worked as a production designer on the quintessential New York films ''Arthur'' and ''Wall Street.'' 
 For ''Life on Mars,'' he began by reviewing files he had kept on the city's police stations over three decades of moviemaking. Ultimately, he chose the former Fifth Street headquarters of the Ninth Precinct (known colloquially as ''The Fighting Ninth,'' for its pugnacious reputation) as the model for Tyler's workplace. He channeled its spirit into a set built to look like a shabby station house in the East Village that has not been renovated in decades. (The exterior of the fictitious station is a home for the elderly on Dean Street in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.)''It gives us a grittiness that you don't find on contemporary cop shows,'' Mr. Hendrickson said of the set, which is at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. ''At that time New York was virtually broke, and God knows nobody was spending any money to paint or repair the inside of a police precinct.'' 
 When a script calls for an outdoor location, Mr. Hendrickson has a ready list of city streets that look much as they did in the 1970s -- or, for that matter, in the early 1900s. A scene from the pilot episode in which Tyler first realizes that he has traveled back in time was shot on Orchard Street on the Lower East Side, with few modifications made to the real-life block.
 ''A really old row of brownstones, for instance, with a little store at the corner, looks exactly the same today as it did then,'' Mr. Hendrickson said. ''A fire escape is a fire escape, and a brick building is a brick building. We may have to change some signage or some details, but the basic line of the street is unchanged.'' 
 Add a few actors wearing bell-bottoms, wide lapels and pastel polyester, replace the Hummers and S.U.V.s along the curb with Chevy Novas and Dodge Chargers, and the years evaporate. 
 EVEN as ''Life on Mars'' glamorizes and all but canonizes this period of the city's history, members of its crew who lived through that era, or through later but equally unpleasant years, have more complicated memories. 
 Mr. Nuciforo, who was raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in the '70s, remembers the ubiquitous graffiti and epidemic drug use, but also the moment he was first inspired to join the police force. 
 ''If a cop came by your hangout or your corner and told you to get lost, you did what the cop said,'' he recalled. ''God forbid he had to take you back to your house. My old man would have plastered me to the wall.''
 Mr. Nemec, who grew up in the late 1980s, remembers it as the era of the ''preppy murderer'' Robert Chambers, of the Central Park jogger and the killing of Yusef Hawkins in Bensonhurst. He still talks about the day he and some classmates emerged from a restaurant on Second Avenue and 85th Street and were attacked by a bunch of gang members, simply, he said, because ''somebody decided to get a posse together and go out and beat up people.'' 
 But Mr. Nemec also has proud memories of working as a video store clerk in Times Square before the neighborhood became a rejuvenated tourist mecca, and as a waiter in a nearby Tony Roma's restaurant, where his most frequent customers were prostitutes and pimps. ''They weren't good tippers,'' Mr. Nemec said, ''but that's who came in for lunch.''
 Though it might seem counterintuitive that some longtime New Yorkers venerate dark chapters of the city's history that they lived and struggled through, according to several observers of the urban scene, such emotions are both commonplace and not at all contradictory.
 ''The image of New York is important to New Yorkers, and it's part of their self-image,'' said Jonathan Mahler, the author of the 2006 book ''Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning: 1977, Baseball, Politics, and the Battle for the Soul of a City.''
 Many people who stuck with the city through tougher times now feel that they have a stake in its continued prosperity, and, he said, ''are now sticking out their chests a little bit. 'Yeah, I may be living in this little studio apartment, but I'm making it and I'm surviving here.' '' 
 Not that New York was utterly beyond redemption in these bygone years: As a kind of modern-day frontier town, Mr. Mahler said, it was teeming with peril, but also with frantic energy and with havens where experimental subcultures could flourish. 
 ''As parts of the city became abandoned and forgotten, they would be taken up by these urban pioneers who would use them for their own purposes and create interesting things there,'' he said, pointing to the gay culture of the West Village, the punk rockers of the East Village and the nascent art scene in SoHo, all of which emerged during those years.
 Mr. Mahler added, however, that that the 1970s were not in any way a better decade to be living in the city. ''I'm much happier to be living here and raising my family in New York now,'' he said. ''Or at least I could have said that six months ago.''
 According to Ken Auletta, who described the city's decline in his 1979 book, ''The Streets Were Paved With Gold,'' the differences between the New York of the mid-1970s and today are more glaring than the similarities.
 ''Of course, as more people fall into poverty, joblessness, et cetera, it is very likely the crime statistics will again go up,'' Mr. Auletta said. ''It is very likely that the fear that people felt on the streets in the 1970s -- and they don't feel quite the same today -- will go up. 
 ''But I don't think you're going to have the kind of racial tension today, with Barack Obama in the White House, that you had back then. As grim as the economic statistics are today and the challenges we face today, I think the optimism you saw among the two million in Washington, that sense of optimism, they didn't have then.'' 
 AS the New York of today continues to look more like its unsavory 1973 self -- a declining economy, upticks in violent crimes like murder and bank robbery and an ever more crumbling infrastructure starved for resources -- it remains to be seen whether the romantic feelings of the ''Life on Mars'' creators (and its viewers) will endure. After all, who wants to turn on a television and be reminded of the bad old days when evidence of bad new days can be seen right outside your window?
 It may be that if the city's downward spiral continues, audiences will seek out more escapist fare. 
 ''Nostalgia's all about missing a period of time that's past and you feel like you won't ever experience again,'' Mr. Mahler said. ''Hardship is going to have an impact on the city and change people's attitudes about living here. At that point, people might be nostalgic for the Giuliani era.''
 In the opinion of Mr. Nemec, ''Life on Mars'' already provides viewers with a getaway of sorts ''because we are not today,'' he said. ''You're going someplace else, someplace completely different.'' 
 To the extent that viewers are watching a series like ''Life on Mars'' to immerse themselves in the past, Mr. Hendrickson said, ''It's because people are fascinated in a time-machine way -- to see, 'Oh, look at that car.' 'Oh, my mom had a dress like that.' Or, 'Oh my God, my dad used to wear a leather jacket.' There are those little keys of recognition that add depth to your characters.''
 But Mr. Nuciforo, the retired detective, suggested that the show held a greater personal appeal, that it could reconnect with an era when New York still needed the help of people like him to save the city from itself.
 Lacking the 21st-century technology and the refined crime-fighting tactics that police officers possess today, Mr. Nuciforo said, his earliest successes on his beat resulted from hard work and an inherent understanding of the city and its residents. ''It was knocking on doors, getting on that telephone,'' he said. ''You had to get out there and do it. If you were lazy, you weren't going to be a successful detective.''
 As he contemplated Times Square, that perpetual barometer of the city's health and harmony where he was once assigned, Mr. Nuciforo said: ''You get a young cop out of the academy, and he's assigned a foot post on 42nd Street, he's not learning the things that a cop in 1982 who was assigned there learned. You could make 10 collars walking down that block back then, and I'm not exaggerating.''
 He wasn't expressing a wish to return for good, he said. ''But every once in a while, if I could wriggle my nose or blink my eyes and be put back there, I wouldn't mind it. I know that sounds weird, but I miss that.''

HEADLINE: For Nonprofits, A Volunteer Lifeline?

BYLINE: By KELLEY HOLLAND. 
E-mail: newmanage@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TIMES are certainly tough on Wall Street, and the automakers are suffering as well. But consider the hardships that nonprofit organizations are enduring.
 Public funding and charitable donations have plummeted even as demand for nonprofits' services -- especially for things like food and housing assistance -- has risen sharply.
 Not far from my town, the Community FoodBank of New Jersey reports that donations were down 20 percent last year until a last-minute celebrity fund-raising pitch, while demand for services grew 30 percent. ''We pulled it out last year, but we don't know what's going to happen this year,'' said Kathleen DeChiara, the president and C.E.O. 
 Nonprofits have a hidden challenge as well: in contrast to executives at most midsize and large businesses, many leaders of nonprofits run very lean organizations and have sometimes risen through the ranks because of their commitment to the group's mission rather than their managerial expertise. In effect, they are navigating an economy in crisis without much of a rulebook. 
 Before the economic turmoil, nonprofits were becoming more inclined to help their executives get management training. But now, many groups are holding off on such training because of financial pressures. 
 At Indiana University, which runs a large program in nonprofit management, registration for its next quarter is off by more than a third, said Dwight F. Burlingame, associate executive director of the Center on Philanthropy there. ''We all know it's the one thing we shouldn't cut at this time,'' he said. ''But the reality is, if you have to keep a staff member and cut training, that's what you do. Then that just sort of snowballs and causes stress on the organization.'' 
 The good news is that the current economy is also creating potential opportunities for nonprofits. 
 More than two million people lost jobs in 2008, and many talented and experienced managers have time on their hands. If they started volunteering, they could help many nonprofits navigate the next couple of years. 
 Some experts say volunteer work can help unemployed professionals keep their spirits up, make new contacts or even to try a new field. 
 ''Three-quarters of people find jobs through being out there, engaged and meeting people,'' said John A. Challenger, C.E.O. of Challenger Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm. ''It's also just extremely valuable to people who are out of work to find work that has meaning when you're sitting out there waiting. Feeling you're giving back can help keep your spirits up, which you need.'' 
 Unfortunately, volunteering has long been a little like daily exercise -- an excellent idea that many people don't act on. Rates of volunteering among Americans 16 or older rose from 20.4 percent in 1989 to 28.8 percent in 2003, but slipped to 26.2 percent by 2007, according to the Corporation for National and Community Service. And many volunteers drift away: more than a third of the 61.2 million who volunteered in 2006 didn't donate any time the next year, according to an analysis of data by the corporation. 
 ''You don't go volunteer because you're feeling the pressure to keep up in the environment you're in,'' Dr. Burlingame said. ''So the professionals who volunteer -- they have been very few and far between.'' 
 Because nonprofits tend to be so lean at the top, they can be hard-pressed to devote many resources to managing volunteers and making the best use of their skills. 
 John Gomperts, president of Civic Ventures, a nonprofit based in San Francisco advocating meaningful second careers, described the situation at Experience Corps, a subsidiary organization he ran until recently. 
 ''We're not the greatest at finance, but how many tens of thousands of finance people have just lost their jobs?'' he asked. ''Can we find someone to help us? We thought of that much, but we have not found the time and energy to execute on it yet.
 ''Many organizations are leaving a great resource on the table or not deploying that resource very well. But it's not part of the ethos of the organization to spend a lot of time on human resource management. You're supposed to be on mission all the time.''
 IT is possible for nonprofits and volunteers to get more out of each other. Clearinghouses like Volunteer Match.org help connect nonprofits and skilled volunteers, and individual nonprofits benefit when executives take time to find volunteers' specific talents.
 Consider Dress for Success, a nonprofit based in New York that provides professional clothing to low-income women looking for jobs. Nancy Lublin, the founder, said that one volunteer with technical expertise wound up designing a Web site for the organization. Another volunteer turned out to be a marathoner, and she organized a 5K run with several clients that Ms. Lublin said helped to bolster their self-esteem. 
 It pays for nonprofit leaders to be able to think like human resources managers, said Ms. Lublin, who is now the chief executive of Do Something, a volunteer clearinghouse for teenagers. 
 ''When someone comes in with a job title from a bank, a lot of nonprofits just see that person as a wallet with legs. That's really short-sighted,'' she said. ''Besides, right now those wallets are empty.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Under New Management column last Sunday, about challenges for nonprofits in the recession, misidentified a program at Indiana University that has experienced an enrollment decline. It is the continuing education program in fund-raising training, not the nonprofit-management programs.

HEADLINE: A Reborn Music Hall Embraces Diverse Programs

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: Tarrytown 

 BODY:
 STANDING on the stage of the Tarrytown Music Hall, Bjorn Olsson, the theater's executive director, sang out in a rich baritone. A former opera singer, he was not performing but demonstrating the 124-year old theater's virtues. ''You can see the eye whites of the people in the back rows,'' the Swedish-born Mr. Olsson said. The acoustics, he added, were terrific. 
 The Music Hall, a historic landmark that once faced the wrecking ball, is experiencing a resurgence. ''Almost every day there's something going on here,'' Mr. Olsson said, noting that the Music Hall produces roughly half the events, while the rest are put on by groups renting the theater. Programs range from performances by edgy singer-songwriters, jazz masters and pop groups to youth shows catering to some 30,000 schoolchildren a year. 
 This week's typically diverse presentations include a classical concert by the Westchester Symphonic Winds on Jan. 25; ''Annie Jr.,'' a musical produced by Random Farms Kids Theater, opening on Jan. 30; and a recital by the Fred Astaire Dance Studio on Jan. 31.
 Since Mr. Olsson and Karina E. Ringeisen, the theater's manager, took over in 2003, programming has more than tripled, community groups have stepped forward with major gifts and the budget of the nonprofit organization has jumped to more than $2 million from $130,000.
 Mr. Olsson and Ms. Ringeisen, a former musical theater dancer and actress, are also life partners who gave up artistic careers to become the theater's first professional staff members in decades. After meeting on tour in Germany in 2000, Ms. Ringeisen said they ''got serious'' about the Music Hall soon after becoming serious about each other. She has a childhood connection to the place; in 1980 her parents, Helen and Berthold Ringeisen, stepped in to prevent the deteriorating building from being turned into a parking lot. 
 The 843-seat theater, with its distinctive Queen Anne-style brickwork facade, was built in 1885 as a hall for concerts, flower shows and vaudeville, later becoming a first-run movie house. The interior combines Victorian and Art Deco design with unusual touches like stenciled patterns, murals and silhouetted figures made of plywood. Jeffrey Greene, president of EverGreene Painting Studios, a leading theater restoration company based in Manhattan, described the theater as ''totally unique and full of personality, with its 1920s decoration shoehorned into a Victorian building.'' 
 When the theater closed in 1976, a victim of multiplexes, the village considered razing it to create parking spaces. Enter the Ringeisens and the Friends of the Mozartina Musical Arts organization, the nonprofit arm of the Mozartina Musical Arts Conservatory in Tarrytown, which Helen Ringeisen directs. They bought the music hall for $130,000, and the couple mortgaged their house as security. ''It was just insanely gutsy,'' Mr. Olsson said. ''They had no experience running theaters.'' 
 Helen Ringeisen, a piano teacher at the conservatory, said she and her husband could not stand by while the theater was destroyed. ''We had gone there for movies and always loved the Music Hall,'' she said. ''I had my teachers go down and try out the acoustics for voice and instruments. One singer said it was one of the few halls that wrapped around her with its wonderful acoustics.'' Mr. Ringeisen, a professor of humanities and languages, died in 2007.
 The Friends group received a tax exemption from the Village of Tarrytown and repaired the deteriorating building through a series of grants and loans. The Ringeisens and other volunteers did much of the work with their own hands, securing a listing on the National Register of Historic Places and reopening the theater as a rental house. Helen Ringeisen, who still does volunteer bookkeeping for the Music Hall, recalled cleaning the theater until two in the morning while Karina, a young child, slept curled up on the seats.
 ''I thought, this is a very strange childhood,'' Helen Ringeisen said. ''But she loved it. She got to meet Ginger Rogers and watch her direct 'Babes in Arms.' Sometimes she missed a little school, but she got a different kind of education.'' Karina Ringeisen recalled ushering and selling refreshments, and noticing that her parents never went out for dinner parties. 
 Now she and Mr. Olsson spend many nights working at the theater, although professionals clean it. The couple have restored the neon marquee, installed a high-quality sound system and last year replaced a 1940s air-conditioning system with a new one, thanks to a $20,000 grant from the Junior League and other contributions. In 2007 the Music Hall took out two mortgages to buy the property behind the theater to be used for a loading dock and parking, among other things. Mr. Olsson said future projects include replacing the seats (many of which are held together by tape), fixing the floors and repairing old water damage. Current projects include updating the bathrooms and completing a master plan in time for the theater's 125th anniversary next year.
 While some of the Music Hall's income is derived from rental fees -- both from presenters and businesses occupying street-level space in the building -- most of it comes from ticket sales, which rose 25 percent from 2007 to 2008, Ms. Ringeisen said. One group, Premier Performing Arts, a professional musical theater group, canceled its performances in December because of poor ticket sales, but the calendar for the coming months is full. 
 Mr. Olsson exudes confidence despite the economic climate. ''The theater is still an inexpensive pleasure,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Third Week of Losses in a Volatile Market

BYLINE: By E. JUSTIN SWANSON

 BODY:
The stock market ended in the red for a third consecutive week, but hope for an expansive recovery plan emerged in Washington Friday afternoon, giving investors a small measure of relief. 
 For most of the week, financial stocks served as a barometer for the overall market, with steep drops on Tuesday and Thursday as investors worried about struggling banks and their effect on the economy. A day of strong gains was sandwiched between.
 The news was mixed for technology companies, as well. Microsoft missed analysts' estimates for sales and profit and announced that it would cut 5 percent of its work force. Google, however, beat earnings forecasts and gave the tech sector some optimism.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 203.66 points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 8,077.56. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 18.17 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 831.95. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.62 percent from 2.32 percent. The futures price of a barrel of oil in New York rose to $46.47 from $36.51.

HEADLINE: Working Hard To Look Busy

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
TO a passer-by, the chic clothing store on Mott Street in Manhattan looked like a tumult of activity. On a recent weekday afternoon, Carolyn Bailey, a supervisor, was fussing with the window displays of women's clothing, shifting piles of perfectly folded sweaters, spacing hangers a finger-width apart, debating avidly on the phone with a higher-up about coordinating outfits.
 Though she appeared occupied, intently so, she was creating an illusion of busyness. The NoLIta shop was empty. 
 ''You don't want anyone from corporate to walk in and see you doing nothing,'' Ms. Bailey said. ''You've got to keep busy for them and the clients. You have to be proactive --'' she broke off to reposition a handsome pair of boots, ''so we'll do a lot of refolding and dusting. Hey, I might just mop!'' 
 By day's end, six customers had wandered in. Ms. Bailey charmed three into making purchases. 
 ''I'm putting the energy out there,'' said Ms. Bailey, a single mother. ''I have to stay positive. And busy.''
 In a sunny economy, workers joke about frittering away the hours during traditional slow times, like January, confident that things will eventually pick up. Looking busy when you're not in order to fool the boss can be something of an art form. 
 But now, when business is verrry slow and the possibility of layoffs icily real, looking busy is no joke. In retail and real estate, restaurants and law offices, many workers are working hard to look necessary -- even when they don't have all that much to do.
 Their concerns are warranted. The unemployment rate is 7.2 percent, more layoffs have been forecast for 2009 and employers have been shrinking workweeks. While staff reductions have left many remaining employees feeling breathless with too much work, at companies where downtime is glaringly obvious, employees are becoming creative about disguising idleness. 
 A portfolio manager, 30, who works for a private equity firm in New Jersey, scatters papers on his desk. When he skips out for long lunches, he colludes with friends in other offices to call him -- and deliberately leaves behind his cellphone, with the ringer's volume set to high. (Like many workers interviewed for this article he requested that neither his name nor his company be mentioned, worried that his position would be at risk.)
 A lawyer at the New York office of an international firm wanted to give the impression he was working late at night -- but he was stymied by office lighting that would dim when he left the room. So he brought in an oscillating fan, which tricked the motion detectors into keeping the lights on long after he'd departed.
 A Manhattan advertising executive in his 30s who oversees the print ads for a major account that may be on the verge of collapse, positions his monitor to face the window, so colleagues can't see that he's designing toys for the baby he and his wife are expecting this spring.
 In fact, cyberloafing -- the nonwork-related use of computers by employees -- often gives temporary cover to those who want to appear busy, if they can master the furrowed brow, the studious squint at the monitor (while bidding on eBay). Work e-mail messages can be programmed to be sent in the middle of the night, so that workers can seem 24-7 dedicated.
 Flinging headlong into busywork itself is another way to seem indispensable. Re-indexing transaction papers. Studying regulations in areas with only a chimerical connection to yours. Writing notes to customers to thank them just for coming in to browse.
 In these unbusy times, busywork's bad reputation may be due for revision. Busywork can give you a reassuring, small-bore task. It can trigger ideas for genuine productivity. It can stave off boredom for some, even as it drives others absolutely batty. It can spray a room with the smell of nervous fear. 
 But it is nonetheless something to do. A sales associate who works at a national clothing outlet in Westbrook, Conn., said she had readjusted her attitude toward refolding garments, retail's numbingly repetitive busywork. Now when customers leave clothes balled up in fitting rooms, the saleswoman feels grateful.
 ''On slow days, you realize you need that crumpled clothing on the floor, and you don't want customers to put them neatly back on the racks,'' she said.
 Eric Abrahamson, a professor of management at Columbia Business School, said though busywork has no inherent productivity value, ''It may have an individual value for the person who is doing it. It's difficult going into work and having nothing to do. Especially for people who are used to being overwhelmed with work.''
 Michelle Kirby, a real estate agent for Gustave White Sotheby's International Realty in Newport, R.I., was accustomed to being work-crazed. 
 But a wintry hush has settled over real estate. These days, Ms. Kirby shows up at the office largely for the companionship and to polish her existing listings. But how often can she check in with a seller to say that the house hasn't been shown in a month? To keep busy, she began an archaeological excavation of her desk. ''I found files from 2003,'' she said. ''Now I have a clear desk blotter. It's completely neat.''
 Experts on workplace behavior say that mustering a token show for the boss can backfire. If a worker isn't already regarded as diligent, ''This is a bad time to manage the impression that you're a hard worker,'' said Robert Giacalone, a business school professor at Temple University. ''There's fear out there, and that fear generates suspicion among people in power that workers are trying to manipulate their images because they're afraid.''
 Of course employers do tend to notice when busywork doesn't contribute to the bottom line.
 Can it really shield you from the ax? 
 ''How can I stop the organization from doing this?'' added Professor Giacalone. ''Good luck!''
 At law firms, which have been jolted almost daily by layoffs, busywork rarely translates into that all-important billable hour. One corporate lawyer, 40, who was a counsel in the Manhattan office of a 950-lawyer national firm, said that when the economy stalled last summer, he spent his days following the Washington news and calling clients in an advisory, nonbillable capacity.
 ''It was a way to show the client that even though things were slow, I'm still looking out for your best interests so that when things come back, you can turn to us as experts,'' said the lawyer, who specialized in structured finance.
 Scrounging for work, he called lawyers in the firm's other practice areas, trying to market himself to pick up hours. Then calls went out to former clients. To old friends from law school. To friends from college. ''But they were all looking to save their own skins,'' the lawyer said. 
 His time sheets increasingly read, ''professional development.'' Earnest, but nonbillable. He volunteered for the firm's diversity recruiting program. Law firms have an ethical obligation to take on pro bono work, so he explored that, too. 
 ''A lot of partners who were anti pro bono used to say, 'If you do that, find another job!' But they're the ones who are sitting at their desks, twiddling their thumbs and doing pro bono to keep busy,'' the lawyer said. He even read to a class once a week at a public elementary school in the city. 
 ''I was busy not making money,'' he said. ''But because I was out there trying to do things for the firm that were valuable in a different way, I thought that might be enough.''
 Three weeks ago he was laid off.
 When work devolves to such a dead place that even token busywork isn't possible, employees usher in the silly season, if only to keep boredom at bay. A banker at a Wall Street investment bank said that as business ground to a halt this fall, ''There were a lot of football catches on the trading floor, and occasionally you'd hear the sound of footballs crashing into monitors.'' In November, he was sacked in a fourth round of layoffs.
 Certainly one beneficiary of so much downtime is the elusive client. On a recent Wednesday, the matinee lunch crowd at an elegant theater-district restaurant could charitably have been called sparse. But the maitre d' put on her game face. ''It's an opportunity to treat customers like kings and queens,'' she said.
 Concerned about staff morale during slow stretches, employers have ready lists of housekeeping chores. Richie Notar, managing partner at Nobu Restaurants, who flew around the country this month to rally the troops, remarked, ''An idle hand is not good for any employee. It gives the impression that nothing is going on.'' 
 On quiet winter nights, servers fill soy sauce pots and fold paper wrappers for chopsticks.
 ''It's like origami,'' he said. ''It's soothing and relieves anxiety. It's a project, and they all smile when they do it.''
 Jonathan Spira, the chief analyst at Basex, a business research firm, said if employers sense that workers have too much downtime or busywork, they can start cross-training programs. But he added, taking initiative before the boss does is preferable. Rather than try to kill time, better to freshen a resume or think of novel ways to be useful on the job. 
 EARLIER in the slowdown, Patrick Gray, who works at Corrao, Miller, Rush & Wiesenthal, a legal recruiting firm, realized he was endlessly making cold calls to lawyers who were hanging up on him. ''It was making me miserable and tense,'' he said.
 So he set up a blog for alumni of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where he worked several years ago as an associate. When the economy improves, he hopes the blog will bring clients. ''I'm busier because I have a direction,'' Mr. Gray said. ''It's purposeful busywork.''

PERSON: Eric McCormack, Tom Cavanagh 

HEADLINE: They're Not Mad Men, Just Loud Ones

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
GOOD luck trying to squeeze a word in edgewise when Eric McCormack and Tom Cavanagh get going. Like the characters they portray in their new series, ''Trust Me'' (which has its premiere on Monday night at 10 on TNT), the duo works under the assumption that two great creative minds are better than one, especially when engaged in an off-the-cuff volley that loosely resembles a conversation. 
 Mr. McCormack, best known for his role as the gay lawyer Will Truman on ''Will & Grace,'' plays Mason McGuire, an art director with a Chicago advertising firm who gets a corner office when his boss drops dead after a disastrous presentation. Mr. Cavanagh, who was the star of ''Ed,'' is Conner, Mason's copywriter partner for seven years and best pal, who takes awhile to recover from the sting of being overtaken professionally. The verbal overload in ''Trust Me'' is the invention of Hunt Baldwin and John Coveny, former Chicago copywriters who shared a moving van to Los Angeles, where they struggled as mostly unemployed writers before becoming screenwriters and co-executive producers for ''The Closer.'' But in a phone interview with Kathryn Shattuck, Mr. McCormack and Mr. Cavanagh demonstrated that they don't need anyone to put words in their mouths. 
 Q. Let's begin by ...
 MR. CAVANAGH (interrupting) Let's sing Eric McCormack's praises. We're going to get to that anyway at some course over the interview, so why don't we start right now. This guy's amazing. Not only is he an icon and fulfilled an iconic role, he's debuting his next iconic role, and how fortunate are we to be there alongside him?
 Q. Do you have anything to say about Tom, Eric?
 MR. CAVANAGH Hey, wait, easy, careful, careful. Nest of vipers alert.
 MR. MCCORMACK Tom Cavanagh is ...
 MR. CAVANAGH (making the sound of a dial tone) This thing went dead. Click. Hello? Hello, Kathryn, hello? 
 MR. MCCORMACK Tom Cavanagh is fantastic. We are, jokes aside, having an amazing time, and all the more amazing because there was no lead-up, there was no audition together, there was no test screening or anything. There was just he and I in a room on the first day of rehearsal going, ''Hey, this works,'' and the producers sighing with relief, and we're having just a blast.
 Q. Why this show?
 MR. MCCORMACK I think we were both kind of equally excited to see great writing, and just another setting too. I can't speak for Tom, but I didn't want to be a lawyer again. We were both funny lawyers. I didn't want to do a lawyer, I didn't want to do forensics, I didn't want to work in an ER.
 MR. CAVANAGH Anything that had to do with getting something stat we didn't want to do.
 Q. Describe your characters.
 MR. MCCORMACK Mason, my character, is the guy with the family; my daughter is like 15, I've been married a long time. Stable home life, lives in the suburbs.
 MR. CAVANAGH Responsible, mature, smart.
 MR. MCCORMACK And I think lives vicariously through Conner, who's still single.
 MR. CAVANAGH Irresponsible, immature and still smart.
 MR. MCCORMACK But Conner secretly harbors some desires, too. It's definitely a grass-is-always greener friendship.
 Q. What about ''Mad Men''? Obviously there are going to be comparisons.
 MR. MCCORMACK Here's the thing. I got these statistics because I asked for them. There are right now 39 ...
 MR. CAVANAGH I thought you weren't going to be a stat man. It's 37, I think.
 MR. MCCORMACK ... 37 crime shows on the air, there's 17 law shows and 19 medical shows. There have been three advertising shows in history.
 MR. CAVANAGH (humming) While you do that, I just want to do building music.
 MR. MCCORMACK Don't do building music. There was ''Bewitched,'' there was ''Thirtysomething'' and then there is ''Mad Men'' on AMC. You've seen the pilot so you know they're totally different shows. They might as well be a medical show versus a law show.
 Q. What happens down the road?
 MR. MCCORMACK What I found in the writing is a little of what, if I may, Anthony Edwards and George Clooney had in that first season of ''ER'' in the sense that Edwards feels the pressure to run things, to be in charge -- then he got all the women. 
 MR. CAVANAGH In this scenario, I want it noted: Tom Cavanagh is George Clooney.
 Q. Your characters annoy each other a lot on screen. How about in real life?
 MR. MCCORMACK I will say it's a little off-putting how many pictures of me Tom keeps in his trailer. I think that creates a weird work scenario.
 MR. CAVANAGH You know, what really offends you is the Photoshop. Look, this is you riding an elephant and a donkey. Look, this is you landing the plane in the Hudson. You're awesome, dude!
 MR. MCCORMACK Putting my head on Ruth Buzzi's body -- it's upsetting.
 MR. CAVANAGH That's cold. Ruth Buzzi. He's good. See how good he is?

HEADLINE: Paying Dividends, But Not All in Cash

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
NO one knows when the slumping stock market will finally rebound, which is why many Wall Street pundits have been advising investors to stick with dividend-paying companies in the interim. After all, they figure, you might as well get paid while you wait.
 Sage advice, for sure. Yet there are no guarantees that even those companies will keep their dividends at current levels, especially in these turbulent times. 
 Just look at the classic dividend payer: real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which are companies that hold portfolios of commercial property like office buildings and shopping malls. In exchange for favorable tax treatment, their corporate structure mandates that at least 90 percent of taxable income be disbursed to shareholders. 
 But last year, amid the credit crisis and the sinking economy, 38 of the 111 REITs cut or suspended their dividends, according to SNL Financial, the research firm. Of these moves, 33 were announced in the fourth quarter, SNL said, and 15 in December alone. (Only 7 REITs cut or suspended dividends in 2007, while 10 did so in 2006, and 8 in 2005.) 
 In the weeks ahead, as companies declare regular dividends for the 2009 first quarter, some REITs may be looking to dole out even less cash to shareholders. New guidance from the Internal Revenue Service gives them the option of paying up to 90 percent of their dividend in stock, rather than the all-cash way. The ruling remains in effect through 2009. 
 Already, a handful of REITs, including Aimco Properties and UDR, have announced plans to distribute stock as part of their special dividends. 
 At least one REIT -- Vornado Realty Trust -- has signaled its intention of reducing cash payouts in regular dividends. Vornado said it would pay 60 percent of its first-quarter common dividend in the form of new stock and 40 percent in cash; if it paid 60 percent of its dividends in stock in all four quarters, it could preserve nearly $400 million in cash this year. (The company, though, reserved the right to pay an all-cash dividend.)
 How is the investment world reacting to these changes? 
 ''We don't know how it's going to play out,'' said Louis W. Taylor, a managing director at Deutsche Bank Securities. ''But there's certainly a lot of strong, diverse opinion being voiced. The investment universe is definitely split on this.'' 
 On the one hand, some money managers and industry analysts hope that the dividend modifications will help shore up certain REIT balance sheets and, in the long run, share prices, by allowing strapped companies to preserve more capital.
 Others, though, are calling the temporary changes ''shareholder unfriendly,'' especially for those investors looking to stay more liquid themselves, rather than accumulate additional shares that might be declining in value. (The tax implications are the same for cash or stock dividends.)
 ''If you own a REIT, it's because it's going to pay you dividends -- that is the attraction right now,'' said Paul D. Puryear, the director of real estate research at Raymond James & Associates. ''You ought to get paid while you wait'' for Wall Street to stabilize, he added, ''and we could be waiting for a while.'' 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which had sought the dividend changes, maintains that they are necessary right now, in large part because financing is harder to come by, both from banks and the debt markets. (The trade group had pushed to make the modifications permanent, at an 80 percent stock ceiling, the same level permitted a half-dozen or so REITs in private I.R.S. rulings over the last few years.) 
 ''The credit crisis is very real and very significant,'' said Tony M. Edwards, the executive vice president and general counsel of the REIT association. ''This is just one of a number of things companies can do to help themselves in this environment and to conserve cash.''
 He cited an analysis by Merrill Lynch estimating that REITs would retain about $17 billion in cash over all -- money that could be used to retire or buy back debt, or for other purposes -- by restructuring the dividend payout. (The estimate was on the assumption that the I.R.S. guidance would be extended through 2010.)
 Mr. Edwards also maintained that a significant number of REIT investors might not even notice any changes because many of them automatically reinvest the dividends, in some cases through dividend reinvestment programs, or DRIPs. ''So, effectively, in those cases, they won't find any difference,'' he said.
 Still, the bigger issue, said Keven S. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial, is that investors effectively are losing the right to decide for themselves (although he noted that they could immediately cash in a stock dividend). 
 ''Shareholders make a conscious decision to participate in a program like DRIPs, and you often get stock at a discount to the current market price,'' he said. ''This takes the choice away from these shareholders.''
 Some industry analysts also worry that issuing more stock to pay dividends might dilute the value of existing shares, while others contend that the move runs contrary to one of the main selling points of REITs: income.
 ''Investors have been sold a REIT story that includes high-yielding-cash-dividend-paying stocks, and that's an attractive story in many eyes,'' said Mike Kirby, a principal in Green Street Advisors, a research company. 
 In a recent report, his company described the change in composition of Vornado's coming dividend as ''functionally analogous to a dividend cut.'' The main difference, the report said, is that ''shareholders will now have more pieces of paper representing ownership of the same economic pie.'' 
 But Green Street also called the decision prudent: ''Capital preservation should take precedence over the other considerations.'' It noted that Vornado, which owns office and retail space and has a lower-than-average leverage ratio, took the action as a ''proactive step to further enhance liquidity.'' 
 Michael J. Salinsky, a vice president of equity research for RBC Capital, said that reducing cash payouts ''does provide additional short-term liquidity.'' He likened the temporary modifications more to stock splits than dividend cuts.
 ''So if you have one share, say, you now have 1.2 shares but the total value is the same, only at a larger base,'' he said.
 Mr. Taylor of Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, estimated that only a small percentage of REITs were likely to take advantage of the new I.R.S. guidance this year -- some to deal with financing issues, and others to prevent future problems. 
 And what should an investor look for in gauging the financial health of a REIT? 
 ''Three things: it's leverage, leverage, leverage,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''In this environment you want to look for companies with lower leverage and clear funding capabilities.''
 SOME analysts said they wouldn't be surprised to see more REIT dividend cuts or even suspensions of dividends this year. 
 ''With the capital markets closed down, and now that a number of companies have gone down this path, there's no longer quite as much stigma attached,'' Mr. Lindemann said.
 Others think that in the long run, investors are still likely to view such moves as a sign of weakness. 
 ''The companies that are able to pay dividends through this down cycle are going to be rewarded coming out of the other side,'' Mr. Puryear said.

HEADLINE: Recycling, and Selling, Some History

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
CONCEIVED back when the residential market was healthy, two warehouse-to-loft conversions in New Jersey are now being marketed in Hoboken and Jersey City, and a third is under way in Newark.
 Two of the projects are condominiums and one is a rental, but all are being promoted as chic, energy-efficient designs that recycle buildings of distinctive historical value.
 ''Reuse of old industrial buildings located in urban areas is highly desirable,'' said Peter Primavera, of the Urban Land Institute, ''from a planning point of view -- and to buyers.'' 
 Residential real estate experts in the state say that demand for converted lofts in urban areas -- especially those near a mass transit ''hub'' -- was surging before the bank and economic crises hit, and most predict it will swell again as the overall economy recovers. 
 Right now, according to the developers, sales at the two condos are tepid.
 ''Well, it's the worst possible timing,'' said Lawrence Bijou, the managing partner of Bijou Properties, which is just now opening the Garden Street Lofts in Hoboken. ''But we have sold almost half of 30 units, which I say is pretty good.''
 In Jersey City, where 22 new condos are nearly complete at ''m650 Flats,'' a five-story conversion of a century-old structure, six units have sold in three months (three of them to members of the Carrino family, which owns Brunelleschi Construction, the building developer). 
 The Newark building, a few blocks from City Hall and the Prudential Center sports and entertainment arena, had also been planned as condominiums. Early last year, Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark cited the prospect of the first condos downtown as evidence that the city's revitalization effort was gaining traction. 
 But prospects for bank financing disappeared with the national economic crisis, said the project's developer, Michael Saltzman, whose company is called Newwork. Construction began in late October to create 67 rental units instead. Mayor Booker said at the groundbreaking that it made him ''very proud.'' 
 The Newark building -- which like the Hoboken and Jersey City structures lay vacant for years before being eyed for renewal -- was originally a jewelry factory. Known as the Richardson Building, it has stood for a century at the corner of Columbia and Green Streets, and it gets a mention in Philip Roth's novel ''American Pastoral,'' which is set in historic Newark.
 The building has one jaw-dropping feature: a six-story-tall steel spiral staircase that stands in an open central atrium. The elements turned the staircase rusty, but that deterioration will be halted, as plans call for a skylight roof and a small courtyard around the central spiral.
 ''It will be a natural gathering place, a social center for residents,'' said Brendan Murray, the chief executive of Tekton Development, which is creating Richardson Lofts.
 Tekton is recycling materials, using ''green'' techniques, and installing energy-efficient features throughout the building, in a bid for a ''silver'' rating from the United States Green Building Council, which issues certifications based on LEED standards -- for Leadership in Energy and Energy Design. This would be a first for Newark.
 The Garden Street Lofts building in Hoboken is headed for certification as the first silver-rated residential building in the Jersey waterfront area. A five-story brick structure where coconuts were once processed, the building was retrofitted with a two-story zinc-faced addition.
 It offers one-, two- and three-bedroom units, some with decks -- and two two-story penthouses on the top floors, one with a 1,400-square-foot terrace with a hot tub. Prices start in the mid-$600,000s and go up to $2 million for the premier penthouse unit.
 ''So far, we haven't had to lower prices,'' said Mr. Bijou, the developer. ''There are actually some interesting buyers out there. We've seen several sports figures, and the ambassador to the United Nations from Sudan came by.'' 
 At the m650 Flats building in Jersey City, the builders said they used green techniques and material but are not striving for the LEED rating. They are going for high-impact style, said Anthony Carrino, the 30-year-old son of Alfonso Carrino, who created the Brunelleschi Construction Company after recognizing the potential of a decrepit structure on Montgomery Street.
 Anthony Carrino, whose cousin John Carrino is also a builder and a buyer at m650, said with a shrug: ''The market is what it is. But we are aiming for the buyer who wants something that can't be found anywhere else.'' 
 At their ''boutique'' building, a block up, and across Montgomery from the huge Beacon condominium complex, the Carrinos carefully deconstructed a brick and bluestone wall at the street level, reusing the brick and stone to create Old World masonry in the style of Filippo Brunelleschi, the Renaissance sculptor and architect, in the condos.
 That is paired with ultramodern Euro-style fixtures for the interiors, environment-friendly bamboo flooring, and a ''virtual doorman'' service.
 A robotic parking garage was installed at street level in the building, which has served variously as a livery, a warehouse, an Army-Navy surplus center -- and even, at one point, the fake storefront site for an F.B.I. sting, according to Alfonso Carrino. 
 ''I should know the history around here,'' Mr. Carrino said. He was born at the Jersey City Medical Center, the complex that is now the Beacon condos.

HEADLINE: Success, Learned and Taught

BYLINE: By JOYCE M. ROCHE. 
As told to Amy Zipkin.

 BODY:
I WAS born in Iberville, La. My mom moved to New Orleans after my dad died in an accident. I have seven sisters and three brothers; all but one brother are still living. At the time we moved, I was the baby of the family. My mom had two other children after she remarried.
 When I was growing up, segregation was real. When we rode the bus, there was something we called the screen. African-Americans, or Negroes as we were called then, were expected to sit behind a piece of wood. Since where we lived had movie theaters and grocery stores, it was only when we traveled to Canal Street to department stores that segregation was most noticeable. 
 One of my older sisters moved in with my Aunt Rose, my mother's sister, who was married but had no children of her own. Soon I lived there almost permanently, too. She made sure I was doing well in everything at school. As a black female, I expected to be a nurse, a teacher or a social worker. I had an English teacher in high school who made me feel like an A student, even though I was a strong B student. She became the person I could see myself being.
 I wanted to go to Dillard University in New Orleans and was accepted, but the August before I was to start, Hurricane Betsy hit. The levee was breached and our house was completely underwater. We made our way to a school that had a second level and climbed onto the roof. A helicopter lift began the next morning. Children and the elderly were airlifted first. We teenagers were on the roof two days waiting to be rescued. At night we slept in the second story of an adjoining house. The third day, a boat was sent to rescue us. Our house needed to be rebuilt. We lived with an uncle while ours was repaired.
 I began working for the phone company instead of going to college. The following summer, I enrolled in Southern University at New Orleans for my first year. I got a scholarship at Dillard for my sophomore year. I had a concentration in math and started practice teaching my senior year. My then-boyfriend was accepted to Harvard Business School and a friend of mine to Columbia Business School. I applied and was accepted to Columbia.
 In 1970, there was a message in society that blacks weren't as academically equipped as whites. I was intimidated. In my first semester, I flunked accounting and was devastated. I thought, ''I've got to go back to New Orleans and teach.'' I decided to take the course again, and passed.
 When I graduated, the economy was taking a dip. I left without a job. After a short time at CUNY, I got a job at Avon in marketing. After about five years, I was recruited to Revlon to be director of Polished Ambers, an ethnic line.
 One time at Revlon, I had a 2 p.m. appointment to present a business plan. I waited in my office to be called into the conference room. Finally, at 10 p.m., I was told I wasn't presenting that day. The executives ahead of me had gone over their time limits. I learned how to perform in a highly competitive environment. 
 After two years, I returned to Avon and later became a company officer. In the mid-1990s I left to become executive vice president of worldwide marketing at Carson Products, which made a line of ethnic hair care products. I became president a year and a half later. After four years at Carson, I left. While considering my next career move, I started doing pro bono work.
 At the time I started interviewing for Girls Inc., a nonprofit organization, I was also interviewing for the presidency of a company that advised clients about work-life balance. I took out a pencil and paper and drew a line down the middle to help me choose. On one side, I listed the satisfaction of helping girls be successful. On the other, I put the politics of working in a corporation.
 I chose Girls Inc.

HEADLINE: Shrewd Bidders Turn Up To Drive Home a Bargain

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.
THE man said he was in the market for a 1954 Chevrolet Corvette.
He was looking for a bargain, saying he had heard that prices might be lower this year than they were in 2008, when an exceptional low-mileage example sold here at the Barrett-Jackson collector car auction for an almost-unheard-of $192,500.
''He came expecting to pay $100,000,'' said McKeel Hagerty, the president of Hagerty Insurance, which specializes in coverage for classic cars. ''Or, let's say he came prepared to pay up to about $100,000 if he had to. But he was definitely shopping for a bargain.'' 
Did this aspiring Corvette owner, who declined to give his name, get the bargain he was looking for? Well, values are hard to pin down in the classic-car business, depending heavily on a car's condition, options and history. But many dealers at the recent round of Arizona auctions said they had expected, with the economy souring and credit tight, lower prices this year than in boom times.
At the Barrett-Jackson auction, there was one Polo White '54 Corvette consigned. The bargain-hunter was seen among the bidders, but he dropped out at $80,000. The car sold for $88,000.
Why had he quit, when the price was well within his budget?
''He got the idea he could do even better elsewhere,'' said Mr. Hagerty, whom the bargain hunter had asked about values for insurance purposes.
''He said he had his eye on a particular one over at Russo & Steele,'' Mr. Hagerty said, referring to another auction, one of about a half-dozen around Scottsdale in January. ''I believe he wound up going over there and buying that one for $59,000. He was thrilled.''
Drew Alcazar, owner of Russo & Steele auctions, said he could offer more details about the car, but not the buyer. Names of buyers and sellers are generally confidential at auctions.
''The majority of clients are conservative, and want to remain private,'' said Terrance D. Lobzun, public relations director of RM Auctions. ''They have their reasons for wanting to remain so. But we come across all kinds of characters. Every car, every owner, has a story.''
If the story includes celebrity ownership or success on a racetrack, it can increase the price.
''This year, I found a lot of people specifically looking for cars with no story,'' Mr. Hagerty said. ''They're still looking for known marques, but perhaps in lesser configurations.''
Luke DeRouen, a spokesman for Barrett-Jackson, agreed. ''Yes, there were a lot of stories like that this week,'' he said. ''People told us they needed to spend wisely in this economy. So we knew we needed to build a docket this year that would get more people involved. We ended up with nearly 70 percent of our buyers this year being new to our event.''
While some auction houses, like RM Auctions and Gooding & Company, continued to cater to the Champagne-and-caviar crowd, the consignment listings at Barrett-Jackson and Russo & Steele seemed to include more cars in lower price ranges than in years when the market was rising rapidly. Having attracted a new crop of buyers with the possibility of bargains, however, auctioneers were not sure how low bidding might go.
The uncertainty was echoed by longtime professionals in the classic-car business. ''I've never gone into an auction season like this one, really having no idea what the results would be,'' Mr. Hagerty said. ''There was a fear among a lot of people that values could go off a cliff.''
Some auction houses let sellers protect themselves with a reserve price, below which the vehicle will not be sold. Barrett-Jackson, however, sells its consignments with no reserve.
''It takes a bit of courage to consign one there,'' Mr. Hagerty said. ''If it sells for $1, it's sold. Since most of these vehicles were consigned four, five and even six months ago, when the market was a little better off, there had to be some anxious sellers.''
''I know the headline writers want quotes like 'blood in the water' or 'giant fire sale!' but it wasn't like that,'' Mr. Alcazar of Russo & Steele said. ''It was a stable marketplace. We couldn't continue with exponential compounding of sales prices, like we saw in 2004 and 2005.''
He added: ''The bottom has fallen out for some things, like the resto-mods and clones and weird customs. But we just sold Nicolas Cage's 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda for $440,000. That proves great cars still get great money.''

HEADLINE: Confessions of a TED Addict

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
Help. Here I go. My pulse is racing. I'm completely manic. 
 Oh why oh why have I been bingeing on TED talks again? I promised myself I would quit watching the ecstatic series of head-rush disquisitions, available online, from violinists, political prisoners, brain scientists, novelists and Bill Clinton. But I can't. Each hortatory TED talk starts with a bang and keeps banging till it explodes in fireworks. How can I shut it off? The speakers seem fevered, possessed, Pentecostal. No wonder I am, too, now. 
 A TED talk begins as an auditorium speech given at the multidisciplinary, invitation-only annual TED conference. (This year's 25th-anniversary conference takes place next week in Long Beach, Calif.) TED then creates videos of the speeches and puts them online so they can find a broader audience -- and usurp my life. There are around 370 speeches and counting on TED.com. A new one is added every weekday. 
 TED (which stands for ''Technology, Entertainment, Design'') was founded in 1984 by the architect Richard Saul Wurman and his partners. Their first conference included one of the first demonstrations of the Macintosh computer. In 2001, TED was acquired and is now run by Chris Anderson, the new-media entrepreneur who started Business 2.0, among other magazines and Web sites. Giving a TED talk has become an opportunity for name-in-lights speakers to throw down, set forth ''ideas worth spreading'' and prove their intellectual heroism. 
 According to June Cohen, the executive producer of TED Media, the speeches were once filmed and cut for a TV pilot. (''The idea of a 'lecture series' wasn't exactly greeted with enthusiasm by the networks,'' she says.) But she had another idea when she brought on Jason Wishnow, an online-video virtuoso. Together, they made the TED talks streamable on the Web in 2006. In less than three years, the talks have become a huge hit, attracting sponsorship from BMW and others. Karen Armstrong, Jeff Bezos, Jared Diamond, Helen Fisher, Peter Gabriel, Jane Goodall, Stephen Hawking, Maira Kalman, Nellie McKay, Isaac Mizrahi, Jimmy Wales and Rick Warren have all given TED talks. As of this month, the talks have been viewed more than 90 million times.
 I have seen about 40. Let me say straight up that one of my favorites is ''Simplicity Patterns,'' by the designer John Maeda. His talk made clear to me the uncanny resemblance between a block of tofu (the kind Maeda grew up making in his family's business in Seattle) and the I. M. Pei building that houses the M.I.T. Media Lab (where Maeda, who is now the president of the Rhode Island School of Design, used to work). Almost haphazardly associative, Maeda's talk expresses respect for the mandate of the talks -- to change the world -- without becoming sententious. You get rapid, straight-to-the-bloodstream access to his mental life.
 The other talk that does this poetically is Jill Bolte Taylor's ''My Stroke of Insight.'' A brain scientist who studied the way she lost her own faculties during and after she suffered a stroke, Taylor urges the audience to pay attention to the sybaritic, present-tense right brain. Repeatedly, she recalls the pleasurable aspects of her stroke with such sensory precision that she seems to enter a rapturous trance. Not only do I buy her case for unfettered right-brain experience, but I began scheming to unfetter my right brain then and there. 
 While looking for your perfect TED talk, don't make the mistake I first did. I started with the 10 most popular. If you do that, you could form the impression that TED talkers are nutcase bullies like the self-help entrepreneur Tony Robbins, who gave a menacing, abrasive performance in ''Why We Do What We Do, and How We Can Do It Better.'' Boasting about his renegade ways, he gunned through a series of piggish sophistries, only to fault fellow TEDster Al Gore -- who was sitting in the front row, no less -- for not making an emotional connection with the American electorate. (This was 2006.) 
 Once you start watching TED talks, ordinary life falls away. The corridor from Silicon Alley to Valley seems to crackle, and a new in-crowd emerges: the one that loves Linux, organic produce, behavioral economics, transhistorical theories and ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' Even though there are certain TED poses that I don't warm to -- the dour atheist, the environmental scold -- the crowd as a whole glows with charisma. I love their greed for hope, their confidence in ingenuity, their organized but goofy ways of talking and thinking. 
 TED supplies its speakers with strict guidelines. ''Start strong'' is the most obvious one, and there is virtually no throat clearing or contrived thanking. Instead, speakers blaze onto the stage like stand-up comics, hellbent on room domination. Some consult notes and stay close by their audiovisual equipment -- PowerPoint is used for emphasis, but it never directs the talks -- while others pace, spread their arms wide and take up space. No one apologizes for himself. No one fails to make jokes. The appreciative room roars at humor, when they're not literally oohing and aahing at insight.
 It's not easy to admit, then, that no single idea put forth in the TED talks seized me with its specifics. The necessary fiction at TED is that matters of substance -- policy, practice, code -- will emerge from the talks. But it's unlikely that a plan to disarm Iran or treat autism will surface; there's too much razzle-dazzle for brass tacks. What's really on display is much more right brain, and that's what I've come to be addicted to: the exposure to vigorous minds whirring as they work hard. 
 Right now I'm holed up on TED.com, sampling the talks. The TEDsters bellow their ideas at me, and I try to brook more stimulation. These are the people of the brain, after all, the understanders. They have only to chant some nostrums and cast rhetorical spells and I'm suddenly thinking some combination of It's all going to be all right and The heck it is -- but only I can stop it! Thanks, TED. I'm clearly inspired out of my mind.

 Points of Entry
 THIS WEEK'S RECOMMENDATIONS
 TEDISSIMO: At a TED conference, 80 speeches are given over four days. On your own, you can savor a choice few -- or binge on way, way more. To get started, consider four sleeper favorites of the TED staff, all available at TED.com or on iTunes: Wade Davis (2003), Majora Carter (2006), Sir Ken Robinson (2006) and Hans Rosling (2006). The site is set up to let you run into other talks you'll like.
 SUPERFANS: Bloggers like to discuss which TED talks are the best, and their idiosyncratic lists are often more interesting than the ''most popular'' on the site. Nam-ho Park has a good list on strangesystems.com as does Tara Hunt at horsepigcow.com. The TED group on Facebook is another place to discuss the talks.
 DE-TED: If you have been reading Tony Robbins or watching TED talks or otherwise getting way too psyched, it might be time for Moments of Rest, David Beardsley's tranquillity blog. Nearly every day Beardsley posts a short film of -- nothing. Everything. Nature. ''It's not about registering, rating, reacting or ranting,'' he writes. ''It exists to give you a moment of stillness each day.''

HEADLINE: Green-Light Specials, Now at Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
IT was billed the Choice Meeting: a secret two-day conference in Arkansas in 2005 pairing Wal-Mart Stores, a symbol of scorched-earth global capitalism, with some of the nation's most influential environmentalists. And it began with a zinger.
''Tell me why I should care about an endangered mouse in Arizona?'' asked H. Lee Scott Jr., the retail giant's chief executive, only partly in jest.
At the time, Wal-Mart was the target of a well-orchestrated assault focusing on its labor practices and environmental record. It was also straining to keep its legendary growth on track. Mr. Scott, hungry for ways to protect and transform his company, began to see environmental sustainability as a way to achieve two goals: improve Wal-Mart's bottom line and its reputation.
So he presented his colleagues with a radical option -- the ''choice'' that gave the meeting its name -- encouraging them to adopt a sustainability program to remake the entire company, from the materials used to build stores to the light bulbs stocked on its shelves. Although participants were conflicted, a vote on the initiative was unanimous: Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer and biggest buyer of manufactured goods, would go green. 
By virtue of its herculean size, Wal-Mart eventually dragged much of corporate America along with it, leading mighty suppliers like General Electric and Procter & Gamble to transform their own business practices.
Under Mr. Scott, who is retiring this month at the age of 59, the company that democratized consumption in the United States -- enabling working-class families to buy former luxuries like inexpensive flat-screen televisions, down comforters and porterhouse steaks -- has begun to democratize environmental sustainability.
For decades, many consumers felt that going green was a luxury, too, reserved primarily for those with enough money -- and time on their hands -- to buy groceries at natural food stores and organic clothing from specialty retailers.
Today, the roughly 200 million customers who pass through Wal-Mart's doors each year buy fluorescent light bulbs that use up to 75 percent less electricity than incandescent bulbs, concentrated laundry detergent that uses 50 percent less water and prescription drugs that contain 50 percent less packaging.
''If all this sustainability stuff is just for the well-to-do, it's not going to make a difference,'' said Jib Ellison, the founder of Blu Skye, a sustainability consultant who has worked with Wal-Mart.
As the saying goes, Wal-Mart has also done well by doing good. Along with the McDonald's Corporation, it was one of only two companies in the Dow Jones industrial average whose share price rose last year.
When Wal-Mart first embraced green initiatives, its fortunes were sagging. After blanketing the country with its giant, all-in-one stores, it began cannibalizing its own sales. Older stores looked tattered and tired, and Wal-Mart's flirtation with higher-end merchandise, like skinny jeans with fur trim, alienated low-income shoppers who preferred unadorned basics.
By renovating thousands of its stores, ratcheting down the pace of its breakneck expansion and all but abandoning its upscale ambitions, it turned around its lagging sales. But its deft financial rejiggering still didn't burnish its reputation, which had become a business problem, too.
A confidential 2004 report, prepared by McKinsey & Company for Wal-Mart, found that 2 percent to 8 percent of Wal-Mart consumers surveyed had ceased shopping at the chain because of ''negative press they have heard.'' Wal-Mart executives and Wall Street analysts began referring to the problem as ''headline risk.''
So the company, known for bitterly rebutting critics or simply ignoring them, began working closely with activists to improve its labor, health care and environmental records.
It is hard to measure the financial return of a good image. But no one at Wal-Mart talks about headline risk anymore because the headlines have become largely positive.
Profits climbed to $12.7 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, from $11.2 billion in the 2006 fiscal year, while sales jumped to $375 billion, from $312.4 billion, during the same period. The percentage of employees on Wal-Mart's health insurance plan rose to 50.2 percent, from 44 percent.
And since the Choice Meeting, sustainability efforts have saved Wal-Mart hundreds of millions of dollars, according to people familiar with the company's environmental initiatives. Wal-Mart declined to provide exact figures about its savings.
''It wasn't a matter of telling our story better,'' said Mr. Scott said in recent interview. ''We had to create a better story.''
WAL-MART, of course, didn't change overnight. It was pushed -- or, more accurately, shoved -- into wrenching reforms.
When Mr. Scott became chief executive in 2000, the company was a Wall Street darling. With nearly 4,000 stores and more than a million employees, it had edged out Goliaths like Sears and Kmart. But its size and success invited scrutiny. In 2005, two union-backed groups, Wal-Mart Watch and Wake Up Wal-Mart, set up shop in Washington and started a public relations assault against the company.
At one point, Wal-Mart Watch set up an automated phone system to recruit whistle-blowers to share secrets about the retailer.
In 2005, Wal-Mart Watch obtained an internal memorandum showing that 46 percent of Wal-Mart workers' children were uninsured or on Medicaid. The memo proposed further ways to cut employees' health and retiree benefits -- at a time when the company was ringing up annual earnings of more than $11 billion.
Meanwhile, environmental groups accused Wal-Mart of being a polluter. Mr. Scott and his team hunkered down, hurling back a litany of statistics and facts in Wal-Mart's defense.
As the company's reputation unwound, so did its business. Its stock price fell roughly 20 percent between 2000 and 2005, a drop that executives and analysts attributed, in part, to investors' anxieties about Wal-Mart's image. Sales growth lagged behind that of its chief rival, Target, and Wal-Mart faced growing resistance to its expansion.
Inside Wal-Mart headquarters, in Bentonville, Ark., rumors swirled about Mr. Scott's future, and board members became restless. In the end, directors stood by Mr. Scott, but told him he had to overhaul Wal-Mart's image.
''What I would tell Lee is that there was a great deal of misunderstanding about the company and that we had to address it head on,'' said Jose H. Villarreal, a director from 1998 to 2006 and a partner in the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld.
MR. SCOTT -- the son of a gas-station owner -- joined Wal-Mart's trucking department in 1979 and rose to the C.E.O. post in 2000. He acknowledged in an interview that while he was running Wal-Mart, his board ''sensitized'' him to critics.
He began meeting with minority groups, politicians and environmentalists. Some meetings were awkward; others were punctuated by tirades. But as it turned out, most critics did not want Wal-Mart to disappear. They wanted it to be better.
Mr. Scott used some of his opponents' ideas to make that happen, believing that sustainability could become an advantage -- saving the company money, reinvigorating its culture, allowing it to sell better merchandise and attracting and retaining talent.
Engaging outside consultants and critics to help with that transformation was a huge change for the retailer, which prized its independence. To outsiders, it was a sign that Wal-Mart was adopting a new attitude.
''There was a time where people in business believed all they had to do was run their business,'' said David D. Glass, Mr. Scott's predecessor as C.E.O. ''But it doesn't work that way anymore. There is an accountability that goes way beyond that.''
After the Choice Meeting, Mr. Scott went through a kind of Outward Bound phase, known within Wal-Mart as ''Eat What You Cook'' -- a mantra that encourages executives to experience firsthand the impact of their decisions.
For Mr. Scott, that meant driving to a New Hampshire mountaintop to discuss climate change with scientists. He slept on a bunk bed in submarine-size quarters with visitors including Steven Hamburg, then an environmental studies professor at Brown University and author of a 1994 report criticizing Wal-Mart's environmental efforts.
Mr. Hamburg, now chief scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, told Mr. Scott that Wal-Mart's earlier green initiatives were just window dressing. ''So he challenged me back and said, 'Well, we've taken another run at this and we'd love to have your input,' '' Mr. Hamburg recalls.
Shortly after that conversation, Mr. Scott told the world that Wal-Mart was embracing sustainability. He laid out ambitious, possibly unattainable, long-term goals for the company: running its operations solely on renewable energy, creating zero waste and selling products that sustain the earth's resources and environment.
Wal-Mart's suppliers had little choice but to follow its lead.
In came the fluorescent bulbs. In 2007 alone, Wal-Mart sold more than 100 million of them. For a manufacturer, selling a bulb that lasts longer means fewer sold. But it would hurt to lose Wal-Mart as a customer. So G.E. and others ramped up production of fluorescent bulbs.
By selling only concentrated liquid laundry detergent, an effort it began last year, Wal-Mart says, its customers will save more than 400 million gallons of water, 95 million pounds of plastic resin, 125 million pounds of cardboard and 520,000 gallons of diesel fuel over three years.
''Lee pushed me,'' said A. G. Lafley, chief executive of Procter & Gamble, and ''we totally, totally changed the way we manufacture liquid laundry detergents in the U.S. and, now, around the world.''
Wal-Mart says it now saves itself $3.5 million a year just by recycling loose plastic and selling it to processors. After changing the design of its trucks and how efficiently it loads them, its fleet had a 25 percent improvement in fuel efficiency. Amory B. Lovins, a MacArthur fellow and chairman and chief scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit research organization, said Wal-Mart would save nearly $500 million a year in fuel costs by 2020.
While environmentalists give Wal-Mart kudos for the changes it has made, they say that much of what it has achieved so far amounts to collecting low-hanging fruit. The company sells tens of thousands of products, and has demanded the overhaul of only a handful, they say. ''The jury's out in the long term,'' Mr. Hamburg says.
Wal-Mart has revised health care plans and labor practices in recent years, also important facets of its makeover.
In the last few years, it has helped its employees get access to lower-cost prescription drugs and taken steps to prevent labor abuses. For years, some store managers forced employees to work without pay, after clocking out, according to scores of lawsuits. To prevent this, Wal-Mart has programmed cash registers to shut down after an employee has exceeded a certain number of hours. It has also told managers to make sure that employees take lunch and rest breaks.
Last month, Wal-Mart settled dozens of lawsuits contending that it forced employees to work off the clock. The settlement will cost Wal-Mart at least $352 million, possibly far more, according to the company.
Still, many activists, especially in the labor world, remain deeply dissatisfied.
A major class-action sexual discrimination lawsuit is pending against the company. And labor leaders argue that Wal-Mart has simply found new ways to fatten its profits without tangibly improving the lives of its employees. It pays its workers, on average, less than $20,000 a year, and many of them pay thousands of dollars a year in medical bills.
''He had the chance to be the Henry Ford of his generation, especially in the last few years, as the stock price soared,'' said Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, of Mr. Scott. ''He could have found a way to share the wealth. Instead, he became the epitome of the greed that has brought our economy to where it is today.''
Mr. Scott declined to comment. But Wal-Mart says that its average wage, $10.83 an hour for full-time workers, are competitive in the retailing industry, and that its health plans are accessible to a wider range of workers than those of some of its rivals.
Wal-Mart will need to keep building on its recent successes. While most retail chains have had double-digit declines during the current economic turndown, Wal-Mart had a 1.7 percent sales increase in December at stores open at least a year.
Yet that number was lower than analysts' expectations, leading some to predict more trouble ahead for Wal-Mart and the rest of the retail industry.
Come February, it will be the job of Michael T. Duke, 58, who has led Wal-Mart's international operations since 2005, to steer the company through the downturn.
As for Mr. Scott, he will serve as chairman of the executive committee of Wal-Mart's board until 2011. And he intends to increase the retailer's lobbying muscle in Washington, especially regarding health care, energy and sustainability.
''As businesses, we have a responsibility to society,'' he said this month, speaking to members of the National Retail Federation in his last public speech as Wal-Mart chief. ''Let me be clear about this point. There is no conflict between delivering value to shareholders, and helping solve bigger societal problems.''

HEADLINE: Great Limits Come With Great Power, Ex-Candidate Finds

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama showed up for his first full day at work on Wednesday determined, as he later told the nation, to make ''a clean break from business as usual.'' But it did not take long for the new president to discover that there were limits to his power to turn his campaign rhetoric into reality.
 Mr. Obama spent his first few days in office rolling out an orchestrated series of executive orders intended to signal that he would take the nation in a very different direction from his predecessor, George W. Bush. Yet he wrestled with fresh challenges at every turn, found some principles hard to consistently apply and showed himself willing to be pragmatic -- at the risk of irking some supporters who had their hearts set on idealism.
 When Mr. Obama wandered into the White House briefing room Thursday afternoon hoping to make small talk with reporters, he was instantly confronted by an unwelcome question: Why was he waiving his tough restrictions on lobbying for a Pentagon nominee? The president brushed it off, saying he would not return ''if I'm going to get grilled every time I come.'' 
 His plan to build bipartisan consensus around an economic package ran smack into discontented House Republicans. When he ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to be shut down, Mr. Obama put off the tough decision of what to do with the terrorism suspects there, a delay that his senior adviser, David Axelrod, attributed to the complexity of the issue -- the same argument Mr. Bush used to keep the prison open.
 ''That is an enormously complicated situation,'' Mr. Axelrod said Friday afternoon in an interview in his West Wing office, adding: ''Obviously, you can't solve problems overnight. But what you can do is signal a sense of motion, a sense of ferment and activity and direction. And I think that he is doing that.''
 All around Mr. Axelrod, there were signs of a new White House coming to life. The senior adviser's name was tacked onto his door on an 8-by-10 inch computer printout -- Obama aides are still learning where to find one another in the West Wing -- and Mr. Axelrod was waiting in vain for the White House Mess to send over the salad he had ordered for lunch. 
 In the Oval Office next door, Mr. Obama was receiving a briefing from his chief economics adviser, Lawrence H. Summers. When the meeting was over, the vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., wandered by, happily chatting up people in the hall. There was an obvious buzz in the place, yet Mr. Axelrod insisted Mr. Obama had experienced no flush of presidential newness.
 ''There has not been a kind of 'Oh my God' moment where he said, 'Now I'm the president,' '' Mr. Axelrod said.
 Throughout the campaign, Mr. Obama was something of a political Rorschach test; he was not required to make tough executive decisions, and so people could see in him what they wanted. His first few days as president, though, have given the first hints of how he will run his administration. 
 ''I think you will see a presidency that's less about hard-core ideology, and more about setting bold strategic objectives and setting out how we are going to get there,'' said John D. Podesta, who ran Mr. Obama's transition.
 Already, that has given rise to some contradictions. 
 On his first full day in office, Mr. Obama declared that his administration would place a high priority on openness and transparency. Yet the first official White House briefing was given by two senior aides who, in the time-honored way of Washington, demanded anonymity.
 At the same time, the Obama team made no apologies for the president's willingness to make an exception to his tough anti-lobbying rules for William J. Lynn III, a military industry lobbyist who is the president's pick for deputy secretary of defense. That exception drew sharp questions late Friday from Senator John McCain, Mr. Obama's opponent in the general election and someone the president has sought to make an ally.
 Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and a close friend of Mr. Obama's, said the move suggested the president was willing to take a few lumps if he thought he was right.
 ''He obviously needed and wanted this man,'' Mr. Durbin said, ''because he knew the critics would say, 'What are you doing here? You established a rule and you changed it.' ''
 And while as a candidate Mr. Obama had tough criticism for the Bush administration's use of harsh interrogation tactics, President Obama left himself some wiggle room in overturning that policy, by deferring a decision on whether some techniques should remain secret to keep Al Qaeda from training to resist them.
 ''I think it emphasizes a realist, a pragmatist, someone who is not on a strictly political or ideological exercise,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who is close to the president. ''It underscores what I think is part of his leadership style, which is that there has to be some flexibility -- a firm principle but a flexible application.''
 Yet one man's flexibility is another man's wishy-washiness, and Mr. Obama's willingness to adapt carries the risk that he will either alienate his liberal base or fail to convert Republicans whose support he hopes to win. During his transition, Mr. Obama managed to charm conservatives; he wooed them at one dinner honoring Mr. McCain, and at another at the home of the columnist George F. Will.
 But just days into the Obama presidency, some conservatives sound wary.
 ''I thought he did very well during the transition on things like the dinner with George Will, and all the words sounded good,'' said Newt Gingrich, the Republican former speaker of the House. ''But I think they are right at the cusp of either sliding down into a world where their words have no meaning or having to follow up their words with real behavior.''
 Mr. Obama came into office with a clear set of objectives for his first week, advisers said. He wanted to convey a sense that he was moving quickly to make good on campaign pledges, while at the same time establishing realistic expectations for what he could achieve. ''He wanted to show that an activist president could get the ball rolling right away,'' Mr. Podesta said.
 Many Democrats, and even some Republicans, say he succeeded. ''He is creating an image that he is making something happen,'' said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist.
 But in the coming weeks, Mr. Obama will have to do more than create an image; he will in fact have to make something happen -- most immediately, an economic stimulus package with bipartisan support, as promised. His ability to bring Democrats and Republicans together will be the first major test of his presidency.
 That test began Friday, in the White House Roosevelt Room, where Mr. Obama tried to bring House Republicans on board, despite their fundamental differences on tax policy for low-wage workers.
 ''I said to him straight up, 'I think your electoral success was largely based on the hope that you could deliver change to the way Washington works,' '' said Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican whip. He said he had told Mr. Obama pointedly that he would lose Republican support unless House Democrats were willing to make some changes in the bill.
 The president listened intently, Mr. Cantor said, giving little hint of how he planned to square that circle.

HEADLINE: Going Their Way?

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
A SECURITY guard working at the taxi depot at John F. Kennedy International Airport one blustery afternoon last week likened the vast, windswept lot, where cabbies pass the long wait between trips into Manhattan, to the United Nations. 
 In some ways, the comparison holds up. The lot and its one squat building are a jumble of cultures cheek by jowl: here, Muslims kneeling on mats on the sidewalk to pray; there, Haitians squabbling over a raucous game of dominoes.
 But the depot has a few things the United Nations lack. It has wildlife, like the seagulls that scour the lot and pigeons that crowd close to the building's entrance. It has makeshift want ads -- ''Looking to buy taxi,'' and much more -- scrawled in marker onto the outside walls. The depot may also have, as a few hours hanging around the gloomy cafeteria reveals, even more spirited debate. 
 One topic on this icy afternoon was a new proposal by Mayor Bloomberg to formalize a system of cab sharing from certain locations. 
 The idea took up exactly three sentences in the mayor's State of the City address this month, and mayoral aides said that most of the specifics had not been worked out. The gist, though, is that separate passengers leaving from the same place -- a designated list of airports, train stations and the like -- could ride together, each paying a set fare. The passengers would pay less per person than they would traveling alone, but the drivers would make more per trip. 
 ''It's a win-win,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in his speech. ''What's not to like?''
 That rhetorical question found many answers at the taxi depot, where drivers, with plenty of waiting time on their hands, are happy to expound on the job's hardships: the long hours, stress, low pay and dirt. City officials were not spared. ''The point is,'' one driver said, ''everything they do is never good for cab drivers.''
 Yet against that backdrop, the mayor's idea may find some fans. A Romanian driver named Daniel Ambro recalled that the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, as an emergency measure during the 2005 transit strike, let drivers turn off their meters, pick up multiple fares and charge by zone.
 ''I made more money on that day, like nothing else,'' Mr. Ambro said. Of the skeptics, he added, ''Ask them: 'During the M.T.A. strike, did you make more money or not?' Sure they made money.''
 (It must be noted, however, that taxi ridership was unusually high during the transit strike, and that Mr. Ambro holds several minority opinions. For one thing, he pronounced the salmon in the cafeteria ''excellent.'')
 Later that afternoon, Lassana Diallo of Mali and Ngoran Dje of Ivory Coast batted the proposal around between glances at their cars parked in the line outside. Mr. Diallo pronounced the idea ''very, very good,'' arguing that with multiple passengers per trip, drivers could make more money on a gallon of gas.
 Mr. Dje conceded the point about theoretically higher income, but wondered where, in a bad economy, all these riders were coming from. 
 Beyond the unresolved mechanics of the plan, what worried many drivers was a familiar lament: the fickleness of the customer. Lots of people, they said, just don't like to share.
 Daleap Paul of Guyana remembered arriving at a crowded terminal at La Guardia Airport late one night with few other cabs in sight. A man got into his car, and then a woman arrived and asked to share the ride. The first passenger agreed, and they headed off. Only later, after the woman was dropped off, did the man complain.
 ''He said, when I take a cab, that's for me,'' Mr. Paul said. ''I said, 'All you had to say was no.' He said, 'I didn't want to tell her in her face.' ''
 Mr. Paul shrugged. ''People in the city love their privacy,'' he said. ''I love my privacy.''
 Cleaning up the remains of his rice and vegetables, he moved toward the door. ''I'm going to take a little 10 minutes' rest,'' he said. ''I want to get away -- like a passenger -- from everybody.''

HEADLINE: As No. 44 Arrives, a Park for No. 32?

BYLINE: By GREGORY BEYER

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA was 12 years old in 1973, when Welfare Island was rechristened Roosevelt Island in honor of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. That same year, a four-acre site at the island's southern tip was designated as the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, and designed by the renowned architect Louis Kahn. 
 A planned memorial was never built, the proposal having sputtered and stalled through multiple decades, administrations and fiscal crises. But its supporters see the Obama presidency, with its promise of public works projects in a time of economic hardship, as a fortuitous echo of Roosevelt and his policies that might finally, this year, spur the memorial's construction.
 ''All of this has a special poetry, it seems to me, that comes together in this particular time,'' said William vanden Heuvel, the founder of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, a nonprofit group that is raising money for the park. ''And all of us would rejoice to be reminded of how we met extraordinary challenges and are prepared to do it again.''
 Mr. vanden Heuvel hopes that construction of the $45 million memorial can begin in June. The project will eventually comprise 150 littleleaf linden trees arranged in two rows flanking a sloped lawn, culminating in a three-sided granite structure housing a bust of Roosevelt, and engraved with his Four Freedoms, as articulated in a 1941 speech.
 The park will be privately and publicly funded. Those who donate a tree will have their names engraved on an adjacent granite parapet, along with a Roosevelt quote or a personal statement of the donor's choosing.
 The plan has its critics, among them Eric Schwartzman, an accountant and island resident who writes the blog Roosevelt Island 360. Mr. Schwartzman said the trees would hinder the magnificent view from the island's southern tip, and he wondered whether the island might be inundated by visitors if the park became a tourist attraction. He also questioned the prudence of allocating public money for the park, given the current economic climate. ''Eight million dollars seems ridiculous right now,'' he said.
 Still, supporters like Councilwoman Jessica Lappin, who pushed for a $4 million allocation in the council budget -- another $4 million will come from the governor's office, and $50,000 from Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer -- say there is no better time than now. Saying that Roosevelt Island can ''absolutely'' can handle the possible influx of tourists, she added, ''I really believe people will come from all over the world.''
 And Mr. vanden Heuvel dismissed the project's critics. 
 ''It will not affect the view,'' he said of the trees. And he contended that it was precisely the making of bold choices in a time of crisis that made the project both timely and necessary. The park's construction, he noted, would create almost 300 jobs.
 ''What we heard in this inaugural speech was the rebuilding of America,'' Mr. vanden Heuvel said, ''and that's what Roosevelt had to do.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a long-planned park memorial to Franklin D. Roosevelt on Roosevelt Island misstated the amount of money that the office of Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer would contribute to the project. Mr. Stringer's office plans to contribute $500,000 -- not $50,000.

HEADLINE: A Liberal Translation

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY GARTON ASH. 
Timothy Garton Ash, a fellow at St. Antony's College, Oxford, and the Hoover Institution at Stanford, is the author of ''Free World: America, Europe and the Surprising Future of the West.''

DATELINE: Oxford, England 

 BODY:
 GOVERNMENT and markets both have their place in a decent society, President Obama suggested in his Inaugural Address, but can become a force for ill if they are without restraint. Missing from Mr. Obama's address was only the proper name of the political philosophy, coded into the constitutional DNA of the United States, that proposes this and other balances: liberalism. 
 Like many of Mr. Obama's speeches, the Inaugural Address presented, in substance, a blend of classical constitutional and modern egalitarian liberalism. The thing, but never the word. Anyone who knows anything about contemporary political discourse in the United States understands why. 
 Just over 20 years ago, a group of leading American intellectuals, gathered by the historian Fritz Stern, placed an advertisement in this very paper trying to defend the word ''liberalism'' against its abuse by Ronald Reagan and others on the American right. It was in vain. Over the last two decades a truly eccentric usage has triumphed in American public debate. Liberalism has become a pejorative term denoting -- to put the matter a tad frivolously -- some unholy marriage of big government and fornication. 
 This weird usage leads, at the extreme, to book titles like ''Deliver Us From Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism and Liberalism.'' But it infects the mainstream too. Asked during a primary debate to define ''liberal,'' and say if she was one, Hillary Clinton replied that a word originally associated with a belief in freedom had unfortunately come to mean favoring big government. So, she concluded, ''I prefer the word progressive, which has a real American meaning.'' This implies that the meaning of ''liberal'' must be unreal, un-American, or possibly both. 
 The United States is not the only place where ''liberalism'' is fiercely contested. In a recent conference at Oxford, with speakers from the Americas, Europe, India, Japan and China, we explored what we deliberately called ''Liberalisms.'' Interestingly, what is furiously attacked as ''liberalism'' in France, and in much of Central and Eastern Europe, is precisely what is most beloved of the libertarian or ''fiscal conservative'' strand of the American right. When French leftists and Polish populists denounce ''liberalism,'' they mean Anglo-Saxon-style, unregulated free-market capitalism. (Occasionally the prefix neo- or ultra- is added to make this clear.) 
 One Chinese intellectual told us that in his country, ''Liberalism means everything the government doesn't like.'' The term is used in China as a political instrument to attack, in particular, advocates of further market-oriented economic reform. Standards of what counts as socially or culturally liberal also vary widely. An Indian speaker wryly observed that in India a ''liberal'' father is one who allows his children to choose whom they want to marry. 
 Faced with this worldwide conceptual cacophony, some at the conference argued that we should abandon the term, or at least dismantle it into component parts with plainer meanings. But combinations and balances belong to liberalism's defining essence, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As the Oxford political theorist Michael Freeden observed, if just one of the necessary components -- for example, the free market -- dominates, then the result can be illiberalism. The vital, never-ending debate over liberalism is not just over its indispensable ingredients, but also over their form, proportion and relation to one another. 
 A plausible minimum list of ingredients for 21st century liberalism would include liberty under law, limited and accountable government, markets, tolerance, some version of individualism and universalism, and some notion of human equality, reason and progress. The mix of ingredients differs from place to place. Whether some distant cousin really belongs to the extended family of liberalisms is a matter of healthy dispute. But somewhere in this contested, evolving combination there is a thing of enduring value. 
 This has been an American argument, some would say the American argument, for more than 200 years. In fact, the United States is still full of liberals, both progressive or left liberals and, I would insist, conservative or right liberals. Most of them just don't use the word. Liberalism is the American love that dare not speak its name. 
 For obvious reasons, we are now witnessing worldwide criticism of a version of pure free-market liberalism, a k a neo-liberalism, charged with having led us into our current economic mess. Yet, our Chinese and European colleagues agreed that markets remain an indispensable condition of liberty. One leading Chinese economic reformer even suggested that there is less income inequality in those Chinese provinces where the market plays a larger role. 
 I don't expect Mr. Obama to use that word any time soon. But those of us who believe in the universal, enduring value of liberalism are happy to see him start by vigorously restoring more of the thing. He has decisively reasserted the importance of equal liberty under the rule of law, not least by ordering the closing of Guantanamo Bay prison. Seeking a more just and efficient balance between government and markets is at the heart of his domestic agenda. He has also found ways to present the traditional liberal value of tolerance in new language that speaks to our increasingly mixed-up world. 
 Then, perhaps in his second term, he might even dare to rescue the word.

HEADLINE: Making Her Name In Politics, Phonetically

BYLINE: By ROSS GOLDBERG

 BODY:
Now that Kirsten Gillibrand has been appointed New York's newest senator, she is waging a campaign to educate constituents about her life story, her positions and her plans to help the state get out of a crippling recession. 
 Lesson one: how to pronounce her name.
 ''It's a sibilant G,'' an aide in her office in Hudson said, with the air of someone who has had a lot of practice. ''JILL-uh-brand.''
 The challenge is unfamiliar to most New Yorkers who, until recently, had been more accustomed to a senatorial selection process that featured more familiar names like Clinton, Cuomo and Kennedy. The winner, it turns out, is someone whose surname is far less recognized, and whose first name (KEER-sten) still trips up those who have known her for years.
 ''The vast majority of her constituents call her Kirsten -- it's very homey,'' said the aide.
 ''But you can mess that first name up, too. You can call her Kristen.''
 The danger was apparent at the news conference on Friday where Gov. David A. Paterson announced his choice of Ms. Gillibrand to fill the seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton. Several times, both Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Nita M. Lowey referred to her as ''KUR-sten.'' 
 Two members of Ms. Gillibrand's staff interviewed for this story asked not to be identified because they had not been authorized to speak to the press.
 Kirsten E. Gillibrand -- nicknamed Keg by some of her staff members, and Little Hillary by some of her critics -- was born Kirsten Rutnik before marrying her husband, Jonathan. As a young woman, she went by the name Tina. The Gillibrand name has been traced back to medieval England.
 Ms. Gillibrand's staff, which has heard her name mangled on the floor of the House by fellow lawmakers during her tenure as a congresswoman from upstate New York, takes the slips in stride. They have encountered a number of variations, they say, including GILL-uh-brand, JILL-der-brand, and GILL-der-brand -- ''like someone from Harry Potter,'' another aide at her office in Sarasota Springs said with a laugh. ''Gilderwaald. He was one of the wizards that Dumbledore fought.''
 The aide was actually mispronouncing Gellert Grindelwald, Professor Albus Dumbledore's nemesis in the days before Harry's story begins. But what's in a name, anyway?

CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions last Sunday about the many ways that the name of New York's newest United States enator, Kirsten E. Gillibrand, is mispronounced misspelled part of the name of the upstate city where she has an office. It is Saratoga Springs, not Sarasota.

HEADLINE: No Time for Poetry

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
PRESIDENT Obama did not offer his patented poetry in his Inaugural Address. He did not add to his cache of quotations in Bartlett's. He did not recreate J.F.K.'s inaugural, or Lincoln's second, or F.D.R.'s first. The great orator was mainly at his best when taking shots at Bush and Cheney, who, in black hat and wheelchair, looked like the misbegotten spawn of the evil Mr. Potter in ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and the Wicked Witch of the West. 
 Such was the judgment of many Washington drama critics. But there's a reason that this speech was austere, not pretty. Form followed content. Obama wasn't just rebuking the outgoing administration. He was delicately but unmistakably calling out the rest of us who went along for the ride as America swerved into the dangerous place we find ourselves now. 
 Feckless as it was for Bush to ask Americans to go shopping after 9/11, we all too enthusiastically followed his lead, whether we were wealthy, working-class or in between. We spent a decade feasting on easy money, don't-pay-as-you-go consumerism and a metastasizing celebrity culture. We did so while a supposedly cost-free, off-the-books war, usually out of sight and out of mind, helped break the bank along with our nation's spirit and reputation.
 We can't keep blaming 43 for everything, especially now that we don't have him to kick around anymore. On Tuesday the new president pointedly widened his indictment beyond the sins of his predecessor. He spoke of those at the economic pinnacle who embraced greed and irresponsibility as well as the rest of us who collaborated in our ''collective failure to make hard choices.'' He branded as sub-American those who ''prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.'' And he wasn't just asking Paris Hilton ''to set aside childish things.'' As Linda Hirshman astutely pointed out on The New Republic's Web site, even Obama's opening salutation -- ''My fellow citizens,'' not ''fellow Americans'' -- invoked the civic responsibilities we've misplaced en masse.
 These themes are not new for Obama. They were there back on Feb. 10, 2007, when, on another frigid day, he announced his presidential candidacy in Springfield, Ill. Citing ''our mounting debts'' and ''hard choices,'' he talked of how ''each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility'' and ''some measure of sacrifice.'' His campaign, he said then, ''has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship.'' But the press, convinced that Obama was a sideshow to the inevitable Clinton-Giuliani presidential standoff, didn't parse his words all that carefully, and neither did a public still maxing out on its gluttonous holiday from economic history. However inadvertently, Time magazine had captured the self-indulgent tenor of the times when, weeks earlier, it slapped some reflective Mylar on its cover and declared that the 2006 Person of the Year was ''You.'' 
 It was in keeping with the unhinged spirit of the boom that three days after Obama's Springfield declaration, a Wall Street baron, Steven Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, a private equity and hedge fund, celebrated his 60th birthday with some 350 guests in the vast Seventh Regiment Armory on Manhattan's East Side. To appreciate the degree of ostentation and taste, you need only know that Rod Stewart was the headliner, at an estimated cost of $1 million. 
 That same week the National Association of Realtors told less well-heeled Americans not to fret about its report that median home prices had fallen in 73 metro areas during the final quarter of 2006. ''The bottom appears to have already occurred,'' said one of the N.A.R. economists. Another predicted: ''When we get the figures for this spring, I expect to see a discernible improvement in both sales and prices.''
 We have discerned what happened to those sales and prices ever since. As for the Blackstone Group, it went public four months after its leader's 60th birthday revels. Its shares have since lost 85 percent of their value, and Schwarzman's bash has become a well-worn symbol of our deflated Gilded Age.
 Yet the values of the bubble remain entrenched even as Obama takes office. In the upper echelons, we can find fresh examples of greed and irresponsibility daily even without dipping into the growing pool of those money ''managers'' who spirited victims to Bernie Madoff. 
 Last week's object lesson was John Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch. He was lionized as a rare Wall Street savior as recently as September, when he helped seal the deal that sped his teetering firm into the safe embrace of Bank of America on the same weekend Lehman Brothers died. Since then we've learned that even as he was laying off Merrill employees by the thousands, he was lobbying (unsuccessfully) for a personal bonus as high as $30 million and spending $1.22 million of company cash on refurbishing his office, an instantly notorious $1,405 trashcan included. 
 Thain resigned on Thursday. Only then did we learn that he doled out billions in secret, last-minute bonuses to his staff last month, just before Bank of America took over and just before the government ponied up a second bailout to cover Merrill's unexpected $15 billion fourth-quarter loss. So far American taxpayers have spent $45 billion on this mess, and that's only our down payment.
 In less lofty precincts of the American economic spectrum, the numbers may be different but the ethos has often been similar. As Wall Street titans grabbed bonuses based on illusory, short-term paper profits, so regular Americans took on all kinds of debt wildly disproportionate to their assets and income. The nearly $1 trillion in unpaid credit-card balances is now on deck to be the next big crash.
 This debt-ridden national binge of greed and irresponsibility washed over our culture not just through the Marie Antoinette antics of a Schwarzman and a Thain but in mass forms of conspicuous consumption and entertainment. Cable networks like Bravo, A&E, TLC and HGTV produced an avalanche of creepy programming catering to the decade's housing bubble alone -- an orgiastic genre that might be called Subprime Pornography. Some of the series -- ''Flip This House,'' ''Flip That House,'' ''Sell This House,'' ''My House Is Worth What?'' -- still play on even as more and more house owners are being flipped into destitute homelessness. 
 The austerity of Obama's Inaugural Address seemed a tonal corrective to the glitz and the glut. The speech was, as my friend Jack Viertel, a theater producer, put it, ''stoic, stern, crafted in slabs of granite, a slimmed-down sinewy thing entirely evolved away from the kind of Pre-Raphaelite style of his earlier oration.'' Some of the same critics who once accused Obama of sounding too much like a wimpy purveyor of Kumbaya now faulted him for not rebooting those golden oldies of the campaign trail as he took his oath. But he is no longer campaigning, and the moment for stadium cheers has passed.
 If we've learned anything since the election, it is this: We have not remotely seen the bottom of this economy, and no one has a silver bullet to arrest the plunge, the hyped brains in the new White House included. Most economists failed to anticipate the disaster, after all, and our tax-challenged incoming Treasury Secretary may prove as evanescent as past saviors du jour. As we applauded Thain in September, we were also desperately trying to convince ourselves that Warren Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs would turn the tide, and that Hank Paulson, as Newsweek wrote in a cover story titled ''King Henry,'' would be the ''right man at the right time.''
 Obama couldn't give us F.D.R.'s first inaugural address because we are not yet where America was in 1933 -- in its fourth year of downturn after the crash of '29, with an unemployment rate of 25 percent. But no one knows for sure that we cannot end up there. 
 On Tuesday, our new president did offer one subtle whiff of the Great Depression. His injunction that ''we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off'' was a paraphrase of the great songwriter Dorothy Fields, who wrote that lyric for ''Swing Time'' (1936), arguably the best of the escapist musicals Hollywood churned out to lift the nation's spirits in hard times. But Obama yoked that light-hearted evocation of Astaire and Rogers to a call for sacrifice that was deliberately somber, not radiantly Kennedyesque.
 That call included the obligatory salutes to those who serve by parenting, firefighting or helping strangers when natural disaster strikes. But he also cited one less generic example: ''workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job.'' There will be -- there must be -- far larger sacrifices in that vein yet to come. No one truly listening to the Inaugural Address could doubt that this former community organizer intends to demand plenty from us as we face down what he calls ''raging storms.''
 Last weekend, Bob Woodward wrote an article for The Washington Post listing all the lessons the new president can learn from his predecessor's many blunders. But what have we learned from our huge mistakes during the Bush years? While it's become a Beltway cliche that America's new young president has yet to be tested, it is past time for us to realize that our own test is also about to begin.

HEADLINE: In Fiscal Balance, a Sisyphus-Like Labor

BYLINE: By GREGORY B. HLADKY

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 IN trying to balance the state budget, Connecticut lawmakers seem to be trapped in a frustrating hike up a mountain, with the constantly deteriorating economy making the climb ever steeper, Gov. M. Jodi Rell said.
 ''It feels like one step ahead, five steps back,'' Mrs. Rell said in her office after hearing new projections that the deficit has grown to nearly $922 million.
 State revenues from income, corporation and sales taxes have plunged with the economy, overwhelming what attempts the governor and lawmakers have already made to cut the deficit. 
 ''I will work with the legislature to ensure that we close this looming budget gap,'' Mrs. Rell said in a statement last week. ''But it is time, past time for the legislature to face this economic storm head on. Lawmakers can no longer cling to false optimism that we can squeak by for one more fiscal year before facing up to any truly difficult financial decisions.'' Part of her frustration is that state lawmakers on Jan. 14 were able to agree on barely $133 million in new deficit trimming measures for the fiscal year that ends June 30. The Democratically controlled General Assembly rejected several of the governor's proposals to deal with what was then a $343 million shortfall.
 They also turned down Mrs. Rell's call to reject a contract arbitration award to state corrections employees and refused Republican proposals to make a symbolic 5 percent cut in legislative salaries.
 The one controversial action they did take was to take unredeemed bottle and can deposits -- estimated at $25 million a year -- away from beverage distributors and use the money to help solve the deficit. 
 Lawmakers' traditional reluctance to cut spending was compounded by uncertainty over plunging revenues and hopes of a federal aid package that might help repair their battered budget. 
 The House majority leader, Denise Merrill, Democrat of Mansfield, said, ''Unraveling would be the word'' to describe the state's fiscal situation. 
 ''It's getting to the point where there's not much we can do,'' Ms. Merrill said. She said that the state has already chopped $500 million from current spending and that additional cuts would cause ''severe disruptions'' in state services at a time when they are needed most.
 Ms. Merrill said she favored using Connecticut's $1.4 billion budget reserve fund to solve the current deficit. ''This is really what it's for, an emergency.''
 But Mrs. Rell, a Republican, believes that ''rainy day fund'' should be saved for dealing with an estimated $6 billion gap between spending and revenue over the next two years.
 The governor is still working on the two-year budget proposal she will present to the legislature on Feb. 4.
 The State Senate's top Democratic leader, Donald E. Williams Jr. of Brooklyn, believes lawmakers should wait to hear what the governor's plans are and for details of the federal aid package to the states expected by the end of February.
 The Senate minority leader, John McKinney, Republican of Fairfield, said the Democrats' wait-and-see attitude ''is an indication to me they don't understand how dangerous it is not to take action to balance the budget now.''
 State Representative Cameron Staples, a New Haven Democrat who is co-chairman of the legislature's Finance Committee, said lawmakers in both parties realize it will take a combination of federal aid, deep spending cuts, borrowing and increased taxes to solve the problems.
 ''But how do we respond without doing worse damage by laying people off or increasing taxes to the point where it's difficult for people to manage?'' he asked.
 He said one likely budget target in the weeks ahead would be the billions of dollars the state now forgoes by offering tax credits and special exemptions to businesses and individuals. Those range from credits to entice moviemakers to shoot films in Connecticut to sales tax exemptions for purchases of clothing under $50.
 Democratic and Republican leaders agree the current budget crisis is even worse than what this state went through in 1991. That was the year a $1 billion deficit forced adoption of a state income tax.
 The House minority leader, Lawrence F. Cafero Jr., Republican of Norwalk, said a major difference today is lawmakers don't have an option of adopting a major new type of tax. 
 Mrs. Rell said many lawmakers seem to be operating as if the usual budget season rules apply, and she pointed to the legislature's rejection of her plans to take millions of dollars from special funds for energy aid, conservation and health programs.
 ''This is not business as usual,'' she said. ''There is no money to add back.''
 Despite the Democrats' rejection of a legislative pay reduction, one Republican lawmaker has decided to go ahead and give the state back 5 percent of his salary.
 ''I feel strongly that, if we're asking people to make sacrifices and we're not sacrificing anything ourselves, that's just not right,'' said the Deputy House minority leader, William A. Hamzy, of Plymouth.

HEADLINE: Obama, in Effort to Build Support, Lays Out Details of $825 Billion Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama, seeking to broaden the appeal of his signature initiative, said Saturday that a proposed $825 billion package of spending programs and tax breaks was crucial not only to turn around the economy but also to rebuild the nation for a new era.
 In his first weekly video address as president, Mr. Obama made the case that the package would help students go to college, protect workers from losing health care, lower energy bills and modernize schools, roads and utilities. 
 ''This is not just a short-term program to boost employment,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's one that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education, health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century.''
 The speech was part of a developing campaign by the White House to build momentum behind the plan and propel it to passage by mid-February. The White House released a report Saturday revealing details about the package, which would pay for a variety of projects, like laying 3,000 miles of transmission lines for a national electric grid, securing 90 major ports and guaranteeing health insurance for 8.5 million Americans in danger of losing coverage.
 The administration plans to press the lobbying effort in coming days. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will appear Sunday on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, and Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, will appear on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. Mr. Obama, who hosted Congressional leaders from both parties on Friday and met with his economic team on Saturday, will visit Capitol Hill in the coming week to talk with Republican lawmakers on their home turf.
 But House Republicans are stiffening their resistance to the magnitude of spending in the plan developed by House Democrats on Mr. Obama's behalf to create or save more than three million jobs. About two-thirds of the $825 billion is reserved for spending and the rest for tax breaks. In the Republican response to the president's address, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader, called for deeper tax cuts instead.
 Mr. Boehner, who will also be on ''Meet the Press,'' pushed a Republican plan to lower federal income tax rates in the two lowest brackets rather than provide a $500 per worker tax credit, as Mr. Obama wants to do. The Republican plan would also give tax breaks to small businesses, home buyers and the unemployed.
 ''Our plan is rooted in the philosophy that we cannot borrow and spend our way back to prosperity,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''Unfortunately, the trillion-dollar spending plan authored by Congressional Democrats is chock-full of government programs and projects, most of which won't provide immediate relief to our ailing economy.''
 Mr. Boehner cited numbers to counter Mr. Obama's, saying the House Democratic plan included $600 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $650 million for digital television coupons and $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. ''All told,'' he said, ''the plan would spend a whopping $275,000 in taxpayer dollars for every new job it aims to create.''
 The White House report offered more detail about how Mr. Obama intended the money to be spent and was released to ''put meat on the bones,'' as one White House National Economic Council official put it. The targets are consistent with the House Democratic legislation, the official said.
 According to the report, the Obama plan would double the generating capacity of renewable energy over three years, enough to power six million American homes. It would retrofit two million homes and 75 percent of all federal buildings to better protect against the weather, saving low-income homeowners an average of $350 a year in utility costs and the government $2 billion a year.
 The White House also envisions using loan guarantees and other financial support to leverage $100 billion in private sector investment in so-called clean energy projects over three years. The plan would lay 3,000 miles of new or upgraded transmission wires for a new electric grid.
 The plan would help 8.5 million Americans keep health care coverage by providing workers who lose insurance with tax credits to pay for continuing coverage under the federal law known as Cobra, and by expanding Medicaid coverage for low-income Americans who lack access to Cobra. The Medicaid formula would be adjusted to protect 20 million Americans whose coverage might be in jeopardy because of state budget shortfalls.
 The plan would modernize 10,000 schools, improve security at 90 ports and build 1,300 wastewater projects. It would bolster Pell Grants to help seven million students and offer a new tax credit for four million college students. And it would increase food stamp benefits for 30 million Americans and increase Social Security benefits $450 for 7.5 million disabled and elderly people.
 In his speech, Mr. Obama said he knew that some worried about the size of his plan. ''I understand that skepticism,'' he said, ''which is why this recovery plan must and will include unprecedented measures that will allow the American people to hold my administration accountable for these results.
 ''We won't just throw money at our problems; we'll invest in what works.''

LENGTH: 1374 words

HEADLINE: A Fumbled Handoff Of the Torch

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS

 BODY:
It was fitting -- or at least symmetrical -- that the inauguration of Barack Obama, with its promise of a new political order, should have coincided with the further decline of the political fortunes of the Kennedy family, who for so long have occupied a dynastic place in the American imagination.
 On Tuesday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, ill with brain cancer, suffered a seizure at the inauguration lunch (he was released from the hospital the next day). And on Thursday, Mr. Kennedy's niece Caroline confirmed, amid a flurry of contradictory rumors and speculation, that she was ending her bid to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 The link between old and new was all the more pronounced because it was these two Kennedys, separated by a generation, who had joined to endorse Mr. Obama's candidacy last winter. 
 It was less a political endorsement than a symbolic anointment. In reality the Kennedys ceased long ago to be the nation's ''first'' political family. For most of the last two decades the Clintons have dominated the Democratic Party as its power couple. And in scorekeeping terms the Republican Bushes have set a new standard for monopolizing high office -- their string of victories now includes three presidential terms, two vice-presidential ones and a pair of governorships in two politically important states (Florida and Texas). 
 By contrast, the Kennedys' hold on high elective office has been relatively modest -- the 1,000 days of John F. Kennedy's presidency, the Senate terms of his two younger brothers, Robert and Edward, along with the careers of other family members that stalled or peaked at lower levels.
 And yet the Kennedys, and they alone, personify a uniquely American form of dynasty. The Clintons and Bushes may have secured the gaudiest political prizes, but even in better economic times it would be hard to imagine either family's artifacts fetching the exorbitant sums -- $574,500 for a humidor, $48,875 for a tape measure, $33,350 for a footstool -- that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's White House memorabilia did when they were auctioned at Sotheby's in 1996.
 The buyers who thronged the auction came in search, it seems fair to surmise, not merely of presidential tokens but of tangible proximity to history itself -- history that transcends the merely political.
 In ways both literal and symbolic the Kennedy family's journey captured the deepest strains of the nation's own transformation. They rose to prominence in the middle decades of the 20th century, when America was rising toward its own ''manifest destiny'' as a superpower. The Kennedys' triumph over immigrant origins and ethnic prejudice, and their deliverance into opulent wealth, distilled the hopes of an era.
 This partly explains why the Kennedy mystique was nurtured even by the family, who learned much from America's one class of homegrown royals, its movie stars. The Kennedy fortune is generally associated with Wall Street. But for Joseph P. Kennedy -- the father of Edward and the grandfather of Caroline -- speculation was only a first step. ''All along he had his eye on a different target: the burgeoning motion picture industry,'' Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote in ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,'' her history of the clan. Joseph Kennedy bought a movie studio, and the public saw more than 100 films that bore the legend ''Joseph P. Kennedy Presents.'' He understood, as Ms. Goodwin put it, that for Americans in the 1920s, ''silent film provided a magnificent world of dreams, allowing them to break away from the toil and drudgery of industrial labor.''
 As President Obama noted in his Inaugural Address, however, American history is written not only in hope and promise, but also in blood and toil, and in sorrow. The Kennedy family has enacted that history too -- indeed has seen two of its sons sacrificed to it, like the scions of ruling families in Greek tragedy.
 Unsurprisingly, this tragic sense has shaped the Kennedys' view of public life. After the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., in April 1968, Robert Kennedy -- who would himself be assassinated two months later -- quoted Aeschylus: ''He who learns must suffer.'' Two years later, in testimony before the President's Commission on Campus Unrest, Edward Kennedy too quoted Aeschylus: ''I pray for no more youth to perish before its prime.''
 No such grandeur attended Ms. Kennedy's monthlong bid for the Senate. From the beginning her mini-campaign, with its many missteps and fumblings, seem mired in confusion.
 Many wondered at the amateurism of a candidate whose family in its prime was unsurpassed at vote-getting, dating to the 1890s, when her ancestors had mastered the bruising arts of Boston ward politics, up through the smoothly tooled operation that swept John F. Kennedy to the presidency in 1960.
 But those victories happened long ago. They belong more to history than to the present-day politics, with its microtargeting and focus groups, its ''brand extension'' and ''outreach.'' In fact, it has been many years since a Kennedy mounted a successful major campaign. 
 Last winter and spring, Mr. Obama's stirring primary performance was often compared with Robert F. Kennedy's in 1968, which also was a crusade, imbued with the passion of what was then called the New Politics. But at the time, Mr. Kennedy, who did not declare until after Eugene McCarthy made a strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, was accused of opportunism. 
 Similar questions beset Edward Kennedy's failed presidential run in 1980. What most remember today is his spellbinding oration at the Democratic convention that year. Those memories were revived when Mr. Kennedy echoed his closing cadenzas in his speech for Mr. Obama at the convention in Denver last summer. But the first speech was made in defeat, after Mr. Kennedy failed to unseat the incumbent, Jimmy Carter, who held every advantage. Even if Mr. Kennedy had won the nomination, ''he would then have to pull the Democratic Party together again and face the Republicans, defending a record he had spent a year denouncing,'' Theodore H. White wrote in 1982. 
 Caroline Kennedy, too, seemed to lunge impulsively for the vacant Senate seat. In her actions, she struck some as imperious and entitled. But it may be instead that she was adhering to a code established by an older generation of Kennedy women -- women like her mother, who accepted their dynastic role without fully embracing politics.
 In 1963, shortly after her husband was murdered, Mrs. Kennedy granted an interview with Mr. White, who had covered the Kennedy election and then written his classic account, ''The Making of the President, 1960.''
 ''Once, the more I read of history the more bitter I got,'' Mrs. Kennedy reflected. Her husband, who in childhood had devoured romantic history books, viewed it very differently. ''For Jack, history was full of heroes. And if it made him this way -- if it made him see the heroes -- maybe other boys will see.''
 For her part, Mrs. Kennedy cherished the flame that burned above her husband's grave in Arlington Cemetery. ''Whenever you drive across the bridge from Washington into Virginia,'' she told Mr. White, ''you see the Lee Mansion in the distance. When Caroline was very little, the mansion was one of the first things she learned to recognize. Now, at night you can see his flame beneath the mansion for miles away.'' 
 When Mrs. Kennedy said this, Caroline Kennedy was 5 years old, and Edward Kennedy was a first-term senator. 
 The fleeting prospect of two of the Kennedy family's survivors being colleagues was tantalizing. The flame of the Kennedy mystique might have glowed a little brighter. The shroud of history might have momentarily lifted.
 But when Caroline Kennedy declared her support for Mr. Obama she looked firmly into the future.
 ''I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them,'' Ms. Kennedy wrote on the New York Times Op-Ed page almost exactly a year ago. ''But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president.'' 
 In those words, two ideas of history -- her father's and her mother's, the romantic and the tragic -- converged.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last week about political succession and the Kennedy family referred incorrectly to the number of sons the family sacrificed to history. It was three, not two. (In referring to two sons, the article was alluding to John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. Their elder brother, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., who was killed in an aviation accident in World War II, should have been included in the number.)

HEADLINE: All Eyes on Washington Jan. 18-24

 BODY:
THE NEWSBarack Hussein Obama was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States on Tuesday as tens of millions of people watched. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas, Mr. Obama inherited a White House built partly by slaves and a nation in crisis at home and abroad. He recited the oath with his hand on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used at his inauguration 148 years ago. Vowing to usher in ''a new era of responsibility,'' Mr. Obama cautioned that the challenges facing the country ''are serious and they are many'' and ''will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America, they will be met.'' 
 THE NEWS On his first full day in office, the president barred officials of his administration from lobbying former colleagues ''for as long as I am president,'' prohibited agencies from hiring anyone who had lobbied the agency in the past two years and ordered all departments to be less resistant to Freedom of Information Act requests. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The steps all broke from practices of the Bush era, when regulatory posts were often filled by industry advocates -- though one of Mr. Obama's own Defense Department nominees apparently needs a waiver. The open-records policy may bring to light information the Bush administration strove to keep from public view.
 THE NEWSTimothy F. Geithner survived his confirmation hearing for Treasury secretary despite tax problems but raised eyebrows when he said that the new administration believed China was ''manipulating'' its currency.
 BEHIND THE NEWS His comment suggested a more confrontational approach to China. Beijing manages its currency in a way that keeps it from appreciating as fast as Western economists think it should. But is China doing so to gain an unfair price edge for its exporters? Beijing says no, and the Bush administration declined to formally accuse China of such ''manipulation,'' which could have led to the imposition of trade barriers by the United States.
 THE NEWS President Obama signed executive orders on Thursday to close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, within a year; to shut down the Central Intelligence Agency's system of secret overseas prisons; and to require that all interrogations of detainees follow the noncoercive methods of the Army Field Manual.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Obama's orders reversed, and implicitly repudiated, measures taken by the Bush administration after Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, in the name of fighting terrorism, that had been bitterly criticized both at home and abroad. ''We intend to win this fight,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We are going to win it on our own terms.''
 THE NEWS The president gave his national security team, including his top generals, a new mission to end the war in Iraq. United States-led forces invaded the country nearly six years ago. 
 BEHIND THE SCENES Mr. Obama promised as a candidate to remove combat troops from Iraq within 16 months. But he held off ordering an exit right away so the military could draw up plans for a ''responsible'' drawdown and review the situation in Afghanistan. He also went to the State Department, where he signaled his intention to use diplomacy to address conflicts. Towards that end, he appointed emissaries to handle the Arab-Israeli conflict and Pakistan and Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: China Jittery About Obama Amid Signs of Harder Line

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Whether it was a shot across the bow or a simple restatement of his boss's views, Timothy F. Geithner's assertion that China ''manipulates'' its currency has complicated a crucial front in President Obama's efforts to improve America's relations with the world.
 China experts here said there were several other signs that the Obama administration could take a harder line toward Beijing, including Mr. Obama's emphasis on climate change and the environment in trade negotiations and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's focus on human rights. 
 The Chinese Ministry of Commerce responded tartly to the charge by Mr. Geithner, Mr. Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary. Su Ning, vice governor of the nation's central bank, said the remarks could ''sidetrack'' efforts to find the real cause and solution to the financial crisis and could revive trade protectionism. A statement from the Ministry of Commerce denied that China had ever used so-called manipulation to gain a foreign trade advantage.
 China starts off on weaker footing with Mr. Obama than it did with his predecessor, George W. Bush. Mr. Bush and his last Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., cultivated Chinese leaders and refused to call Beijing a manipulator. Mr. Obama has little personal experience of China, and lacks senior advisers with a deep interest in or knowledge of the country. With the American economy in a deep slump, and China trying to ramp up its exports to cushion a sharp slowdown there, experts worry that trade relations between the countries could deteriorate.
 If the United States repairs its image in many parts of the world, that could make it harder for the Chinese to present themselves as an alternative to American influence in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere.
 ''The Chinese are probably one of the few people in the world who were sorry to see President Bush go, and are nervous about his successor,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked on China policy for the Clinton administration.
 ''They saw the Inaugural Address as having some uncomfortable elements for them,'' Mr. Lieberthal said. ''They are uneasy about Hillary Clinton. She has, in their assessment, not been a friend of China.''
 The Chinese news media played down the significance of Mr. Geithner's remarks, which were made in writing to the Senate Finance Committee as part of the confirmation process.
 Rather than dwell on or analyze the reference to China's currency, the Chinese official newspaper, The People's Daily, quoted Mr. Geithner as saying that the currency manipulation issue would take a back seat to working with China to alleviate the global financial crisis. The headline said, ''U.S. Treasury secretary-designate vows to deepen U.S.-China economic ties.''
 American experts agree that the United States will have to work closely with China to engineer a global recovery, and the two countries have each embarked on costly programs to stimulate their economies. The Obama administration will also depend on China to continue buying Treasury bills and other government debt to finance its $825 billion recovery package.
 Yet several things could conspire to spoil that cooperation. The Treasury must decide later in the spring whether to label China a currency manipulator, under a law that requires the administration to report to Congress twice a year on the exchange rate practices of trading partners.
 In his written response, Mr. Geithner appeared to leave the administration plenty of wiggle room. ''The question is how and when to broach the subject in order to do more good than harm,'' he said.
 But as a candidate, Mr. Obama took a tough line on China's practices, saying that Beijing pegged its currency at an artificially low rate and pledging to use diplomatic means to force a change.
 ''This is not good for American firms and workers, not good for the world, and ultimately likely to produce inflation problems in China itself,'' Mr. Obama said in a campaign essay for the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
 Advocates for closer ties said they worried that unless the administration developed an overall framework for the relationship, individual events like the Treasury report could dictate the atmosphere.
 It is not clear that such a framework exists. Mrs. Clinton was careful to steer clear of currency issues in her testimony to the Senate. In that testimony, she demurred on the question of whether the Obama administration would continue the ''strategic economic dialogue,'' a semiannual meeting on economic issues between the two countries that was led by Mr. Paulson.
 Mrs. Clinton does not have the same extensive history with China that she has had with other countries. She is best known there for a speech she gave in 1995 in Beijing about women's rights, and some China experts said they worried that her positions on trade and human rights could be a problem. Mr. Obama's focus on energy and climate change, experts said, could cut both ways. If China and the United States could find ways to cooperate on stemming the growth of greenhouse gases, it could become the cornerstone of the relationship. If not, it could be dangerously disruptive.
 Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington, said the financial crisis had upended many of the assumptions about the relationship.
 China's currency, he noted, has increased in value in recent months because it is pegged to the dollar, which has risen as investors fled to safe investments. China's trade surplus with the United States has stopped growing, as American consumers stop buying so many Chinese imports.
 C. Fred Bergsten, the Peterson institute's director, said Mr. Geithner had another target in mind with his remark.
 ''It was a shot across the bow of Congress,'' he said. ''The administration is saying, 'We will be tougher on the Chinese on trade, so you don't need to pass protectionist legislation.' ''

HEADLINE: Money Manager

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
As the former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is supposed to protect the American people from investment fraud, how do you feel when you look at the current economic landscape and see 401(k)'s going up in smoke? I feel saddened. I feel saddened that so many people have been hurt; that, on reflection, we've all acted foolishly. We've spent too much money on too many frivolous things. 
 How could a journalist spend too much money? That defies logic. You have changed your spending habits. 
 Have you changed yours? Yes. I canceled a vacation to the Far East that I had planned for the spring. I don't feel right about spending large sums of money in this environment. 
 As the chief of the S.E.C. under Clinton, are you kicking yourself for not having caught Madoff at his game? I believe that our commission was the most investor-friendly in the history of America. Bernie Madoff was simply not on our screen, except as a leading market maker.
 In 2000, you put Madoff on an advisory committee, presumably because he was a pioneer of electronic trading. The S.E.C. had perhaps 14 committees to evaluate a variety of issues. Madoff served on one dealing with market structure. At that time, his reputation was as a trader, not a money manager.
 How would you describe him, personality-wise? He was intelligent and gentlemanly with a certain amount of charm. He smiled easily, rarely lost his temper and was a good listener. 
 Did you happen to notice that photograph of him, where he is posed in front of a series of Roy Lichtenstein lithographs of bulls? You see a bull in every Wall Street office. People on the Street tend to be aggressive, macho, positive.
 The other meaning of bull has lately seemed more pertinent, I'm sorry to say. Unfortunately, history seems to prove you correct. 
 After you left your S.E.C. post, what led you to become an adviser to the Carlyle Group, the investment firm known for its ties to the Bush family and defense contracting? That's such a Michael Moore-like exaggeration. I was an adviser to the Carlyle Group before I went to Washington as well. I'm proud of their intelligence, professionalism and business ethics.
 Frankly, I can't understand why the S.E.C. culls its leaders from the world of high-stakes investment. What about what economists call the ''capture theory,'' whereby regulators become co-opted by the industries they regulate? The 4,100 people who worked for me at the S.E.C. were as patriotic as anyone I served with in the U.S. Air Force or the several government commissions I've served on, and I've worked for four presidents.
 That's just boosterism. You're not answering the question. The European system of gray bureaucrats running government agencies forever is far less effective than the refreshing American system of repotting private-sector talent to bring in new ideas. 
 Your father, Arthur Levitt Sr., was the New York State comptroller for more than 20 years. Yes, he was fiercely passionate about protecting the interests of pensioners. My mother was a schoolteacher for 38 years. 
 You grew up in Brooklyn, in the years following the Great Depression. We lived with my grandparents. My grandfather was so thrifty that every time a light bulb burned out, he'd place it in a bushel basket. When the next bulb burned out, the basket would come out and he would try every one of maybe 75 burned-out bulbs to see if one might possibly work. That's a story you ought to use. 
 I'm using it. It's in. Do you ever feel as if you should apologize? For what?
 Does anything keep you up at night? Indigestion.

HEADLINE: Can social networking turn disaffected young Egyptians into a force for democratic change?

BYLINE: By SAMANTHA M. SHAPIRO. 
Samantha M. Shapiro is a contributing writer who frequently reports for the magazine from the Middle East.

 BODY:
Only a few hours after Israel's first air strike against Hamas positions in the Gaza Strip late last month, more than 2,000 protesters marched through the streets of downtown Cairo, carrying Palestinian flags. This began what would become weeks of protests, in which thousands of Egyptians of all different political leanings gathered in Egypt's main cities, in public squares and at mosques and universities. Hundreds were arrested. In every city, the biggest presence at the protests was the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political organization, active in many countries throughout the Middle East, that seeks to govern according to Islamic law. Other, smaller demonstrations were put together, sometimes spontaneously, by leftist groups and student organizations.
 Anti-Israel demonstrations in Arab capitals are nothing new. From Amman to Riyadh, governments have long viewed protests against Israel as a useful safety valve to allow citizens to let off steam without addressing grievances closer to home. But in Egypt, this time, the protests were different: some of the anger was aimed directly at the government of President Hosni Mubarak. In defiance of threats from the police, and in contravention of a national taboo, some demonstrators chanted slogans against Mubarak, condemning his government for maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel, for exporting natural gas to the country and for restricting movement through Egypt's border with Gaza. 
 As the street protests went on, young Egyptians also were mobilizing and venting their anger over Gaza on what would, until recently, have seemed an unlikely venue: Facebook, the social-networking site. In most countries in the Arab world, Facebook is now one of the 10 most-visited Web sites, and in Egypt it ranks third, after Google and Yahoo. About one in nine Egyptians has Internet access, and around 9 percent of that group are on Facebook -- a total of almost 800,000 members. This month, hundreds of Egyptian Facebook members, in private homes and at Internet cafes, have set up Gaza-related ''groups.'' Most expressed hatred for Israel and the United States, but each one had its own focus. Some sought to coordinate humanitarian aid to Gaza, some criticized the Egyptian government, some criticized other Arab countries for blaming Egypt for the conflict and still others railed against Hamas. When I sat down in the middle of January with an Arabic-language translator to look through Facebook, we found one new group with almost 2,000 members called ''I'm sure I can find 1,000,000 members who hate Israel!!!'' and another called ''With all due respect, Gaza, I don't support you,'' which blamed Palestinian suffering on Hamas and lamented the recent shooting of two Egyptian border guards, which had been attributed to Hamas fire. Another group implored God to ''destroy and burn the hearts of the Zionists.'' Some Egyptian Facebook users had joined all three groups. 
 Freedom of speech and the right to assemble are limited in Egypt, which since 1981 has been ruled by Mubarak's National Democratic Party under a permanent state-of-emergency law. An estimated 18,000 Egyptians are imprisoned under the law, which allows the police to arrest people without charges, allows the government to ban political organizations and makes it illegal for more than five people to gather without a license from the government. Newspapers are monitored by the Ministry of Information and generally refrain from directly criticizing Mubarak. And so for young people in Egypt, Facebook, which allows users to speak freely to one another and encourages them to form groups, is irresistible as a platform not only for social interaction but also for dissent.
 Although there are countless political Facebook groups in Egypt, many of which flare up and fall into disuse in a matter of days, the one with the most dynamic debates is that of the April 6 Youth Movement, a group of 70,000 mostly young and educated Egyptians, most of whom had never been involved with politics before joining the group. The movement is less than a year old; it formed more or less spontaneously on Facebook last spring around an effort to stage a general nationwide strike. Members coalesce around a few issues -- free speech, economic stagnation and government nepotism -- and they share their ideas for improving Egypt. But they do more than just chat: they have tried to organize street protests to free jailed journalists, and this month, hundreds of young people from the April 6 group participated in demonstrations about Gaza, some of which were coordinated on Facebook, and at least eight members of the group were detained by police. 
 As with any group on Facebook, members can post comments or share news articles, videos or notes on the group's communal ''wall.'' The wall of the April 6 group is constantly being updated with new posts, and the talk is often heated and intense. On a recent afternoon, members were discussing photographs that had just been posted on the Muslim Brotherhood Web site of a mass protest in Alexandria against Israel's actions in Gaza, in which thousands of members of the brotherhood took to the streets.
 ''They are real men!'' posted a young woman using the alias Mona Liza.
 ''Something like this should happen in Cairo,'' another member typed. ''People should go to the streets of Cairo until the Jewish crusaders' government falls.''
 Another member dissented: ''We need strong actions, not protests like the brotherhood's where they sing religious songs and go home.'' 
 Ahmed Maher, a 28-year-old engineer who is one of the group's unofficial leaders, weighed in. ''There are ideas about a big protest for Gaza right now,'' he wrote. The April 6 group should join that protest, he agreed, but ''we should link it to our demands, which are of course different from other peoples' demands, like those of the brotherhood.'' It was a crucial point: unlike many protest groups in Egypt that were angry about Gaza, Maher saw Gaza as a way to stoke and focus discontent against Mubarak and his government. Maher saw Egypt's relationship with Israel as one symptom of a larger set of problems -- censorship, corruption, joblessness and government incompetence -- whose solution would lie not in resistance in Gaza but in democratization at home. ''We should link politics with economic and social problems to show that our suffering is caused by a corrupt regime,'' Maher wrote.
 The fact that tens of thousands of disaffected young Egyptians unhappy with their government meet online to debate and plan events is remarkable, given the context of political repression in which it is occurring. Organized groups opposed to Mubarak's National Democratic Party have long lived under constant surveillance by the government; their leaders are regularly jailed. As a result, most Egyptian opposition groups remain small and are often plagued by infighting. And although about a third of Egypt's population is between 15 and 29, young Egyptians have for years been politically disengaged. A 2004 study by the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies found that 67 percent of young people weren't registered to vote, and 84 percent had never participated in a public demonstration. 
 In its official statement, the April 6 movement takes pains to emphasize that it isn't a political party. But the movement has provided a structure for a new generation of Egyptians, who aren't part of the nation's small coterie of activists and opinion-makers, to assemble virtually and communicate freely about their grievances. When I spoke earlier this month to Samer Shehata, an assistant professor of Arab politics at Georgetown University, he said that it was no surprise that young Egyptians have chosen to put their political energy into a group that is not part of the Egyptian political process. ''The state of the opposition in Egypt is so pathetic that existing parties have lost all credibility,'' he told me. ''They've been around for a long time and produced nothing.'' The April 6 Facebook group, he said, ''has credibility because it hasn't sold out to the regime or played the pathetic, limited game of politics the regime engages in.'' 
 ON A THURSDAY AFTERNOON last fall, I made my way to a Cinnabon cafe in Nasr City, a well-to-do district of Cairo, to meet with one of the founders of the April 6 Facebook group, a 30-year-old woman named Esraa Abdel Fattah Ahmed Rashid, who works as a training coordinator for a company that makes Islamic DVDs. The Cinnabon was subdued: a few pairs of young women and one or two married couples were scattered around the seating area with open laptops and frothy, sweet drinks. Sean Paul's ''Temperature'' played at a tasteful volume, low enough that the dance-hall lyrics about ''the right tactics to turn you on'' were nearly indecipherable. Rashid was wearing a meticulously coordinated outfit: brown pants, sandals, T-shirt, eyeliner and a baby blue tunic with overlapping light blue and brown head scarves. 
 Rashid has a round face, a high-pitched voice and a plucky sense of determination -- Reese Witherspoon in a hijab. Her husband works in Dubai most of the year, and while he is away, she lives with her mother. She originally joined Facebook to keep up with friends; she joined groups for fans of the Egyptian singer Mohammed Mounir and the national soccer team, another for discussions of the Koran and others that offered updates on the latest styles in pajamas and modest wedding dresses. But her relationship with Facebook evolved in ways she could not have predicted. Last spring, the general strike that Rashid and her friends organized on Facebook landed her in jail, on talk shows and in newspapers around Egypt and abroad. She was now widely known around Egypt -- even by people who didn't use the Internet -- as the Facebook Girl, and she told me that she was logged into the site pretty much any time she wasn't working or sleeping. (Like most of the Internet activists I met in Egypt, Rashid spoke little English, and we communicated mostly through an interpreter.) 
 The April 6 movement has its roots in Egypt's brief burst of political freedom in 2005 and 2006, which came after the Bush administration put pressure on the Mubarak regime to hold its first multiparty election. Although the election was far from free, it created new opportunities for activists to organize and demonstrate, and out of the campaign a loose coalition of socialist, leftist and Islamist groups emerged called Kefaya (''enough'' in Arabic). They focused on direct action and rarely discussed ideology, but they were united on one issue: that Hosni Mubarak should not be allowed to transfer power to his son Gamal. Kefaya organized street protests to pressure Mubarak to step down, hold free elections and allow the Egyptian judiciary to remain independent. Some demonstrations attracted as many as 10,000 people.
 This flare-up of political activity coincided with the moment Egyptians were starting to gain access to the Internet in large numbers. Home computers and Internet cafes were becoming more popular, and the cost of getting online was dropping, thanks to a government initiative intended to encourage technological innovation in Egypt. The new technologies and political movements grew symbiotically. Shortly before Kefaya started, Wael Abbas, who is now one of Egypt's most influential bloggers, set up a Web site called Egyptian Awareness, and it quickly became the main source of information on Kefaya's activities, which were largely ignored by the state-run media. 
 Abbas and a few other early adopters of blog technology worked simultaneously as political advocates and crusading journalists. In 2006, Abbas posted cellphone-video footage of a police officer sodomizing a screaming minibus driver with an iron rod, which ultimately led to the officer's conviction. Another prominent blogger and friend of Abbas's, a woman in her early 30s named Nora Younis, posted stories about sexual harassment of women who participated in street demonstrations, which helped spur Egypt's mainstream media to cover the issue. (Younis worked briefly for The New York Times as a stringer.) Political blogs became essential reading for opposition parties; in 2005, Al Dustur, a weekly paper opposed to the regime, started a blog page, which reprinted important posts for readers without Internet access. 
 During the 2005 election campaign, Esraa Rashid started volunteering at the headquarters of El Ghad, a liberal democratic party that was founded in 2004 by Ayman Nour, a wealthy lawyer and member of Parliament. Nour came in second in the election, behind Mubarak, with 7 percent of the vote; he is currently in jail for forgery charges that his supporters insist are bogus. Rashid told me that she loved working at the Ghad office, but she and some of her friends in the youth wing grew impatient with the party bureaucracy. Like most political parties in Egypt, El Ghad has a strict hierarchy, and before deciding to stage an event, the leaders would carefully weigh a number of factors, including internal office politics and their current standing with the Mubarak regime. Members of the youth wing, Rashid told me, didn't have much say in that process, or much interest in the endless deliberations. So she and some friends turned to Facebook as a quicker, easier way to plan their own events and protests. Rashid's first foray into using Facebook for organizing was to coordinate a small demonstration around the opening of a movie about corruption and torture called ''Heya Fawda'' or ''This Is Chaos.'' Rashid invited all her friends on Facebook to the event; they invited more friends; and in the end, about 100 people showed up. To Rashid, the event was a huge success; exhilarated, she and friends from El Ghad planned a few more events the same way.
 THEN LAST MARCH, Rashid got a text message on her phone from Maher, the 28-year-old engineer and activist, suggesting that young Egyptians should do something to support the workers in Mahalla al-Kobra, an industrial town, who were planning to strike on April 6. For more than a year, workers around Egypt had been striking, periodically, to protest high rates of inflation and unemployment, but they never coordinated their protests. Rashid and Maher met when they were both part of the Ghad youth wing, but Maher had left the party to devote himself more fully to the youth movement of Kefaya. Unlike Rashid, he had been active in street protests and had been arrested. Rashid loved the idea of doing something to support the workers, and she called Maher immediately. She suggested they create an open group on Facebook to brainstorm ideas. On March 23, Rashid set up the April 6 Strike group on Facebook with herself and Maher as administrators. 
 Rashid expected this protest would develop more or less like her movie outing. But almost as soon as she set up the group, there were 16 members; when she refreshed the page a few minutes later, there were more than 60. The next day, more than 1,000. Rashid watched with fear and excitement as thousands of people, then tens of thousands, started joining and posting to the group. Eventually, the number reached 76,000. As the group's administrators, she and Maher could approve messages as they were posted, and it was their responsibility to delete spam or inappropriate posts; the two took turns monitoring the site day and night. 
 The group never developed a unified plan of action for April 6. Rashid initially proposed that people stay home and not buy anything in solidarity with the workers -- unless they weren't afraid of protesting, in which case they should take to the streets. One girl suggested that everyone who protested on the street should give flowers to the security forces to disarm them, an idea Rashid supported. Maher started sending so many messages to the group that Facebook canceled his account; the site's automated filters presumed him to be a spammer. That left Rashid as the group's sole administrator. As the April 6 group grew, its call for a strike was endorsed by a variety of groups -- political parties, labor groups, the Muslim Brotherhood, student organizations, the Kefaya movement. On the streets, supporters handed out leaflets and sprayed graffiti to make non-Internet users aware of the action. 
 Members who identified themselves as government security agents joined the April 6 group, too, posting comments under the insignia of the Egyptian police, and as April 6 approached, the government issued a strong warning against participation in the strike. Rashid told me that she was scared to go out on the street that day. She would have stayed home, she said, but she felt she owed it to all the people she'd been communicating with to come out. She posted her plans on Facebook; on the day of the strike, she said, she'd meet people at the Kentucky Fried Chicken in Tahrir Square downtown. She told people what she'd be wearing and gave out her cellphone number.
 On April 6 in Mahalla, thousands of workers rioted, tearing down a Mubarak billboard. There were many arrests and at least three deaths. When Rashid headed out toward Tahrir Square, she was shocked to see police and military vehicles blocking off streets; soldiers and police officers, it seemed, were everywhere. As Rashid approached the Kentucky Fried Chicken, she found it was surrounded by police. She called some friends and told them to meet her at a nearby cafe to decide what to do next. Police swept in and arrested Rashid at the cafe; they took her to jail, where she stayed for more than two weeks. 
 Rashid was not prepared for a jail term. She had never been away from her mother for even a day without checking in, and although her mother knew she did clerical work for El Ghad, she had no idea that Rashid had been involved in organizing a general strike. Rashid's mother was beside herself, and she appeared on TV, begging the authorities to release her daughter. 
 While Rashid was in prison, members of the April 6 Strike Facebook group replaced their profile pictures with an image of Rashid with the words ''Free Esraa!'' printed below. And when Egypt's prime minister, Ahmed Nazif, came to speak at Cairo University about the government's technology initiatives, a 20-year-old member of the April 6 group named Blal Diab stood up and heckled him, urging him to free Rashid and other jailed activists from the April 6 movement. ''They are the same young people who used the Internet to express their opinions!'' he yelled, to thunderous applause. (One of Diab's friends captured the whole thing on his cellphone, and the video was shared widely over YouTube and on blogs.) 
 Rashid's release from prison was shown on live television, and it was quite a show. She ran out the door of the jail into her mother's arms, wailing. An unbelievable amount of screaming and crying ensued. Rashid's mother tilted her face to the sky and issued a continuous stream of praise and thanks to Allah. Rashid said, tearfully, that she didn't expect that posting on the Internet would get her sent to jail, and that if she'd known what would happen, she wouldn't have done it. ''They treated me well!'' she sobbed. ''They let me remain a girl. I missed you, Mom. I prayed to God every day.'' 
 When Rashid started playing the video on her laptop for me, she had to get up and walk away. Watching it still makes her cry. 
 ETHAN ZUCKERMAN, a research fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, told me that the April 6 movement illustrates what he calls the ''cute-cat theory of digital activism.'' Web sites or proxy servers created specifically for activists are easy for a government to shut down, Zuckerman says, but around the world, dissidents thrive on sites, like Facebook, that are used primarily for more mundane purposes (like exchanging pictures of cute cats). Authoritarian regimes can't block political Facebook groups without blocking all the ''American Idol'' fans and cat lovers as well. ''The government can't simply shut down Facebook, because doing so would alert a large group of people who they can't afford to radicalize,'' Zuckerman explained.
 When I spoke to Wael Nawara, a 47-year-old Ghad activist who is a co-founder of the party, he explained why, for him, getting on Facebook was such a big eye-opener. If you look at Egyptian politics on the surface, he said, you might think that the Muslim Brotherhood is the only alternative to the Mubarak regime. But ''Facebook revealed a liberal undercurrent in Egyptian society,'' Nawara said. ''In general, there's this kind of apathy, a sense that there is nothing we can do to change the situation. But with Facebook you realize there are others who think alike and share the same ideals. You can find Islamists there, but it is really dominated by liberal voices.'' 
 Interestingly, young Islamists in Egypt have also started blogging in ways that challenge their elders, often posting critical comments about the senior leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the past, this kind of internal dialogue was suppressed by the brotherhood's leadership, or at least hidden from view, since the brotherhood's newspapers were outlawed. But the official leaders of the brotherhood and younger malcontents have both found a happy home on the Internet. Abdel Monem Mahmoud, one of the most prominent young Muslim Brotherhood bloggers, recently wrote a scathing critique of an article by a brotherhood leader arguing that all politicians must be devoted Muslims. And when the brotherhood circulated a draft of a political platform -- the first step toward becoming an official political party -- a 28-year-old brotherhood member named Mustafa Naggar used his blog to publish critiques of the platform's prohibition against electing women or Coptic Christians to the presidency. 
 A somewhat-grudging alliance has developed among some of the young Islamist bloggers and their secular-liberal compatriots over issues of free speech and the rights of opposition parties. I met Naggar one afternoon in a Cairo coffee shop just after he had recited the midday prayer. He told me Wael Abbas and Nora Younis's blogs are required reading for him; he visits them every day to stay current, although, he said, it really bothers him that Abbas often uses curse words in his posts. When I spoke to Asmaa Aly, a feminist blogger, she said that she was put off by the practice of many brotherhood members never to touch women other than their wives. ''I could never be friends with someone who won't shake my hand!'' she said emphatically. But she added that if a brotherhood blogger was jailed, she would definitely show up for a protest. 
 In Washington, there is increasing interest in the April 6 Youth Movement. James Glassman, the outgoing under secretary of state for public diplomacy, told me he followed the group closely. ''It's not easy in Egypt, and in other countries in the Middle East, to form robust civil-society organizations,'' he said. ''And in a way that's what these groups are doing, although they're certainly unconventional.'' 
 Other State Department officials told me they believe that social-networking software like Facebook's has the potential to become a powerful pro-democracy tool. They pointed to recent developments in Saudi Arabia, where in November a Facebook group helped organize a national hunger strike against the kingdom's imprisonment of political opponents, and in Colombia, where activists last February used Facebook to organize one of the largest protests ever held in that country, a nationwide series of demonstrations against the FARC insurgency. Not long ago, the State Department created its own group on Facebook called ''Alliance of Youth Movements,'' a coalition of groups from a dozen countries who use Facebook for political organizing. Last month, they brought an international collection of young online political activists, including one from the April 6 group, as well as Facebook executives and representatives from Google and MTV, to New York for a three-day conference. 
 IN RECENT MONTHS, Ahmed Maher has edged Rashid out of the leadership role they initially shared. When she was in jail, Rashid gave Maher the password to be the administrator of the April 6 Facebook group. He changed it, and ever since, he has declined to tell her the new password. Soon after Rashid was released from jail, she was married and left for her honeymoon. In May, Maher says, state-security officers picked him up and beat him intermittently for 12 hours to try to get him to give up the password for the Facebook group. Abbas posted pictures of Maher's bruised back on his blog, and an opposition newspaper printed Maher's account of the incident. Maher and other April 6 members set up a variety of steering groups for the movement, each of which is also on Facebook; using the wall, steering-group members discuss and vote on the direction the movement should go next. The new steering groups are not open to everyone, as the original group is, and Rashid has not been invited to join. 
 Some Egyptian bloggers and activists told me they resented Rashid's emotional display when she was released from jail -- particularly the fact that she said she wouldn't have organized the protest if she'd known she would be arrested for it. (Rashid later recanted that apology at a meeting of the April 6 group; she quoted a lyric from a Mohammed Mounir song: ''I didn't need to repent; loving Egypt is not a sin.'') Abbas told me that other female activists, including the blogger Asmaa Aly, had been arrested before -- Aly spent a month in jail in 2006 for participating in a Kefaya-organized sit-in for judicial independence -- and when they were released, they didn't cry or apologize. 
 ''What the hell was she saying?'' Abbas asked, referring to Rashid's televised apology. ''The girl is chicken. I am sorry to say stuff like that, but people are going to think that everyone who is active online is chicken like her. We are in the streets taking videos and photos. We aren't only sitting in our bedroom in our pajamas.'' (Once, looking at Rashid's Facebook profile with her, I pointed out that Facebook's software had included Wael Abbas on her page, under a tab labeled ''People You May Know.'' Rashid looked at his picture and shook her head. ''We will not be friends,'' she said firmly.)
 Ahmed Maher and a number of his friends in the activist-blogger community spoke with respect about what Rashid had accomplished, but they agreed with Abbas that she didn't have the right stuff to run the movement. Some activists working with Maher questioned her lack of experience and said it wouldn't be appropriate for a woman to lead the group, given that the government had tortured Ahmed Maher and sent Rashid to prison once already.
 Rashid says she is not happy about any of this. When she and I met in early October, she said that a month earlier, at the beginning of Ramadan, she told Maher he had until the end of the holiday to give her back the password. Now Ramadan had just ended. ''The longer he takes, the more forceful my response will be,'' she said fiercely.
 It was in many ways the unideological, unedited voice that Rashid represented -- someone who described herself as ''a girl who loves Egypt'' and who thought giving flowers to the police might be a good idea -- that attracted people to the April 6 movement in such numbers. Young people were drawn to the fact that the movement wasn't part of Egypt's calcified party politics. (''I am involved in no parties, never,'' one teenage boy told me at a protest. ''I just go to Facebook events, wherever they are. I'm in the Facebook Party.'') But for April 6 to keep growing, some say, that may have to change. As Amr Hamzawy, an Egyptian political scientist who is currently a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me: ''Just saying you are against Mubarak automatically gets a certain number of people behind you, but it's not enough. Kefaya wasn't capable and ready for the next step. They needed to put forth a positive platform as well as a critique of Mubarak in order to move beyond the base of elites in Cairo. April 6 will have to do this. It will have to become more organized in order to succeed where Kefaya failed.''
 THE APRIL 6 STRIKE was a success partly because it had its roots offline, among a cohesive, organized group of laborers; their protest was then vastly amplified by the Facebook activists. A number of the events created last summer and fall by the April 6 Youth Movement did not succeed in the same way. Protests were typically attended by only a few dozen of the group's supporters and often shut down by the police before they even began. Back in July, Maher tried to organize a ''flash mob'' on the beach in Alexandria that would sing patriotic songs and fly a kite with the Egyptian flag painted on it. But on the day of the protest, Maher and his crew of about 30 young people were stopped by the police before they were even able to finish unfurling their kite.
 This month, as the university exam period began to cut into members' free time, the group's involvement in Gaza protests seemed to diminish. The decline in turnout led to a flurry of accusations, reflections and recriminations on Facebook. On Jan. 10, a young woman named Asmaa Mahfouz posted an angry screed on the April 6 site titled, ''Are you all fed up, or what?'' She accused members of opting out of protests because they thought things couldn't change, no matter how many strikes and demonstrations were organized. ''Is this a reasonable way of thinking???!!!'' she wrote, punctuation marks flying. ''Is it reasonable???? No, no, no, nooooo, absolutely not!''
 A young man named Mahmoud Dahshan Ahmed replied that he thought the group needed to coordinate with the Muslim Brotherhood if they were to have an impact. ''Frankly, I am fed up,'' he wrote. ''What is the point of us demonstrating and marching from noon till 6 p.m., when nothing ever changes?''
 By organizing online, the April 6 movement avoids some of the pitfalls of party politics in Egypt -- censorship, bureaucracy, compromise with the regime. But whenever the movement's members try to migrate offline, they find they are still playing by Egypt's rules. They almost never meet in real life, certainly not in large groups, and when they do, the police often show up.
 Online, members of the movement are casting votes on the Web site's walls, publishing notes with their views on the political situation and creating groups to draft a constitution for their movement. But what does it mean to have a vibrant civil society on your computer screen and a police state in the street? When I spoke to Nora Younis, she described the April 6 strike as a practice session for the new generation. ''It's a rehearsal for a bigger thing,'' she said. ''Right now, we are just testing the power of each other.''

HEADLINE: Bill Gates's Next Big Thing

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
 Here's a paradox: In these brutal economic times, one of the leading advocates for the world's poorest people is one of the richest.
 Bill Gates will publish his first ''annual letter'' on Monday outlining his work on his twin passions -- health and development in the poorest nations and education in America -- and calling for the United States to do more even during this economic crisis. I came here to Seattle for an advance peek at the letter and to ask how he is adjusting to his transition from tycoon to philanthropist.
 Mr. Gates ended his full-time presence at Microsoft last July and since then has thrown himself into work at his foundation. He is now trying to do to malaria, AIDS, polio and lethal childhood diarrhea what he did to Netscape, and he just may succeed. 
 He does seem to be going through withdrawal, for software engineering was his passion. ''I miss that,'' he said, but added that he is becoming equally maniacal (that's his word) about poverty and education.
 Mr. Gates and his wife, Melinda, are already having an effect on the developing world that is simply transformative. Just one of their investments, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, has saved more than three million lives since 2000. 
 That's a down payment. 
 In 1960, almost 20 million children died annually before age 5, Mr. Gates notes. There are more children today, yet the death toll has been halved to under 10 million annually. Now his goal is to see it halved again, saving an additional five million children's lives annually.
 ''We're on the verge of some big advances,'' Mr. Gates said. In particular, a promising malaria vaccine will enter its final phase of human trials this year, with others behind it. Mr. Gates said he is ''absolutely confident'' that a successful malaria vaccine will be achieved, probably within a half dozen years, and an AIDS vaccine 10 or more years from now. 
 Look, I'm a cynical journalist, and I don't want to sound too infatuated. I think the Gates Foundation has missed the chance to leverage the revolution in social entrepreneurship, hasn't been as effective in advocacy as it has been in research, and has missed an opportunity to ignite a broad social movement behind its issues. 
 But if Mr. Gates manages to accomplish as much in the world of vaccines, health and food production as he thinks he can, then the consequences will be staggering. Squared. In that case, the first few paragraphs of Mr. Gates's obituary will be all about overcoming diseases and poverty, barely mentioning his earlier career in the software industry.
 Mr. Gates said he got the idea for an annual letter from Warren Buffett, who writes such a letter ruminating about investments and the business world. (You can sign up to get Mr. Gates's letter, or read it beginning Monday, at www.gatesfoundation.org.)
 In the letter, Mr. Gates goes out of his way to acknowledge setbacks. For example, the Gates Foundation made a major push for smaller high schools in the United States, often helping to pay for the creation of small schools within larger buildings. 
 ''Many of the small schools that we invested in did not improve students' achievement in any significant way,'' he acknowledges. Small schools succeeded when the principal was able to change teachers, curriculum and culture, but smaller size by itself proved disappointing. ''In most cases,'' he says, ''we fell short.''
 Mr. Gates comes across as a strong education reformer, focusing on supporting charter schools and improving teacher quality. He suggested that when he has nailed down the evidence more firmly, he will wade into the education debates.
 ''It is amazing how big a difference a great teacher makes versus an ineffective one,'' Mr. Gates writes in his letter. ''Research shows that there is only half as much variation in student achievement between schools as there is among classrooms in the same school. If you want your child to get the best education possible, it is actually more important to get him assigned to a great teacher than to a great school.''
 Mr. Gates told me he was optimistic that President Obama would make progress on these issues, notwithstanding the economic crisis, and he noted that the downturn had only added to the need for foreign assistance and education spending. ''The poorer you are, the worse the impact is,'' he said.
 I asked Mr. Gates what advice he had for ordinary readers who might want to engage in micro-philanthropy.
 ''The key thing is to pick a cause, whether its crops or diseases or great high schools,'' he said. ''Pick one and get some more in-depth knowledge.'' If possible, travel to see the problems firsthand, then pick an organization to support with donations or volunteer time.
 So try it. The only difference between you and Mr. Gates is scale.

HEADLINE: Of War, Peace and Paying Customers

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
NO theatrical event of 2008 captured the political mood of the country quite like the Public Theater's hit revival of the Vietnam-era rock musical ''Hair'' in Central Park last summer. Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain were sparring daily about whether to withdraw troops from Iraq; ''Hair'' and its antiwar anthems gave voice not only to the anger that many people felt about the 2003 invasion, but also to the hopes that many of them had invested in Mr. Obama.
 He is President Obama now, and soon both he and the country will come to a reckoning point in Iraq, as his administration prepares to withdraw tens of thousands of troops over the next 16 months. And the New York theater world is reflecting that national moment, just as the Public did with ''Hair,'' by mounting several significant productions this winter and spring that wrestle with themes of war, its legacy, and responsibility and accountability. 
 But will theatergoers continue to be interested in issues raised by war? Given Americans' exhaustion with the war in Iraq, and the departure of President Bush, not to mention the nation's dire economic landscape, will there be a demand for war plays? Once again, ''Hair'' may prove to be a reflection of a national mood: the producers are transferring it to Broadway in early March, and they have had difficulty lining up investors to cover costs (a deepening recession is, of course, also a factor). Will audiences stay away?
 Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, is confident they will come. ''What we need is to imagine ways to move beyond being a war country, in a sense to redeem ourselves,'' Mr. Eustis said. ''What that requires, on our part, is more theater that gives hope.''
 Several other theater producers and artistic directors echoed his desire for exploring war through a prism of hopefulness, but they were torn about whether productions that deal directly with Iraq and Afghanistan, or with Israel and the Palestinians, would appeal to wide audiences.
 ''I actually feel like people are looking for other ways to respond to what is going on politically,'' said Sarah Benson, who last fall directed Sarah Kane's critically acclaimed play ''Blasted,'' about two lovers and a soldier caught in a civil war. ''I moved here in 2002 and sensed a strong feeling of political helplessness, which intensified until the recent election. We're all products of our environment, of course, and what's going on in the world creates the choices we make artistically.''
 Recent war-themed productions have largely zeroed in on matters of moral, social or familial accountability and obligations, some subtly and some through more overt methods. And while a few of the shows have received critical praise, most were not commercial successes. 
 ''The response you most often receive if you're foolish enough to tell a producer that you're thinking of writing a war play is, 'Oh, none of the good Vietnam movies came out until after the war was over -- a writer needs distance,' '' said Stephen Belber, a playwright and director, whose Iraq-themed play ''The Geometry of Fire'' drew positive reviews but not the commercial producers who could have kept it running. 
 Mr. Belber's play, as well as ''Prayer for My Enemy,'' ''The Language of Trees'' and the revival of Arthur Miller's ''All My Sons,'' all considered the effect of a family member's wartime experiences on his loved ones. The revival of David Rabe's ''Streamers'' dealt with the bonds among soldiers. ''Silent Heroes,'' a play about a group of military wives waiting to learn which one of their husbands has died, is an extended argument about the morality of both war and the warriors.
 Next up is Will Ferrell's one-man show, ''You're Welcome America: A Final Night With George W. Bush,'' which began previews last week, and which uses comedy and satire to review America's experience in Iraq. And Christopher Durang's new play, ''Why Torture Is Wrong, and the People Who Love Them,'' at the Public in March, applies the well-known gimlet eye of the author of ''The Marriage of Bette & Boo'' to the legacy of Abu Ghraib ''and how we are going to get past our anger at the Bush administration,'' Mr. Eustis said.
 Among the most commercially successful war-related shows last season were those that told personal, intimate stories, like ''All My Sons,'' Lincoln Center Theater's revival of ''South Pacific'' and the Scottish play ''Black Watch.''
 Miller's ''All My Sons,'' which has World War II as a backdrop, deals with responsibility for war on both an individual and national level, as the patriarch of a family comes to admit his role in producing defective aircraft parts that led to the death of young pilots, including one of his sons, a member of a squadron who is lost and presumed dead. At the end of the play Chris, the surviving son, argues with his mother about taking responsibility: ''Once and for all you can know there's a universe of people outside and you're responsible to it, and unless you know that, you threw away your son because that's why he died.''
 For some audiences the Miller play -- which first opened on Broadway in 1947 -- implicitly evoked Iraq, and the culpability of President Bush and his cabinet for soldiers' deaths. 
 After seeing the play, which recently ended its limited run on Broadway, Moises Kaufman, the playwright and director, quoted Arthur Miller, who wrote in The New York Times in 2003, ''Failures tend to examine their suppositions about life; the successful are more likely to celebrate themselves as good examples.'' Mr. Kaufman added, ''Because our current wars have been such a failure of policy and national purpose, we as a culture need a theater where we can have a dialogue about conscience and responsibility, about our recent past and our future.''
 Among the more modern-day war plays, Ms. Benson's staging of ''Blasted,'' which has closed at Soho Rep, was both the most shocking -- with its gruesome physical violence -- and the most despairing. Despite that, it was sold out night after night, and extended its run twice. Ms. Benson, the artistic director of Soho Rep, said she believes the universality of the play -- it does not deal with a particular war -- helped broaden interest in its themes.
 ''It seemed about all the civil wars and conflicts happening right now,'' she said.
 Other war plays, even those with a more hopeful spirit than ''Blasted,'' struggled to survive. Mr. Belber had a difficult time even persuading producers to come to the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater this winter to see ''The Geometry of Fire,'' which closed last month. Its moving story centers on Mel, a young Marine sniper who returns from Iraq with a paralyzing case of post-traumatic stress, and his contentious relationship with his father, Bob, who went to jail to avoid Vietnam. At several points the two men argue over the idea of one citizen bearing the burden of the Bush administration's war strategy. 
 Mel: ''We were there, Dad; it was our responsibility to fix our mistakes.'' Bob: ''It wasn't your responsibility.'' Mel: ''Why not me? Someone at least trying to affect how things get done.''
 Mr. Belber noted that plays and films about war can be a hard sell; even when Iraq was more squarely in the news, movies like ''Stop-Loss,'' ''In the Valley of Elah'' and ''Redacted'' had trouble finding audiences, regardless of the critical response. 
 War ''is a risk for most writers to take on; it's much easier to write about dysfunctional families,'' Mr. Belber said. ''But at the risk of grandiosity, I guess I view our entire country as a single, many-hued dysfunctional family, and I prefer plays that assume that as a starting point.
 ''The fact is, our big, nationwide family was just at war for six and a half years, and we all, in one way or another, share in the responsibility for that, simply by being a part of the family. As we emerge from that war, those of us who are writers might point a spotlight on that process of emergence -- and hopefully help it along.''
 Mr. Eustis made a similar point about the coming production of ''Hair,'' which focuses on a ''tribe'' of hippies -- a family, in a sense -- and its attempts to end the Vietnam War through protest. What ''Hair'' makes clear, he said, is that emotional fervor will accomplish only so much; an organized movement is critical in wartime.
 ''Ultimately the protesters in 'Hair' not only cannot stop the war, they also cannot stop one of their own from going over and getting killed,'' Mr. Eustis said. ''All the hope and idealism in the world will not suffice without a thought-out plan of action. By showing the limits of antiwar fervor, 'Hair' underscores how people must be smarter in taking responsibility to act against war and stop war.''
 Now the question is whether theater becomes smarter, too, in finding ways to dramatize war for a war-weary public.

HEADLINE: Obama Plans Fast Action To Tighten Financial Rules

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration plans to move quickly to tighten the nation's financial regulatory system. 
 Officials say they will make wide-ranging changes, including stricter federal rules for hedge funds, credit rating agencies and mortgage brokers, and greater oversight of the complex financial instruments that contributed to the economic crisis.
 Broad new outlines of the administration's agenda have begun to emerge in recent interviews with officials, in confirmation proceedings of senior appointees and in a recent report by an international committee led by Paul A. Volcker, a senior member of President Obama's economic team. 
 A theme of that report, that many major companies and financial instruments now mostly unsupervised must be swept back under a larger regulatory umbrella, has been embraced as a guiding principle by the administration, officials said. 
 Some of these actions will require legislation, while others should be achievable through regulations adopted by several federal agencies.
 Officials said they want rules to eliminate conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies that gave top investment grades to the exotic and ultimately shaky financial instruments that have been a source of market turmoil. The core problem, they said, is that the agencies are paid by companies to help them structure financial instruments, which the agencies then grade.
 ''Until we deal with the compensation model, we're not going to deal with the conflict of interest, and people are not going to have confidence that the ratings are worth relying on, worth the paper they're printed on,'' Mary L. Schapiro said in testimony earlier this month before being confirmed by the Senate to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Timothy F. Geithner, the nominee for Treasury secretary, made similar comments in written and oral testimony before the Senate Finance Committee.
 Aides said they would propose new federal standards for mortgage brokers who issued many unsuitable loans and are largely regulated by state officials. They are considering proposals to have the S.E.C. become more involved in supervising the underwriting standards of securities that are backed by mortgages.
 The administration is also preparing to require that derivatives like credit default swaps, a type of insurance against loan defaults that were at the center of the financial meltdown last year, be traded through a central clearinghouse and possibly on one or more exchanges. That would make it significantly easier for regulators to supervise their use.
 Officials said that the proposals were aimed at the core regulatory problems and gaps that have been highlighted by the market crisis. They include lax government oversight of financial institutions and lenders, poor risk management efforts by banks and other financial companies, the creation of exotic financial instruments that were not adequately supported by their issuing companies, and risky and ill-considered borrowing habits of many homeowners whose homes are now worth significantly less than their mortgages.
 ''I believe that our regulatory system failed to adapt to the emergence of new risks,'' Mr. Geithner said in a written response to questions that was made public on Friday by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. ''The current financial crisis has exposed a number of serious deficiencies in our federal regulatory system.''
 The regulatory changes are a major piece of a broader package being prepared by the new administration to address the market crisis. Another piece to be issued soon will provide the strategy for how the government will go about repairing the declining banking industry. Congress recently approved the second $350 billion in spending from the Troubled Assets Relief Program. 
 The White House has come under increasing political and market pressure to disclose how it intends to manage the program, and there is nervous expectation on Capitol Hill that the administration will need to spend more than $350 billion. That plan is expected to focus on reducing foreclosures, revising the bank bailout program, and buying or issuing guarantees for the rapidly deteriorating assets that have been discouraging more private investment in the banks.
 Senior aides have vowed to move quickly on the administration's financial regulatory agenda. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, approved last fall, requires the White House to make regulatory recommendations to Congress by April 30, although the administration is preparing to make legislative and regulatory proposals sooner. 
 Mr. Obama is expected to make one of his first foreign trips to a summit of the leaders of the Group of 20 nations in London on April 2, and officials said the administration will have outlined the details of its proposed regulatory overhaul by then. 
 Officials have been grappling for nearly a year to figure out how to better oversee the financial system, particularly as a number of large and inadequately supervised companies have encountered problems. In a sweeping regulatory blueprint unveiled last March, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. proposed a broad consolidation of banking and financial agencies, including merging the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That proposal is not included in the current plans.
 Other elements of the regulatory overhaul, such as the requirement that hedge funds register with and be more closely supervised by the S.E.C., would mark a sharp departure from the policies of the Bush administration. Many hedge funds now voluntarily register and subject themselves to some regulation, but the Bush administration opposed attempts to make registration and tighter oversight mandatory, even though that was proposed by William H. Donaldson, a chairman of the commission appointed by President George W. Bush.
 But other proposals the Obama administration is preparing to make, like tighter federal regulation of mortgage brokers, had been recommended in Mr. Paulson's blueprint.
 Officials said some credit default swaps with unique characteristics negotiated between companies might not be able to trade on exchanges or through clearinghouses. But standardized or uniform ones could.
 ''We want to make sure that the standardized part of those markets move into a central clearinghouse and onto exchanges as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Geithner testified. ''I think that's really important for the system. It will help reduce risk and the system as a whole.''
 The new trading procedures for derivatives could also enable regulators to impose capital and collateral requirements on companies that issue credit default swaps that would make them safer investments. American International Group, one of the largest issuer of such swaps, never had to post collateral and nearly collapsed as a result of issuing a huge volume of such instruments that it was unable to support.
 Officials said the plan may include a broader role for the Federal Reserve in protecting the economy from companies whose troubles pose systemwide risks, as the report issued under the leadership of Mr. Volcker, a former Fed chairman, has proposed. The report was issued this month by a subcommittee of the Group of 30, a not-for-profit body of senior representatives from various governments and the private sector. The group's members include Mr. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House National Economic Council.
 Administration officials have begun to study ways to control executive compensation. 
 For example, they are preparing proposals to limit executive pay at companies that receive money under the bank bailout program. In response to written questions by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Geithner said that in such circumstances the administration was planning to set a limit and that any compensation over that amount would ''be paid in restricted stock or similar form that cannot be liquidated or sold until government assistance has been repaid.''
 ''Excessive executive compensation that provides inappropriate incentives,'' Mr. Geithner said, ''has played a role in exacerbating the financial crisis.''

 BODY:
 FOR several months last year, makeshift signs at Washington Crossing State Park warned of plans to shut portions of the park, a popular historical site here on the Delaware River.
 The signs have vanished, along with the threat that a cut in state dollars would have forced Lisa P. Jackson, then commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, to close part of the park. But they serve as an example of how Ms. Jackson, President Obama's choice to lead the federal Environmental Protection Agency, used public opinion and political savvy to get things done during her three-year tenure in New Jersey.
 After Gov. Jon S. Corzine threatened to make significant cuts in the parks budget, Ms. Jackson publicly circulated a detailed list of the swimming holes, campsites and hiking trails that would have been closed. A huge public outcry ensued, and in the end, the governor restored $4.5 million in the parks budget.
 ''She's politically astute in the good sense of the word,'' said Christopher Daggett, a former state environmental commissioner who served during the administration of Gov. Tom Kean, a Republican. ''She understands the political process.'' 
 Ms. Jackson, working on environmental issues primarily as a regulator over the last 20 years (including time at the E.P.A.), has created a reputation as a consensus builder who understands politics and public perception. 
 But critics say there were occasions when Ms. Jackson was too politically accommodating, and they complain that standards she drew up to qualify select rivers for special safeguards from development excluded many endangered species from the automatic protections.
 ''The impression we get is she, for the most part, got out of the way,'' said Jeff Ruch, executive director of the Washington-based Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, who was one of Ms. Jackson's most vocal critics leading up to her confirmation hearings on Jan. 14. 
 Ms. Jackson declined to be interviewed for this article. In her confirmation hearings before the Senate, she said science would be her guiding principle: ''If I am confirmed, political appointees will not compromise the integrity of E.P.A.'s technical experts to advance particular regulatory outcomes.'' 
 Those who worked with her in New Jersey say her tenure offers clues to how she will manage the nation's top environmental agency, where the pressures to balance safeguarding the nation's natural resources with the needs of industry are constant.
 ''I think she is an environmentalist at heart,'' said Dave Pringle, a lobbyist for the New Jersey Environmental Federation, an advocacy group. ''And she is effective at getting as much as her boss will let her get.''
 Ms. Jackson, 46, has degrees in chemical engineering from Tulane and Princeton. She is beginning her second stint at the E.P.A., having worked there for 16 years before joining the state environmental agency in 2002 as assistant commissioner for compliance and enforcement. Governor Corzine named her to head the agency in early 2006. She will be taking over a job at an agency that was run from 2001 to 2003 by another prominent New Jersey official, former Gov. Christie Whitman. 
 Mr. Corzine said Ms. Jackson was masterly in balancing the pressures on her office from commercial and preservation interests.
 ''I think Lisa's done a great job in pushing forward with the issues and finding that balance,'' he said.
 In New Jersey, the department was battered by annual budget cuts. Its staff dropped to 3,129 last year from 3,422 when Ms. Jackson took office in 2006. Another 119 workers left with an early retirement incentive last summer.
 Her department's budget similarly has dropped to $421 million from $470 million over the same three years, state budget records show.
 ''After years of adhering to the mantra that we 'do more with less,' the current budgetary situation combined with decades of statutory mandates -- many funded but many not -- is forcing us into a 'do less with less' approach,'' she told the State Legislature last year.
 The budget cuts required some compromises, and not everyone was pleased.
 For instance, late last year she announced plans to disband the department's Division of Science and Research, which was nationally renowned before being ravaged by budget cuts and staff reductions. In its place, Ms. Jackson set up a much smaller Office of Research, which will team with a Science Advisory Board consisting of academics and experts in environmental matters to evaluate the science behind department policies.
 Also, Ms. Jackson cooperated last year in drafting legislation that would allow privatization of the cleanup of some hazardous-waste sites by authorizing developers to hire specially certified engineers to sign off on the completion of the cleanup of polluted industrial sites being readied for sale or redevelopment. The department currently has 20,000 sites awaiting sign-off, a backlog that has grown by 4,000 since Ms. Jackson took office. 
 She said the use of outsiders is the only way to address the backlog, but she has lobbied for amendments to the measure that would increase the level of state oversight on the corps of privatized so-called ''licensed site professionals.''
 And late last year, in a worsening economic crisis, Ms. Jackson was powerless to stop a drive by lawmakers and business leaders to scale back standards for D.E.P. development permits as a way to boost the prospects for commercial growth. But she did succeed in turning what was originally proposed as a broad suspension of D.E.P. regulations into a more limited rule that simply extended the expiration date on approved permits by about two years.
 ''This was, I think, a reaction to what was happening in the Legislature and the builders, a way of placating them to some extent, but not doing everything they want,'' said Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter. He credited Ms. Jackson with frequently being able to devise a ''political maneuver to blunt the stuff coming from the builders.'' 
 Michael McGuinness, chief executive of the New Jersey branch of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, said Ms. Jackson was easy to deal with and always true to her principles.
 ''I thought she was very committed to the goals of the D.E.P.,'' he said. ''I would think the environmental groups probably got more of what they were looking for than the development and redevelopment groups.''
 Outside of her tussles on the financial front, Ms. Jackson oversaw development of a sweeping plan to rein in New Jersey's production of the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, rewrote plans to limit sprawl by setting new restrictions on where new sewer lines can be drawn, stopped the bear hunt, and drew up rules to implement the Legislature's plan to restrict development in the 860,000-acre Highlands region of northwestern New Jersey.
 ''The whole key to environmental protection is trying to balance those needs,'' said Mark Mauriello, a career D.E.P. officer who has been named to succeed Ms. Jackson as state environmental commissioner. ''It all really is a balancing act.''
 Mr. Daggett, the former commissioner who headed a task force that examined problems in the department's permitting systems last year, praised Ms. Jackson's ability to juggle often-competing fiscal, political and environmental concerns.
 In Washington, Ms. Jackson's critics and backers agree, the interests may well be aligned morein the favor of environmental protection.
 Bradley M. Campbell, Ms. Jackson's immediate predecessor as D.E.P. commissioner, and the man who hired her away from the federal agency in 2002, said, ''I think in the significant issues confronting E.P.A., Administrator Jackson will have more support in Congress than she possibly had in the State House here in Trenton, in part because of the budget and in part because the members of Congress are a little more removed from the immediate impact of regulatory decisions.''

HEADLINE: For Coming-Out Party, New Senator Stops in Harlem and Queens

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ; Jason Grant and David M. Halbfinger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
On one of the biggest days of her political life -- the day after she was named successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton in the United States Senate -- Representative Kirsten E. Gillibrand went to Harlem and southeast Queens on Saturday, meeting with black leaders and seeking to win over a constituency that might have been skeptical of an upstate congresswoman whose district is 2.7 percent black.
Ms. Gillibrand turned her first public appearances since Gov. David A. Paterson announced her appointment on Friday into what amounted to a daylong introduction. 
In the morning, she stood before dozens of black New Yorkers at the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters on West 145th Street, discussing the Wall Street bailout, unemployment and police brutality. In the afternoon, she met in Jamaica with Queens elected officials, including the new State Senate majority leader, Malcolm A. Smith, and talked with them behind closed doors about gun control and other issues.
''I am here to listen to you,'' Ms. Gillibrand told the audience in Harlem, adding, ''I'm here to represent all of New York.''
Ms. Gillibrand's two-borough tour was part of a whirlwind day in the city for a little-known, 42-year-old congresswoman from a mostly rural upstate district that is home to dairy farms and 677,000 people. Her schedule became a showcase for black leaders and for her as well, as she displayed a folksy charm and a knack for keeping cool when handling tough questions.
In Harlem, Ms. Gillibrand briefly visited Sylvia's restaurant, a soul food institution, where she shook hands and posed for pictures with customers and workers. ''She was so upbeat, so cordial,'' said Lorraine Benton-Horne, 52, the president of a group eating in the restaurant at the time, Ministers' Wives and Widows of the United Missionary Baptist Association. ''She asked us to keep her in our prayers.''
Ms. Gillibrand also later met with Hispanic leaders and strategists, including Representative Nydia M. Velazquez and Roberto Ramirez, the former Bronx Democratic Party chairman.
Throughout the day, the New Yorkers she met formally and informally seemed to want reassurances that she was flexible on some of the positions that have made her a popular Democrat in a heavily Republican Congressional district, and Ms. Gillibrand seemed eager to provide those assurances.
Ms. Gillibrand grew up in a hunter's family -- both her mother and father hunt, she said -- and she has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. After meeting with Queens leaders, she said: ''I will always protect hunter's rights. But that is a far different issue than the issues that we face here in this community.''
She added that she supports reducing gun violence, but that she never had a reason to focus on the issue because it rarely came up in her district, which runs from the mid-Hudson Valley to Lake Placid. When a reporter held up Saturday's edition of the Spanish-language newspaper El Diario, which called her anti-immigrant in its front page headline, she replied, ''It's understandable. They don't know me.''
Ms. Gillibrand answered questions from reporters after her speech at Mr. Sharpton's headquarters, but it was a question from a man in the audience about Sean Bell that provided an awkward moment. The man asked her if she thought the police shooting deaths of Mr. Bell, Amadou Diallo and Oscar Grant III -- a young, unarmed black man shot and killed by a transit officer in Oakland, Calif., on New Year's Day -- were murders.
''I think each of the cases were terrible instances of things we need to right in our community, and I think that your concern and your anger and your outrage is valid, important and just,'' Ms. Gillibrand replied.
The man pushed further, asking her again if she thought the shooting deaths were crimes and if she had seen the videotape of Mr. Grant's shooting, which has been shown on Internet and news sites. ''Based on the videotape, it looked like a crime to me,'' she said.
Mr. Sharpton praised Ms. Gillibrand for selecting Harlem and his weekly ''action rally'' as the site of her first visit on Saturday. ''Reporter said to me this morning, 'Well, do you know her well?' No,'' Mr. Sharpton told the audience. ''But I would rather it was someone I didn't know that reached out, than somebody that I do know that takes us for granted.''
In Harlem, Ms. Gillibrand made no mention of Caroline Kennedy, who had been considered a top contender for the post before she announced her withdrawal from consideration early Thursday. Talking to reporters in Queens, Ms. Gillibrand said she had not spoken to her yet, but looked forward to working with her. ''I admire her and respect her very much,'' she said.
Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island, who had declared his intention to challenge Caroline Kennedy if she was given the Senate seat, called on the governor to give a detailed description of his selection process to explain when and how he settled on his choice of Ms. Gillibrand. ''The people of New York are entitled to know, since this whole process was such a circus atmosphere from the start, why he decided on her, a one-term member of Congress whose views seem to be out of step with the Democratic party in New York,'' Mr. King said in an interview.
Ms. Gillibrand seemed to make a good impression among those she met face to face on Saturday.
She had a disarming, down-to-earth style that surprised many of those she met. One staffer said it was not an affectation, but her natural personality. After she appeared with the governor at a news conference on Friday, she took one of her two children to the doctor for a cold.
''We could have been having this meeting about a neighborhood issue, as opposed to having it with New York's new junior senator,'' said Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman, a Queens Democrat, after meeting with Ms. Gillibrand. ''And I hope that she keeps that same humility.''

HEADLINE: What Crisis? Collector Car Prices Soften, but Don't Crash

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
Scottsdale, Ariz.
FANS of classic cars often like to think of them as time machines. But the notion has recently taken on an unintended meaning, as prices in some sectors of the collectible-car market have turned the clock back to levels not seen since 2004-5.
All things considered, however, the market showed resilience in the string of auctions in and around Scottsdale, Ariz., this month. The long-predicted free fall in prices did not occur.
And there were some genuine surprises among the individual sales as more than $100 million worth of cars changed hands.
Perhaps the most unexpected results came at the Gooding & Company auction, which flew in the face of expectations and surrounding circumstances . With $32.4 million in sales, compared with $21 million at last year's sale, it seemed more like the summer of 2008 than the winter of 2009. 
Gooding had the top-dollar sale of the final weekend with a 1960 Ferrari 250 GT California Spider, a late consignment that brought $4.95 million. And while seven-figure lots had become commonplace across Arizona over the last several years, this year there were just seven such sales and all were confined to Gooding, the last of the major auctions to get under way.
With the no-sales of some big-ticket cars at the RM Auctions sale and the still unfurling economic crisis on the minds of attendees, the mood at the beginning of the Gooding auction was tense -- think back to the first ''Saturday Night Live'' broadcast after 9/11.
The $1.4 million sale of a 1929 Duesenberg Model J Dual Cowl Phaeton, just nine lots in, had the same ice-breaking effect as when Lorne Michaels, the show's producer, asked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani if it was all right to be funny.
Mayor Giuliani's impeccably timed response: ''Why start now?''
David Gooding, chief executive of Gooding & Company, said there was still a strong market for good quality cars that were priced fairly and truly for sale. He did allow, however, that prices were down somewhat in the $250,000-$850,000 midrange of postwar European cars.
At the moment, vintage cars seem to be showing more strength in the market than other collectibles. Leigh Keno, a host of ''Antiques Roadshow'' on PBS, said that in general, presale estimates for American decorative arts sold at auction this season have been as much as 50 percent lower than they would have been two years ago. Mr. Keno said, ''There is a sense that the market will reward more conservative estimates.''
At RM, the star car, a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport -- one of just five examples of a Corvette racecar whose incredible potential was cut short by General Motors' decision to stop supporting racing -- didn't sell during the auction. Nevertheless, RM sold a very respectable 83 percent of its lots for a total of approximately $18 million.
According to Ian Kelleher, RM's chief operating officer, the sale attracted a record number of bidder registrations for the event, and a number of cars that could be considered ''sensitive'' in the marketplace sold quite well. An example of the latter was a 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 Berlinetta that brought $918,500. While this was a bit less than some sales before October 2008, the price was a healthy increase over the $816,750 that RM got for a similar car at a May 2007 auction in Italy.
Given the economic circumstances, there was great interest in cars priced under $100,000 that would also serve as summer weekend drivers. Cars that are easy to find parts for, and eligible for events like vintage rallies and tours, did well.
RM, for example, sold a 1967 Alfa Romeo Duetto Spider -- similar to the car driven by Dustin Hoffman in ''The Graduate'' -- for $46,200. Gooding sold a 1954 Nash Metropolitan hardtop for $19,800, Barrett-Jackson garnered an astonishing $59,400 for a 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am and Russo & Steele managed $49,000 for a 1961 Triumph TR3A. All were at the least strong results, and perhaps records.
Robert Pass of St. Louis was the consigner of the 1961 Triumph. Mr. Pass has been collecting cars since the late 1950s and said he was not aware of a TR3 ever approaching $50,000 at either a public auction or in a private sale.
According to Craig Jackson, chief executive of the Barrett-Jackson auction house, his company anticipated the demand for more accessible cars and purposely adjusted its offerings to favor cars in the $50,000 to $100,000 range. This was reflected in the overall sale figure of $63 million, down some $20 million from last year, but a bit higher than the company's 2005 results of $61 million.
Mr. Jackson said that his company worked hard with consigners to ensure that there was a ''meeting of the minds'' where sale expectations were concerned. Nevertheless, there were notable high sales, including the second 1957 Chevrolet produced, a two-door from the entry-level 150 series with just 46,133 miles, that brought $165,000. Barrett-Jackson also continues to be the sale known for drawing new people into the hobby, with 70 percent of registered bidders being first-timers.
One of the notable aspects of the Barrett-Jackson sale was the sale of 214 cars from the General Motors Heritage Collection. Most were prototypes or concept cars and included the striking 1996 Buick Blackhawk. Built to celebrate Buick's 100th anniversary in 2003, it recalled the granddaddy of all design studies, the striking 1938 Buick Y-Job; the Blackhawk sold for $522,500.
Nearly all the cars in the G.M. offering were sold on either a bill of sale or a scrap title, according to Barrett-Jackson. The former, Mr. Jackson said, can never be legally registered for road use. Fortunately, the Blackhawk was sold on a scrap title so it can be registered and driven on public roads. It would be a shame for it to spend its life behind a velvet rope.
Aside from the Buick Blackhawk sold by Barrett-Jackson, few concept cars were offered in Arizona. An exception was the 1954 Dodge Firearrow III sold by RM for $880,000. While some 1950s dream cars look as if they took too much styling inspiration from the Air Force's latest interceptor, the Firearrow was exquisite in every way.
Perhaps the best buy of the G.M. collection was a 1989 Corvette ZR2, a one-of-a-kind prototype with a big-block V-8 that sold for $71,500. Tom DuPont, a Florida collector, discounted those who tried to tie the timing of the G.M. sale with the company's dire financial condition. Mr. DuPont said he thought G.M. was simply managing its collection as many private collectors manage theirs, eliminating some cars to make for a more orderly display of the remainder.
There is certainly some common ground between the perceptions of Mr. Gooding and Mr. Jackson in the collector car market, and Mr. Keno in the antiques world. Mr. Keno said he believed that the midrange of the American decorative arts market was the softest now, as is the case with the collector car market. ''However,'' he said, ''the great things will always do well.''

HEADLINE: Movies Sell Slowly At Sundance

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
In a weakening entertainment economy, movie sales came slowly, but did not halt, at the usually far more exuberant Sundance Film Festival, which ended Sunday in Park City, Utah.
 Buyers proved fussy. Sellers were a bit frustrated. And despite some prominent deals -- including Sony Pictures Classics' buying the rights to ''An Education,'' a British coming-of-age drama set in the '60s, for a reported $3 million -- there was no blockbuster sale to match the $10 million that Focus Features spent last year on a single picture, ''Hamlet 2.''
 But the action continued even as the 10-day festival closed Sunday, promising that total sales would match or exceed the $15 million or so spent on rights to Sundance movies in 2008. 
 ''Everyone is confident that quite a few more films will still sell,'' said Richard Klubeck, a partner and independent film specialist with the United Talent Agency, who spoke Friday by telephone. 
 Mr. Klubeck's agency took three films to the market that accompanies the annual festival: ''The Messenger,'' a drama with Woody Harrelson among its stars; ''Five Minutes of Heaven,'' a drama with Liam Neeson; and ''Paper Heart,'' a romance with Michael Cera.
 None of the three had closed a sale as the festival headed toward its close, Mr. Klubeck said, but negotiations were under way with potential buyers.
 ''It's pretty clear that this was a really strong festival in terms of everyone's ability to find films they loved,'' said Mr. Klubeck. But among potential buyers, he added, ''caution was in the air.''
 The festival's bigger sales included ''Black Dynamite,'' an action comedy that quickly sold for about $2 million to a unit of Sony Pictures after a midnight screening on the festival's first day, and ''Adam,'' a romance that went to Fox Searchlight soon after. 
 But some of the festival's hotter action involved the pursuit of niche films like ''Humpday,'' a comedy about straight men making a gay pornographic film. That one sold for about $100,000 to Magnolia Pictures, which plans to release the film via video-on-demand before taking it to theaters.
 ''I imagine this is what Sundance was like 15 years ago,'' said Kevin Iwashina, an independent sales and financing consultant who worked with Submarine Entertainment in negotiating the ''Humpday'' purchase.
 Going into the final weekend, Mr. Iwashina said, demand was soft for theatrical rights to any of the many documentaries offered at the festival, though Submarine announced early Sunday the sale of ''Art & Copy,'' about the advertising business, to Arthouse Films. Those still looking for a theatrical distributor as the festival was winding down included ''The Cove,'' a kind of environmental thriller about the slaughter of dolphins in a secretive Japanese village, and ''Why We Laugh,'' a documentary about African-American humor.
 Also still on the table were ''I Love You Phillip Morris,'' a gay-themed loved story with Jim Carrey. ''Spread,'' which featured Ashton Kutcher as a gigolo, was considered a hot title, but it did not sell until late Friday, for about $3.5 million, to Anchor Bay Entertainment.
 Some of the unsold films will eventually find distributors for prices lower than sellers would like. Others will wind up making their debuts on cable television rather than in theaters. Still others may land, as did ''Humpday,'' on video-on-demand services, which are beginning to transform the independent film market.
 One of the most robust video-on-demand distributors, IFC, owned by Rainbow Media and its parent, Comcast, has said it expects eventually to pick up a significant number of movies screened at the overlapping Sundance and Slamdance festivals. 
 For instance, on Thursday, IFC -- which puts movies in a small number of theaters while adding them to its on-demand service -- bought rights to ''In the Loop,'' a British political farce. The company was reported to have spent almost $1 million, though it often pays in the tens of thousands of dollars, rather than the hundreds of thousands, banking on the eagerness of filmmakers to get their work seen.
 ''I've come to realize that my festival run is my theatrical run,'' said Joe Swanberg, the director of ''Alexander the Last,'' a movie that is expected to make its debut in March simultaneously at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin, Tex., and on IFC's video-on-demand service.
 Mr. Swanberg spoke at Sundance last Monday, during a panel discussion of changing market dynamics in the independent film business.
 If Sundance was a lesson in diminished expectations for most, a few found reason to exult. One among them was Marco Weber, chief executive of Senator Entertainment, which will distribute its first films this year.
 Shortly before the premiere of ''Brooklyn's Finest,'' whose stars included Richard Gere and Don Cheadle and which was directed by Antoine Fuqua, Mr. Weber had expressed hope that the film would not seem sufficiently commercial to interest the buyers from big studio units like Fox Searchlight and Focus Features.
 In the end, Senator had the winning bid, in partnership with Sony Pictures' acquisition group, for an amount that Mr. Weber afterward characterized as being ''in the low seven figures.''
 ''I'm in love with this movie,'' Mr. Weber said later, though he said that it needed some editing and a new score.
 Others who attended saw the slower pace and the lower bids as unhappy signs of the times. 
 One of those was Jamie Patricof, whose Hunting Lane Films had no film of its own at Sundance but will be in the market over the next year with Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in a drama, ''Blue Valentine.'' 
 ''Unfortunately, everyone's worst fear came true -- that buyers wouldn't be buying,'' Mr. Patricof said.

An article on Monday about the sale of films at the Sundance Film Festival misidentified the corporation that owns Rainbow Media Holdings and IFC, among the most active buyers at this year's festival. Rainbow Media Holdings and IFC are part of Cablevision Systems, not Comcast.

HEADLINE: Giving Decades of Video A New Life on the Web

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: SILVER SPRING, Md. 

 BODY:
Media companies are rushing to repackage their videos for the Internet, and some say they can hardly keep up with advertiser demand for more. Video clips of TV shows and behind-the-scenes outtakes are omnipresent online -- but how do they get there? 
 Part of the answer is here, at the headquarters of Discovery Communications, where a small team of editors mines the 23-year-old video vault of the Discovery Channel for animal attacks, dinosaur animations and scientific oddities. Old shows that ordinarily would not be repeated on Discovery or its other cable channels can be repackaged online, turning every week into ''Shark Week,'' three minutes at a time. 
 As users spend more time watching videos with advertisements attached, they are fast becoming an incremental moneymaker for media companies. While the young medium is not impervious to the economic slowdown, the research firm eMarketer forecasts a 45 percent gain in online video spending in 2009, evidence of the sharp rise in video production for the Web. 
 Perhaps that explains why the words ''brighter digital future'' are scribbled in blue ink on a whiteboard next to Josh Ferg's desk. Mr. Ferg is one of eight producer-editors, or preditors for short, who create bite-size video for the Web at Discovery. 
 Despite the unfortunate job title -- ''I think 'Dateline NBC' has kind of ruined it,'' Mr. Ferg joked, referring to the newsmagazine's ''To Catch a Predator'' franchise -- Discovery views the team as an important part of its Internet strategy. The producer-editors made about 4,500 videos for Discovery's Web sites last year, helping the company record eight million video views in November.
 While the online advertising market has slowed considerably because of the weak economy, the executive vice president for digital media at Discovery, Josh Freeman, said advertisers' demand for video remained robust. Asked whether the ads were lagging behind the content creation, he responded: ''In video? Not a chance.''
 When Mr. Freeman arrived from AOL in mid-2007, he said, he concluded that Discovery ''was just leaving money on the table'' in online video. Now, he says, the company is playing catch-up. 
 To a greater extent than most media companies, Discovery owns the global rights to the content it broadcasts. Because the company owns 13 networks in the United States, including TLC, Animal Planet and the Science Channel, it has untold thousands of hours of footage. And because many of its TV episodes are timeless, the clips can still be relevant to Internet users years after their original broadcast. 
 ''Cheetahs are still killing gazelles the same way they did 3,000 years ago,'' Doug Craig, the senior vice president for digital media production, said, ''and on top of that, we don't have to pay residuals.''
 To that end, Discovery has added six temporary employees to ''maximize the library,'' Mr. Craig said. They are repackaging old shows into short clips for the how-to Web site HowStuffWorks, a recent acquisition by Discovery, and Discovery's other platforms. 
 That gives Mr. Ferg and the other full-time producer-editors time for more complex projects. Sometimes they blend several videos to create original series with new graphics and narration. Recent examples include ''Jaws and Claws,'' about the relationship between predator and prey, and ''Strange Science,'' about all sorts of bizarre phenomena. The Science Channel recently shortened the latter segments into 30-second vignettes.
 Almost every video is shorter than five minutes. ''Killer Clips,'' a series of 30- to 40-second clips of animal takedowns, have proved especially popular on the Animal Planet Web site. But Mr. Ferg avoids the term clipping because, he says, it oversimplifies the process. ''It's always about a story,'' he said, whether that story is an hour or a minute long.
 When the producer-editors want to repackage shows from long ago, the continuing digitization of the Discovery archives allows them to mine the vault ever deeper. An archive in Sterling, Va., stores 1.3 million tapes of old episodes; when a producer wants to clip something from one of those tapes, it is brought to an editing center a few blocks from Discovery's headquarters and a digital copy is created.
 All of the shows are fodder for online clips. Mr. Freeman particularly enjoys the super-slow-motion ''Time Warp'' videos that show the impact of a boxer's punch or a burst of fireworks. The half-hour show lends itself well to one-minute variations. 
 Some of the videos seem destined for wide popularity. Placing them on sites like YouTube clearly helps. 
 The Discovery series ''MythBusters'' is probably the most popular show for clips. A video of one of the co-hosts, Adam Savage, inhaling helium and explaining the voice-adjusting effects has attracted more than a million views on YouTube. In the coming months, Discovery will begin selling ads for its videos on YouTube, adding another source of revenue for the company.
 On a recent day, Discovery.com's short videos featured ads from consumer products companies, electronics makers and the United States Army. The online video industry continues to suffer from a lack of specified ad formats and standardized measurements, but Mr. Freeman is optimistic about ad money.
 ''Those dollars are going to come,'' he said. ''I want to be there when they do.''

HEADLINE: Underpaid Judges

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''On the Subject of Judicial Salaries, a Difference of Opinion,'' by Adam Liptak (Sidebar column, Jan. 20): 
 Judges are public servants. My colleagues and I are productive because our duty is to serve. But that does not mean that we are not underpaid.
 Since 1994, I have routinely worked 60 hours a week and have never seen a raise, although there have been a few cost of living adjustments, or COLAs, to keep pace with inflation. This year, judges are the only federal employees who will not even receive a COLA. Members of Congress gave themselves the very COLA denied to judges.
 If all 1,200 federal judges received a 2.5 percent COLA, it would amount to approximately $5.5 million -- a pittance compared with the money spent on bailouts and lengthy wars.
 If America wants the highest quality judiciary -- one that reflects our nation's diversity -- we must not limit the opportunity to those who have already built a nest egg in the private sector.

HEADLINE: Remembering Germany

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 When my thoughts turn to wreckage, and there's a lot of it about these days, I tend to think of Germany's ''Stunde null,'' or zero hour, the moment in 1945 when a once powerful nation faced its utter moral and material bankruptcy, the rubble of its collective suicide.
 No doubt that's because I lived in Berlin in the 1990s, at the time when the capital returned there from Bonn and a reunited Germany felt confident enough to face the ghosts of its darkest hours. Berlin was still raw, its past present at every turn, and so the miracle of Germany's post-war recovery was palpable. 
 A country in disgrace had fast-forwarded from ruin to peace and prosperity.
 That miracle, of course, was in large measure a German-American achievement, from Marshall Plan reconstruction, through West Germany's insertion into NATO, culminating with the astute U.S. diplomacy that allowed the country's unification within the Western alliance.
 It's easy to forget these days that solving ''the German question'' took much of the 20th century. It's also easy to forget that the U.S. embassy in Bonn was once America's largest in the world, comparable, with its thousands of staff, to the Baghdad embassy today.
 What a difference a couple of decades make. The U.S. alliance with Germany has soured. Donald Rumsfeld's comparison of the country to Libya was a low point illustrating how differences over Iraq poisoned a relationship already complicated by the disappearance of its strategic imperative.
 Things have looked up a bit since then, but not a lot. The Germans still feel a little like jilted lovers. Many Americans have a vague notion of an ungrateful nation that's gone soft and smug. It's safe to say President Obama, his campaign speech in Berlin notwithstanding, does not have Germany high on his ''to do'' list.
 That's a pity. Germany is important to the United States right now. It's time to rekindle a dormant relationship. While America is not at ''Stunde null,'' it's at a moment of disarray when it has to rethink the nature and exercise of its power. Germany knows all about reinvention. It can help in four important areas: Europe, the economy, Iran and Afghanistan.
 A strong Europe is essential to America's recovery. The United States is too stretched -- militarily and economically -- to do without the cohesion of its closest allies.
 There are three major European powers: Britain, France and Germany. Britain is going through a meltdown so severe that the joke there is that the country's the next Iceland. That aside, its European credentials are always a little suspect.
 In France, the notion of the European Union as a ''counterweight'' to American power still lurks, although President Nicolas Sarkozy has done much to dispose of such Gallic intellectual baggage.
 Only in Germany is a powerful commitment to the strength and effectiveness of the European Union matched by an equally powerful conviction that the trans-Atlantic relationship remains critical.
 Through Germany, Obama should press the urgent need for the 27-nation E.U. to complete reforms that will give it a president and foreign minister with terms long enough to count. Germany, Europe's largest economy and the world's largest exporter, must also be a pivot of post-crash reforms.
 The recession is severe in Germany, but the country still has a savings ratio of 11 percent (it's negative in the United States), a strong manufacturing sector and, after spending a staggering $1.8 trillion to integrate the Communist East, it has managed to get its budget close to balance.
 Hence its much-criticized hesitation to join the socialist bandwagon (the Chinese are now referring to the U.S. economy as ''socialism with American characteristics'') and pump billions into salvage operations. But Germany has now come through with a $110 billion stimulus package.
 It is an essential American ally in turning the global economy around; expanding the G-8 to reflect today's realities by including at least Brazil, Mexico, India, China, South Africa and Indonesia; and pushing through global financial reforms to be discussed in London in April that should include minimum capital ratios for banks and measures to ensure risk and responsibility get enduringly reacquainted with each other.
 In Iran, Germany has broad experience of negotiation in recent years, along with Britain and France. That experience has led to some important German convictions: that American leadership under Obama is essential; that no deal will work without a regional security arrangement that only the United States can underwrite and that must (at least tacitly) acknowledge the Israeli bomb; and that new avenues have to be found to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because only he counts.
 With 3,500 troops in Afghanistan, set to rise to 4,500 this year, Germany has the third-largest troop presence there. It has been a strong advocate of some measures -- including treating Pakistan and Afghanistan as a single theater and concentrating on corruption-eliminating government reform -- now finding favor in Washington. Another reason to think Berlin.
 A good start would be naming a vigorous, German-speaking ambassador to Berlin. The post is vacant. It shouldn't be for long.

HEADLINE: Keeping America Safe: The View From the F.B.I.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Focus on Immigration Crimes Is Said to Shortchange Other Cases'' (front page, Jan. 12):
 The F.B.I. remains highly committed to the investigation of public corruption and organized crime. 
 First, uncovering and investigating public corruption by public officials at all levels remains the top criminal priority for the F.B.I. Today, more F.B.I. agents are assigned to public corruption than ever before, an increase of 38 percent since 2003. Over the past three years, the F.B.I. helped prosecute nearly 2,500 corrupt local, state and federal officials -- a substantial increase over the previous three years and the highest number of prosecutions for such a period ever.
 Second, after 9/11, with the F.B.I.'s shift of some resources to fight terrorism, the larger white-collar crime program was restructured. Fewer cases were opened involving ''low-hanging fruit'' investigations and comparatively small amounts of money. State and local authorities have the jurisdiction to investigate these crimes. F.B.I. resources have targeted corporate and securities fraud, which poses the greatest threat to the nation's economic security. 
 Finally, today there are three times as many organized-crime task forces across the country and around the world than at the time of 9/11. Given the counterterrorism and counterintelligence demands, there are fewer F.B.I. agents dedicated to organized crime. But the impact has not diminished: More arrests were made last year than in any year since 2001.
 Necessarily, following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the F.B.I. shifted resources to strengthen national security. But there has been no reduction in its commitment to keep America safe -- whether from traditional crimes, terrorism or foreign intelligence collection.

HEADLINE: Brothels Ask to Be Taxed, But Official Sees a Catch

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- It is virtually unheard of for any legal industry to ask to be taxed. And it would seem even more unlikely for any government, especially one facing down a nearly $2 billion budget gap, to hesitate when a business is willing to pay up.
Yet such is the case for Nevada's brothels, a $50-million-a-year industry that pays significant amounts of tax to the rural counties in which they operate but only a $100 business license fee to the state.
The industry's lobbyist, George Flint, director of the Nevada Brothel Association, has been approaching the Legislature's leadership for months about creating an entertainment tax that would require the state's 25 legal brothels to give the state some money on a per-transaction basis. 
''I am a voice crying in the wilderness,'' said Mr. Flint, who does not own any brothels himself. ''It's not going to make a hell of a lot of money, but we would be happy to pay our fair share. We can't even get a hearing. The speaker of the House told me, 'As bad as it is, I don't think we want to go there.' ''
Nevada is one of only two states where prostitution is legal, but by state law it also is restricted to counties with fewer than 400,000 residents. That outlaws it in two counties, Clark, which contains Las Vegas, and Washoe, which contains Reno. There are about 225 women licensed by the state as prostitutes; no county allows brothels to have men who sell sexual services.
Still, since 1971, when prostitution was legalized, Nevada has added more than two million residents and become significantly more socially conservative. The state has also lost much of its frontier mentality, so Mr. Flint acknowledges that the tax effort is ''something of an insurance policy'' against the Legislature's deciding one day to do away with the industry.
''Anytime you're going to take tax money, the state's not going to view you as a relic of a past time and put you out of business,'' explained Mr. Flint, who said he was gaining traction for a brothel tax in 2003 until he made the faux pas of joking to a reporter that he would commit to putting the governor's portrait in every prostitute's lair along with a note reading, ''Don't forget the governor's share.''
Like most states, Nevada is facing economic problems. Gov. Jim Gibbons, a Republican, submitted to the Legislature this month a budget that included 6 percent pay cuts for teachers and a 36 percent reduction in all higher-education financing to help close an expected $1.8 billion revenue gap created in part by dwindling tourism profits and a collapsing housing market.
Mr. Gibbons's budget -- which proposes the deep cuts to avoid any tax increases, in keeping with his 2006 no-tax-increases campaign pledge -- was rejected out of hand by leaders of the State Senate and the House, both of which are dominated by Democrats. In Speaker Barbara Buckley's response to the proposal and to Mr. Gibbons's State of the State address on Jan. 15, she vowed to ''gather all the facts, tap the best minds in the state, hear all points of view and commit ourselves to finding meaningful solutions.''
Still, Ms. Buckley said she did not support taxing brothels because she believed that to do so the state would have to legalize prostitution in the largest counties, ''and I just don't support the idea.'' Asked why she supports prostitution in some areas of the state and not others, Ms. Buckley declined to answer except to say that legalization came ''way before the time I was elected.''
Mr. Flint does have at least one legislative ally, Senator Bob Coffin, a Las Vegas Democrat and the incoming chairman of the Senate Taxation Committee. Mr. Coffin said he was willing to hold a hearing on the matter in the coming legislative session, which starts next month.
Mr. Coffin disputed the speaker's assertion that a brothel tax would require statewide legalization and called it a ''legal backdoor'' to avoid the matter.
''There is a way to make it work, just as we make all these other legal contortions work based on population,'' he said. ''You can do it if the legal counsel says we can do it. And we should, because the brothels have been essentially exempted from the sharing of the burden that we all have to spread around on as many people as possible so the impact is less.''
Not all brothel owners support Mr. Flint's efforts. Dennis Hof, owner of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Mound House, said his brothel was the ''highest private taxpayer in Lyon County'' and questioned why anyone would ''consider another layer of tax on me. It's unbearable in this economy.''
Mr. Hof, whose brothel is the subject of the long-running HBO reality show ''Cathouse,'' said he paid $78,000 a year for his county business license and $25,000 a year to the local health department officials. ''The legislators are saying they've got bigger issues to deal with,'' said Mr. Hof, who has long disassociated himself from Mr. Flint and the brothel association. ''The state needs $1 billion. The money they would get from a brothel tax is a small amount of money. So why bring it up? If the Legislature thinks they need to get some more money from us, we'll deal with it on our own.''
And even brothel owners who support the idea of being taxed by the state are not as worried as Mr. Flint is that the Legislature might ban the business. James Davis, owner of the Shady Lady Ranch in Scotty's Junction, said legislators from the smaller counties would never allow the state to eliminate one of their few reliable sources of local tax revenue.
Ms. Buckley said she suspected that Mr. Flint's motive was to first have the industry taxed by the state and then build a case for legalizing it in the larger counties. And Mr. Flint acknowledged that he hoped he could show the Legislature how much money the state is losing by not regulating and taxing the booming illegal prostitution industry in Las Vegas. (The closest legal brothels to the Strip are more than 60 miles away in Nye County.)
Mr. Flint has another outspoken ally, Mayor Oscar B. Goodman of Las Vegas, long an advocate of having legal brothels in the city. The mayor said that Nevada's reputation is such that most travelers already believe that prostitution is legal throughout the state.
''They tell me we're missing tens of million of dollars that could be used for the school system, to keep jail guards employed, to provide mental health services,'' Mr. Goodman said.
''I also believe that by regulating and controlling this business, we could make it much safer for the customers as well as the prostitutes. We kid ourselves and we're very disingenuous if we pretend that there isn't rampant prostitution now that is unsafe for which we get no tax revenue.''
Correction: February 2, 2009, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Monday about efforts by the Nevada brothel industry to pay the state a per-transaction tax attributed an erroneous distinction to the state. While Nevada is the only state that licenses prostitutes and allows for legal brothels, it is not the only state where prostitution is legal. Rhode Island has no law expressly forbidding prostitution from taking place indoors. (The state does criminalize the activities of streetwalkers and customers who solicit them from cars.)

HEADLINE: A Way to Mark Robinson's 90th Birthday

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
On Monday night in Manhattan, Rachel Robinson and select friends will celebrate what would have been her husband's 90th birthday.
 Jack Roosevelt Robinson's actual birthday is Jan. 31, but Rachel decided to use the celebration to kick off a fund-raising campaign for the most ambitious project of her life: the Jackie Robinson Museum.
 Jackie Robinson is a seminal figure in American history. Through letters, exhibits and lectures, the proposed museum will give the Robinson legacy shape and form for a young generation that played a pivotal role in electing the first African-American president. The museum will consolidate the major themes that defined Robinson's life and the lives of all who aspire to effect change: commitment and courage. 
 ''I saw that in Jack and I see that in President Obama and others who prevail,'' Robinson said last week during an interview in her office in Manhattan. ''When you're committed, you can fight, you have the spirit and you have the determination to fight for the goals that you believe in.''
 Jackie Robinson's presence ultimately brought out the goodness of the American character, but it immediately brought out the beast, with daily death threats, persistent harassment from fans, revolts and threatened revolts from opposing players and from some teammates. As a condition of becoming the First, Robinson had to agree not to lash out publicly or strike back.
 Rachel Robinson recalled an arduous trip in February 1946, when she and Jackie traveled to Daytona Beach, Fla., from Los Angeles for Robinson's first Brooklyn Dodgers training camp. They were bumped off a connecting flight in New Orleans. There was no place in the airport for blacks to rest. Unable to buy food in the airport unless they ate it elsewhere, they chose not to eat. They were bumped once again in Pensacola, Fla., and were told to deplane for refueling, only to see their seats be given to a white couple.
 Then they had a 16-hour bus ride to Jacksonville, during which they were told to move to the back of the bus to sit on straight-backed seats that didn't recline.
 They finally arrived at the private home in Daytona Beach where they were to spend the night.
 ''We were so relieved to get into a safe environment, someplace where people were welcoming us,'' Robinson said.
 ''Having been on guard for two days, experiencing rejection we had never experienced, humiliation we had never experienced, we just fell into bed. We were so happy to be together and safe. We didn't review the trauma of where we had to stay and how we had to behave. We knew we had to get ready for tomorrow. We knew we couldn't carry all that mess into the next day.''
 An aspect of Jackie Robinson's character that I've come to admire is the ability, indeed the willingness, he had to self-correct.
 In July 1949, Robinson, with other prominent African-Americans, was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee to rebuke the actor-singer Paul Robeson, who had said that African-Americans would not fight against the Soviet Union in a war.
 According to an Associated Press account from the days before his testimony, Robinson said he would tell the committee, ''Paul speaks only for himself.'' Referring to his Brooklyn Dodgers teammate Roy Campanella, Robinson said: ''Campy and I would fight any aggressor -- the Russians or any other nation. Anybody who wants to take away the things I've gained will have to fight for it.''
 Just before his death in 1972 Robinson, writing in his autobiography, ''I Never Had It Made,'' looked back on his decision to testify in 1949 and said he had been naive.
 ''In those days, I had much more faith in the ultimate justice of the American white man than I have today,'' he wrote. ''I would reject such an invitation if offered now. I have grown wiser and closer to the painful truth about America's destructiveness and I do have increased respect for Paul Robeson who, over a span of 20 years, sacrificed his career and the wealth and comfort he once enjoyed because, I believe, he was sincerely trying to help his people.'' 
 Since the election, Rachel Robinson, like so many of us, has thought about all of those she wished had lived to witness such a historic day. She has thought intensely about her husband. 
 ''I wanted him here,'' she said. ''He belonged here, he should have seen it, should have been a part of it. It would have been so rewarding because he was getting so discouraged at the end of his life, that change would not take place, that it would not be permanent, that it would not be expansive. This would have conquered all of those thoughts.''
 I asked where she watched the inauguration. ''I deliberately stayed home by myself on election night and on inauguration night, just so I'd be free to respond the way I felt.'' 
 We often say that a pioneer opened a door, but Jackie Robinson insisted that although being the first was an honor, he never would consider the door truly open until there was a second and a third and a fourth.
 When Larry Doby, Campanella and Don Newcombe entered major league baseball, Robinson said he felt he had made a difference.
 At a time of economic distress, there is little room for luxury items.
 The proposed Jackie Robinson Museum is not a luxury item, but a guiding light to illuminate where we have been as a nation, where we are and where we are headed.

HEADLINE: A Broken Business Model?

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The global credit crisis may have caused the decline in consumer and business spending that is assaulting the giants of high tech. But as the dominant technology companies try to emerge from this slump, they may find themselves blaming people like David Title just as much as they blame Wall Street. 
 Mr. Title, a 35-year-old new-media manager at a film production company in New York, has dropped his cable subscription and moved to watching most of his television online -- free. While shopping for a new laptop for his girlfriend recently, he sidestepped more expensive full-featured computers and picked a bare-bones, $200 Asus EeePC laptop, also known as a netbook.
 ''We've reached one of those moments in tech history when there are low-priced and free alternatives that are both user-friendly and reliable enough to make the switch,'' Mr. Title said. ''Then there's the extra bonus of saving some cash.'' 
 Silicon Valley has been gripped by a growing sense that the economic retreat might do more than depress earnings. There is too much ingrained optimism here to think that the tech sector will not bounce back, stronger than before. 
 But the fear now is that consumers like Mr. Title, and businesses operating with the same cost-cutting mind-set, will erode the high-margin businesses of the information technology industry -- slowing some technologies and companies but giving new momentum to others. 
 A normally confident Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, expressed this very fear last week after announcing the company's first big reduction of its work force. ''Our model is not for a quick rebound,'' he said. ''Our model is things go down, and then they reset. The economy shrinks.''
 This has happened before. The dot-com bust earlier in the decade dragged down high-fliers like Sun Microsystems and America Online but set the stage for a new generation of Web powerhouses like Google and other innovative Internet software companies like Salesforce.com, founded on disrupting the status quo. 
 The recession of the early 1990s sent I.B.M., then the dominant force in technology, into a five-year tailspin. But it also propelled Microsoft and Compaq, later acquired by Hewlett-Packard, and Dell to the forefront of computing.
 Indeed, Silicon Valley may be one of the few places where businesses are still aware of the ideas of Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist who wrote about business cycles during the first half of the last century. He said the lifeblood of capitalism was ''creative destruction.'' Companies rising and falling would unleash innovation and in the end make the economy stronger. 
 Recessions ''can cause people to think more about the effective use of their assets,'' said Craig R. Barrett, the retiring chairman of Intel, who has seen 10 such downturns in his long career. ''In the good times, you can get a bit careless or not focused as much on efficiency. In bad times, you're forced to see if there is a technology'' that will help.
 So who's up, who's down and who's out this time around? Microsoft's valuable Windows franchise appears vulnerable after two decades of dominance. Revenue for the company's Windows operating system fell for the first time in history in the last quarter of 2008. The popularity of Linux, a free operating system installed on many netbooks instead of Windows, forced Microsoft to lower the prices on its operating system to compete.
 Intel's high-power processors are also under assault: revenue tumbled by 23 percent last quarter, marking the steepest decline since 1985. 
 Meanwhile, more experimental but lower-cost technologies like netbooks, Internet-based software services (called cloud computing) and virtualization, which lets companies run more software on each physical server, are on the rise. 
 Penny-pinching shoppers like Mr. Title could have the most immediate effect on the tech industry, particularly if more people consider canceling their cable subscriptions to watch video online, or drop their landline telephones to depend on their cellphones or on Internet calling services like Skype.
 Many consumers appear ready to abandon the costly desktop computer altogether. Analysts expect PC sales to fall in 2009 for just the second time in the last two decades, with desktops falling even faster than they did in 2007 or 2008. 
 The only bright spot in the PC industry is netbooks. Analysts at the Gartner research company said shipments rose to 4.4 million devices in the third quarter of 2008, from 500,000 units in the first quarter of last year. Analysts say sales could double this year despite a deep worldwide recession. 
 Two lumbering giants, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, missed the first wave of these tiny, stripped-down machines, allowing Acer of Taiwan to grab market share. Acer pushed Apple out of the No. 3 spot behind H.P. and Dell as sales soared 55 percent. Dell and H.P. are making the devices now.
 Even the mighty Apple, whose iPod and iPhone revenue had helped insulate it from the first phase of this recession, reported last week that revenue from its desktop line fell 31 percent from the same period a year ago. 
 ''The day of the Rolls-Royce laptop and the high-end computer may not be totally over,'' said Charles King, an independent technology industry analyst in Hayward. Calif. ''But certainly the audience for that type of product is getting smaller and smaller.''
 Companies have also started to examine what they can do without and what they can do differently, and their choices may alter the competitive and lucrative landscape of business computing. 
 Hoping to save money, Arista Networks, a start-up based in Menlo Park, Calif., has much of its internal technology processes online, or ''in the cloud.'' Instead of buying its own hardware and software systems from the likes of Microsoft and Oracle, it opted for e-mail and online document services from Google and online sales and manufacturing software from Netsuite, based in San Mateo, Calif.
 It is spending a fifth of what it would be for traditional technology, said Jayshree Ullal, Arista's chief executive. 
 She smells a trend. ''I think 80 percent of the new high-tech and small to mid-size companies are doing what we're doing,'' she said. 
 A spate of start-ups have seized on cloud computing. Companies like Intacct offer online accounting software as an inexpensive alternative to Microsoft's products, and giants like Amazon.com sell access to data centers for business operations. Amazon has outpaced the traditional hardware makers with such services. 
 The number of virtualized new servers has doubled over the last three years, which has driven the revenue of VMware, one of the leaders in this cost-saving technology, to an estimated $1.88 billion last year from $387 million in 2005. 
 The makers of open-source software also continue to benefit from the growing appeal of their often cheap, if not free, products. Sun Microsystems distributes 65,000 downloads a day of its MySQL database, which has turned into the favored business software of new companies. The job search engine Indeed.com shows a thriving job market for MySQL and Linux developers. 
 Linux has proved popular as well on a new crop of smarter devices -- be they phones, TVs or set-top boxes -- that have captured software developers' imaginations. The new products they build will undoubtedly challenge the status quo. 
 ''Companies like Intel, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments that make chips for these devices are hiring Linux talent as quick as they can,'' said Jim Zemlin, executive director of the nonprofit Linux Foundation. ''They know thefuture is netbooks and mobile Internet devices.''

HEADLINE: Latest From the Networks: Safe Formulas From the Past

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
After suffering the fallout of a writers' strike last year and a fall season in which three networks posted significant ratings declines, network programmers have turned their attention to changes that can be made quickly.
 The issues are most acute at ABC and NBC. In the audience category both those networks use as their chief barometer of success, viewers from the ages of 18 to 49, each network is down 12 percent from last year. The Fox Broadcasting network is off even more at 14 percent, but it has introduced its usual winter schedule of strong programs, led by ''American Idol,'' and should steam ahead into the lead in that age group within a few weeks. 
 CBS, the one network that actually gained overall audience this season, is off only 3 percent among those young adult viewers and has the fewest programming holes to fill. 
 But worries about the network business are pervasive, especially because of the downturn in the economy. CBS executives have lamented privately that the network has not been able to take full advantage of its strong fall and that the advertising market has stalled. That has led to fears about what might happen this spring when advertisers make their commitments to new fall television shows. 
 Both NBC and ABC have already shaken up the management of their program development departments. ABC last week put its production studio under the control of its top programmer, Stephen McPherson, and NBC last month laid off most of its top program development executives and brought back one, Angela Bromstad, who had been exiled overseas. 
 Hopes for a better winter and spring -- and fall -- rest with a lineup of new series, a batch that the networks believe will benefit from the full efforts of writers poststrike. Many of the shows are leaning toward the familiar, both in terms of themes and creative talent. 
 Looking partly to the success that CBS has had with more conventional formats, many of the newer shows are steering clear of the experimentation of recent years.
 That is one reason that creators of previous hits, like the teams behind shows like ''The Office,'' ''E.R.'' and ''NCIS,'' will be back on the air with new entries. 
 ABC is still trying to find some 10 p.m. dramas to complement its strong lineup of 9 p.m. shows like ''Lost'' and ''Dancing With the Stars,'' as well as just one new comedy that could be labeled a success.
 For NBC the challenges are even more daunting. The network is so short of successful shows it even announced that it would broadcast three more episodes of its 15-year-old medical drama ''E.R.'' 
 The longtime hit, which is still the most successful 10 p.m. drama on NBC, was scheduled to end its run on March 12; but Ms. Bromstad, now the president of NBC's prime-time programming, announced that the end had been put off, with the last-minute addition of three more episodes this season.
 Now the final episode is set for April 2 (recent photographs of George Clooney in medical scrubs indicate the last show will feature the series' most famous alumnus). That will truly be the show's last hurrah, however, because NBC announced a new drama to fill the 10 p.m. slot on Thursday, starting the following week: a police show set in Los Angeles, once called ''L.A.P.D.'' but now renamed ''Southland.'' 
 NBC had earlier announced that a new drama named ''Kings'' (about a fictional contemporary kingdom and its ruling family) would be the replacement for ''E.R.'' Now that series has been shifted to Sunday at 8 starting March 15, Ms. Bromstad said.
 NBC also announced that its new comedy starring Amy Poehler of ''Saturday Night Live'' -- likely to be titled ''Public Service'' -- has a start date. The show, which deals with small-time local government, will begin April 9 at 8:30. Its creators, Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, both of ''The Office,'' described the show as not a spinoff of ''The Office,'' although it will borrow at least a few conventions from that show, including a cast of ordinary office workers. 
 Mr. Daniels said Ms. Poehler's show was originally planned for a post-Super Bowl send-off but the star's pregnancy had forced the change in schedule. (Her son was born in October.) Still, ''The Office'' remains so much the signature series for NBC that the network has ordered more episodes this season -- to total 29, according to Paul Lieberstein, one of the show's new supervising producers (who also plays the office human resources representative, Toby Flenderson). Most shows produce 22 episodes a season, with the maximum usually 24.
 One series that will not be producing anywhere near that many more episodes is the Fox drama ''Prison Break.'' Fox announced that the show will wrap up its four-year run with four episodes starting April 17. 
 CBS, meanwhile, has plans to find new ways to exploit one of its hits: It will introduce a spinoff of its potent drama hit ''NCIS'' with an episode this spring that will use the ''NCIS'' characters to set up a similar military crime team. ''NCIS'' will thus be passing on the favor it received when it started off as an episode of a previous CBS series, ''JAG.''

HEADLINE: From Here to Retirement

 BODY:
If you have a 401(k) retirement plan at work, you don't need us to tell you that you've taken a hit in the past year. The really bad news is that the damage to your retirement security is likely worse than what the numbers say on your statement. 
 Many Americans didn't have enough savings coming into the downturn. And employers are increasingly cutting back or suspending their 401(k) match. FedEx, Eastman Kodak, Motorola, General Motors and Ford, among others, have announced such moves. 
 There's also no guarantee that today's battered 401(k)'s will rebound powerfully. People close to retirement don't have time for a do-over. Even for those still far from retirement, there's no telling how stocks will perform in the future. 
 They could post impressive gains, especially in the near term, from their current low levels. But they could also struggle. The last 25 years was a time of low inflation rates and low interest rates, which boosted stock prices. Going forward, inflation and interest rates have nowhere to go but up, which would be bad for stocks. 
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. Over the last several decades, businesses and government used matching contributions and tax breaks to encourage the proliferation of 401(k)'s. They lauded them as a way to harness the market to create wealth and increasingly viewed them as replacements for traditional corporate pensions.
 In 1983, 62 percent of workers with retirement coverage had a traditional pension only, while a mere 12 percent had 401(k)'s. Today, approximately 20 percent have a traditional pension and about two-thirds have only 401(k)'s. 
 The shift to 401(k)'s also shifted investing risks and responsibilities from employers to employees, but as long as participants generally made money and recovered losses quickly, the risks seemed reasonable. Now many Americans are inevitably having second thoughts. 
 So far, the cumulative wipe-out of household retirement savings totals about $2 trillion, and no one believes that the downturn is anywhere near over. As a result, participants in 401(k)'s are in greater danger than ever of coming up short in retirement.
 That grim reality calls for an expanded approach by policy makers to retirement issues. Traditionally -- and correctly -- an important focus has been on lower-income Americans who lack the means to save and tend to work for employers who do not offer retirement plans. 
 During the campaign, President Obama supported a better savers' tax credit to encourage savings among lower-income Americans. He also supported universal I.R.A.'s, which would make a 401(k)-like account available to all workers. Those good ideas should be pursued. There are also good ideas for improving 401(k)'s that deserve attention, such as helping people manage their retirement withdrawals so that the money lasts a lifetime. 
 The wipeout in 401(k)'s has made it clear that it is not enough to get more people to save more. There needs to be a better way to reasonably ensure that a lifetime of savings can't be undone by forces beyond one's control. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, a leader in retirement policy, is advocating a new savings account -- in addition to Social Security and 401(k)'s -- that would enable risks to be shared among workers, retirees and the government. 
 After decades of promoting and improving 401(k)'s, in which employees bear substantial risk, that's a new and difficult reality for policy makers to grapple with. The sooner Mr. Obama puts his team on the issue -- his budget director, Peter Orszag, is one of the nation's top retirement experts -- the better.

HEADLINE: Oil Cartel Keeps Cuts On Track

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
After months of gradually closing the oil spigot, members of the OPEC cartel have managed to stop the slide in oil prices -- at least for now.
 Showing an unusual degree of discipline, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have slashed their output by more than three million barrels a day in recent months as they sought to put a floor under oil prices, which have fallen by $100 a barrel since last summer. That is about 75 percent of the production cuts pledged by members of the cartel since September.
 The cuts have been led by Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, which has trimmed its production to eight million barrels a day this month, down from nearly 10 million barrels over the summer. 
 In September, OPEC producers vowed to reduce their output by 4.2 million barrels a day, or about 5 percent of global production. 
 ''Compliance has been extremely high,'' said Kevin Norrish, an oil analyst with Barclays Capital in London. ''Most OPEC countries have done most of what they'd pledged to do.''
 Oil lost 70 percent of its value in recent months as the global economy fizzled and oil consumption fell. In the United States, the world's biggest consumer, demand has dropped nearly 8 percent, or 1.6 million barrels a day, from a year ago. Most experts believe global oil consumption will decline in 2009 for the second straight year.
 But OPEC's policy seems to be catching up with the economic downturn. After hitting a peak above $145 a barrel in July, and falling to $32 a barrel by December, their lowest level since the end of 2003, oil prices have stabilized in recent weeks. As the latest OPEC cuts have influenced the markets, prices have been trading in a range from $35 to $45 a barrel.
 OPEC's success has created the prospect of a rebound in prices -- most oil-producing countries want prices well above $70 a barrel. But such a rebound could hobble the world economy further, making an eventual recovery more difficult. 
 Already, retail gasoline in the United States has bottomed out and begun to rise. It is still far below the high of $4.11 a gallon in July, but is up about 20 cents over the last month, to a national average of $1.86 a gallon. 
 On Friday, oil prices rose $2.80 a barrel, or 6.41 percent, to settle at $46.47. While that is well below last summer's level, it remains relatively high by historical standards.
 The precipitous slide in recent months had alarmed many producers, as well as some Western oil companies, which warned of lower investments for new energy supplies. 
 ConocoPhillips, for example, last week trimmed its investment program by 18 percent, or $2.8 billion, for this year. Suncor Energy, which produces oil from Canadian tar sands, slashed its investments for the second time in a few months. After posting a loss in the fourth quarter, Suncor cut its spending plans to $3 billion this year, down from $10 billion.
 ''Politically, it is better to say we need the lowest possible oil prices, but there are economic implications to low prices, and not just for OPEC producers,'' said Olivier Jakob, the managing director of Petromatrix, an independent research firm in Zug, Switzerland. ''Lower prices defer investments in the energy sector that could hurt Western economies in the longer term.''
 The steep drop means that oil prices have returned to levels last seen before 2004. But given a rise in production costs, and vast government spending programs initiated by most oil-producing states, many oil exporters today need significantly higher prices to balance their budgets. 
 Saudi Arabia, for example, once seen as favoring low prices, recently said that it considered $75 a barrel to be a fair price. 
 Oil companies also say they need higher prices to develop complex and costly resources, like deepwater fields or tar sands, that have higher break-even costs. 
 ''If economies recover, we will quickly face the same challenges on the supplies,'' Helge Lund, the chief executive of StatoilHydro, a Norwegian oil company, said in a recent interview. ''We won't be able to meet the increase in demand.''
 The drop in prices, if sustained, may lead to a realignment of policies even for the most nationalistic producers, analysts said. Kazakhstan and Venezuela, for example, recently indicated they might relax investment terms or seek new deals with foreign companies in a bid to bolster their production and increase revenues.
 The OPEC cartel's discipline reflects a more forceful stance taken by Saudi Arabia, the group's most powerful producer, which has taken the lead in aggressively cutting production in recent weeks. 
 The country's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said the kingdom would go even beyond its OPEC pledges with a unilateral cut that would bring its output next month below its official target. Analysts expect the kingdom to reduce its output by an additional 300,000 barrels a day below its OPEC quota.
 ''We are working hard to bring the market in balance,'' Mr. Naimi said a few days ago in New Delhi.
 Saudi Arabia's economy is expected to shrink this year, and the country is planning to run a budget deficit because of the slump in oil prices. 
 OPEC has received some involuntary help from other producers. These include Mexico, where output from the country's biggest oil field is declining sharply; Russia; and Canada, where producers of tar sands have shut down some operations that are becoming uneconomical at today's lower oil prices.
 The last time the cartel met, in December, its members pledged to reduce production by 2.2 million barrels a day. It was the group's third agreement in four months to cut its output, after pledges of 500,000 barrels a day in September and 1.5 million barrels a day in October.
 But not everyone believes that OPEC's actions can keep prices from falling further, especially if the global economy continues to worsen. 
 OPEC has announced 12 quota reductions since 1993, and 80 percent of the time the cartel succeeded in defending a floor for oil prices, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank. The times when the cartel failed was when global economic growth was falling sharply, as in 1998 and 2001. 
 OPEC's president, Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos, has said he expected oil prices to eventually recover to around $75 a barrel this year as a result of OPEC's actions. The cartel is expected to meet again in March. At least one producer, Iran, has said the group might slash production even further to push up prices. 
 ''If all the cuts are carried out within the established time frame, there will be an impact in the market that will lead to a positive trend in terms of oil prices,'' Mr. de Vasconcelos told Reuters.

HEADLINE: A Fictional Ad Agency That Really Hawks [Your Product Name Here]

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Advertising tries to capture the ''now,'' and that makes it an oddly effective way for television dramas to examine the ''then.'' 
 The AMC series ''Mad Men'' is a moody, sardonic homage to the early '60s, when Madison Avenue was ascendant, but America's postwar power and confidence were just beginning to slip.
 ''Trust Me,'' a TNT series set in a Chicago advertising agency, is clever and likeable -- which, incidentally, is what most commercials try to be. But the series, which begins Monday, was created before the collapse of the credit market, and accordingly it looks at times like a period piece. Its characters live in the contemporary world but operate in a prerecession economy when television and print commercials still ruled the market, and advertising executives paid scant attention to the Internet, DVRs or the bottom line. 
 Mason (Eric McCormack, ''Will & Grace'') and Conner (Tom Cavanagh, ''Ed'') are a creative duo at the fictional agency Rothman Greene & Mohr, which on the show is a rival to firms like Leo Burnett and DDB. 
 The series was created by Hunt Baldwin and John Coveny, who were Chicago copywriters before they moved to Hollywood and became the writers and executive producers of ''The Closer'' on TNT. Their workplace comedy has an atavistic ''Thirtysomething'' feel that clashes with TNT's aggressive, cutting-edge marketing of both the series and its sponsors' wares: conspicuous product placement, online games and promos, advertorials in Adweek and even a cameo appearance by a real-life brand manager for Dove Hair Care, one of the show's advertisers. 
 Classic ad campaigns of the ''Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz'' variety are an endangered species. Nowadays television is exploring ''branded entertainment,'' which allows sponsors to insinuate their products into the story line in order to thwart viewers who DVR past ads. 
 NBC's ''30 Rock'' devoted one episode to mercilessly mocking product placement even as it placed its sponsors' products in the script. ''Trust Me'' is heavily branded entertainment -- the plots are integrally woven into promotions that include Apple computers, Starbucks coffee and Chris-Craft speedboats -- that prefers to maintain that everything in advertising is still pretty much as it was.
 The pilot opens with an inside joke, a woman lying by a swimming pool shadowed by a passing airplane, a reference to a 1979 ''Share the Fantasy'' campaign for Chanel No. 5. Mason and Conner are lounging by the same hotel pool, in Los Angeles for a 10-day photo shoot that is clearly a boondoggle. 
 ''Some kids want to be firemen, some kids want to be astronauts,'' Conner says. ''We always wanted to be hung over on expensive booze that someone else is paying for while everyone back in Chicago thinks we are working.'' 
 Actually, most ad executives in the Midwest these days are thinking about unemployment: in November, the Detroit area office of the advertising agency BBDO, which had Chrysler as its major customer, laid off 22 percent of its work force.
 There are a few attempts to signal that the advertising business is changing. Younger copywriters in the company complain that tag lines are ''old school,'' only to be rebuked by Mason, who recites a litany of famous tag lines, including ''We Try Harder'' and ''Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.''
 Mason and Conner are longtime friends and colleagues who complement each other, except when they clash. Mason is steady, hardworking, married and the father of three, whereas Conner is single, irresponsible and childish. The casting is counterintuitive: comedy duets usually play up physical differences, but in this case both actors are tall, lean and dark haired. 
 But together the two plausibly balance rapid-fire repartee with more soulful moments. Mr. Cavanagh, who was mawkishly cute in the role of a small-town lawyer on ''Ed,'' here is more bearable as a charmingly glib, but mostly annoying, sidekick. 
 Their chemistry is enhanced, and sometimes eclipsed, by Monica Potter's star turn as Sarah Krajicek-Hunter, a talented, deeply neurotic and irritating copywriter. ''Hi, Stu,'' Sarah says, chasing her new and distracted boss across the room. ''I know it's only my first day, and I am really excited to be working with you, and I can't wait, really, but the thing is, and it's totally no big deal, but I thought I was getting a window office.'' 
 Ms. Potter, who is very, very funny but also touching, is one of the best things in the show.
 And advertising, even in these constrained times, is an engaging premise. Besides police work and ice dancing, there are not many other jobs that rely on a buddy system, and that conceit fueled ''Bosom Buddies'' and ''Thirtysomething.'' It's a creative profession that unlike medicine or the law can never really take itself seriously. 
 Insecurity is its comic leitmotif -- even in flush times, admen like Darren on ''Bewitched'' are at the mercy of tyrannical bosses and mercurial clients -- and the best advertising executives act as if they are just one pitch away from disgrace and unemployment. 
 These are not flush times however. A little like the self-contradictory tag line ''Instant Classic,'' this series is infused with nowadays nostalgia, a trip back not to yesteryear but yestermonth.

HEADLINE: A World Away From Wall Street, a Bank and a Robber

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: CARLETON, Neb. 

 BODY:
 The man entered the intimate Citizens State Bank with a balaclava covering his face and sunglasses shading his eyes. His attire did not seem too out of place, given that workers at the nearby grain elevator are known to wear similar protection against the punishing cold of Nebraska in winter.
 Here in Carleton, the standard greeting -- ''Keeping out of trouble?'' -- gleans a ''Yep'' or a ''Nope,'' both equally reassuring to its population of about 136. But this man stepped up to the counter, with its rack of candy canes and clear view of the silvery vault open in trust, and greeted the teller with: Give me your money.
 The salutation received a classic Carleton response, something along the lines of: Are you serious? 
 The man answered by making sure she saw the pocket of his heavy Carhartt coat, bulging with his hand and maybe something else. Following bank protocol, which says no amount of money is worth a human life, she gave him the cash in her till, all the while taking quiet note of two physical traits. He had fat fingers and a fat nose.
 He tucked the money into a zippered pouch and left without availing himself of either a candy cane or one of the complimentary yardsticks jutting from a bucket by the door. As soon as he left, the teller loudly called out words not common in Carleton: We've been robbed.
 The bank's president, Michael Van Cleef, came running out of his office, where he had been discussing a farmer's financial situation with the bank's loan officer. He looked out the window just in time to see the grimy getaway, in a maroon, dust-caked Grand Am with a spoiler on the back.
 The event took all of 55 seconds.
 Proper protocol continued. The bank locked down, and someone called 911. Within nine minutes the sheriff's deputies arrived. Soon came the first of many calls of concern and support, a few of which, a smiling Mr. Van Cleef remembers, went like this: ''Hear you've been robbed. Can I bring you over a pie?''
 In this day of bank bailouts and subprime mortgage debacles, some of us might find Robin Hood charm in a Nebraska bank robbery. Some might whisper the lines to the old Woody Guthrie song romanticizing the violent bank robber Pretty Boy Floyd: ''Some will rob you with a six-gun, and some with a fountain pen.''
 But the Citizens State Bank in Carleton has no connection to any of those banking conglomerates with names like AmeriCitiComGroup. It is the only branch of a small, family-owned business that has six employees, three of whom are family and none of whom are accustomed to junkets. It has a few hundred customers and about $11 million in loans out.
 Its one-story brick building, built as a bank more than 100 years ago, has remained a local fixture while most buildings in downtown Carleton, such as it is, are bricked up or closed up: the old Weddel's grocery store; the old post office that partially caved in a few years ago; the old Little Cafe, where Thelma and Shirley sold fresh pies of apple and cherry.
 Just outside the bank, a Cargill grain operation grinds away. Truckloads of soybeans and corn are weighed and dumped with a sound like a sigh into the mammoth grain elevators looming over the empty storefronts. Every few minutes, another long Union Pacific freight train loudly announces itself.
 Inside the bank, Mr. Van Cleef, 46, is usually helping local farmers figure out how to finance the fertilizer, chemicals, machinery, fuel and irrigation needed to grow their crops, all while guessing what beans and corn will go for. There is no online banking here. It's all face-to-face, how are you, Mike, see you later down at TJ's for a burger.
 The Van Cleef business has not exactly followed the Wharton School model. Mr. Van Cleef's father, Lloyd, 72, was a Navy veteran working as a meter reader for a gas company in Fairbury, about 40 miles away, when a local banker offered him a career change. He worked his way up the banking ranks and then, in 1975, decided to buy the Citizens State Bank in Carleton.
 His teenage son, Michael, did not appreciate moving from a town with a Pizza Hut and a movie theater to a town where the passing trains served as entertainment. But he started working in the bank after high school, attended banking seminars instead of attending college, set aside aspirations of law school and eventually became a bank president without pinstripes.
 ''You do loans, you do deposits,'' he says. ''You scrape the snow outside. You change the light bulbs.''
 Over the years, the bank, like Carleton, experienced some tough times. Lloyd briefly had to take a banking job in another state to help keep his own bank afloat. Michael's wife, Nancy, held three jobs for a while: mother of five, bank officer and waitress at an American Legion hall in Hebron.
 The Van Cleefs recall a common-sense practice from those times, a practice that some larger institutions seem to have forgotten. ''When things get tight,'' Michael Van Cleef says, ''you don't get a bonus.''
 Maybe this explains why the bank and the Van Cleefs remain. Lloyd lives here with his wife, Marion, who comes once a week with mop and bucket to clean the bank. Nancy is an emergency medical technician. Michael is on the village board -- overseeing a $100,000 budget and a single public employee -- and was instrumental a few years ago in dissuading the Postal Service from shutting down the post office. ZIP code 68326 lives on.
 This, then, is who a fat-fingered man robbed at 3:14 on the cold Thursday afternoon of Jan. 15. For the record, his was the fourth robbery at the bank since it opened in 1890, and the first in a half-century. Two were break-ins, and one, in 1950, involved a local man wearing a rubber mask and wielding a water pistol. He got away -- briefly -- with $12.50.
 The robber and his dirty Grand Am probably turned right onto D Street, past the crumbling old post office, the new post office in the old library, and TJ's Cafe, where locals gather on Fridays for the Mexican night specials. A quick left, a quick right, across Route 4 and then onto a gravel road heading north, where the Van Cleefs say his dust trail was seen by more than a local herd of Holsteins before he vanished into the great American vastness.
 Through that afternoon and into the night, people in cars rolled slowly past the bank to catch a glimpse of investigators working behind the yellow caution tape, while calls of concern continued: from TJ's, offering to send over some food; from banking competitors, offering to send over staff or money. Some said they had seen that Grand Am around.
 Michael Van Cleef says he feels violated -- as though someone had broken into his home -- but is glad no one got hurt. And while he would not reveal how much had been stolen, he says the amount was not worth the robber's trouble.
 He says he wonders what motivated the man with fat fingers. Did it have something to do with what investigators were saying? That with this economy, we're going to see more robberies in rural America?
 No matter. On the morning after the robbery, at precisely 8:30, the Citizens State Bank once again opened its doors to the rumbles and sighs of Carleton.

HEADLINE: CUNY Plans Campus for New Approach to Community College

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
Students would be required to enroll full time, taking at least 12 credits a semester. Majors would be limited to about a dozen fields with robust job opportunities, including health care and environmental technology. Admission would still be open to anyone with a high school diploma or G.E.D., but face-to-face interviews would be required.
 Those are among the ideas detailed in a 120-page blueprint for the community college of the future -- specifically, a 5,000-student Manhattan campus that would be New York City's first new two-year institution of higher education in 37 years. Education officials have not secured financing for the new college, and they say its opening is at least two years away, but the urgency is mounting, as the economic slowdown fuels enrollment at the City University of New York's six community colleges, already up 31 percent over the last decade. 
 CUNY's chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, testified before a legislative committee this month, saying that the system's ''capacity will be severely tested in the coming year,'' noting that the Borough of Manhattan Community College alone has 22,000 students, up from 16,000 a decade ago. But with dismally low graduation rates at community colleges here and around the country, educators are loath to simply add more of the same kind of curriculum. 
 ''We need bold and new approaches in the way we envisage initial engagement, support services and curriculum,'' Mr. Goldstein told the State Assembly's Committee on Higher Education during a hearing on budget cuts. ''Our students will face increasingly competitive pressures in an unforgiving economy, and getting a degree matters. It is therefore in their interest to attend community colleges where the focus is on high standards and degree completion.'' 
 Nationally, about 6.2 million students are enrolled in 1,045 community colleges -- about 35 percent of overall students pursuing higher education, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. In New York, 51 percent of the students at CUNY's community colleges are immigrants, making the institutions a critical bridge to both cultural assimilation and career opportunities. 
 With the state and city facing budget deficits and already beginning to chip away at higher education financing, CUNY is trying to raise money for the new college from a number of private groups including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has promised to spend hundreds of millions of dollars through 2025 to double the number of people who earn a postsecondary degree or certificate by age 26. In a November speech, Hilary Pennington of the Gates Foundation said CUNY's proposed college was the kind of innovative approach her organization might look to finance. 
 About half of American adults have a higher education degree, but for Hispanics and African-Americans, the number drops to about 20 percent. Helping to bolster the appeal of the new college is a pilot program that is testing many of the proposed ideas across the existing CUNY community colleges. The 1,132 students in the program, called Accelerated Study in Associate Programs and known as ASAP, get free tuition, MetroCards and books; twice-monthly sessions with a counselor; and first choice on classes. 
 Over the two years that the program has been in place, its students have outperformed their peers, earning a higher grade-point average, 2.61 compared with 2.43 for students not in the program, while taking more credit hours, 11 versus 9.6. About 80 percent of them remain enrolled after two years, compared with 60 percent of those outside the program.
 (Though about 80 percent of CUNY's community college students fail one of three basic skills exams, enrollment in ASAP was limited to those who needed no remedial education, and their performance was compared with a similar population.)
 ''What we promised was that within three years, we would graduate half the students who came in,'' Chancellor Goldstein said in an interview. ''We are on track to do that.''
 Roughly 30 percent of the 81,000 CUNY community college students earn a degree or transfer after three years, slightly better than the national average of 24.7 percent.
 ASAP, and the larger development of a new community college ideal, grew out of a mayoral commission on reducing poverty whose 2006 report cited continuing education as a top priority. After a breakfast meeting at which Chancellor Goldstein told Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg that the low graduation rates were a ''travesty,'' the city agreed to give CUNY $19.5 million for ASAP. The money came from a $125 million fund that was established to test ways to prevent people from falling into poverty.
 ''If you have a high school diploma you cut chances of living in poverty in half,'' said Deputy Mayor Linda I. Gibbs, one of the leaders of the mayor's poverty commission. ''With higher education you cut your chances even more. The community colleges are so critical because they are able to provide much-needed economic credentials to a very high-need population.'' 
 Some 60 percent of CUNY's community college students come from households that earn less than $30,000 a year, and 66 percent of them work at least part time while taking classes. 
 When Abeje Leslie enrolled at La Guardia Community College in 2007, she was worried about balancing school with a clerical job at which she put in 16 hours a week. But because she was in ASAP, she was given priority for picking classes, which allowed her to carve out time for her job. 
 ''In the morning, or the night, I can set a reasonable schedule,'' said Ms. Leslie, 19. ''I can come to school, get my work done and then concentrate on work.''
 This year, because of cutbacks at her office, she works only eight hours a week -- making ASAP's free textbooks and MetroCards a critical support to keep her in school. (CUNY officials said they would like to raise enough money for the new college to extend these benefits to its entire student body.)
 ASAP students are required to remain in school full time for the first year -- the equivalent of about six hours a day, five days a week, of time spent studying and attending classes. Nearly 9 in 10 students at CUNY community colleges start out full time, but by the end of three years, about half of those students have reduced their hours.
 In interviews with a dozen ASAP students at La Guardia, the twice-monthly counseling sessions were cited as being critical to keeping them on course.
 Students in CUNY's community colleges can easily get lost on vast campuses, where students speak more than 100 different languages and often remain strangers as they cycle through classes that are just one part of hectic days filled with family and work responsibilities.
 ''They are all basically on their own,'' Alexandra Torres said of her classmates outside the program. ''No one knows each other, and no one has relationships.'' Of ASAP, she said: ''We all entered together and know our classmates. I am glad we have a support system.''
 Chancellor Goldstein said officials were using the lessons learned from the ASAP pilot ''as a foundation for the new community college.''
 John Mogulescu, CUNY's dean for academic affairs, said the new college would have a fundamentally different curriculum from that of the existing colleges, the Borough of Manhattan, Hostos, Queensborough, Kingsborough, La Guardia and Bronx Community Colleges.
 In the first year, extra math would be required: at least 135 total hours a semester, or nine a week, to bring students up to college-level proficiency. (The existing colleges have varied requirements.) 
 Similarly, there would be an intense focus on literacy. A city seminar and a professional studies course would develop skills in reading, writing, oral communication, research, managing and organizing information and creating effective presentations in a case-study structured curriculum. Such courses would fill 195 hours over a semester, or 13 a week.
 By keeping enrollment below 5,000, officials hope to be able to give all the new college's students the more convenient block schedules and individual attention that have fueled ASAP's success.
 While ASAP only admitted students who did not need remedial work, the new college would have the same open admissions requirements as the existing six, with a lottery if applications exceed openings. But unlike at the other schools, students at the new college would be required to attend a 4- to 6-week summer orientation that would include remediation for those who needed it. 
 The mandatory interviews for admission -- unheard of at community colleges -- are not so much to weed out unqualified applicants as to let prospective students know what will be expected of them.

HEADLINE: Toward a More Energy-Efficient Future

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Energy Inefficient'' (editorial, Jan. 19):
 Yes, we must immediately improve efficiency in existing energy technologies even as we engineer new ones. But it's important to clarify that engineering greater efficiency can't merely rely on an Apollo-project approach or a fortunate burst of creative genius. 
 It will require a steady program of fundamental scientific research leading, for example, to low-weight, high-capacity batteries, to high-efficiency solar cells, to environment-friendly biofuels and to the ability to capture carbon when burning fossil fuels. 
 Phillip F. Schewe
 College Park, Md., Jan. 20, 2009
 The writer, senior science writer at the American Institute of Physics, is the author of a history of the social impact of electricity.
 To the Editor:
 Bravo for urging the use of proven energy efficiency technologies. The potential benefits are vast, since the productivity of generating electricity has not improved since Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, and since the production of heat and power accounts for 66 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions. 
 Policies to induce the capture of wasted energy could profitably cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent and greatly enhance manufacturing competitiveness. 
 Recycled energy is as pristine as solar and wind power, and has the advantage of avoiding transmission lines and associated losses. Standing in the way are decades-old barriers designed to benefit electricity monopolies and the refusal of government regulators to allow energy recycling projects to capture much of the value they create. 
 Let's hope the Obama administration will eliminate these policy barriers and spur a clean-energy boom. 
 Thomas R. Casten 
 Chairman 
 Recycled Energy Development 
 Westmont, Ill., Jan. 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Our nation's poor energy efficiency has one primary cause, as you mention: our cheap energy. 
 As a market economy, we need to tax carbon products to make their alternatives competitive in the marketplace as in Japan and other advanced countries in Europe and elsewhere. 
 I suggest phasing in higher gas taxes over the next several years with, say, a 10 percent increase every year until our hydrocarbon products reach a price level that reflects their true value. Our grandchildren will thank us for it.
 Stephen Eittreim 
 Palo Alto, Calif., Jan. 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Clearly huge improvements in energy efficiency will reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption. But this is not a cure-all. In the end, we need to invest in technologies that will fundamentally alter the way we produce electricity and transport ourselves and our products.
 The future of carbon-neutral electric power is, beyond doubt, solar energy. Transportation fuels can be supplied in the near term by renewable energy sources like algal biofuels without impacting food supply. In the longer term, hydrogen-based fuels will be available.
 What is needed to make these transitions is political leadership and an understanding that the future of our children's children depends upon the decisions we make today.
 The Energy Department must take the lead in developing a national energy strategy that engages our best and brightest scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs. Paul G. Falkowski 
 Princeton, N.J., Jan. 20, 2009
 The writer is director of the Rutgers Energy Institute.
 To the Editor:
 The only possible long-term solution to the global warming problem is to shift to a nonpolluting energy source. The most likely such source is sunlight. 
 All the energy available to us comes from sunlight, both the polluting fossil fuels (oil and gas) deposited eons ago and the nonpolluting sunlight that falls on the earth in visible form every day.
 The energy in sunlight, which is far greater than we can possibly use, can be captured photoelectrically and used efficiently if we convert to an electrical economy. In such an economy, all devices that use power get that power from electricity. 
 We will need efficient electric-powered cars, not efficient gasoline-powered cars. Since we do not yet know how to make electrically powered airplanes, we can convert almost all air travel to train travel with little or no loss of speed, since most train travel is between cities that are within a few hundred miles of each other. 
 And until we have electrically powered airplanes, we need to seriously consider giving up high-speed overseas travel, for the sake of the survival of humanity. William F. Schreiber 
 Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 19, 2009
 The writer is emeritus professor of electrical engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 To the Editor:
 You don't mention a huge opportunity for energy efficiency when it comes to transportation. 
 Europeans use less fuel to travel farther not just because of smaller cars, but also because of vastly superior transit, biking and walking facilities. 
 Add to that more compact neighborhoods and higher fuel taxes, and you have countries where up to 50 percent of trips are taken by foot or bike.
 We can do the same thing in the United States. In my hometown of Missoula, Mont. (yes, Montana), nearly 15 percent of local residents walk or bike to work. The percentages are rising in New York, Portland, Ore., and other cities that are investing in bike networks and sidewalks. There is a new campaign to create an official bike route network that connects local networks.
 We need investment now in cycling and walking facilities. They're less expensive, make better use of existing technologies, save energy, cut emissions, reduce oil dependency and encourage healthy transportation. What's not to like? Jim Sayer 
 Executive Director

 Missoula, Mont., Jan. 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Let's tell people of the quantum jump in energy efficiency that could be accomplished by eating less meat and having what meat is eaten be grass fed and pasture raised by local farmers. 
 It's easy to cut meat consumption if you start with one day a week of no meat. People will be pleasantly surprised at how delicious vegetarian food can taste. Bonnie Lane Webber

HEADLINE: U.S. Bank And Trust?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Only five days into the Obama presidency, members of the new administration and Democratic leaders in Congress are already dancing around one of the most politically delicate questions about the financial bailout: Is the president prepared to nationalize a huge swath of the nation's banking system?
 Privately, most members of the Obama economic team concede that the rapid deterioration of the country's biggest banks, notably Bank of America and Citigroup, is bound to require far larger investments of taxpayer money, atop the more than $300 billion of taxpayer money already poured into those two financial institutions and hundreds of others.
 But if hundreds of billions of dollars of new investment is needed to shore up those banks, and perhaps their competitors, what do taxpayers get in return? And how do the risks escalate as government's role expands from a few bailouts to control over a vast portion of the financial sector of the world's largest economy?
 The Obama administration is making only glancing references to those questions. In an interview Sunday on ''This Week'' on ABC, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, alluded to internal debate when she was asked whether nationalization, or partial nationalization, of the largest banks was a good idea. 
 ''Well, whatever you want to call it,'' said Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California. ''If we are strengthening them, then the American people should get some of the upside of that strengthening. Some people call that nationalization.
 ''I'm not talking about total ownership,'' she quickly cautioned -- stopping herself by posing a question: ''Would we have ever thought we would see the day when we'd be using that terminology? 'Nationalization of the banks?' ''
 So far, President Obama's top aides have steered clear of the word entirely, and they are still actively discussing other alternatives, including creating a ''bad bank'' that would nationalize the worst nonperforming loans by taking them off the hands of financial institutions without actually taking ownership of the banks. Others talk of de facto nationalization, in which the government owns a sizeable chunk of the banks but not a majority, with all that connotes.
 That has already happened; taxpayers are now the biggest shareholders in Bank of America, with about 6 percent of the stock, and in Citigroup, with 7.8 percent. But the government's influence is far larger than those numbers suggest, because it has guaranteed to absorb the losses of some of the two banks' most toxic assets, a figure that could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars.
 Many believe this form of hybrid ownership -- part government, part private, with the responsibilities of ownership unclear -- will not prove workable. 
 ''The case for full nationalization is far stronger now than it was a few months ago,'' said Adam S. Posen, the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''If you don't own the majority, you don't get to fire the management, to wipe out the shareholders, to declare that you are just going to take the losses and start over. It's the mistake the Japanese made in the '90s.''
 ''I would guess that sometime in the next few weeks, President Obama and Tim Geithner,'' he said, referring to the nominee for Treasury secretary, ''will have to come out and say, 'It's much worse than we thought,' and just bite the bullet.''
 So far the Obama administration has signaled that it is trying to avoid that day, and members of its economic team -- among them Mr. Geithner and the president's top economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers -- made the case during the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s that governments make lousy bank managers.
 Indeed, the risks of nationalization they warned about then apply equally to the United States now. The first is that nationalization can prove contagious. If the Obama administration took over Bank of America and Citigroup, two of the largest banks in the United States, private investors could decide to flee from the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, or other major banks, fearing they could be next. 
 Moreover, Mr. Obama's advisers say they are acutely aware that if the government is perceived as running the banks, the administration would come under enormous political pressure to halt foreclosures or lend money to ailing projects in cities or states with powerful constituencies, which could imperil the effort to steer the banks away from the cliff. 
 ''The nightmare scenarios are endless,'' one of the administration's senior officials said.
 The argument in favor of nationalization, even a brief nationalization of a few months or years, is straightforward: It might be the only way to pull America's largest financial institutions out of the downward spiral that makes it enormously difficult to raise the capital they need to keep operating.
 Right now, many banks are reluctant to write off their bad debts, and absorb huge losses, unless they can first raise enough capital to cushion the blow. But they cannot attract that capital without first purging their balance sheets of the toxic assets. Japan's experience proved the dangers of that downward swirl; the economy stagnated, new lending ground to a halt and the country's diplomatic clout shrank with its balance sheets.
 Nationalization could pull the banks out of that dive, at least temporarily, as the government injected capital, hired new managers and ordered a restart to lending. But some Republicans who bit their tongues when President George W. Bush ordered huge interventions in the market would charge that Mr. Obama was steering America toward socialism. 
 Nationalization, said Charles Geisst, a financial historian at Manhattan College ''is just not a term in the American vocabulary.'' 
 ''We think of it,'' he continued, ''as something foreigners do to us, not something we do.'' 
 It is also something foreigners do to themselves: the British have recently taken a majority stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland. 
 Some of Mr. Obama's advisers have asked who the government would get to run the banks. Many of the most experienced executives are tainted by the decisions they made during the age of excess. And how would the government attract the best talent if it demanded that they take minimal pay -- a political reality in the current environment?
 Another option is for the government to buy the banks' most toxic assets either through a giant fund, or, more likely, a federally supported bad bank designed to buy up troubled investments. But in that case, taxpayers might well be the losers: They would have all of the banks' worst assets and none of their performing loans. And unless a deal is worked out to take a larger share of the banks whose bad loans are shuffled off to the government, the taxpayers would not have the chance to benefit by selling the shares back to private investors. 
 Moreover, cleaning up the banks' bad assets, without extracting a heavy price for the bank managers, shareholders and their lenders, is exactly what Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner warned against during the Asian financial crisis. 
 ''We told the Asians that they had to be willing to let banks and companies fail,'' said Jeffrey Garten, a professor at the Yale School of Management and a top official in the Clinton administration. ''We warned that there was great moral hazard if governments just bailed them out.''
 ''And now,'' he said, ''we are doing the polar opposite of our advice.''

HEADLINE: Melding Obama's Web to a YouTube Presidency

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Lyle McIntosh gave everything he could to Barack Obama's Iowa campaign. He helped oversee an army that knocked on doors, distributed fliers and held neighborhood meetings to rally support for Mr. Obama, all the while juggling the demands of his soybean and corn farm.
 Asked last week if he and others like him were ready to go all-out again, this time to help President Obama push his White House agenda, Mr. McIntosh paused.
 ''It's almost like a football season or a basketball season -- you go as hard as you can and then you've got to take a breather between the seasons,'' he said, noting he found it hard to go full-bore during the general election. 
 Mr. McIntosh's uncertainty suggests just one of the many obstacles the White House faces as it tries to accomplish what aides say is one of their most important goals: transforming the YouTubing-Facebooking-texting-Twittering grass-roots organization that put Mr. Obama in the White House into an instrument of government. That is something that Mr. Obama, who began his career as a community organizer, told aides was a top priority, even before he was elected. 
 His aides -- including his campaign manager -- have created a group, Organizing for America, to redirect the campaign machinery in the service of broad changes in health care and environmental and fiscal policy. They envision an army of supporters talking, sending e-mail and texting to friends and neighbors as they try to mold public opinion.
 The organization will be housed in the Democratic National Committee, rather than at the White House. But the idea behind it -- that the traditional ways of communicating with and motivating voters are giving way to new channels built around social networking -- is also very evident in the White House's media strategy. 
 Like George W. Bush before him, Mr. Obama is trying to bypass the mainstream news media and take messages straight to the public. 
 The most prominent example of the new strategy is his weekly address to the nation -- what under previous presidents was a speech recorded for and released to radio stations on Saturday mornings. Mr. Obama instead records a video, which on Saturday he posted on the White House Web site and on YouTube; in it, he explained what he wanted to accomplish with the $825 billion economic stimulus plan working its way through Congress. By late Sunday afternoon, it had been viewed more than 600,000 times on YouTube.
 The White House also faces legal limitations in terms of what it can do. Perhaps most notably, it cannot use a 13-million-person e-mail list that Mr. Obama's team developed because it was compiled for political purposes. That is an important reason Mr. Obama has decided to build a new organization within the Democratic Party, which does not have similar restrictions.
 Still, after months of discussion, aides said the whole approach remained a work in progress, even after Friday, when the organizers e-mailed a link to a video to those 13 million people announcing the creation of Organizing for America. Mr. Obama's aides know they have a huge resource to harness, but fundamental questions remain about how it will run and precisely what organizers are hoping to accomplish.
 ''This has obviously never been undertaken before,'' David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager and one of the organizers of this effort, said in the video sent to supporters. ''So it's going to be a little trial and error.''
 Even with that video, in addition to one sent earlier in the president's name, the organization does not have a fully developed Web site, evidence, some of Mr. Obama's advisers said, of just how murky the mission is.
 Mr. Plouffe said the group had not settled on a budget or begun serious fund-raising. The goal is to have a relatively small staff, with representatives in most, if not every, state, and to make up any shortfall in personnel with the use of technology. 
 There is a clear interest in keeping the Internet-based political machinery that made Mr. Obama's brand so iconic and that helped him raise record amounts. The new group's initials, O.F.A., conveniently also apply to his Obama for America campaign. And the desire for the Obama organization to live on was voiced in a meeting of organizers in Chicago after Election Day, and echoed at 4,800 house meetings in December and in a survey completed by 500,000 Obama supporters.
 Still, sensitive to ruffling feathers even among fellow Democrats wary of Mr. Obama's huge political support, Mr. Obama's aides emphasized that the effort was not created to lobby directly or pressure members of Congress to support Mr. Obama's programs. 
 ''This is not a political campaign,'' Mr. Plouffe said. ''This is not a 'call or e-mail your member of Congress' organization.'' 
 Instead, Mr. Plouffe said the aim was to work through influential people in various communities as a way of building public opinion.
 ''So it's: 'Here's the president's speech today on the economy. Here are some talking points,' '' he said. ''This was a very under-appreciated part of our campaign. If someone who has never been involved in politics before -- or is an independent or a Republican -- makes this case with their circle of people, that has more impact.''
 The operation is being run from borrowed desks on the third floor of the D.N.C. headquarters on Capitol Hill, led by organizers chosen, Mr. Plouffe said, because of skills they demonstrated during the campaign. The head of the group is Mitch Stewart, a low-key operative who helped run Mr. Obama's effort in three critical states -- Iowa and Indiana in the primary season and Virginia in the general election. Another important person in the operation is Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, the new executive director of the Democratic National Committee, who was the battleground states director for Mr. Obama in his campaign.
 And there will be clear coordination between this independent operation at the Democratic National Committee and a communications arm being set up at the White House, under Macon Phillips, the ''new media'' director for Mr. Obama's administration. 
 Mr. Phillips was an Internet strategist with Blue State Digital, a private firm closely tied to Mr. Obama's campaign. His team signaled the new direction Mr. Obama is bringing with a redesigned White House Web site that was introduced shortly after Mr. Obama was sworn in and is modeled after his campaign site. It will be continually updated to add presidential orders and blog postings that make the case for administration policy, often echoed by talking points that Organizing for America is sending to supporters.
 In an interview, Mr. Phillips, 30, said the site would give the White House another way to reach the public without having to rely on the mainstream news media.
 ''Historically the media has been able to draw out a lot of information and characterize it for people,'' he said. ''And there's a growing appetite from people to do it themselves.''
 The approach is causing some concern among news media advocates, who express discomfort with what effectively could become an informational network reaching 13 million people, or more, with an unchallenged, governmental point of view. 
 ''They're beginning to create their own journalism, their own description of events of the day, but it's not an independent voice making that description,'' said Bill Kovach, the chairman of the Committee of Concerned Journalists. ''It's troublesome until we know how it's going to be used and the degree to which it can be used on behalf of the people, and not on behalf of only one point of view.''
 The undertaking will require Mr. Obama's aides to wedge technology that worked for them in the campaign into the infrastructure of the White House, with its relatively older technology and security restrictions. Where Mr. Obama's campaign was free to use Facebook, instant messaging and Twitter, among other forms of communication, the White House faces more constraints. With every note part of the historical record, and new scrutiny on every communication, staff members are unable to access public instant messaging accounts and social networking sites from their desks.
 The administration's Web team has a YouTube channel, but it is already exhibiting the dangers for a White House in the Wild West of the Internet: a page showing Mr. Obama's inauguration address is littered with offensive commentary from users.
 In campaigns, candidates control multimillion-dollar advertising budgets and organizations in 50 states. When they take office, they have had to put their own stamp on existing party organizations, and to rely largely on the news media to communicate with the public. Though he comes to the task with the advantage of a team that proved innovative in using technology and communications advances to reshape electoral politics, Mr. Obama's challenge is not totally different from the one that faced his predecessors.
 ''The problem that you have is, you come off a campaign -- where there is an infrastructure and a director in every state -- and then you have nothing,'' said Sara Taylor, a White House political director for Mr. Bush. ''You have allied organizations, but they don't report to you, so you're relying on allies to be supportive when you don't have control of those organizations.''
 Mr. Obama's aides acknowledged that after two long years there were also some concerns about ''list fatigue.'' Mr. Obama, the party and the inaugural committee have reached out to his supporters on the e-mail list so frequently -- for money, for input, for help in persuading their neighbors to vote -- that some want to give it a rest before cranking it up again. 
 Even some of Mr. Obama's most enthusiastic foot soldiers understand the sentiment. 
 ''It's kind of like we're spent right now,'' said Dr. Robert Gitchell, who campaigned for Mr. Obama in Ames, Iowa. But, ''once that fire is lit'' in supporters, he said, ''it's easy to trigger them all again.''

HEADLINE: OBAMA'S ORDER LIKELY TO TIGHTEN AUTO STANDARDS

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and PETER BAKER; Felicity Barringer contributed reporting from Palo Alto, Calif.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama will direct federal regulators on Monday to move swiftly on an application by California and 13 other states to set strict automobile emission and fuel efficiency standards, two administration officials said Sunday.
 The directive makes good on an Obama campaign pledge and signifies a sharp reversal of Bush administration policy. Granting California and the other states the right to regulate tailpipe emissions would be one of the most emphatic actions Mr. Obama could take to quickly put his stamp on environmental policy.
 Mr. Obama's presidential memorandum will order the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider the Bush administration's past rejection of the California application. While it stops short of flatly ordering the Bush decision reversed, the agency's regulators are now widely expected to do so after completing a formal review process.
 Once they act, automobile manufacturers will quickly have to retool to begin producing and selling cars and trucks that get higher mileage than the national standard, and on a faster phase-in schedule. The auto companies have lobbied hard against the regulations and challenged them in court. 
 Mr. Obama will use the announcement to bolster the impression of a sharp break from the Bush era on all fronts, following his decisions last week to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; tighten limits on interrogation tactics by Central Intelligence Agency officers; order plans to withdraw combat forces from Iraq; and reverse President George W. Bush's financing restrictions on groups that promote or provide abortion overseas, administration officials said. 
 Beyond acting on the California emissions law, officials said, Mr. Obama will direct the Transportation Department to quickly finalize interim nationwide regulations requiring the automobile industry to increase fuel efficiency standards to comply with a 2007 law, rules that the Bush administration decided at the last minute not to issue. 
 To avoid losing another year, Mr. Obama will order temporary regulations to be completed by March so automakers have enough time to retool for vehicles sold in 2011. Final standards for later years will be determined by a separate process that under Mr. Obama's order must take into consideration legal, scientific and technological factors.
 He will also order federal departments and agencies to find new ways to save energy and be more environmentally friendly. And he will highlight the elements in his $825 billion economic stimulus plan intended to create jobs around renewable energy.
 The announcements, to be made in the East Room, will begin a week of efforts to get the stimulus plan through Congress. The White House hopes the Senate will confirm Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary on Monday, and Mr. Obama plans to travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with both Senate and House Republican caucuses and lobby for his stimulus package. Mr. Obama's aides expect the House to vote on its plan on Wednesday.
 But the centerpiece of Monday's anticipated announcement is Mr. Obama's directive to the Environmental Protection Agency to begin work immediately on granting California a waiver, under the Clean Air Act, which allows the state, a longtime leader in air quality matters, to set standards for automobile emissions stricter than the national rules.
 California has already won numerous waivers for controls on emissions that cause smog, as opposed to global warming. 
 The Bush administration denied the waiver in late 2007, saying that recently enacted federal mileage rules made the action unnecessary and that allowing California and the 13 other states the right to set their own pollution rules would result in an unenforceable patchwork of environmental law.
 The auto companies had advocated a denial, saying a waiver would require them to produce two sets of vehicles, one to meet the strict California standard and another that could be sold in the remaining states.
 The Bush administration's environmental agency director, Stephen L. Johnson, echoed the automakers' claims in denying California's application, ignoring the near-unanimous advice of agency lawyers and scientists that the waiver be granted.
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, wrote to Mr. Obama last week asking him to swiftly reconsider Mr. Bush's decision. The head of California's Air Resources Board, Mary D. Nichols, also wrote to the new director of the environmental agency, Lisa P. Jackson, asking for a quick reversal of the Bush policy.
 Ms. Nichols said Sunday night that she had not been formally notified that Mr. Obama intended to move toward granting the waiver. But she said, ''Assuming that it is favorable to our request, we're delighted that the president is acting so quickly to reverse one of the worst decisions by the Bush administration and to get the E.P.A. back on track.''
 Ms. Jackson indicated in her confirmation hearing this month that she would ''aggressively'' review California's application. The environmental agency has routinely granted California such waivers dozens of times over the past 40 years.
 The California law, which was originally meant to take effect in the 2009 model year, requires automakers to cut emissions by nearly a third by 2016, four years ahead of the federal timetable. The result would be an increase in fuel efficiency in the American car and light truck fleet to roughly 35 miles per gallon from the current average of 27.
 The emissions standards are part of an ambitious California plan to reduce emissions of the gases that are blamed for the heating of the atmosphere. Automotive emissions account for more than one-fifth of all such greenhouse gases.
 California was joined in its plea by 13 other states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Washington. Three other states have indicated they plan to adopt the California standard. Together they account for about half of the American market for cars and light trucks.
 Charles Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the car makers would prefer a single national standard and needed time to develop new fuel-sipping models. ''Applying California standards to several different states would create a complex, confusing and very difficult situation for manufacturers,'' he said last week in anticipation of the Obama administration's announcement.
 Mr. Obama wants to use the Monday event to promote the environmental and energy elements of his economic plan, aides said. According to a report released by the White House this weekend, the plan is intended to double renewable energy generating capacity over three years, which would be enough to power six million American homes. 
 It would also pay for 3,000 miles of new or modernized transmission lines as part of a new national electric grid as well as 40 million ''smart meters,'' which provide instant readouts of electricity uses, on American homes. The money would also help refurbish two million homes and 75 percent of federal building space to better guard against the weather and conserve enough energy to save low-income families $350 a year and the federal government $2 billion a year, according to the report.
 The White House also said that Mr. Obama wanted to start a ''clean energy finance initiative'' to leverage $100 million in private sector investments over the next three years through loan guarantees and other financial support.
 Environmentalists and California Democrats had pressed hard for the tougher automotive standards. Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress in Washington, plans to attend Monday's announcement and said he was pleased by the quick action.
 ''This is a complete reversal of President Bush's policy of censoring or ignoring global warming science,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''With the fuel economy measures and clean energy investments in the recovery package, President Obama has done more in one week to reduce oil dependence and global warming than George Bush did in eight years.''
 The California rules would not take effect immediately, but would require several months of legal review and public comment. The auto companies could challenge them in court, but they have been unsuccessful in previous lawsuits.
 The Clean Air Act allows California to seek a waiver from federal rules if it can demonstrate that its own regulations are more stringent, and needed to address its air pollution problems. California's trend-setting air resources board has done this successfully more than 50 times. Other states can adhere to either the California or the federal standard.

HEADLINE: With His Senator Chosen, Paterson Tries to Move On

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON; Joel Stonington contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson appeared eager to put the widely maligned process of selecting New York's new senator behind him during a brief press conference on Sunday in Manhattan, when he praised his selection, Kirsten E. Gillibrand. 
 He also explained his decision to travel to a global economic meeting in Switzerland this week, saying he had decided in December to attend. The governor's remarks followed a lunch with Ms. Gillibrand; her predecessor, Hillary Rodham Clinton; and Senator Charles E. Schumer at the Waldorf-Astoria. They discussed foreign and economic affairs, Governor Paterson said. 
 The governor has been criticized for his office's handling of the appointment, particularly after Caroline Kennedy, who had been considered a top contender, withdrew from consideration on Wednesday. On Friday, Mr. Paterson said of the process, ''In retrospect, I wish I had not showed all of you the wrestling match.'' 
 But that tone was not in evidence on Sunday, when the governor took two questions before leaving the hotel for a ceremony. The first question regarded the criticism of the treatment of Ms. Kennedy's candidacy. 
 ''Caroline Kennedy called me on Wednesday, whatever date Wednesday was, Jan. 21, to inform me that for personal reasons she had to withdraw,'' he said. ''She had gotten no signal from me that she had to withdraw.''
 He added: ''She is a great New Yorker. She is a great friend of mine and there is nothing that would have prohibited her from serving.'' 
 Regarding Ms. Gillibrand, a congresswoman from upstate, he said she was off to a good start by traveling to places where she is little known, including Harlem and Queens. 
 The second question involved Mr. Paterson's trip to Davos, Switzerland, which his office announced on Saturday. Much of the five-day forum will focus on how countries and central banks can address the global downturn, and Mr. Paterson said the United States stood to gain by lending money to other countries. 
 ''There's an immense opportunity if we use some of those resources to try and make loans available to other countries,'' he said. ''It would give us bigger resources for the taxpayers.'' 
 ''There's a desire to have leaders from around the country be in Davos to talk about the interests of a lot of countries right now whose exports are limited,'' he said, before leaving the hotel. 
 The press conference was held in a small hallway outside the restaurant Oscar's, where the quartet sat down at 1:30 p.m. Ms. Gillibrand is set to be sworn in on Tuesday in Washington. 
 Neither Senator Schumer nor Mrs. Clinton appeared at the news conference. Ms. Gillibrand continued taking questions after the governor left. Addressing critics who have said she is lax on gun control, she said she would be flexible and consider the concerns of what is now her statewide constituency. 
 Ms. Gillibrand said that her upstate district had a strong tradition of hunting and that although she supported gun control, she did not want to take rights away from hunters. 
 ''I very much believe in protecting hunters' rights,'' she said. 
 Mrs. Clinton had offered her advice on how to be an effective senator. The bulk of it, Ms. Gillibrand said, was about how to organize her office to best serve the many requests that come from constituents across the state. She said she would follow Mrs. Clinton's example and ''hit the ground running.''
 Ms. Gillibrand also spoke of developing a plan for high-speed rail service to Montreal and to Buffalo, and emphasized her availability to those who are not familiar with her. 
 ''You will see me wherever you want to see me,'' she said. As if to underscore this message, when she left, she walked the long way through the Waldorf, stopping to talk to members of the public.

Accounts
 Saatchi & Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe, lost two creative assignments to other Publicis agencies. The Procter & Gamble Company, Cincinnati, shifted the creative duties for Crest oral care products in Europe and North America from Saatchi & Saatchi to the Publicis Worldwide unit of Publicis. Spending was estimated at $200 million. And General Mills, Golden Valley, Minn., shifted the creative duties for Totino's frozen pizzas from Saatchi & Saatchi to Fallon Worldwide, Minneapolis, part of the SSF Group unit of Publicis. Spending was estimated by Advertising Age at $20 million to $25 million.
 Chrysler, Auburn Hills, Mich., owned by Cerberus Partners, returned the national creative duties for its Jeep brand to the Troy, Mich., office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. The assignment, with spending estimated at $125 million, was shifted in April 2007 to another Omnicom agency, Cutwater, San Francisco. The decision reunites the Jeep creative account; when the national duties were shifted to Cutwater, BBDO had retained the creative duties for dealer ads and direct marketing. BBDO also handles the creative duties for the Dodge and Chrysler brands sold by Chrysler. 
 The Burger King Corporation, Miami, named two agencies to handle the creative and media accounts for campaigns aimed at Hispanic consumers, with spending estimated at $30 million to $40 million. LatinWorks, Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group, becomes the creative agency and Tapestry, Chicago, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe, becomes the media planning and buying agency. The creative and media accounts had been handled by Bromley Communications, San Antonio, part of Publicis.
 Newell Rubbermaid, Atlanta, selected the Salt Lake City office of the McCann Worldgroup, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as global creative agency of record for its technology global business unit, covering brands like CardScan, Dymo and Mimio sold in 36 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. Spending was estimated by Adweek at $20 million. Previously the brands had worked with various local agencies and freelancers. 
 The Illinois Lottery named Energy BBDO -- the Chicago office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group -- as its creative agency. The account, with spending estimated at $18 million, had been at the Chicago office of JWT, part of WPP. 
 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Denver, chose Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners, Sausalito, Calif., as its advertising agency of record. The account, with spending estimated at $10 million, had been handled by DeVito/Verdi, New York.
 People
 John Seifert, chairman for the global brand community at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, New York, part of WPP, was promoted to a new post, chairman for Ogilvy North America. The appointment is part of a reorganization that eliminates a dual-manager structure that had been in place for the North America operations. Previously, Bill Gray and Carla Hendra had been co-chief executives for North America. Now, Mr. Gray is being shifted to a new post, vice chairman for North America. Ms. Hendra becomes the sole chief executive for North America, reporting to Mr. Seifert rather than to Miles Young, chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather; she continues as chairwoman for the Ogilvy New York office.
 Marty Orzio joined Gotham, New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as chief creative officer as part of a series of executive hires by the new chairman and chief executive, Peter McGuinness. Mr. Orzio had most recently been chief creative officer at Energy BBDO, the Chicago office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group; he left there in April to return to New York, where he had worked for agencies like Lowe Worldwide and Merkley & Partners.
 Logan Wilmont joined People Ideas and Culture, a new agency opened by Domenico Vitale, as chief idea architect, based in London. Mr. Wilmont was most recently executive creative director at the London office of Draft FCB, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Mr. Vitale, who also has the title chief idea architect, is based in New York; he recently left Lowe Worldwide to open People Ideas and Culture, which is operating in partnership with Bond N.Y., a design agency.
 Miscellany
 DentsuNext, part of the Dentsu Holdings USA division of Dentsu, is being closed. The accounts handled by the agency's offices in Brea, Calif., and New York, which included Sharp Electronics and Suzuki motorcycles, will be shifted to other Dentsu agencies like McGarryBowen.
 The retail sales of licensed merchandise in the United States and Canada fell 14 percent in 2008 compared with the previous year, according to an annual survey by The Licensing Letter newsletter, published by EPM Communications, New York. The total last year of $59.1 billion was the first time in 20 years that consumers spent less than $60 billion on merchandise licensed by sports teams, entertainment companies, celebrities and consumer companies.
 Play, Richmond, Va., founded in 1990 by Andy Stefanovich, was acquired by Prophet, San Francisco. Financial terms were not disclosed. Play becomes the Richmond office of Prophet and Mr. Stefanovich becomes a senior partner at Prophet.
 In a newspaper advertisement last week, Philip H. Geier Jr., chairman emeritus of the Interpublic Group of Companies, offered a plan to revive the economy. Mr. Geier, now chairman at the Geier Group, New York, a consulting company, proposed that the federal government reduce taxes by issuing certified checks to consumers offering discounts on merchandise like autos, computers and groceries.

HEADLINE: Technology Gets a Piece Of Stimulus

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The time-tested way for governments to create jobs in a hurry is to pour money into old-fashioned public works projects like roads and bridges. President Obama's economic recovery plan will do that, but it also has some ambitious 21st century twists.
 The $825 billion stimulus plan presented this month by House Democrats called for $37 billion in spending in three high-tech areas: $20 billion to computerize medical records, $11 billion to create smarter electrical grids and $6 billion to expand high-speed Internet access in rural and underserved communities. 
 A study published this month, which was prepared for the Obama transition team, concluded that putting $30 billion into those three fields could produce more than 900,000 jobs in the first year. The mix of proposed spending is different in the House plan, but the results would be similar, said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which did the study.
 Beyond creating jobs, advocates say, government investment in these technology fields holds the promise of laying a lasting foundation for more business innovation and efficiency, while helping to create new digital industries. 
 ''The appeal of these kinds of investments is that you not only get the stimulative effect but also build a platform for productivity gains and long-term growth,'' said Blair Levin, a former senior official at the Federal Communications Commission who was a technology policy adviser on the Obama transition team.
 During the campaign and afterward, Mr. Obama has championed policies to promote electronic health records, better broadband networks and power grids that use computers and sensors to fine-tune electricity use. 
 But the standard for including any initiative in the economic recovery plan is that it be ''timely, targeted and temporary,'' while also creating jobs, Mr. Levin said recently in an address to the Congressional Internet Caucus, an advisory group. Not every investment in these technology fields, he said, fits those criteria. 
 The technology industry is not typically viewed as a prolific job producer. Much of its manufacturing is highly automated. But bringing technology to services fields like health care, telecommunications and energy can be labor intensive and thus generate jobs.
 At the top of the jobs pyramid, the design of new technology is done by scientists and engineers with advanced degrees. The installing, tweaking and maintaining of that technology in specific industries involve a far broader base of workers with a range of training, skills and education. 
 ''There is a huge implementation phase to the adoption and use of these kinds of technologies locally,'' said John Irons, an economist and research director at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ''The jobs involved do tend to span the spectrum of skills and income levels. And they are not going to be outsourced offshore.''
 The job-generation estimate by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation translates into more than 30,000 jobs created for each $1 billion of government investment -- roughly similar to projections for public works spending.
 But proponents of spending on digital infrastructure say the beneficial spillover effects are greater than for conventional public works. The high-tech investments, they say, can be the contemporary equivalent of federal financing for highways in the 1950s, which fostered the growth of businesses like automakers and national retail chains.
 For years, technology policy in the United States has focused mainly on broad measures like federal spending on basic research and tax credits for private investment in research and development. Mr. Obama has vowed to increase spending on basic research and make R.& D. tax credits permanent.
 But the administration's plan for large programs tailored to specific industries is a departure. How investments and incentives are structured, experts say, will be crucial to companies, consumers and taxpayers.
 The danger of such an approach, some economists warn, is that industry-specific government programs can tilt markets to the advantage of some companies and disadvantage of others, putting Washington on the path of picking winners and losers.
 The other criticism is that, while these projects may be worthy for the long term, they should not be part of a short-term economic recovery plan.
 All three fields, said Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford, involve ''a bunch of specialists, where if we raised spending quickly, the limited number of competent suppliers would be in short supply and get increased incomes,'' benefiting some companies more than the economy as a whole.
 ''We should not pour government money into these areas,'' said Mr. Hall, who is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative research group.
 The issues surrounding electronic health records illustrate the policy challenges of targeted programs. Mr. Obama has advocated spending $50 billion over five years to accelerate the use of such records and the sharing of health information across a national network. 
 The computerized records, when used properly, are an indispensable tool for measuring, tracking and improving patient care -- yet only about 17 percent of the nation's doctors are using them. They are commonplace at large medical groups, but 75 percent of doctors practice in small offices of 10 physicians or fewer. 
 Doctors often benefit from inefficiency, because the dominant fee-for-service payment system means they are paid for doing more -- more doctor visits, tests, surgical procedures, pills.
 ''Paying to put computer hardware and software in physicians' offices isn't going to do anything unless you change the incentives in the system,'' said Dr. David J. Brailer, former national health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration.
 There are some experiments with a pay-for-performance approach, in which Medicare gives medical groups bonus payments for meeting certain benchmarks of quality care. Monitoring that performance requires electronic health records. Yet to date, these have been isolated tests.
 ''You want to pay for achievement -- better health quality and efficiency,'' said Dr. David Blumenthal, director of the Institute for Health Policy at the Harvard Medical School, who advised the Obama campaign. ''But in the transition period, before financial incentives are reformed, you need to provide incentives or grants to use electronic health records because this technology is sort of the opening wedge to reform.''
 Those eligible for grants to buy technology, a member of the Obama transition team said, will include inner-city and rural hospitals and small doctor practices. But most money, he said, will go to incentive payments to improve quality and safety of care. 
 Still, creating effective programs to accelerate the use of health information to improve care will be difficult. And the move toward a national health information network, where patient data is more widely shared among providers and insurers, must include strong safeguards to address concerns about the privacy of personal health information, if Congress is to approve the proposed financing. 
 Some health experts say a shortage of skilled people is a bottleneck in any rapid push toward electronic records.
 In suburban Philadelphia, Greg Beese is head of the Logic Group, a 15-person technology support firm, whose clients include 15 doctors' offices. He says he looks forward to an acceleration of the use of electronic health records. A person with solid technology skills, he said, can master the health care knowledge in a couple of months on the job. ''It's not like we'd have to send them back to school for two years.''

HEADLINE: Arts Leaders Urge Role for Culture in Economic Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
As the Obama administration tackles the challenge of shoring up the economy through infusions of capital and job creation, cultural leaders are urging the president not to forget arts institutions, which are also reeling from the market downturn.
 ''We wanted to make sure arts were not left out of the recovery,'' said Robert L. Lynch, president of Americans for the Arts, a national lobbying group. ''The artist's paycheck is every bit as important as the steelworker's paycheck or the autoworker's paycheck.'' 
 For the moment eyes are largely turned to the National Endowment for the Arts. Dana Gioia, the outgoing chairman, officially stepped down on Inauguration Day and President Obama has not yet named his successor.
 In Congress the American Recovery and Reinvestment bill, approved last week by the House Appropriations Committee, includes a $50 million supplement for the N.E.A. to distribute directly to nonprofit arts organizations and also through state and local arts agencies. 
 The bill is expected to go to the full House for a vote on Wednesday before proceeding to the Senate. It could reach the president's desk as early as mid-February, an N.E.A. spokeswoman said. 
 Arts groups, meanwhile, are urging federal departments like Transportation or Labor to factor culture into their financing. A transportation enhancement program, for example, could pay artists for related public artworks; through the Labor Department displaced arts professionals could receive new training to stay in the work force. ''Every one of these places is a vehicle through which the money is going to flow, and we want to make sure the arts is part of it,'' Mr. Lynch said. 
 Much of the clamor arises from anticipation stirred by Mr. Obama's campaign remarks about the importance of the arts. One of the few candidates with an arts platform, he called for a young ''artist corps'' to work in low-income schools and neighborhoods; affordable health care and tax benefits for artists; and efforts at cultural diplomacy, like dispatching artist-ambassadors to other countries.
 The president is considering the establishment of an arts-and-culture portfolio within the White House's Domestic Policy Council, according to Bill Ivey, who served as the administration's transition-team leader for the arts and humanities, including the future of the N.E.A., the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
 Some cultural figures have even been calling for a cabinet-level arts czar. In a radio interview last fall on WNYC's ''Soundcheck,'' the music impresario Quincy Jones said that when he next spoke to Mr. Obama he would ''beg for a secretary of arts'' along the lines of the culture ministers in many European countries. His comment inspired an online petition that now has more than 199,500 signatures.
 Americans for the Arts has proposed appointing a senior-level administration official with an arts portfolio, along the lines of Leonard Garment of the Nixon administration, August Heckscher under John F. Kennedy or Roger L. Stevens under Lyndon B. Johnson. ''Someone to connect the dots,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''We don't have that right now.''
 But what arts executives are most eager for, they say, is additional direct financing and a president who sends the message that art is important. The country's 100,000 nonprofit arts groups employ some six million people and contribute $167 billion to the economy annually, Mr. Lynch said. ''I don't think of this as a bailout for the arts,'' he added. ''It's an economic investment in the arts.''
 Funds for the N.E.A. have declined to $145 million in fiscal year 2009 from $176 million in 1992. Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a New York Democrat who is co-chairwoman of the Congressional Arts Caucus, said she would seek more in the next fiscal year. ''I'm more encouraged than I've been in a very long time,'' she said of Mr. Obama. ''He has said many times how important the arts are to him.''
 Mr. Ivey is director of the Curb Center for Art, Enterprise and Public Policy at Vanderbilt University and a former N.E.A. chairman. ''There has never been an administration that looked at the cultural agencies as a partner in advancing big, overarching policy objectives,'' he said in an interview. ''That's a real unfulfilled opportunity and I think this administration is poised to do a better job.''
 On Jan. 15 Mr. Ivey convened a meeting of about 20 arts organizations at the transition team's headquarters in Washington. Among those attending were the chief executives of groups like the Association of Art Museum Directors, Chorus America and the National Association of Latino Arts and Culture.
 ''We were invited to talk about our ideas and hopes for the endowment,'' said Andrea Snyder, the executive director of Dance/USA, a national service organization. ''It was more than just, 'We need more money.' ''
 She said that she hoped the N.E.A. would focus on issues like health insurance for artists, ''how we support individual artists in this country, and reframing the importance of the arts in this society.''
 Since a Jan. 16 report in The Los Angeles Times much of the speculation about the agency's next chairman has focused on Michael C. Dorf, a lawyer who served on Mr. Obama's arts-policy team during the campaign and was an adviser to the transition. The newspaper described him as the leading candidate for the post. Mr. Dorf declined to comment on his candidacy. 
 As special counsel to the long-serving Illinois Congressman Sidney R. Yates, who died in 2000, Mr. Dorf helped develop national policies on arts financing. During the culture wars of the 1990s he advised an independent commission that sought to preserve the N.E.A. after accusations that it had supported some projects that ran counter to patriotic or moral ideals.
 Other possible N.E.A. candidates mentioned include Wynton Marsalis, the trumpeter and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center; Agnes Gund, president emerita of the Museum of Modern Art in New York; the Minnesota state Senator Richard J. Cohen; or a return of Mr. Ivey. It is unclear when the administration will make a selection, though some arts professionals said they expected a decision in the next few weeks.
 Arts groups said that they would seek to drive home the idea that culture is an economic engine. ''Arts jobs are jobs,'' said Marc A. Scorca, president and chief executive of Opera America. ''We see opera companies cutting health care, administrative staff -- these people are taxpayers and rent payers and mortgage payers, just like every other employee.''
 For many, the inaugural celebrations and the inauguration itself -- with Michelle Obama and her daughters dancing to pop music at the Kids' Inaugural, and Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman and others performing at the swearing-in -- demonstrated a new administration's recognition that culture matters. 
 Arts professionals sense that the Obama administration is ''open and desirous of partnering with the arts community,'' said Jesse Rosen, president and chief executive of the League of American Orchestras. 
 ''That bodes well for what will happen next,'' he said. ''It's important that our voices be heard.''

HEADLINE: Plotting Path in Congress For an Economic Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
President Obama has set out to curb Washington's huge influence industry. But Mr. Obama himself needs a state-of-the-art lobbying performance to make his economic program the start of something big.
 Few doubt that the new president, riding approval ratings around 70 percent and a wave of public anxiety about the economy, will win a stimulus package from Congress. Robust Democratic majorities in the House and Senate all but guarantee that.
 Instead, uncertainty surrounds how he will win. Mr. Obama's goals extend far beyond jump-starting the economy. Whether he can achieve them -- expanding health care, moving toward energy independence, transforming the capital's culture -- will partly turn on the good will and breadth of support he attracts at the outset from Republicans as well as fellow Democrats. 
 That process involves tradeoffs of economics and politics, testing the durability of partisan divisions, and the deftness of the Obama team.
 ''There will be bipartisan support,'' said Mr. Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of partisan wars on the Clinton White House staff and more recently as a member of Congress. But Mr. Emanuel hedged on the level of support, adding, ''There's no number that says it's bipartisan.''
 An Aisle Less Crossed
 The partisan alignment that allowed President Ronald Reagan to gain wide Democratic support for his 1981 tax and budget cuts no longer exists. Reagan's conservative Democratic backers and their successors gravitated toward the Republicans, widening the ideological gulf between the parties.
 Thus President George W. Bush received comparatively modest Democratic support for his 2001 tax cuts. President Bill Clinton failed to win a single Republican vote for his 1993 economic plan, which included tax increases.
 Yet Mr. Obama made bridging partisan polarization a theme of his campaign last year and his inauguration last week. He has underscored the point with assiduous outreach, including separate meetings this week with House and Senate Republicans.
 ''Obama has more of an imperative to do it,'' said Nick Calio, who lobbied Congress for both Presidents Bush. His early moves, Mr. Calio said, have been ''spot-on.''
 The moves have, however, yielded few obvious dividends so far. The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, has criticized a House proposal for $550 billion in stimulus spending as too much and for $275 billion in tax cuts as too little. Initial committee votes fell along party lines, even as Republicans are urging Mr. Obama to demonstrate greater independence from the liberal-leaning Democratic caucus under the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. 
 ''That doesn't make a lot of sense,'' responded Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. In a familiar refrain from recent House battles, Mr. Waxman added, ''Republicans haven't quite made the adjustment to their minority status.''
 Mr. Obama's legislative strategists -- led by a former Waxman aide, Phil Schiliro -- have seen more auspicious signs from the Senate, where the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Congress should meet the call by the White House to have a stimulus bill on the president's desk by mid-February. Senate consideration, and then negotiations between the two Congressional chambers, offer additional places for compromise.
 The contours of an endgame bid for greater Republican support are clear to the White House and lawmakers alike: Mr. Obama could accept Republican calls to shave marginal spending programs in favor of additional tax cuts.
 The question is how far would the president go in that direction, and whether that is worth doing.
 Is a Coalition Possible?
 If $275 billion in tax cuts cannot lure many Republicans, Democrats argue, there is little reason that adding $25 billion to $50 billion would help. Some Republican veterans concede that the cost for Mr. Obama in alienating Democrats might exceed the payoff.
 ''Obama can't change the dynamic of the House,'' said former Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, a Republican who retired last year. Republicans who back him, Mr. Davis said, ''will go back to their Lincoln Day dinners and get beat up by their base,'' making continued cooperation difficult. 
 ''If he gets a big bipartisan vote now, what does that get him a year from now?'' Mr. Davis asked. ''He's going to need his base.''
 That assessment reflects the confines of recent political history. Some argue that the atmosphere of the moment -- Mr. Obama's standing, the economic crisis, the public's desire for change -- may yet fuel a coalition broad and powerful enough for success on the scale of the New Deal under President Franklin D. Roosevelt or the Great Society under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
 ''Do the times permit a 1965 or 1933 type of legislative session?'' asked Howard Paster, who headed Congressional relations in the Clinton White House. ''I don't think we know yet.''
 On the stimulus package, Mr. Paster figures the president may garner 300 votes in the House and more than 70 in the Senate. Even in falling short, he said, Mr. Obama could ''win the battle on tone and style'' and court future support by demonstrating openness and flexibility.
 In an interview this month, Mr. Obama said he was ''looking for as much cooperation as possible.'' But aware that his economic policies would be judged on their effectiveness, he noted that his decisions on the final stimulus package would turn on ''what gets the job done.''
 Of course, Republicans and Democrats disagree on what works. As Mr. Obama weighs competing ideas over the next several weeks, he and his aides will face close calls involving political art and economic science.
 ''There will be an interesting dynamic between the economic team and the political team,'' said Joel Johnson, a legislative strategist in the Clinton White House. ''There's like a legislative Newton's Law: for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
 ''The president's popularity won't finish the job.''

NEW YORK
 DAYBOOK
 Party Is Over, Obama
 Tuesday. Wait a minute. Listen. There it is: the subtle sound of the media dropping their tambourines and picking up magnifying glasses for the typical round of presidential micro-observation. Barack Obama has been in office for only a week, but the tone of the coverage has started shifting, from the classically exhilarated to the instinctively skeptical. No one can begrudge the press for looking toward a dark and stormy future. But even the lowliest among us usually gets a honeymoon of at least 10 days. 
 '80s Music Redux
 Thursday, 9 p.m. Like many things that now seem out of date -- Reaganism, say -- Depeche Mode, the British synthpop band, arrived in 1980, a year best left forgotten. Then again, where punishment is concerned, you can always find a glutton, like the Depeche Mode New York Fan Club, which is hosting a bash to celebrate the band's new tour. With all due respect to supporters, the time for ''People Are People'' has likely long since past. 310 Lounge, 310 Bowery, Manhattan.
 Beware That Left Jab
 Saturday, 10 p.m. It's safe to say that with the Bush era behind us, the American Macho -- responsible for Blackwater and ''Mission Accomplished''-- is on the wane. Beyond firehouses and military bases, the one place where it actually still exists is in the Ultimate Fighting Championships, the mixed martial arts league that has replaced the prize fight as America's favorite blood sport. Machismo is a white blood cell: it appears where it is needed. And it surely will be when BJ Penn and Georges St.-Pierre meet in a match to pick the best pound-for-pound fighter in the league. Watch on pay-per-view. Southern Hospitality, 1460 Second Avenue, Manhattan.
 Nachos, Beer, Football
 Sunday, 6 p.m. Then there is the Super Bowl, the one sporting event that even nonsports fans like to watch. It's culture, really, served with fatty helpings of Buffalo wings and nachos. Give in to the just-becauseness of the day and watch. ESPN Zone, 1472 Broadway, Manhattan.

HEADLINE: White House Pushing Stimulus Package

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON and PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Barack Obama and his top advisers sought over the weekend to broaden the appeal of his proposed $825 billion economic-stimulus package and to defend the way they are pushing it through Congress. But some senior Republicans said Sunday that as the stimulus plan stands, they would oppose it.
 The new administration has begun a campaign to build momentum behind the economic-stimulus plan and propel it to passage by mid-February. The White House released a report Saturday revealing details about the package, which would pay for a variety of projects, like laying 3,000 miles of transmission lines for a national electric grid, securing 90 major ports and guaranteeing health insurance for 8.5 million Americans in danger of losing coverage. 
 As the administration pressed for quick action, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. offered a bleak assessment of the current situation but predicted that the stimulus package would ultimately pass Congress with support from both parties. Speaking to Bob Schieffer on CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. Biden said of the economy, ''It's worse, quite frankly, Bob, then everyone thought it was, and it's getting worse every day.'' 
 ''There's no good news, and there's no good news on the horizon.'' 
 But he said that rapid Congressional action could begin to change that. ''I think you'll see a fairly strong vote across the board'' for the package in Congress, he said.
 Republicans have complained that the Obama administration has largely sidelined them, though the president met with some Republican lawmakers on Friday.
 But on Sunday, Senator John McCain of Arizona said that he would oppose the package as it now stands.
 ''The plan was written by the Democratic majority in the House, primarily, and so, yeah, I think there has to be major rewrite,'' Mr. McCain said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' Asked if that meant he would oppose it, he replied: ''I am opposed to most of the provisions in the bill; as it stands now, I would not support it.''
 Still, Mr. McCain, the recent Republican presidential candidate, said that he wanted to work with Mr. Obama and still believed that a compromise package could pass in February. 
 While saying that ''clearly we need to have serious negotiations,'' he added, ''I think we can sit down in three weeks and work hard and negotiate and come to some agreement, hopefully.''
 Representative John Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader, was also critical of the package, which he said relied too much on government spending -- and on spending that would produce results far too slowly, some for projects deemed dubious. As it stands, he said, ''We don't believe it's going to work,'' adding that ''a lot of Republicans will vote no.'' But Mr. Boehner held open a door to compromise, saying, ''At the end of the day, we want him to succeed, because America needs him to succeed.''
 Mr. Obama himself presented the argument for his plan on Saturday, in his first weekly video address as president, saying it would help students go to college, protect workers from losing health care, lower energy bills and modernize schools, roads and utilities.
 ''This is not just a short-term program to boost employment,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's one that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education, health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century.''
 The administration's plan to press the lobbying effort included the appearance Sunday by Vice President Biden on CBS and by Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, on NBC. 
 Mr. Obama, who played host to Congressional leaders from both parties on Friday and met with his economic team on Saturday, will visit Capitol Hill in the coming week to talk with Republican lawmakers on their home turf. But House Republicans are stiffening their resistance to the magnitude of spending in the plan developed by House Democrats on Mr. Obama's behalf to create or save more than three million jobs.
 About two-thirds of the $825 billion is reserved for spending and the rest for tax breaks. In the Republican response to the president's address Mr. Boehner called for deeper tax cuts instead. He is pushing a Republican plan to lower federal income tax rates in the two lowest brackets rather than provide a $500 per worker tax credit, as Mr. Obama wants to do. The Republican plan would also give tax breaks to small businesses, home buyers and the unemployed.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Campaign Adds a Get-Out-the-Vote Tactician

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Trying to rebuild the formidable ground operation that helped sweep him into office, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has hired Maura Keaney, a top aide to the speaker of the City Council, as head of field operations for his re-election campaign. 
 Ms. Keaney, 34, who has strong ties to organized labor, will be responsible for turning out voters for the Bloomberg campaign, which has already named a campaign manager, media strategist and voter analyst more than nine months before Election Day -- well ahead of his likely rivals. 
 Mr. Bloomberg just snatched up Ken Strasma, a consultant who researched voting patterns and preferences for the Obama presidential campaign.
 The appointment of Ms. Keaney and Mr. Strasma shows how aggressively the mayor's campaign -- known for expensive television advertisements and mailings -- intends to employ old-fashioned door-to-door tactics to get out the vote. ''We want to have a large, effective volunteer operation,'' Ms. Keaney said.
 Mr. Bloomberg is expected to face a spirited Democratic competitor in the general election this year, as the city's economy sputters and he is forced to make unpopular budget cuts. 
 The New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., and Representative Anthony D. Weiner, both Democrats, have vowed to run forceful, elbows-out campaigns against Mr. Bloomberg, who helped revise New York's 15-year-old term limits law so he could seek a third term. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, an independent, has already frustrated his opponents by recruiting top Democratic strategists, like Howard Wolfson, a media strategist for Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign, and Bradley Tusk, the new campaign manager who was a former deputy to Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois and an aide to the mayor during his first term. 
 Ms. Keaney, another Democrat, worked for two of Mr. Bloomberg's Democratic rivals in the 2001 mayor's race. But she warmed to Mr. Bloomberg during his first term in office, and briefly campaigned on his behalf during his 2005 re-election bid when the union she worked for, Unite Here, endorsed the mayor. 
 ''Mike Bloomberg's won me over,'' she said in an interview. ''He is an incredibly effective mayor and he surrounds himself with an effective team.''
 Ms. Keaney has worked on campaigns for Mrs. Clinton, Christine C. Quinn and Alan G. Hevesi. From 2002 to 2006, she was Unite Here's state and national political organizer.
 ''She is one of the very best field operators in politics,'' said Mr. Wolfson. 
 For the last three years, Ms. Keaney has worked as deputy chief of staff for Ms. Quinn, the Council speaker and a close political ally of Mr. Bloomberg's. Ms. Quinn, who considered running for mayor this year, bowed out after Mr. Bloomberg said he would seek a third term, and played a major role in assuring passage of the controversial legislation that allowed him -- and Ms. Quinn -- to seek re-election this fall. 
 Ms. Keaney's hiring as a senior Bloomberg staff member, slated for next month, could be seen as further evidence of a political partnership between the speaker and the mayor. 
 Ms. Keaney, however, played down the idea. ''I don't think this is evidence of anyone being joined at the hip,'' she said. ''It's simply a personal decision.''

HEADLINE: At Davos, Economic Crisis Culls the Guest List

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: GENEVA 

 BODY:
The titans of Wall Street no longer sit atop the magic mountain.
 Not long ago, at the World Economic Forum's annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, Richard S. Fuld Jr. of Lehman Brothers held forth on the state of the global economy before mesmerized journalists and cowering subordinates while other Wall Street stars mingled after-hours with the likes of Claudia Schiffer, the German supermodel.
 As business, government and nonprofit leaders trek up the peak originally made famous by Thomas Mann's novel, but now better known for the gabfest that begins Tuesday, star power is no longer in.
 This year, politicians, not corporate titans, are poised to be the big draw, echoing the broader power shift away from the free market as one government after another tries to prop up its sinking economy. 
 This time, the prototype of the jet-setting ''Davos Man'' may well be Gordon Brown, the dour British prime minister who spent last week staving off another round of bank failures in London.
 And with much of the financial system in Britain and the United States edging toward a government takeover, the 2009 agenda at Davos, ''Shaping the Post-Crisis World,'' seems to have concentrated minds on the here and now more than past themes like climate change and globalization.
 ''The pendulum has swung and power has moved back to governments,'' said Klaus Schwab, the German-born economics professor who founded the World Economic Forum in 1971 and has been its impresario ever since. ''This is the biggest economic crisis since Davos began.''
 The crisis, to be sure, is hurting some more than others. While Davos will draw about 2,500 participants -- roughly the same as last year -- it looks as if there will be many fewer members of the tasseled-loafer set strutting down the resort's snowy streets.
 The insurer American International Group, while still afloat, has dropped its top-tier sponsorship.
 Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, is sending his deputy. It looks as if Ms. Schiffer and Angelina Jolie, another celebrity from the glamour years of the boom, will also be absent.
 Even Bono, the rock star and social activist who has attended for the last three years, has other commitments: he and his band, U2, are releasing a new album.
 Coinciding with the Chinese New Year did not help either, Mr. Schwab acknowledged. But he says the absence of some Asian business executives will be made up for by the presence of Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister.
 Lehman, once a top-tier corporate ''strategic partner'' to the tune of 500,000 Swiss francs a year, is bankrupt, of course, and Mr. Fuld's invitation has disappeared with it. Even if he had wanted to come, Mr. Schwab crows, there is no room for has-beens at Davos.
 Some invitees do not want to test Mr. Schwab's hospitality.
 John A. Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, abruptly canceled after being pushed out on Thursday from a top job at Bank of America, which acquired Merrill last year. Mr. Thain, a Davos regular who once ran the New York Stock Exchange, was to have taken part in a panel on Jan. 31, ''The Bank of the Future.''
 For those still in the club, the private evening galas -- as much a part of the Davos experience as the high-minded daytime discussions -- will also lack the panache of yesteryear.
 Google, whose annual fete was known for vintage California champagne as well as tech glitterati, is toning down this year's festivities, as is Citigroup, which recently received a $45 billion bailout from Washington.
 Citigroup, now scaling back to a smaller Citicorp, still plans to send five formal participants to the conference, like others in the strategic partners circle. But the company has sharply reduced the army of other executives and support staff that usually accompanies them.
 Indeed, big banks and Wall Street firms have been busy checking with one another in recent weeks to gauge what is an appropriate level of hospitality and what might be considered excessive in today's bleak economic climate, according to one planner.
 Of course, when it comes to economizing at Davos, everything is relative. At B B Heli in Zurich, which provides helicopter service to Davos, business is still strong, but more passengers are opting for a single-engine copter rather than the faster twin-engine model, says Marcus Baumann, the general manager. So instead of $8,500 for the 45-minute flight, the cost is a mere $4,250. 
 Burda, the German publisher of Focus magazine and other publications, is also adapting. Its star-studded nightcap has always been a big draw, with Naomi Campbell as Burda's special guest last year and Ms. Schiffer the year before that.
 At the Burda party in 2007, journalists and corporate chieftains alike posed for pictures with the German supermodel as other awe-struck guests like Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, wandered nearby.
 Mr. Dimon and Mr. Schwarzman will be in Davos this year, but Burda is not bringing the supermodels, showcasing instead its annual digital media conference called DLD.
 ''People are reassessing what they do in Davos, and the organizers have encouraged sobriety and want to focus on the crisis,'' said Marcel Reichart, a managing director at Burda.
 What about stars? Instead of Ms. Schiffer, he offered up Guido Westerwelle, a prominent German politician who leads the Free Democratic Party.
 ''He might be a celebrity,'' Mr. Reichart said wanly, a trace of disappointment in his voice. ''This year the politicians are the real stars.''
 To Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which does research for the richest industrial democracies, ''Davos is reflecting what's happened in real life: the main protagonists and the ones setting the agenda are the political leaders.''
 Along with Gordon Brown and Wen Jiabao, other top political figures set to appear include Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. All together, the leaders of at least 40 countries will make it up the mountain, up from 27 last year and 20 in 2007.
 President Obama is a little too busy to attend, however.
 Lawrence H. Summers, director of the White House National Economic Council, and James L. Jones, the national security adviser, were originally supposed to attend, but withdrew late last week.
 Instead, the headliner from the White House will be Valerie Jarrett, a top White House aide who is a longtime confidante of both Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle. 
 Besides the politicians, another group of unlikely stars this week will be the economic doomsayers who have now emerged as prophets, like Nouriel Roubini of New York University and Robert J. Shiller of Yale. The two men are discussion leaders for a dinner Friday night that will focus on ''The Power of Fear in Times of Uncertainty.''
 For the Wall Streeters who are in attendance, talking with these two Cassandras may not be as much fun as chatting up Claudia, Angelina or Brad. But then again, it might finally help the World Economic Forum live up to its motto: Committed to Improving the State of the World.
 ''You come out of Davos feeling a little bit wiser,'' Mr. Gurria said. ''Or at least with the consolation that you are as confused as everyone else and don't feel so bad.''

HEADLINE: The Moment for National Service

 BODY:
President Obama used his Inaugural Address to summon the nation to ''a new era of responsibility'' and personal engagement to solve the nation's problems. He set an example by spending part of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday painting walls and furniture at a shelter for homeless teenagers. 
 As Mr. Obama recognizes, there are certain tasks that cannot be accomplished by volunteers showing up occasionally or contributing a few hours a week. Worthy service programs, like Teach for America, have too few slots to accommodate the rising number of applicants. 
 Now is the moment for the new president and Congress to harness the sense of idealism and unity evident amid the huge crowds that massed in the nation's capital by greatly expanding the opportunities for sustained and productive national and community service. 
 A smart blueprint for doing exactly that was just introduced in the Senate by Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah. Building on the ongoing success of AmeriCorps, Bill Clinton's signature domestic service program, and relying on its administrative framework, their Serve America Act would rapidly expand the number of full-time and part-time national service volunteers eligible for minimal living expenses and a modest educational stipend at the end of an intensive year of work by 175,000 from the current level of 75,000.
 The new positions would be devoted to meeting challenges in a handful of targeted areas: tackling the dropout crisis, strengthening schools, improving health care and economic opportunity in low-income communities, cleaning up parks, aiding efforts to boost energy efficiency, and responding to disasters and emergencies.
 The Serve America Act is structured to invite participation by people of all income levels and ages, including retirees. It would offer tax incentives for employers who allow employees to take paid leave for full-time service, and permit older individuals to transfer their education awards to a child or grandchild. A new Volunteer Generation Fund would help nonprofit groups recruit and manage an expanding pool of volunteers. 
 Much as President Franklin Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps during the early days of his first term in 1933, Mr. Obama should tell Congress he considers the Serve America Act a top priority. 
 Truly, there is no reason for delay. The measure largely fleshes out ideas that Mr. Obama promoted on the campaign trail and that are currently posted on his White House Web site. In his previous job representing Illinois in the Senate, Mr. Obama co-sponsored the bill when it was proposed at the end of the last Congress.
 Understandably, Mr. Obama is now concentrating on gaining quick passage of a $825 billion stimulus package aimed at creating new jobs and aiding the nation's ailing economy. At a price tag of about $5 billion over five years, the Serve America Act is an apt companion piece. 
 Its prompt approval would create tens of thousands of meaningful new positions for people ready to work hard for the public good, making tangible the ''spirit of service'' Mr. Obama spoke of in his Inaugural Address.

HEADLINE: Republicans Are Resistant to Obama's Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
Republicans plan to test President Barack Obama's commitment to bipartisanship as his $825 billion stimulus package heads to the floor of the House of Representatives this week, with the House Republican leader saying Sunday morning that many in his party will vote no unless there are significant changes to the plan.
 ''Right now, given the concerns that we have over the size of this package and all of the spending in this package, we don't think it's going to work,'' the House Minority Leader John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''And so if it's the plan that I see today, put me down in the no column.'' 
 While the plan can potentially pass the Democratic-dominated House without Republican support, it will continue to face opposition when it comes before the Senate, said Senator John McCain of Arizona, speaking on ''Fox News Sunday.'' At least two Republicans will need to approve the bill for a filibuster-proof majority vote of 60.
 Senator McCain, who lost the presidential election to Mr. Obama in November, said that he planned to vote no unless the bill were changed. 
 ''We need to make tax cuts permanent, and we need to make a commitment that there'll be no new taxes,'' Mr. McCain said. ''We need to cut payroll taxes. We need to cut business taxes.''
 ''We need to have a commitment that after a couple of quarters of G.D.P. growth that we will embark on a path,'' he said about the gross domestic product, ''to reduce spending to get our budget in balance.'' 
 The Republican objections came as President Obama dispatched his top economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, to the talk shows to defend aspects of the plan that have come under attack. More details about the stimulus package, the largest of its kind in the nation's history, have become clear this weekend, as Democrats released a more detailed list of the spending.
 Speaking on ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Summers, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said that the president was attempting to strike a balance between tax cuts and longer-term initiatives in the bill, like spending on renewable energy and college tuition assistance.
 President Obama has pledged that three-quarters of the fund will be spent out in the first 18 months, Mr. Summers said in defense of the plan.
 ''We believe that this is a properly sized approach to move the economy forward,'' he said.
 He also said that there might be additional assistance to banks beyond the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program already approved by Congress. Of Mr. Obama's plans for how the next $350 billion of TARP funding will be spent, he said, ''It's going to be very different than what you've seen so far,'' with an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and ''getting credit flowing again.'' 
 ''The next few months are, no question, going to be very, very difficult and it may be longer than that,'' Mr. Summers said.
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Sunday that he believed that the stimulus package would ultimately pass with ''fairly strong vote across the board.'' ''If you notice, roughly 40 percent of this entire package is tax cuts,'' the vice president said on CBS's ''Face the Nation.'' ''That's not what the Democrats wanted. And 60 percent of it is spending, economic stimulus. That's not what the Republicans wanted. But we've come a pretty long way already. So there will be, I'm sure, more compromise.''
 Mr. Boehner and other Republicans have taken issue with the large chunk of funding in the stimulus package -- some $300 billion all told -- that will go to shore up the budgets of states. That figure includes billions in state aid to education and such controversial pieces as millions in spending for family-planning initiatives.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking on ABC's ''This Week,'' said that the assistance to states was necessary, including the family-planning funds. 
 ''The family-planning services reduce cost,'' she said. ''The states are in terrible fiscal budget crisis now, and part of it, what we do for children's health, education, and some of those elements, are to help the states meet their financial needs.''
 She also said that House Democrats would consider Republican ideas, judging them ''by their ability to create jobs, to -- to help turn the economy around, to stabilize the economy, and to see how much they cost.'' 
 Ms. Pelosi said that if additional government funding to banks is required, the government should take an equity stake in banks that receive the funds so taxpayers could share in any gains as banks return to health.
 If Congress is strengthening the banks, she said, ''then the American people should get some of the upside of that strengthening.'' But the House Speaker repeatedly objected to the term ''nationalization'' in describing the government investments. 
 ''Change has to happen in terms of what is done -- what the transparency of it is, what the accountability of it is,'' she said. ''Only then would we be able to pass any additional funding.''

HEADLINE: City May Get $3.4 Billion From Federal Stimulus Bill

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New York City could receive at least $3.4 billion in federal aid as part of an economic stimulus bill being considered by Congress, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other officials announced during a news conference at City Hall on Sunday night. 
 The aid would be financed through a federal stimulus package, which President Obama has named the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan, that is expected to be as large as $825 billion.
 New York City's slice of the package could include $1.8 billion in Medicaid savings and at least $1.6 billion in education aid, officials said on Sunday night.
 At the news conference, Mayor Bloomberg, Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Charles B. Rangel said the aid would help to stem a growing city deficit that is estimated to rise to $11.3 billion over the next two years. More specifically, the bulk of the money would help defer the cost of the city's Medicaid contribution and would also be earmarked for building and repairing city schools and other education-related initiatives, they said.
 ''It's not going to solve all of our problems, not by a long shot,'' Mayor Bloomberg said. ''It's not going to eliminate all of the tough budget decisions we still have to make. But it will go a long ways toward avoiding some of the most drastic options that we would otherwise be facing.''
 The bill includes legislative provisions that would ensure that the city receive added financial relief for Medicaid programs. New York is one of 17 states where local governments share the Medicaid burden with the state, officials said. New York counties contribute about $7 billion to the state's Medicaid program, roughly 32 percent of the nonfederal share of the costs.
 In echoing the mayor's statements, Senator Schumer said of the bill, ''It's not a panacea, rather a silver lining in the dark economic cloud looming over our city and our metropolitan area.''
 Across the nation, the bill is expected to distribute about $86.6 billion in Medicaid relief as well as $40 billion in education aid, officials said.
 The stimulus package is expected to head to the floor of the House of Representatives this week, and the Obama administration is pushing to have the bill passed by the middle of next month.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Better Than Expected in December

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes posted an unexpected increase last month, closing out the worst year for the real estate market in more than a decade.
 The National Association of Realtors said Monday that sales of existing homes rose 6.5 percent to an annual rate of 4.74 million in December, from a downwardly revised pace of 4.45 million in November. 
 The results were better than expected. December's sales had been forecasted to fall to a pace of 4.4 million units, according to ThomsonReuters. 
 Buyers were taking advantage of dramatically lower prices, especially in distressed markets like California, Florida and Nevada, where foreclosures have swamped the market.
 The nationwide median sales price plunged to $175,400, down 15.3 percent from $207,000 a year ago. That was the lowest price since May 2003 and the biggest year-over-year drop on records going back to 1968.
 ''The economy just simply cannot recover as long as home prices continue to decline,'' said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, who called on lawmakers to include tax credits for home buyers in the economic recovery package being considered by Congress.
 For all of 2008, there were 4.9 million existing home sales, down more than 13 percent from a year earlier, and the lowest total since 1997.
 And another encouraging sign -- the number of unsold homes on the market in last month fell nearly 12 percent to 3.7 million. At the current sales pace, it would take 9.3 months to sell all the properties, down from 11.2 months in November.
 In another economic report, a private research group says its monthly forecast of economic activity rose unexpectedly in December, mostly because the flood of federal bailouts increased the money supply.
 The Conference Board's monthly forecast of economic activity increased 0.3 percent in December. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a 0.3 percent decline.
 The group's index of leading economic indicators had fallen 0.4 percent in November and a revised 1.0 percent in October.
 The index is designed to forecast economic activity in the next three to six months based on 10 economic components, including stock prices, building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours and initial claims for unemployment benefits.
 With most components falling steeply, the Conference Board said unemployment could rise to 9 percent from 7.2 percent as the country remains in an intense recession through spring.
 The Conference Board's leading economic index is about 5.0 percent lower than its most recent peak in July 2007. In the last six months, a separate Conference Board index has seen its largest decline since 1980.

HEADLINE: Corporate Jets Sitting Out This Year's Super Bowl

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
THE party isn't over for the Super Bowl this Sunday, but let's just say they're keeping it down. 
 ''It's sure not 2008 any more,'' said Nathan McKelvey, the chief executive officer of Jets.com, a company that books charter flights on private jets. 
 Last year, during Super Bowl weekend in Phoenix, Mr. McKelvey's company co-sponsored a fancy two-day party at the airport terminal used by many of the roughly 500 corporate jets that flew in for the game. Also, Jets.com booked 55 private jet packages, which often include transportation, game tickets, hotels and admission to various parties scheduled around the game. 
 This year's packages? ''We've had 13 so far,'' Mr. McKelvey said.
 PricewaterhouseCoopers is estimating that overall visitor spending during the Super Bowl weekend in the Tampa, Fla., area will be down this year to about $150 million, compared with nearly $200 million in the Phoenix area during last year's game weekend. 
 Lavish corporate spending for Super Bowl trips hit its stride about 2001. Back then, I wrote a column quoting Robert Tuchman, who runs Premier Corporate Events, a major sports event travel packaging company, as saying that ''there are companies that will pay $15,000 to $20,000 per person and bring 20 or 30 people'' to entertain.
 Those were the days, Mr. Tuchman said Monday. 
 ''There is definitely a difference this year in the euphoria,'' he said. ''I remember before the 2001 Super Bowl getting a call from one of the tech companies that was then up and coming, and now is probably out of business, saying: 'I will pay anything for the best seats in the house. I need to have my clients there -- it isn't a matter of cost.' ''
 Tickets to the Super Bowl, large numbers of which are scooped up by packagers as soon as they reach the so-called secondary market, are still expensive by anyone's reckoning. But they are nowhere near the prices of recent years. 
 Of course, in some years the competing teams simply draw from more ardent fan bases. 
 ''In Miami two years ago, ticket prices for a lower-level seat were $8,500 near game time,'' Mr. Tuchman said. ''You definitely will not see that this year. Now you can probably pick up a ticket for $1,800 or less.'' 
 The Super Bowl is one of several annual sports events (others include the Kentucky Derby, the United States Open golf tournament and the N.C.A.A. Final Four) that always draw a large number of corporate visitors, usually with clients in tow -- which, of course, makes the weekend into a tax-deductible business trip.
 But the business jet industry has been staggered lately not only by a bad economy, but also by a palpable public backlash against high-flying corporate jets. That was apparent last November when executives of Detroit's Big Three automakers flew in their private jets to Washington to ask for federal bailouts.
 Starting late last year, the use of corporate jets dropped sharply, as companies eliminated or curtailed flight departments and as individuals cut back on charter flights. After several years of record sales of new aircraft, the business jet industry now is deeply worried about a glut of used jets on the market.
 In December, according to data assembled by Aviation Research Group/U.S., a business aviation research company, there were 22.8 percent fewer departures from domestic airports of corporate aircraft -- including business jets and turbo props -- than in December 2007. 
 During the fall, companies ''were looking very closely at all of their expenses, the corporate flight department just being one of them,'' said Joe Moeggenberg, the president of Aviation Research Group. 
 ''But then, after the auto manufacturers showed up in Washington on their jets, I think a couple of companies felt it was politically correct to dismantle their flight departments, because that was perhaps what their stockholders were concerned about,'' Mr. Moeggenberg said. ''So it was sort of a double whammy.'' 
 He and others, incidentally, said they are seeing signs that business jet use is slowly starting to increase.
 With lots of jets sitting idle all around the country, anyone looking to charter a plane for the Super Bowl will find plenty available, said Mr. McKelvey, of Jets.com. 
 Commercial airline fares from Phoenix to Tampa and back for the weekend ranged the other day from about $660 to about $1,725, with most trips requiring a connecting flight.
 On the other hand, Jets.com recently booked a weekend Super Bowl round-trip flight on a large-cabin Challenger 604 for $60,254 round trip, Phoenix to Tampa.
 But the plane does seat up to 12, and it flies nonstop.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Moves to Cut 20,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The heavy equipment maker, Caterpillar, announced layoffs on Monday and warned of a tough year ahead as a downturn that began in the United States metastasized into a full-blown global recession, gutting orders for its earth-moving equipment. 
 The world's largest maker of construction and mining machines, which also reported lower-than expected fourth-quarter earnings, said on Monday it was laying off 17,000 workers, and buying out 2,500 others, to reduce costs in the face of what it predicted would be the weakest year for business since the end of WWII. The company said earlier that it was offering employees incentives to leave voluntarily, the company said.
 The company cut its outlook for 2009 and seemed to raise the possibility that it would report a loss in the current quarter.
 The news sent Caterpillar shares skidding 8 percent in premarket trading, pulling the broader market lower.
 In a statement, the chief executive, James W. Owens, said Caterpillar had been ''whipsawed'' by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices.
 He said the company had responded by encouraging dealers to align their inventory levels with falling volume and ''they responded with significant order cancellations, particularly in December.''
 The layoffs and buyouts, which will hit one in every 10 of the company's regular workers and idle 8,000 contract workers, represent the biggest wave of job cuts at Caterpillar since the early 1980s, when the company was losing about $1 million a day.
 In addition, the company said it was freezing salaries of most employees and significantly reducing the total compensation of executives and senior managers.
 ''It's just a very pessimistic outlook in terms of the world economy,'' said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, N.Y.. ''Clearly the building of global infrastructure has come to a grinding halt.''
 The company reported a fourth-quarter profit of $661 million, or $1.08 a share, compared with $975 million, or $1.50 a share, last year.
 Sales rose 6 percent to $12.92 billion.
 The company attributed the drop in profitability to significantly higher operating costs in its manufacturing operations as capacity utilization plunged. It also said a sharp decline in profit in its captive finance unit contributed to the poor showing.
 Analysts, on average, expected the company to report a profit of $1.28 a share on sales of $11.97 billion.
 After shrugging off the downturn in the housing market that sparked the worldwide crisis, Caterpillar and other makers of bulldozers, dump trucks and excavators have suddenly faced a world of challenges, including a drop in spending by their well-heeled energy and mining customers.

HEADLINE: 62,000 Jobs Are Cut by U.S. and Foreign Companies

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; Stephanie Rosenbloom and Catherine Rampell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Employers have tried to nip and tuck their labor costs by reducing overtime, shortening the workweek and freezing wages, but now, they are reaching for the saw.
 On Monday alone, companies across the employment spectrum announced more than 65,000 job cuts in the United States and around the world, a stark sign that businesses are enduring a painful, protracted downturn.
 Monday's toll included 20,000 cuts at Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction and mining machinery; 8,000 jobs at the wireless provider Sprint Nextel; 7,000 workers at Home Depot, and 8,000 from the expected merger of the pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and Wyeth. The beleaguered automaker General Motors announced that it would cut shifts at plants in Michigan and Ohio, where the downturn has hit hardest, eliminating some 2,000 jobs.
 And Texas Instruments said after the market closed on Monday that it would cut 3,400 jobs or 12 percent of its work force through 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 buyouts or retirements. 
 In Europe, the banking and insurance group ING said it would cut 7,000 jobs; the electronics company Philips, 6,000; and the steel maker Corus, 3,500 worldwide. 
 ''We're now into the danger zone,'' said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist at IHS Global Insight. ''It really becomes pernicious because the uncertainty increases, corporate confidence is badly battered, and you get these severe measures being taken.''
 President Obama cited the layoff announcements in remarks Monday morning as he urged action on an $825 billion economic stimulus package of tax cuts, emergency benefits and public spending projects.
 ''These are not just numbers on a page,'' Mr. Obama said. ''As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008, these are working men and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold. We owe it to each of them and to every single American to act with a sense of urgency and common purpose. We can't afford distractions and we cannot afford delays.''
 The United States economy has dropped some 2.59 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007, and unemployment rose to 7.2 percent last month. Economists worry that the economy could now be losing as many as 600,000 jobs a month, and they said Monday's layoff announcements served to underline the stricken state of the labor market. 
 Last week, the government reported that first-time unemployment claims had risen to 589,000 for the week ending Jan. 17, tying a record high set in December.
 The latest job cuts -- and the additional announcements likely to come in a cascading pattern as job losses through the economy cause demand to shrink further and thus lead to more layoffs mean more pain for states, as unemployment insurance claims rise and deplete state coffers.
 The Obama administration has proposed setting aside $43 billion to help blunt the problem and provide for new recipients of unemployment insurance and existing ones. That money is intended to raise the weekly benefits, to extend how long people can collect those payments and to cover more types of workers, like part-timers. It is largely based upon an estimate that the unemployment rate will peak at 8.3 percent in 2010. But if unemployment reaches the double-digits, as some economists expect, the funding will almost certainly not be enough, economists say.
 ''The economy is deteriorating at a faster clip than even the most dreary forecasts had expected,'' said the economist Joseph Brusuelas. ''At the current trend, $43 billion will not be sufficient, should we breach 9 percent unemployment and maybe reach into the double digits.''
 Monday's announcements only added to a grim parade of job cuts from Wall Street to wireless providers to computer companies to retail stores. 
 Last week, Microsoft announced it would cut 5,000 jobs over the next year and a half; Sony in Japan and Ericcson in Sweden each announced 5,000 layoffs; and the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said it was eliminating 1,000 jobs. Carmakers in Japan, South Korea and Europe have also cut jobs in recent months as did the cellphone maker Nokia. 
 ''It steepens the whole downturn,'' said Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute. ''The magnitude of these layoffs indicates that the downturn in the labor markets seems to be accelerating.''
 ''This is a big deal,'' said Dean Baker, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ''We're losing jobs at an incredibly rapid rate, and even with that, I'm worried they're accelerating. We're seeing a much more rapid rate of layoff announcements.''
 Caterpillar, which has been hurt by falling orders for construction and mining machinery, said Monday morning that it would cull 20,000 workers through layoffs and buyouts. It said it would make ''sharp declines'' in overtime and eliminate scores of temporary and contract jobs.
 The company said 2009 would be one of its weakest years since World War II.
 ''These are very uncertain times,'' the chief executive, James W. Owens, said in a statement. ''While it's painful for our employees and suppliers, it's absolutely necessary given economic circumstances. We expect to have most of the actions needed to lower employment and cost levels in place by the end of the first quarter.''
 ''We were whipsawed in the fourth quarter as key industries were hit by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices,'' Mr. Owens said.
 The wireless provider, Sprint Nextel, said its 8,000 job cuts were part of a plan to trim labor costs by $1.2 billion, and said most of the cuts would be completed by March 31. About 850 of the job cuts are expected to come through buyouts, which will cost the company $300 million in severance costs and related expenses.
 ''Labor reductions are always the most difficult action to take, but many companies are finding it necessary in this environment,'' Sprint's chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, said. 
 Home Depot, the country's largest home-supply chain, said it would cut 7,000 jobs, about 2 percent of its work force, and would close its higher-end Expo Design Center business, which includes 34 stores. 
 Carol B. Tome, Home Depot's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview that the company began exploring ways to save its Expo business months ago, but ''as we kept looking at alternatives the business kept getting softer and softer.'' 
 With no sign of consumers cracking open their wallets anytime soon, executives simply realized, ''we can't fix it.''

HEADLINE: Amid Red Flags, Citigroup and M.T.A. Made Bond Deal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
In August 2007, an official at Citigroup sent an e-mail message to a colleague warning of trouble in an obscure corner of the financial world: the $330 billion market for auction-rate securities. 
 ''There are definitely cracks forming in the market,'' read the e-mail message, which is cited in a complaint filed last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a Citigroup subsidiary, Citigroup Global Markets. ''Inventories are starting to creep higher in the market and failed auction frequency is at an all-time high.''
 In the following weeks, the problems in the market, which state and local governments across the country relied on to raise money for public projects, became more acute. So did the alarm at Citigroup.
 But that did not stop the bank from peddling the securities to investors and working with government agencies -- including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail system -- to bring more bonds into the already stressed market. With Citigroup Global Markets as one of its underwriters, the authority issued $430 million of auction-rate bonds on Nov. 7, 2007. 
 Almost immediately the deal soured. Interest rates on the bonds, set in weekly auctions, began to climb, to 4 percent from about 3 percent, and finally, by February, to 8 percent. By then, the entire auction-rate market had collapsed as panicked investors worried that they could not get access to their money.
 Stunned by the soaring rates, which were costing it up to $560,000 a week, the authority redeemed the securities in March. To do so, it issued a new round of bonds, outside the auction system and at more favorable interest rates. But the move came with a cost: about $5.6 million in fees to bankers, lawyers and others, including the state, according to data provided by the authority.
 All told, Citigroup earned more than half a million dollars on the two sales; Goldman Sachs, the authority's financial adviser, which counseled in favor of the auction-rate sale, made $929,500 for its work on both.
 The transportation authority is now grappling with its worst fiscal crisis in decades, caused by plummeting tax revenues, rising expenses and a heavy debt load. To help plug a threatened $1.2 billion budget shortfall, it has proposed steep fare and toll increases for this year, as well as sharp cuts in service. 
 The S.E.C. civil complaint charges that Citigroup misled investors and provides new evidence that the bank recognized early that the market was unstable but continued to underwrite and sell bonds.
 Though the complaint does not mention the authority's bond sale in November 2007, it covers the bank's actions during that time. 
 Officials at Citigroup refused to answer questions about the transportation authority's bond deal; in a statement, the bank said, ''Since the beginning of the auction-rate securities crisis, Citigroup has worked diligently with issuers, investors and regulatory authorities to work toward solutions.'' 
 The complaint against Citigroup was filed in federal court in Manhattan on Dec. 11, 2008, the same day a prearranged final settlement was announced.
 Without admitting wrongdoing, Citigroup had settled the S.E.C. complaint and other cases brought by state regulators, including the attorney general of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo, agreeing to buy back more than $7 billion of securities from investors and to pay a $100 million fine. Other banks have agreed to similar settlements. 
 While the commission's complaint takes Citigroup to task, there is also evidence that the transportation authority -- or its adviser, Goldman Sachs -- should have seen warning signs, as other government issuers did. The authority's offering was one of the largest municipal bond sales in the months before the auction-rate market collapsed, according to data compiled by Ipreo, a financial services firm. 
 ''We saw problems,'' said Richard M. Froehlich, the general counsel and executive vice president for capital markets of the New York City Housing Development Corporation. The agency had used auction-rate bonds in the past, but as he prepared to sell more bonds in late 2007, Mr. Froehlich said he deemed them too risky. 
 ''There were dislocations that started in the summer of '07,'' he said. ''After that, it was never our desire to go back into auction rate.'' 
 One authority board member, Doreen M. Frasca, has voiced concern about some financing decisions, including why the authority stepped into the auction-rate market just as it was about to implode. 
 ''I think there was a very surprising lack of foresight in reading the handwriting that was on the wall,'' said Ms. Frasca, who runs a consulting firm that specializes in airport finance. She joined the board after the auction-rate bonds had been redeemed. 
 Gary J. Dellaverson, the authority's chief financial officer, said he did not believe that he was misled by the bankers or the authority's financial adviser.
 He said that the experience with the bonds must be judged within the authority's overall borrowing program, which contains a predominance of fixed-rate debt and a smaller portion of cheaper but riskier variable-rate debt. Over the last three years, he said, the variable-rate debt has saved the authority $150 million in interest payments, compared to what it would have paid if the same debt were in fixed-rate bonds.
 ''This was a calamitous disruption in the credit markets,'' Mr. Dellaverson said. ''We managed our way through it.'' 
 Auction-rate bonds are long-term bonds with interest rates that reset at regular auctions, as often as once a week. Holders of the bonds would put them up for sale and investors would bid by designating the minimum interest rate they would accept. 
 But for an auction to be successful, all the bonds for sale on that date had to find buyers. If there were not enough bids at the right price, the auction would fail. For years, the banks had stepped in to keep auctions from failing by buying whatever bonds were not selling. 
 But it was not widely known how much the banks were intervening to prop up the auctions. 
 Citigroup had never allowed an auction to fail, according to the S.E.C. complaint, a fact it advertised to assure clients of the market's soundness. 
 But in August 2007, according to the complaint, demand for the securities began to weaken as investors sought safer places for their money. As a result, Citigroup was forced to invest increasing amounts to buy up bonds that had no other takers. 
 Typically, Citigroup kept $1 billion to $2 billion tied up in such bonds, the complaint said. But beginning that August, the amount began to increase. It soon rose to $4 billion, and by February 2008 it was more than $10 billion. 
 But the bank was facing other demands on its capital, partly because of bad bets it had made on subprime mortgages, and it knew it could not continue indefinitely to support the auctions, the S.E.C. said. In internal e-mail messages sent as early as August 2007, managers began raising the specter of letting auctions fail. 
 Despite that, the bank kept underwriting new bond sales. According to the commission, Citigroup's investment bankers wanted to continue bringing new bonds to market to ''earn fees and to maintain their position vis-a-vis bankers at other broker-dealers.''
 The bank and two other underwriters, Bear Stearns and J. P. Morgan, began working with the transportation authority on its auction-rate deal in early October 2007, according to Mr. Dellaverson. 
 Mr. Dellaverson said he was aware at the time that some auctions for nonmunicipal bonds had recently failed. But he said he discussed the issue with the financial adviser, Kevin Willens, of Goldman Sachs, and concluded that the market for municipal bonds remained healthy. 
 Goldman declined to make Mr. Willens available for an interview. ''Investor demand for this type of security was strong,'' the bank said in a statement. ''Our market judgments and advice to clients were based on prevailing market conditions, which were far different from the unprecedented market dislocations in early 2008.''
 The authority had issued auction-rate debt eight times previously, although not since 2005, and Mr. Dellaverson said that in 2007, those bonds were showing no signs of trouble. 
 But there was another potentially troubling development involving Ambac Assurance, the company chosen to insure the bonds. In October 2007, the insurer's parent company, Ambac Financial Group, reported large losses tied to subprime mortgages. 
 ''That should have set off alarm bells,'' Ms. Frasca said. 
 Mr. Dellaverson said that despite the company's losses, the insurer was given a high credit rating, which qualified it to participate in the deal. 
 Another Citigroup e-mail message cited in the complaint, from Nov. 1, 2007, also voiced concerns about insurer weakness, saying it could drive nervous investors from a market that was already ''subject to a potential liquidity crisis.'' 
 ''We are very concerned that a further investor pullback could increase the risk of widespread failed auctions,'' the e-mail message said. Six days later, the transportation authority bonds were issued. Rates were set at 3.15 percent the first day, producing a weekly interest payment of $260,000. But the rates rose over the next few weeks, causing consternation at the authority. 
 In January 2008, several major bond insurers, including Ambac, had their credit downgraded. 
 Investors fled the auction-rate market. By mid-February, Citigroup and other investment banks stopped putting money into auctions, which then failed by the thousands. 
 Many investors were stuck holding the bonds. They continued to receive interest and did not lose their investment, but they could not sell the bonds to get at their cash. 
 Many government agencies saw costs soar. Failed auctions often triggered high penalty rates, while in auctions that continued to function rates were also prohibitive. 
 The authority acted quickly to contain the damage. In mid-February, it sold $1 billion of new bonds and used part of the proceeds to buy back the auction-rate securities. Citigroup was one of the underwriters on the new debt. 
 For the two bond deals, Citigroup was paid a total of $442,000 in financing fees and a share of the $388,792 the three underwriters charged in auction fees, the authority said. 
 As part of the settlement with the New York attorney general's office, the authority's underwriters will reimburse it for a portion of their fees from the second bond sale. Last week, Citigroup sent its reimbursement: $97,650.

HEADLINE: France Looks to Help Airbus With Loan Guarantees

BYLINE: By CAROLINE BROTHERS

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
France will guarantee up to 5 billion euros in loans to help airlines finance the purchase of aircraft, a move squarely aimed at helping Airbus and its parent company, European Aeronautics Defense and Space, maintain production during the current credit crunch, officials said Monday. 
 The 5 billion euros, or $6.6 billion, out of about 7 billion euros that France is making available to help its exporters will be directed toward the aerospace industry ''to allow the financing of export contracts in the aeronautical sector,'' according to a finance ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not an authorized spokesman on the subject. 
 Banks with airline clients unable to afford the purchase of aircraft will be able to approach a newly created state-owned institution, the Societe de Financement de l'Economie Francaise, which will provide the loan guarantees, the spokesman said. 
 Both Airbus and its American rival, Boeing, are hoping to avoid the worst of the credit squeeze because of government aid to airlines that are their clients.
 A spokesman for the Export-Import Bank, Phillip Cogan, confirmed on Monday reports that it could increase its guarantees for sales of Boeing jets by nearly 50 percent, to up to $9 billion, this year. The bank supports the financing of goods and services.
 ''Given the tighter credit markets and a lack of liquidity with some lenders, we anticipate, based on expressions of interest, an increase in the need'' for financing from the bank, Mr. Cogan said.
 Boeing and Airbus are already at loggerheads over government assistance, each accusing the other before the World Trade Organization of being the recipient of illegal subsidies. 
 But experts say that with a $2 trillion stimulus package under way in the United States, and bailouts for banks and carmakers proliferating, limited aid to a relatively healthy industry is unlikely to cause many ripples among regulators.
 ''With this form of aid, both sides are looking in a mirror,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation expert at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm based in Fairfax, Va.
 Airbus, which said earlier this month that gross new orders could drop to 300 this year from nearly 900 in 2008, applauded the move by Paris, saying it was ''a strong initiative by the French government to help restore the functioning of the financial markets.''
 France's decision to help the aerospace industry is the second volley of a plan to help its economy survive a downturn that has brought bank lending close to a halt; it follows France's injection of 10.5 billion euros of cash to recapitalize its banks, the finance ministry official said.
 Aviation specialists say that airlines, which pay for about 80 percent of a new aircraft upon delivery, already have financing in place for most planes scheduled for delivery in the next eight to nine months, although financing for 2010 looks less certain.
 Doug McVitie, chief consultant at Arran Aerospace in Dinan, France, estimated that up to 40 percent of the manufacturers' backlog looked ''flexible.''
 Both Boeing and Airbus normally provide financing for customers during economic downturns, and both have said they are prepared to step in this time. The idea is to keep production at a plateau rather than ramping down sharply only to have to ramp back up in the upswing.
 ''This isn't a bailout,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. ''It is simply a way of keeping production numbers high.''

HEADLINE: Year of the Ox Is Looking Inauspicious

BYLINE: By MARK McDONALD and BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Hong Kong's gleaming past and current troubles are right there, plain to see, on Vincent Chan's wall -- photographs of more than a hundred Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Jaguars for sale, luxury cars dumped by their once-flush owners in need of some ready cash.
 Mr. Chan sells only one or two cars a week now -- a third of the sales his dealership has made in recent years. And under pressure from his bank, he is prepared to sell any of his cars at a loss, just to free up some money. He is ready to haggle.
 The Chinese Lunar New Year began Monday, and projections for the Year of the Ox from astrologers, lawyers, bankers and fishmongers are anything but auspicious. 
 ''The mood is confused and desperate,'' said Kerby Kuek, a feng shui master and Chinese astrologer. ''Two years ago, people would ask me if they should change from a medium house to a big house, or from a Nissan to a BMW. 
 ''Now people ask me directly, 'When am I going to get laid off?'''
 Mr. Kuek said he was getting the same fearful questions from clients as he heard in 2003, when Hong Kong was rocked by the epidemic of SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome. Foreigners fled, tourism disappeared, local people went around in surgical masks, and the economy, of course, buckled. 
 Hong Kong's other economic calamity came with the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. Property values dropped 50 percent. 
 But Mr. Chan, 58, does not see a current parallel to that dark period, which he called ''completely horrible.'' 
 ''We haven't had any suicides this time!'' he said brightly. ''So, you see: Not so bad as '98!''
 Most of his customers are expatriates, and the global crisis and the ensuing recession in Hong Kong are forcing many of them to economize. (Which explains the huge backlog of cars in Mr. Chan's jammed warehouse.) Some expats have been recalled to their home countries, especially those in banking, law and finance, while others have been fired outright. 
 But gloom can be relative. There are no signs of mortgage defaults in Hong Kong, and people are not losing their homes like they are in the United States. And even if thousands of expats have been handed one-way tickets back to New York, London and Sydney, a number have chosen to remain.
 ''There isn't the desperate urge to leave like there was during SARS,'' said Shriram Chaubal, chief operating officer of GeoClicks, which runs a popular Hong Kong Web site called GeoExpat.com. ''They know Hong Kong is a lot better than wherever they'd be expatriating back to.''
 But Mr. Chaubal said friends and clients working in the manufacturing, retail, and food and beverage sectors were worried. And while enrollments have grown a bit at the Discovery Bay International School, the principal, Grant Ramsay, has heard plenty of gruesome layoff stories on the parental grapevine. 
 ''We certainly know a dip is coming,'' he said. ''So it's eyes wide open and bracing for the worst.''
 And the worst appears yet to come. Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's chief executive, delivered this blunt warning last Tuesday: ''Hong Kong is in the grip of the financial tsunami.'' He predicted more layoffs and company closings after the New Year holiday.
 The economic numbers -- macro and micro -- certainly support Tsang's baleful analysis. The Hang Seng stock index, for example, was off 48 percent in 2008. 
 The unemployment rate ticked up recently to 4.1 percent, a mild cough compared to the tubercular rate of 8.8 percent in 2003. But a new Citigroup analysis warns that ''this cycle appears worse,'' with no appreciable recovery until 2011. 
 Personal bankruptcies, up 85 percent from a year ago, are increasing 10 percent per month, said Thomas Tse, a partner at the law firm Yip, Tse & Tang. He expects bankruptcies to double between now and late summer, eventually ensnaring 1 percent of the city's working population, largely on personal loans and credit card debt.
 A dozen years ago, a bankruptcy was a traumatic loss of face, a deep humiliation in a society that prizes propriety and thrift. But now, after a dozen years of economic peaks and troughs, Mr. Tse said it carries much less of a stigma. 
 John Carroll, a historian of Hong Kong, said people here were ''legendary for their resourcefulness and ability to recover'' from economic shocks.
 He pointed to rebounds from labor strife in the mid-1920s; the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945; United Nations and United States embargoes during the Korean War that prompted a shift from trade to light industry 50 years ago; and Hong Kong's more recent move to a service economy after industrial jobs were shipped to mainland China. 
 Anil Daswani, head of research at Citigroup in Hong Kong, wrote a strategy report last week that admired the city's transformation from a trading port into ''a genuine global financial powerhouse alongside London and New York.'' 
 ''Hong Kong has always prospered by being able to reinvent itself,'' he wrote, ''and we are of no doubt that during this downturn it will do it again.''
 The go-go years in the middle of this decade certainly burnished the city's reputation as an Asian hub for business, banking and excess. Those were the days when the Peninsula Hotel, in a single order, bought 14 custom-made Rolls-Royces specially painted in ''Peninsula green.'' 
 The Hong Kong wealthy remain wealthy, and stratospherically so. But for people a few rungs down the economic ladder, the impromptu weekend trips to Bali or Tokyo, the jewelry binges, the full-on lush life -- that is mostly over. 
 ''The whole party-party thing, the let's-go-splurge thing, that's clearly not happening now,'' said Chaubal of GeoClicks. 
 If there is any time for Hong Kongers to party, however, it is now. The New Year holiday in Asia calls for a long break from work, with money spent on new clothes, big dinners, flowers and gifts. But this year, in street markets and marbled malls alike, the buzz of commerce is more muted. And with consumers more cautious, prices have plunged. 
 Caterpillar fungus, a kind of Chinese cure-all that is cooked into stews, has dropped in price by a third, down to about $250 an ounce. Crocodile jerky, sea cucumbers, shark's fin and dried fish bellies have seen similar reductions. 
 Kumquat trees, a traditional holiday gift that symbolizes prosperity, are the same price as last year, although more buyers are going for the lower-priced potted shrubs rather than the grander 5-footers.
 And at his showroom on Dragon Road, Mr. Chan has a '96 Rolls-Royce Silver Spur for sale. Marked down from $48,000, the sticker now says $38,000 -- and even that is negotiable. 
 Mr. Chan is making other changes. He has always reserved four tables at a good restaurant where he treats his employees and a few dozen loyal customers to a New Year's dinner. This year he has cut back to one table, staff only.
 He is also cutting back on the money he is putting into the red-and-gold envelopes traditionally given to children, staff members and service people during the holiday. In previous years he has put in a crisp bill of 100 Hong Kong dollars, worth about $12.80. This year he will use 50-dollar notes.
 ''They won't be angry,'' Chan said. ''Everybody knows the problems with the economy. They know what's happened.''
 A former garage mechanic, Mr. Chan bought a 1956 Vauxhall junker when he was a teenager, fixed it up, and sold it for five times the money. He has been buying and flipping cars ever since.
 ''If I sell a car now and lose money, O.K., I'm still alive,'' he said. ''I can always make money again.'' He snapped his fingers. ''This is Hong Kong. We're gamblers.''

HEADLINE: Layoffs Spread To More Sectors Of the Economy

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Jack Healy, Stephanie Rosenbloom, Louis Uchitelle and Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Furloughs, wage reductions, hiring freezes and shorter hours simply did not do enough. A year into this recession, companies across the board are resorting to mass job cuts.
 Home Depot, Caterpillar, Sprint Nextel and at least eight other companies announced on Monday they would cut more than 75,000 jobs in the United States and around the world -- a gloomy start to the workweek for employees anxious about holding their own as the economy sinks. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, is slashing its payrolls by 16 percent. Texas Instruments said late in the day that it would eliminate 3,400 jobs, or 12 percent of its work force.
 Jobs began disappearing in home building and mortgage operations early in the recession, then across finance and banking more generally. Now the ax is falling across large swaths of manufacturing, retailing and information technology, taking out workers from New York to Seattle. Just last week, Microsoft announced its first significant job cuts ever. 
 Because companies like Microsoft have invested in their workers' skills and knowledge, they usually delay major work force reductions as long as they can. But with orders for new products and services drying up and financing tight, employers are looking to shrink their costs drastically and are slashing their payrolls, anticipating a protracted decline for business in 2009. 
 Monday's parade of negative news comes after months of announcements from other prominent companies like Citigroup, General Electric, Nokia and Harley-Davidson. As part of its acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer said it would cut the combined workforce by 19,500 employees.
 On Wednesday, the tally of mass layoffs for December will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Already, the bureau says the United States economy has shed 2.55 million jobs since the recession began, pushing the unemployment rate up to 7.2 percent last month. 
 The latest round of job cuts -- and the additional rounds likely to come as these move through the economy -- mean more pain ahead for states as unemployment insurance claims rise and deplete state budgets.
 Congress has proposed setting aside $43 billion to assist the states and to provide for new and current recipients of unemployment checks. That money is intended to increase the weekly benefit amounts; to extend how long people can collect payments; to cover more types of workers, like part-timers; and to help states distribute benefits more quickly. 
 It is based largely on an estimate that the unemployment rate will rise to 8 to 9 percent this year even with a stimulus package, according to the proposal summary from the House Appropriations Committee. But if unemployment soars into double digits, as some economists expect, the financing may not be enough.
 ''The economy is deteriorating at a faster clip than even the most dreary forecasts had expected,'' said Joseph Brusuelas, an economist who, bucking the current job market trend, will soon start a new job at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''At the current trend, $43 billion will not be sufficient should we breach 9 percent unemployment and maybe reach into the double digits.''
 President Obama cited the layoff announcements in remarks Monday urging Congress to approve an $825 billion economic stimulus package of tax cuts, emergency benefits and public spending projects. ''These are not just numbers on a page,'' he said. ''As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008, these are working men and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold.''
 Charles DiGisco, of Randolph, N.J., is one casualty of the downturn. He said he had been looking for work since Sept. 18, when he lost his job as a vice president for sales and marketing at Master Cutlery, a knife maker. He frequently hears a familiar refrain from would-be employers: ''We would hire you, but we're not hiring anybody.''
 His family's monthly expenses are four times what Mr. DiGisco collects from unemployment, and he said his family was selling two of its three cars and might dispose of some stocks or dip into retirement funds to keep paying the mortgage. 
 ''It takes me 20 years to save it, and it takes me five months to go through it,'' Mr. DiGisco said. 
 While stimulus spending on public works may take some time to get going, some companies could bring back displaced workers quickly if the government initiative generated new orders.
 Caterpillar, for example, had announced buyouts, wage freezes and work stoppages around the holidays because of ''a dramatic decline in orders,'' said Jim Dugan, a spokesman for the company, based in Peoria, Ill. 
 On Monday, the company said that a total of 15,000 permanent and temporary jobs, out of about 125,000, would have been eliminated by the end of this week, and that it would trim 5,000 more by the end of the first quarter. Should orders for earthmovers and other heavy equipment improve, which some expect as countries around the world start building bridges, highways and other public works to help create jobs, Caterpillar can recall some workers quickly.
 Many companies, though, may not rush to increase staffs even if business begins to pick up. Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, said downturns often motivate companies to restructure business models permanently, meaning jobs they cut now are unlikely to be replaced.
 ''Structural change is put into overdrive because of the recession,'' he said, ''so who knows for sure how a company like Microsoft will fare?''
 Sprint Nextel, which announced Monday that it was eliminating 8,000 jobs, or roughly 14 percent of its work force, is similarly facing some tough restructuring decisions as it continues to hemorrhage subscribers.
 After a dismal holiday shopping season, retailers are letting employees go in droves. More than 66,600 retailing jobs were lost in December, the worst period since the late 1930s. 
 Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, said Monday it would cut 7,000 jobs, or 2 percent of its workers. Some 5,000 cuts will come through store closings, largely of its upscale Expo chain; the rest will come from corporate support, many at its Atlanta headquarters.
 Carol B. Tome, Home Depot's chief financial officer, said the company had explored ways to save Expo, but ''as we kept looking at alternatives, the business kept getting softer and softer.'' 
 For most of last year, relatively healthy demand for exports gave global companies like Caterpillar a cushion. But with downturns deepening across Europe and Asia, and the dollar strengthening, global demand for costlier American goods has faltered.
 ''There really isn't any hiding place for companies anymore,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''The recent numbers coming in from the rest of the world are disastrous.''

HEADLINE: A Good Stimulus Bill

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''The First Test'' (column, Jan. 23), David Brooks claims that there is no unifying vision for the House version of the stimulus bill. In fact, the unifying vision is pretty clear: Create jobs while investing in programs that build infrastructure for the future, particularly in high-need areas. 
 For example, the House bill includes $13 billion for education to be given out through Title I, a program that serves the communities hardest hit by the economic downturn. Title I puts qualified teachers and other staff members in critical positions in school districts that are firing teachers and carrying out hiring freezes. 
 Another key part of the stimulus bill's education package -- the Incentive Fund for states -- is intended to build infrastructure for accountability and for more efficient school systems, which also leads directly to job creation while improving education for all children.
 Mr. Brooks talks about immediate impact versus long-term impact, yet what is needed immediately should be consistent with what is needed long term. The current House bill blends these concepts admirably, particularly in the way it addresses education spending.

HEADLINE: For Fed Policy-Making, Murky Era Lies Ahead

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Until last month, anyone keeping tabs on monetary policy at the Federal Reserve would focus almost entirely on one simple, almost Pavlovian number: the overnight federal funds rate that banks charge each other for lending their reserves. 
 If the central bank wanted to jump-start the economy with cheaper money, the federal funds rate would inch down. If it wanted to cool down the economy and head off inflation, the rate would inch up. If policy makers wanted to add some color to their thinking, they could drop hints in their statement after each meeting.
 But when Fed policy makers finish their two-day meeting on Wednesday, they are likely to be far more opaque about their actions. 
 Having reduced the benchmark interest rate almost to zero last month, Fed officials are now trying to prop up the economy by pumping out cheap money through at least a half-dozen new programs that are both difficult to explain and difficult for the public to track.
 Officials are expected to articulate their broad goals in the short statement that always follows a policy meeting. On Wednesday, they are likely to reiterate that the economy is still in dire trouble, that inflation is still slowing and that they will use ''all available tools'' to get things moving again. They are also expected to repeat their intention of keeping the federal funds rate at ''exceptionally low levels'' for ''some time.''
 Fed officials acknowledge that the new strategy creates communication problems and is likely to make policy-making less transparent. The fast-growing and fast-changing array of new programs are all aimed at reviving a particular segment of lending, from home mortgages to short-term corporate debt to consumer loans and student loans. 
 But officials have offered little detail on potentially explosive political questions about how much to push down interest rates on mortgages versus municipal bonds or corporate debt.
 At the moment, the Fed's most important new lever is its program to buy up $500 million in mortgage-backed securities that have been guaranteed by the federal government. By buying up those mortgage securities, the central bank will push up their prices and push down their yields, or interest rates. Indeed, the program has already driven down rates on plain-vanilla mortgages to their lowest level in decades.
 But the Fed has many other levers with names that are bafflingly easy to confuse: the Term Auction Facility, which provides loans to banks; the Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility, a $200 billion program to finance consumer loans; the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, which lends money for short-term business i.o.u.'s.
 All of those programs are meant to increase the supply of money, which usually leads to lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Indeed, the Fed has sharply increased the money supply to finance the new programs. Since last September, the central bank has created more than $1 trillion in new money, virtually out of thin air.
 ''They are trying very hard to be open,'' said Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase. ''But what are the actual things they are doing in the market? What is their intent? How long will they keep these things in place? There is lots of debate going on in the market about that.''
 Fed officials acknowledge that the new tactics of monetary policy are likely to be at least somewhat murkier to explain than their traditional decisions about the federal funds rate.
 After the central bank's policy meeting last month, when officials lowered the federal funds rate almost to zero, senior Fed officials held a conference call with reporters to answer questions. 
 But under the ground rules that Fed officials demanded, the senior officials doing the talking were not allowed to be quoted directly or by name. As a result, their answers were heavily filtered through the prism of reporters without giving members of the public a chance to hear the officials themselves.
 Fed officials have toyed with the idea of holding occasional news conferences in front of television cameras. The idea is still anathema to many Fed officials, but it has been standard procedure for the president of the European Central Bank. The E.C.B. normally holds a news conference after every second policy meeting.
 Fed officials said they were not even close to that kind of change. But they may be inching in that direction. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has accepted an invitation to speak at the National Press Club in February. 
 But analysts said the wide range and ever-changing array of Fed programs could put it in the position of making decisions about whether to focus on reducing rates for corporate borrowers, home buyers or some other group.
 At the moment, for example, the Fed is buying up hundreds of billions of dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities. If it switched to buying high-grade corporate bonds, it could end up raising rates for home buyers and lowering them for companies like General Electric.
 ''I don't think the Fed has even attempted to explain why it has bought mortgage-backed securities and not corporate bonds,'' said William Poole, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ''Here we have the Fed allocating credit to particular sectors. What are the criteria? There are lots of deserving borrowers out there. Why did the Fed pick these particular ones?''

HEADLINE: American Express Profit Drops 79%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The American Express Company, the credit card company, said Monday that its profit dropped 79 percent in the fourth quarter as cardholders cut back their spending amid the harsh economy and the company took a significant severance-related charge.
 Net income dropped to $172 million, or 15 cents a share, from $831 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Results included a $273 million charge primarily related to severance costs from previously announced job cuts, as well as a $66 million increase in the company's membership rewards reserve related to a partnership agreement with Delta Air Lines.
 On an adjusted basis, excluding discontinued operations, the company earned $238 million, or 21 cents a share.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Finds China Copyright Law Lacking

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States claimed victory on Monday in a groundbreaking World Trade Organization case in which China was found to have failed to protect and enforce copyrights and trademarks on a wide range of goods. 
 ''Today, a W.T.O. panel found that a number of deficiencies'' in China's intellectual property rights system ''are incompatible with its W.T.O. obligations,'' the United States trade representative, Peter F. Allgeier, said in a statement.
 ''We will engage vigorously with China on appropriate corrective actions to ensure that U.S. rights holders obtain the benefits of this decision,'' Mr. Allgeier said.
 Washington started the dispute in 2007 out of frustration at unauthorized copies of films, branded goods and other trademarked property openly available in Chinese cities.
 The International Intellectual Property Alliance, a coalition of United States music, movie, book and software industry groups, conservatively estimates that piracy in China costs them more than $3.7 billion in lost sales.
 The United States persuaded the dispute settlement panel that China had violated W.T.O. rules by barring copyright protection for movies, music and books not approved by state censors for legitimate sale, Mr. Allgeier said.
 The panel also said it was ''impermissible'' for China to allow public auction of counterfeit goods seized by Chinese customs authorities, with only the requirement that the fake brand or trademark be removed, he said.
 The United States failed to persuade the W.T.O. panel on one main point of its case, however: that Chinese copyright pirates and counterfeiters have no fear of criminal prosecution because the government's threshold for bringing a case is too high.
 That was ''disappointing,'' Mr. Allgeier said, but he added that the panel established a market-based analytical approach that should help W.T.O. members avoid or resolve future disputes over obstacles to criminal enforcement of counterfeiting and piracy.
 Both the United States and China can appeal the panel ruling, the results of which emerged when a confidential preliminary report was released in October.

HEADLINE: A Match Made With a Coloring Brush

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Danica Warren, 24, is an apprentice hair colorist at the Antonio Prieto Salon in Chelsea. She moved to New York from Salt Lake City two years ago, and came to the salon in August 2007.
 Why hair? I have really bad dyslexia, so I've always struggled academically. I did creative things to get by in high school -- dance, a little bit of cheerleading, a little bit of drama. I've always done my friends' hair for the prom, and was always cutting hair in my mom's kitchen. I loved beauty school right away. Finally there was something I didn't struggle with doing. I was getting A's for the first time. 
 Early experimentation: Once I dyed my mom's hair a crazy Crayola orange. She hated it, she cried, I fixed it and she was fine. It was laughable for 45 minutes. 
 Taking work home: Whenever I'm home on vacation, I do my mom's hair, my aunt's, my sister's, my cousin's. I kind of don't ever get a break. 
 Growing up Mormon: I was brought up really strict: no caffeine, no alcohol, no drinking, all that jazz, no dating until I was 16. A lot of kids were not allowed to wear tank tops, and they had to cover their shoulders and knees. My parents were a little more relaxed, and now they accept me for me. I like alcohol and boys, and I drink a lot of tea. 
 What the family thinks: I have three brothers and one sister, and their aspiration is to have a family and get married, except for my hippie brother who wants to camp all the time and rock-climb. The big city doesn't appeal to them. They just think I'm crazy. But they're happy for me and proud of me. They've always known I'm a little different. 
 New York after Utah: It definitely took some getting used to. It was really lonely. I lived with a Mormon couple in the Bronx. On Sundays, they made sure I said my prayers. Now I live in Greenpoint with two roommates.
 First job in New York: Working at H & M on Fifth Avenue. 
 After that: Baby-sitting in Park Slope and working at a small salon in Brooklyn and then another in Midtown. 
 The path to Antonio's: I found it listed on Craigslist. You have to do a hair model for them -- I did three models -- and the next day they told me I was hired. I'm apprenticing under all of the colorists. I'm in a training program to become one, which means the prices for what I do are cheaper. With the economy and stuff, a lot more people are drawn to the apprentice program. I've been crazy busy, and I love it.
 Difference between clients in Utah and New York: I don't know if it's because of the salon I'm at, but the clients here are a little more conservative. The salon I was at in Salt Lake had a very young crowd. Here, they all have an idea in mind. 
 Eccentric clients: One of the clients always gets totally undressed under her robe. She's very loud and I think drinks a little bit when her hair's processing. But I love her to death.

HEADLINE: Luxury Hotels Are Feeling Economy's Pinch

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
The hotel business has collided head-on with the bad economy and the tight credit market. 
 Hotel revenue is down sharply. Big new projects, planned in the boom days, are either sitting unfinished or left on the drawing boards. And some high-end hotel owners now face an unhappy situation -- how much can they cut prices to fill their rooms before they damage their hotels' luxury cachet? 
 ''I don't think anybody realized the switch was going to be turned off so quickly,'' said Lisa Grossberg, the general manager of the Buckingham Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. ''We saw people being more rate-conscious; we saw the renegotiations of corporate contracts as companies tightened their belts in the fall. But then in the middle of December, everything just about stopped.'' 
 Numbers from Smith Travel Research, the leading hotel research company, show just how tough times have become for all hotels. For the week of Jan. 11 to 17, the average revenue per available room -- the standard measure of hotel performance -- fell 16.4 percent over the comparable week in January 2008 in hotels in the United States. Average occupancy fell 12.9 percent, and average daily room rates declined 4 percent. 
 The figures for luxury hotels were even bleaker. Occupancy rates fell 24.4 percent in the week that ended Jan. 10 compared with the first week of January 2008, Smith Travel Research found. Average daily rates fell 8.9 percent.
 Many of the same forces now hitting the bottom lines of luxury hotels have affected other segments of the luxury market -- from top-end department stores to private jets -- as the rich feel the pain of the stock market collapse and cut back on spending. Luxury hotels are heavily dependent on high-end business travel, corporate meetings and international visitors -- all of which have fallen. 
 ''Everybody's got low occupancy, let's be honest,'' said Jim Treadway, the managing director of the Liberty, a luxury hotel in Boston. 
 Even with pressure to generate revenue, managers of hotels in all price categories except the lowest generally dislike overt discounts, fearing that customers will then insist on the bargains when good times return. 
 But now, said Mr. Treadway, ''There is some very competitive pricing going on, which is a euphemism for discounting, which, of course, we are loath to do.''
 The luxury hotels are particularly worried about losing business travelers, as many companies tighten travel spending policies. 
 Some business travelers who were formerly authorized to stay at five-star hotels are now restricted to four-stars (which include so-called big-box urban hotels like Sheraton or Hilton). And big-box hotels are also dropping prices, adding to their lure. 
 ''What we're worried about is the big-box hotels that were charging $270 are now charging $140,'' Mr. Treadway said. ''We don't want to discount to the extent that we reposition ourselves into a different segment, and wake up one day a year from now saying, 'Oops, we're no longer a luxury hotel.' ''
 Still, luxury hotels in the United States and abroad are almost all offering bargain prices packaged to mask the fact that they have dropped rates. 
 ''Things like 'Book us for two nights and get the third night free,' '' Mr. Treadway said. ''Effectively, that's arithmetic that adds up to discounting, though it's meant to look like you're just getting rewarded for a longer stay.'' 
 Higher-end hotels are also now including in the room price services they used to charge extra for, like valet parking, Internet service and spa use. Some are even throwing in a free lunch or dinner in the hotel restaurant.
 In every price range, hotels are struggling to cut costs without damaging the reputation of their brand. Midlevel hotels are trimming expenses, like reducing the amount of fresh fruit available in free breakfast buffets. Luxury hotels are looking at expenditures like staffing levels, flowers and bathroom amenities.
 ''We're doing a lot of things that really don't impact the guests, but take out costs,'' said J. W. Marriott Jr., the chief executive of Marriott International, which owns the Ritz-Carlton brand as well as numerous other brands. ''We're buying energy carefully. A lot of us are taking fresh flowers out of the lobby and substituting plants and things that we don't have to replace every day.'' 
 Ms. Grossberg at the Buckingham Hotel in Manhattan said she was doing the same things. ''You're thinking, how do you provide decent service to guests without them seeing that you've cut back on staffing levels, or noticing you're putting two bags of coffee in the room instead of four?'' she said. 
 Even as existing hotels struggle in these tough times, many hotel projects that were financed and put into development years ago are languishing. The number of hotel rooms under construction in the top 26 markets was down 19.7 percent at the end of 2008 compared with the end of 2007, Smith Travel Research said. Across the country, even hotel projects that are well under way, including as the $4.8 billion Echelon resort complex on the Las Vegas Strip, are sitting starkly idle, awaiting a better economy.
 This year, capital expenditures in the United States hotel industry are expected to be $3.75 billion, down 30 percent from 2008, said Bjorn Hanson, an associate professor at the New York University Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management. 
 One ambitious new hotel chain, Aloft, from Starwood Hotels started opening properties last summer, as the economy worsened. Aloft hotels were aimed partly at young professionals in the three-star midprice niche occupied by hotels like Marriott Courtyard and Hilton Garden Inn, said Brian McGuinness, a senior vice president for Starwood's specialty brands, including Aloft.
 Though some of the 20 or so Aloft hotels due to open this year are a few months behind schedule, the chain's existing 17 hotels are performing well, Mr. McGuinness said. Partly, he said, that is because they have received unanticipated business from travelers who have traded down from four-star hotels. ''That's actually been a blessing in disguise,'' he said. 
 Most company travel departments have locked in corporate business-travel hotel rates for 2009, often after demanding renegotiations late in the year when it became clear that hotels' pricing power had weakened. 
 ''From the midlevel to the budget level, hotels are much more amenable to giving us better rates,'' said Sam Jain, the chief executive of CheapOAir.com, an online travel booking company. The more upscale chains, he added, are ''a little more disposed to deal than before, but they still do not want to give out too much of their inventory'' to online bookers. 
 Ms. Grossberg took over at the Buckingham Hotel in Manhattan in June 2001, during a tough economic time and less than three months before 9/11 and the temporary travel collapse that followed.
 But she said: ''This one is a really big downturn, a scary one that isn't confined to one niche or one segment of the country. It's different than anything before, and I don't know where the bottom is. For now, it's just survival of the fittest.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Wavers on Good News and Bad

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Wall Street posted modest gains on Monday, but strong currents of hope and fear continued to tug the uncertain financial markets in opposite directions.
 Positive economic news came on a day when employers in the United States and around the world also announced more than 75,000 job cuts, a sign of rapid deterioration in the economy. The announcements of job cuts crossed the employment spectrum, from finance and pharmaceuticals to home supplies and wireless networks.
 After rising more than 150 points in early trading, the Dow Jones industrials settled back to finish up by 38.47 points, or 0.5 percent, at 8,116.03. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.6 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 836.57 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended 0.82 percent higher at 1,489.46. 
 The announcements of job cuts heightened fears that out-of-control unemployment could begin a vicious downward spiral of lower spending, lower growth and more job losses, prolonging what is shaping up to be a very severe recession.
 ''It steepens the whole downturn,'' said Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute. ''The magnitude of these layoffs indicates that the downturn in the labor markets seems to be accelerating.''
 Caterpillar, which has been hurt by ailing orders for construction and mining machinery, said it would lose 20,000 workers through layoffs and buyouts as it braced for one of its toughest years ever. Shares of Caterpillar fell 8.4 percent to end at $32.67 a share, helping to drag down the blue-chip averages.
 Home Depot, the nation's largest home-supply chain, closed 4.7 percent higher at $22.73 after announcing 7,000 job cuts, while the wireless provider Sprint Nextel finished slightly higher after announcing 8,000 job cuts. 
 Shares of America's biggest banks and financial companies have been pummeled since the start of the year, with some falling 50 percent this month on new worries about the stability of the financial system.
 Financial companies were mixed. Shares of Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo declined slightly, but JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley posted small gains. 
 American Express fell 5 percent to close at $15.20, and the credit card companies Visa, MasterCard and Discover closed lower. After markets closed on Monday, American Express reported that its net income fell by 79 percent in the fourth quarter.
 The pharmaceutical maker Pfizer fell 10.3 percent to close at $15.65 a share after it announced it had agreed to acquire its rival Wyeth for $68 billion. The drop in Pfizer shares aside, analysts said any activity in mergers and acquisitions was a good omen.
 ''Deal flow is part of the fabric of a healthy market,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.
 Earlier in the day, investors were buoyed by news that existing home sales in December beat analysts' expectations. The National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales rose 6.5 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.74 million units, largely a result of falling prices. That fueled hopes that falling mortgage rates and tumbling home values were enticing buyers back into the market and burning off an inventory of four million unsold homes. 
 The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose 0.3 percent in December, also bucking expectations.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 6/32, to 109 17/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.64 percent, from 2.62 percent late Friday. 
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and 20-year inflation-protected securities:

HEADLINE: What Price Luxury?

 Ms. Grossberg took over at the Buckingham Hotel in Manhattan in June 2001, less than three months before 9/11 and the travel slump that followed.
 But she said: ''This one is a really big downturn, a scary one that isn't confined to one niche or one segment of the country. It's different than anything before, and I don't know where the bottom is. For now, it's just survival of the fittest.''

HEADLINE: Gates Group Plans to Give More in 2009 Despite Losses

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The asset value of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation fell around 20 percent, to $38.7 billion at the end of last year, but the foundation -- the world's largest philanthropic organization -- will increase its giving this year to $3.8 billion, from $3.3 billion in 2008, Mr. Gates said Monday. 
 ''Although spending at this level will reduce the assets more quickly, the goal of our foundation is to make investments whose payback to society is very high rather than to pay out the minimum to make the endowment last as long as possible,'' Mr. Gates wrote in his first letter as a full-time philanthropist.
 The letter, posted on the foundation's Web site and modeled after the much-anticipated letter Warren E. Buffett produces annually about the economy, highlights some of the work the foundation is doing to improve health and well-being in the world's poorest countries and improve education in the United States. 
 Mr. Gates, the co-founder and chairman of Microsoft until he stepped down last summer, also reveals some disappointments with the foundation's work, citing its inability to reduce the number of deaths from rotavirus and the failure of its efforts to demonstrate that school size has an impact on student achievement. 
 Asked on a conference call with reporters on Monday whether the foundation would use any of its increased giving this year to address the financing shortfalls and constraints making it harder for nonprofits to provide critical social services, Mr. Gates said that, generally, the foundation did not see that as its goal.
 ''Because we're based in the Pacific Northwest, we do a variety of giving to social services organizations in the area, and we have a theme focusing on homelessness, particularly homelessness for families,'' he said. ''We have a number of grants we're looking at related to the fact that so many of these groups are having a hard time raising money at a time when the needs are going up.''
 In the letter, Mr. Gates listed ''three magical elements'' of his new job: big opportunities to greatly improve lives around the world, an ability to create teams of people to tackle seemingly intractable problems and the chance to work with his wife, Melinda.
 ''She and I enjoy sharing ideas and talking about what we are learning,'' he wrote. ''When one of us is being very optimistic, the other takes on the role of making sure we're thinking through all the tough issues.''

HEADLINE: Obama and the Era of Responsibility

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''No Time for Poetry'' (column, Jan. 25):
 Frank Rich and President Obama are correct: there is collective responsibility for the fix we are in. The age-old problem is motivating people to move against their short-term, personal interests -- a k a greed -- to sacrifice for the greater, long-term good. 
 Absent a saint who can inspire or imbue guilt; a national tragedy like the Depression, Pearl Harbor or 9/11 that causes sporadic patriotic bursts; a legislative mandate like the draft, price controls or some similar command or restriction, people -- especially in a democratic-capitalistic system that rewards individual gain -- are not inclined to sacrifice for the common good. 
 It may be Darwinian; it is not uniquely American. The enigma can be unlocked only if a leader can discover a way to educate a majority of the citizens to see the selfish benefit to common sacrifice, a benefit that will have relatively minor short-term gain but great long-term gain for themselves and their progeny.
 John E. Colbert Chicago, Jan.
 25, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Frank Rich spoke eloquently in his column. President Obama told us frequently during the long campaign that he would always tell us what we needed to hear, not what we wanted to hear. His tone-perfect Inaugural Address did just that.
 Moved by his somber message about what lies ahead, I see our task as listening and taking up the yoke of citizenship we let slip off when nobody was minding the store. He needs our best as much as we need his. I, for one, am ready to dust myself off.
 Cele Keeper Houston, Jan.
 25, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I strongly disagree with Frank Rich's interpretation of President Obama's Inaugural Address: 
 ''We can't keep blaming 43 for everything, especially now that we don't have him to kick around anymore. On Tuesday the new president pointedly widened his indictment beyond the sins of his predecessor. He spoke of those at the economic pinnacle who embraced greed and irresponsibility as well as the rest of us who collaborated in our 'collective failure to make hard choices.' '' 
 We who have consistently opposed the tax policies of the Bush administration have seen our savings for retirement and other investments drop between 30 and 40 percent in less than a year; our homes are worth less than fair market value. We contribute to the productivity of the economy but still manage to stay out of debt. The misguided and bungled Iraq war has contributed to a federal deficit that will haunt us, and very likely our children, for years. 
 Mr. Rich, don't blame those of us who have been prudent. We are victims, not collaborators, of an economy gone berserk.
 Carole York Stratham, N.H., Jan. 25, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''More Than Charisma,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 24):
 We are elated by the election of Barack Obama because we voted against cynicism and won.
 Our nation's fundamental values are freedom and hope. From Watergate and Vietnam to Iraq and Guantanamo, our vision of our nation and its ideals has been besmirched; cynics said those ideals had never been more than propaganda in the first place. In November millions of Americans voted for the possibility that we can claim that vision and those ideals again.
 It's been said that skepticism is healthy, but cynicism is a disease. 
 We must become attuned to distinguishing the one from the other, lest the cynics take over again.
 Suzanne P. Elliott New York, Jan.
 24, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Thank you, Bob Herbert.
 For this just-turned 60-year-old, it was a magnificent year of hope and hard work. I felt drawn into politics again with a passion I haven't felt since the late '60s at Columbia University in New York.
 I felt my political intellect reawakened, eager for the day's information and news, in a way I haven't for so long. 
 Since Nov. 4, I've reflected on poems I wrote in preteenage days, deeply patriotic poems whose hope and faith later got lost in anger, disappointment and mistrust during the years of young and middle adulthood. 
 I had to -- have to -- believe that this man, Barack Obama, is as good as his word. Based on conversations with others in my age group, I'm not alone. We want to believe that true leadership -- caring, thoughtful, perceptive, deeply intelligent leadership -- is possible. We don't expect perfection. And we can't wait to get back to work.
 At first, I wasn't thrilled about having my 60th birthday. I have a lot of living I still want to do. But since Jan. 20, I have to say that I'm thrilled to be alive to witness, and be part of, this amazing change.
 Carol Coven Grannick Wilmette, Ill., Jan.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''Where Obama's Speech Got Harsh Reviews'' (White House Memo, Jan. 23):
 An Inaugural Address at a time of national crisis does not call for graciousness but inspiration. It is a time for rallying the nation and identifying critical issues, and a time to proclaim goals, define challenges and prepare the people for sacrifices to come. 
 If the former president's advisers feel that he was ''wordboarded,'' so be it. President Obama said what he had to say.

HEADLINE: Thousands of Job Cuts Likely After Drug Merger

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Pfizer's $68 billion plan to buy another big drug company, Wyeth, seems like just the sort of blockbuster corporate merger that Wall Street has been starving for. 
 But it is also likely to pack a nasty side effect for the New York region, analysts say, in the form of thousands of layoffs and the likely shuttering of one of the two company headquarters. Pfizer is based in Manhattan, while Wyeth's headquarters are in Madison, N.J.
 And analysts say the proposed Pfizer-Wyeth merger could lead to a spurt of takeovers in the pharmaceutical industry that could help struggling investment banks but also cause pain for workers in the metropolitan area, which is to drug companies what Silicon Valley is to the technology industry. 
 ''This is one of those odd scenarios where increasing the deal flow will likely reduce employment in the pharmaceutical firms,'' said Damien Conover, a stock analyst with Morningstar in Chicago. Mr. Conover said he expected at least one more big merger involving companies based in the region, possibly including Schering-Plough or Merck.
 Most of the biggest American drugmakers are based in the region. Several, like Wyeth, Merck and Schering-Plough, have their headquarters in northern New Jersey. A few, like Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, still have their main offices in New York City.
 Pfizer said it would eliminate about 19,500 jobs from the combined companies over the next three years if the deal is consummated. Pfizer's chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, said that even without the deal, the company planned to cut 8,000 jobs by 2012. The company has about 4,500 employees in the city, about 1,600 in New Jersey and 5,000 in Connecticut.
 Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said it was too soon to say how many of those layoffs would happen in the city and the surrounding areas. But she said some of the reductions would result from combining administrative operations.
 Pfizer intends to keep its headquarters, on East 42nd Street, in the city, Ms. Campion said, but it has not decided what it would do with Wyeth's headquarters in Madison, about 25 miles west of Manhattan. 
 In most corporate takeovers, the target company's home base is emptied out and sold, Mr. Conover said. 
 ''The cuts will definitely come in the home offices,'' Mr. Conover said. But, he added, an even larger number could come from scattered field offices as Pfizer reverses its strategy of spreading sales representatives across the globe.
 Pfizer is facing the looming expiration of the patents on some of its most profitable prescription medications, and its research pipeline is not expected to yield as many breakthrough drugs as it has in the past, Mr. Conover said. It has been shrinking gradually in recent years. Two years ago, when it had about 100,000 employees worldwide, Pfizer closed its oldest manufacturing operation, a packaging center in Brooklyn that employed 600 workers.
 Wyeth employs about 47,000 people around the world, including more than 900 in Madison. Ray Codey, the borough administrator in Madison, said he had not received any definitive answer about what would happen to Wyeth, which he said was the second-largest private employer in Madison, after the Maersk shipping company. 
 The acquisition would be a boon to several banks, investment banks and law firms that advised the two companies on the transaction. To complete it, Pfizer would borrow more than $20 billion from banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Company, Citigroup, Bank of America and Barclays. 
 Each of those banks has received part of the federal bailout package the federal government provided to stabilize the American banking system. Mr. Conover said that could mean that federal funds are indirectly financing a merger that would wipe out nearly 20,000 jobs.
 But Kathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, an association of large corporations, objected to that view of the takeover. She said more good than harm would come from it, especially in the city. 
 ''We like mergers-and-acquisition activity. We're happy to see it,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''There's been a concern about the health of all sectors of our economy. Pfizer and the pharmaceutical industry are important parts to New York's efforts to develop a biotech cluster. As a result, anything that strengthens them, as this acquisition does, is something we consider important for the health and growth and certainly the diversification of the New York economy.''

HEADLINE: Paterson Seeks Distance From Senate Damage, but Hedges

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting from New York City.

DATELINE: HYDE PARK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Facing intense criticism for his handling of the appointment of a new United States senator, Gov. David A. Paterson tried to distance himself on Monday from the tarnishing of Caroline Kennedy, and abruptly canceled a trip to Switzerland he had planned for this week.
 The governor's moves came as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg condemned the treatment of Ms. Kennedy, who withdrew on Thursday after weeks of auditioning for the job. Under the cloak of anonymity, an associate of the governor criticized Ms. Kennedy to reporters later that day, saying that she was ill-suited for the position and that her candidacy had been derailed by problems involving taxes and a household employee. 
 ''It is as good an example of cheap, dirty politics as you could ever find,'' Mr. Bloomberg said on Monday at a news conference at City Hall. ''And I thought it was reprehensible.''
 Mr. Paterson has been trying to undo the damage he has suffered as a result of his highly visible and sometimes chaotic selection process for the Senate seat. But his remarks on Monday may have only confused matters more.
 When asked if the anonymous attacks on Ms. Kennedy had come from inside his administration, Mr. Paterson at first denied he or his staff had been behind them.
 ''I'm denying it,'' he said at an environmental conference at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library, which was convened by Kirsten E. Gillibrand, the senator-designate.
 But then he equivocated, lamenting the leaks that had been emanating from his office throughout the Senate search and his inability to determine who was responsible for them.
 ''But there have been leaks coming from my administration throughout this entire process of choosing a senator, of contradictory types of information,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''Now, as you know, this is a pretty serious thing, and actually one that I would condemn.''
 He added: ''I would love to know who is responsible. But at this point, I've been unable to determine that.''
 Ms. Kennedy took her name out of consideration last week for the seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton, stunning people inside and outside the New York political establishment because she was widely viewed as a leading contender for the appointment, which the governor of New York makes under state election law.
 Her departure set off conflicting reports, with some saying she was withdrawing out of concern for the health of her uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who is suffering from brain cancer. Other reports said she withdrew after learning that Mr. Paterson would not be selecting her. Ms. Kennedy's official statement said she withdrew for ''personal reasons'' but did not specify, only adding to the confusion.
 Then on Thursday, associates of Mr. Paterson reached out to news organizations, undermining Ms. Kennedy's qualifications; in some reports, Paterson associates were quoted anonymously as saying that Ms. Kennedy was ''not ready for prime time.'' 
 Mr. Paterson repeated on Monday comments he made in a written statement last week that he had not learned of any information that would have disqualified any contender from being selected for the job.
 He tried to shift the discussion among reporters gathered at the library, saying: ''I really wish that people would respect the decision that she made and let her go on with her life. She's not the senator. We have a new senator.''
 Addressing questions that his popularity had suffered as a result of the way he had handled the Senate selection process, he said he was trying to move on.
 ''You have ups and downs in public service, and you have to keep working. You have to keep trying. You have to keep doing your best. And if you conduct yourself ethically, I think over a period of time people see that.''
 As for his travels, the governor appeared to acknowledge that the timing of his trip to Davos, Switzerland, was not ideal, given the state's economic and fiscal trouble. The World Economic Forum typically attracts a who's who of financial and political titans, and Mr. Paterson expected to be there for several days. But with the specter of a recession this year, some, like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, have opted not to attend.
 When asked if he still planned to attend, given the projected $15 billion budget deficit, Mr. Paterson responded, ''I think I'll stay here,'' adding, ''Perhaps it would be a better idea to go at another time, send a couple of assistants and stay right here with the leaders of the Legislature and work on the budget.''
 A spokeswoman for the governor, Marissa Shorenstein, later clarified that no one from the governor's office would be attending the Davos meeting.

HEADLINE: Really Soft Power

BYLINE: By GARY SCHAUB. 
Gary Schaub is an assistant professor of strategy at the Air War College.

 BODY:
Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala. 
 GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, not Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, will shape American engagement with the Middle East for years to come. While Mrs. Clinton prepares to put together the State Department, the military is already reconsidering American policy in critical regions. The politically savvy General Petraeus has both a plan and the resources to see it through. 
 Unfortunately, Mrs. Clinton can't say the same. The State Department is supposed to direct American foreign policy, but it lacks the human and financial resources to fulfill its mission. R. Nicholas Burns, a foreign service veteran, may have summed up the problem best when he said that we have more musicians in the Pentagon than we have diplomats in the State Department. The department's budget for 2009 is $39 billion -- less than 8 percent of the amount allotted to the Defense Department. 
 Not surprisingly, the State Department has trouble pulling its weight -- and the Defense Department fills the void. Regional commanders like General Petraeus -- or Gens. H. Norman Schwartzkopf and Anthony Zinni before him -- have amassed great power and influence in the United States government and abroad since the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
 General Petraeus oversees Central Command -- America's military presence in the Middle East -- and has assembled a task force to develop a strategy for the area that stretches from Egypt to Pakistan. This task force will not develop a traditional military strategy with a focus on offensive and defensive operations. Centcom will aim to help nations in the region govern effectively, build their economies and provide security to their people. It will also try to communicate America's foreign policy intentions clearly. 
 Regional commanders oversee policy in their regions because no one else can. They have staffs of thousands, forces numbering in the tens of thousands and vast financial resources. These generals tower over civilians who share responsibility for securing American interests abroad: ambassadors, regional desk officers and assistant secretaries of state. 
 Defense Secretary Robert Gates recognizes the imbalance and has called for increasing the State Department's budget. But this is a long-term proposition. As he rebuilds his team in a new administration, Mr. Gates should see to it that every command has civilian officials to work alongside their military counterparts. He could, for instance, designate regional deputy defense secretaries to work with the regional commanders, just as Ambassador Ryan Crocker worked with General Petraeus on the successful surge strategy in Iraq. 
 As it stands, Defense Department civilians simply don't have the authority to hold their own with the regional commanders. They are ranked as deputy assistant secretaries of defense and are fourth-tier civilians within the secretary's office. They reside in small offices in the Pentagon and have even smaller staffs. Rarely do they engage with regional commanders.
 Mr. Gates could promote these officials, give their staffs bigger budgets and more support, and coordinate their activities with the regional commanders so that they would have increased awareness and influence over American policy. 
 Reorganization of the Defense Secretary's office along these lines would not solve the structural problem of a weak State Department. But it would be a necessary first step toward more effective oversight of foreign policy, and it would put a civilian face on American engagement with the world.

HEADLINE: Geography Is Dividing Democrats Over Energy

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama is moving quickly to act on the environmental promises that were a centerpiece of his campaign. But tackling global warming will be far more difficult -- and more costly -- than the new emissions standards for automobiles he ordered with the stroke of a pen on Monday. 
 Already, the Congressional Democrats Mr. Obama will need to carry out his mandate are feuding with one another.
 By coincidence or design, most of the policy makers on Capitol Hill and in the administration charged with shaping legislation to address global warming come from California or the East Coast, regions that lead the country in environmental regulation and the push for renewable energy sources. 
 That is a problem, says a group of Democratic lawmakers from the Midwest and Plains States, which are heavily dependent on coal and manufacturing. The lawmakers have banded together to fight legislation they think might further damage their economies.
 ''There's a bias in our Congress and government against manufacturing, or at least indifference to us, especially on the coasts,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. ''It's up to those of us in the Midwest to show how important manufacturing is. If we pass a climate bill the wrong way, it will hurt American jobs and the American economy, as more and more production jobs go to places like China, where it's cheaper.''
 This brown state-green state clash is likely to encumber any effort to set a mandatory ceiling on the carbon dioxide emissions blamed as the biggest contributor to global warming, something Mr. Obama has declared to be one of his highest priorities. Mr. Obama has said he intends to press ahead on such an initiative, despite opposition within his own party in Congress and divisions among some of his advisers over the timing, scope and cost of legislation to curb carbon emissions.
 The centrist Democrats who urge a slower-paced approach represent states that are crucial electoral battlegrounds and that stand to lose the most from such regulation. They say they believe that global warming is a serious threat and they will support legislation to address the problem -- but not at the expense of their already-strained workers and industries.
 These Democrats are concerned, they say, that climate bills will be written by committees in the House and Senate led by two liberal California Democrats, Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Henry A. Waxman, and shaped by Mr. Obama's team of environmental and energy advisers, virtually all of whom are from California or the East Coast.
 For decades, California has led the nation in environmental regulation, including the most sweeping effort to address global warming by imposing mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2012. 
 Following California's lead, a group of Northeastern States have created a partnership known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to control carbon emissions.
 But California and many East Coast States also differ sharply in the extent to which they depend on coal -- a fossil fuel that is a major culprit in producing carbon emissions. California, for example, derived only 20.7 percent of its electricity from coal and 40 percent from hydroelectric power and renewable sources in 2005, while Ohio drew 86 percent of its electricity from coal that year, according to the Department of Energy. Other states of the Great Lakes and Plains are much more like Ohio than California in energy usage.
 In the space of a single afternoon this month, Ms. Boxer, Mr. Waxman and the House speaker Nancy Pelosi, another California Democrat, issued statements declaring their intent to work with Mr. Obama to act quickly on comprehensive climate and energy legislation, with a goal of passage this year. Mr. Waxman said he expected to move a climate bill out of his Energy and Commerce Committee by Memorial Day. Ms. Boxer said ''the writing is on the wall that legislation to combat global warming is coming soon.''
 Rahm Emanuel, the new White House chief of staff, endorsed the lawmakers' timetable and said he believed the goal of passage of a broad climate change bill this year was ''realistic,'' given the substantial Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.
 Mr. Obama and leaders in Congress have endorsed a so-called cap-and-trade system in which power plant owners and other polluters could meet limits on heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide by either reducing emissions on their own or buying credits from more efficient producers.
 Mr. Obama's energy and environmental advisers include Lisa P. Jackson, the former head of the New Jersey environmental agency who will head the Environmental Protection Agency; Steven Chu, former director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, who is the new secretary of energy; and Nancy Sutley, former deputy mayor of Los Angeles for environmental affairs, the new chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
 Carol M. Browner, who will occupy the new post of White House coordinator for climate and energy policy, is a former head of the E.P.A., a former director of Florida's environmental agency and was a senior adviser to former Vice President Al Gore.
 The appointees come to office with a mandate from the president to transform the nation's energy economy and to lead the world in addressing climate change.
 But their ambitions confront a brutal reality of a weak economy, fading public concern about climate change and serious qualms within their own party about the costs of taking on global warming and who will pay them.
 They will also have to deal with bruised feelings among many Democrats over the coup Mr. Waxman mounted last November to wrest the gavel of the Energy and Commerce Committee from its longtime leader, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and a longtime champion of the auto industry and other Midwest manufacturers.
 ''For us, it's still a big disappointment,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, referring to the unseating of Mr. Dingell, who was pursuing a more moderate climate proposal than those advocated by Ms. Boxer and Mr. Waxman.
 ''My message over all is that for us to support what needs to be done in addressing global warming we need to demonstrate that, in fact, jobs are created,'' Ms. Stabenow said. ''It's not a theoretical argument. We have to come up with a policy that makes sense, that is manageable on the cost end, that creates new technology -- and that treats states equitably and addresses regional differences.''
 Ms. Stabenow is a leader of the so-called Gang of 10, representing the coal-dependent states in the middle of the country; the group was formed after the failure of a Senate global warming bill pushed by Ms. Boxer last June. The members' goal is to assure that their concerns are met in any future legislation.
 The other original members are Senators Brown of Ohio, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, Carl Levin of Michigan, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Jim Webb of Virginia, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and Ben Nelson of Nebraska.
 In the fall, six more Democratic senators joined the group: Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, Kent Conrad and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Ken Salazar of Colorado.
 Mr. Salazar has since left the Senate to become secretary of the interior.
 ''We will play an important role in the final bill,'' Ms. Stabenow said.
 Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been a leader in Congress on environmental matters for three decades, has been assigned by Mr. Waxman to write the House's version of global warming legislation. Mr. Markey said he was very aware of the concerns of coal-state Democrats.
 He noted that Mr. Obama, who comes from Illinois, a coal-dependent state, had traveled to Ohio last week to speak at a factory that produces parts for wind turbines.
 ''Every single wind turbine takes 26 tons of steel to construct,'' Mr. Markey said. ''A lot of new jobs will be created if we craft a piece of global warming legislation correctly, and that is our intention.''

HEADLINE: Detroit Calls Emissions Proposals Too Strict

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Automakers said Monday that they were working toward President Obama's goal of reducing fuel consumption, but rapid imposition of stricter emissions standards could force them to drastically cut production of larger, more profitable vehicles, adding to their financial duress.
 Mr. Obama ordered the government on Monday to reconsider whether California and other states could regulate vehicle emissions to help control greenhouse gas emissions, a reversal of a position taken by the Bush administration. 
 The announcement came as General Motors and Chrysler are borrowing billions of dollars from the government to avoid bankruptcy, and as Toyotaprepares to report its first operating loss in 70 years. Shortly after the president spoke, General Motors said it would cut 2,000 jobs at plants in Michigan and Ohio because of slow sales.
 The California regulations, if enacted today, ''would basically kill the industry,'' said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, an independent research organization in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''It would have a devastating effect on everybody, and not just the domestics.''
 But Mr. Cole said he thought major modifications to the proposed standards were likely and that action was still ''a long ways off,'' giving the carmakers more time to overcome their financial problems and develop the technologies needed to sell a full lineup of compliant vehicles. 
 Right now, carmakers say they would be able to sell only their smallest, most fuel-efficient cars -- models like the Toyota Prius, a hybrid whose sales have fallen sharply since gas prices began dropping last fall -- because once-popular vehicles like pickup trucks made by Ford and G.M. are not efficient enough.
 ''I want clean air and clean water just like the next guy,'' said Erich Merkle, an independent automotive analyst in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''But in the real world, there would be consumer outrage with the fact that they're limited to maybe two vehicles and there's nothing there that would meet their family's needs.''
 Environmental advocates who have long challenged the automakers' opposition to the proposed California standards say such regulations will help the companies produce vehicles that consumers want. 
 Failing to invest in reducing emissions and increasing efficiency will only prolong Detroit's problems, said David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 ''I think this is the pathway to their survival,'' Mr. Doniger said. ''If carmakers are going to survive in a world of volatile oil prices and global warming, they have to be making more efficient vehicles. When the economy comes back and people start buying cars again, they're going to expect that gas prices are going to go up, and they're not going to want the gas hogs that they used to want. Consumers' tastes have changed in terms of what's cool.''
 One concern automakers have with states regulating tailpipe emissions is that keeping up with a hodgepodge of standards would be difficult. They expressed support Monday for the ideal of cutting emissions but want their engineers to be concerned with meeting just one set of requirements nationally.
 The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 11 carmakers, said it favored ''a nationwide program that bridges state and federal concerns and moves all stakeholders forward, and we are ready to work with the administration on developing a national approach,'' in a statement from the group's chief executive, Dave McCurdy.
 G.M., the only Detroit automaker to issue its own response Monday, said it was ''working aggressively on the products and the advance technologies that match the nation's and consumers' priorities to save energy and reduce emissions.'' But the company also emphasized the need for ''a comprehensive policy discussion that takes into account the development pace of new technologies, alternative fuels and market and economic factors.''
 Automakers are operating in the worst market since the early 1980s. New vehicle sales fell nearly 19 percent in 2008 and are universally expected to be even lower in 2009.
 Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who has long been one of the Detroit automakers' strongest allies in Washington, praised the president's attitude toward global warmingand expressed hope that the administration would act only after studying the effect that ''setting a patchwork of different emission standards'' would have.
 ''President Obama and I both share the goal of energy independence and a cleaner environment for our children and grandchildren,'' Mr. Dingell said in a statement. ''We have a unique opportunity in history to address the issue of global climate change and we must take bold and balanced action.''
 Mr. Cole, the Center for Automotive research chairman, said he believed Congress would ensure Detroit would be able to live with any new standards.

HEADLINE: Something to Fear, After All

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In 1933, as today, a new president stepped into the White House, vowing change and decisive action at a time when a banking crisis posed a grave threat to the nation's economy.
 The economic morass that confronted Franklin D. Roosevelt 76 years ago was undeniably deeper and more ominous than the trouble President Obama is facing. Yet, according to economists and historians, there are also some telling similarities and cautionary lessons to be drawn from the experience of the Roosevelt years in the 1930s.
 Roosevelt had his triumphs. He stemmed panic and stabilized the banking system with a combination of deposit insurance, government investment in banks, restrictions on banking practices and his ''fireside chat'' radio addresses, which repeatedly steadied the national mood and bought Roosevelt time to make changes. 
 Still, even after the government assistance, the surviving banks were shaken and lending remained anemic -- much as the nation's banks today are reluctant to make loans again, despite receiving more than $300 billion of taxpayers' money in Round 1 of the federal banking bailout. 
 So, throughout the 1930s, economic recovery remained frustratingly elusive and arrived only with the buildup for World War II in the 1940s.
 The shorthand verdict on Roosevelt, economists and historians say, is that he was an eloquent and skillful politician, and an innovator in jobs programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps and in regulatory steps like the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission to police Wall Street. But Roosevelt, they say, while brilliant in many ways, did not have a sure grasp of how to guide the economy as a whole.
 ''Roosevelt had some successes, but we hope that Obama is going to do better,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. ''Otherwise, we're in trouble.''
 Roosevelt's New Deal is often portrayed as an embrace of Keynesian economics, which advocates increased government spending to combat economic downturns and generate jobs. 
 Yet despite New Deal programs and some aid to the states, total government spending -- federal, state and local -- as a share of the economy throughout the 1930s remained at just under 20 percent. (Today, total government spending is more than 35 percent, a larger buffer against weakness in the private sector.)
 During the 1930s, the unemployment rate fell somewhat under Roosevelt, but remained stubbornly high, averaging more than 17 percent for the decade. 
 In 1934, the British economist John Maynard Keynes visited Roosevelt in the White House to make his case for more deficit spending. But Roosevelt, it seems, was either unimpressed or uncomprehending. ''He left a whole rigmarole of figures,'' Roosevelt complained to his labor secretary, Frances Perkins, according to her memoir. ''He must be a mathematician rather than a political economist.''
 Keynes left equally disenchanted, telling Ms. Perkins that he had ''supposed the president was more literate, economically speaking.''
 It would not be until the early 1940s, with the beginning of World War II, that a strong dose of Keynesian medicine was administered to the American economy. By 1942, total government spending as a share of the economy rose to 52 percent, and peaked at nearly 70 percent in 1944, when unemployment fell to 1 percent.
 One lesson from the 1930s, economists say, is how difficult it is to engineer a recovery when an economy has spiraled down as far as it had by 1933. Swift and effective steps early in a downturn, they say, can enable an economy to avoid further slippage and joblessness. And Mr. Obama has the advantage of taking over far earlier in an economic descent than Roosevelt did. 
 In 1933, the United States economy had shrunk by one-third in real terms since 1929. Industrial production had fallen by 40 percent. Unemployment had soared to 25 percent, from 3 percent in 1929. 
 ''Mute shoals of jobless men drifted through the streets of every American city in 1933,'' wrote David M. Kennedy of Stanford, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the Depression, ''Freedom From Fear'' (Oxford, 1999).
 Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, amid a nationwide bank panic -- the impetus of his memorable line, ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.''
 Roosevelt may have been lacking as an economist, but he was an extraordinary crisis manager. The next day, he declared a national bank holiday, and set the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to work on a phased program to sort good banks from bad ones, provide financing and restore confidence in the banking system.
 In his first fireside chat on March 12, Roosevelt addressed the nation to discuss the banking crisis. He started with a brief education in how banks work, with most money not held in their vaults but lent out. ''The bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels of industry and of agriculture turning around,'' he said.
 Bank runs, by themselves, can bring commerce to a halt. He reassured his listeners, ''It is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.'' And he appealed: ''You people must have faith; you must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses. Let us unite in banishing fear.''
 At the time, listeners had only Roosevelt's word that his plans to stabilize the banking system would work. But he had an uncanny ability to communicate in simple and convincing terms. When the stock market reopened on March 15 after being closed for more than a week, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 15 percent, the biggest percentage gain ever in one day.
 ''Roosevelt was a genius at using those fireside chats to calm the national mood and restore confidence,'' said John Steele Gordon, an author and business historian. ''Never underestimate the power of psychology in the economy. We're seeing that now.''
 Roosevelt deployed his persuasive powers to buy time for his programs to address the banking problem. Besides deposit insurance and a banking act that controlled competition and interest rates, Roosevelt drastically enlarged and expanded the role of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which was established in 1932. 
 The agency made loans to troubled banks, and seized and sold off distressed assets at others. After government inspections, many small banks never reopened, with more than 4,000 closed in 1933. The agency also bought stock in 6,000 banks, at a cost of $1.3 billion. In proportion to today's economy, the program would amount to about $200 billion.
 That is nearly the size of the government capital injections so far in banks as part of the financial rescue package enacted by Congress in the fall. With new capital, Congress and the Bush administration hoped, banks would resume normal lending to businesses and consumers. But worried banks are holding onto the money, so there has been scant benefit to the economy from the government help to the banks.
 Roosevelt, it seems, had the same problem. ''He was much better at reassuring the public that the banks were safe than he was at persuading the banks to lend again,'' said Richard Sylla, an economist and financial historian at the Stern School of Business at New York University. Throughout the 1930s, Mr. Sylla said, the amount banks lent for each dollar of reserves remained at about half the level of the 1920s.
 Today, a range of steps is being examined by the Obama team to resolve the banking logjam. They include taking the toxic mortgage-backed assets from the banks in a separate agency and selling them off to partial and wholesale nationalization plans. Some of these echo tactics used by the ReconstructionFinance Corporation of the Roosevelt era.
 ''But the banking crisis today is more complex and more global, so we'll have to do something bigger than the R.F.C.,'' said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T.
 More government spending beyond the planned $825 billion economic recovery plan, economists say, is probably in the cards as well. Roosevelt is seen as the father of big-spending government, yet the judgment of history seems to be that in the 1930s he was too timid.
 ''The lesson from the 1930s and early 1940s is that the government has to do much more than it has done so far, both to end the financial crisis and to get us out of the recession,'' said Mr. Sylla of N.Y.U. ''I do think the Obama team knows this and seems prepared to act on the knowledge.''

HEADLINE: Geithner Wins Confirmation

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Timothy F. Geithner was sworn in as secretary of the Treasury on Monday evening, confirmed by a Senate majority that concluded that his experience in government and finance outweighed concerns about recent disclosures of some $34,000 in past tax delinquencies. 
 The vote was 60 to 34.
 The tax controversy had delayed Mr. Geithner's confirmation, keeping him from taking office right after Barack Obama's inauguration last Tuesday as administration officials had hoped, given the economic emergency.
 In a desultory two-hour Senate debate on Monday, opponents cited the tax issue to explain their votes against Mr. Geithner's leading the Treasury, which oversees the Internal Revenue Service. A couple of populist senators objected as well to the leading role he played, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in government bailouts of financial institutions over the last few months. As early as next week, the new secretary will announce changes for the bailout program that are expected to press banks to make more loans and reduce housing foreclosures.
 Mr. Geithner, 47, who was sworn into office by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a ceremony at the Treasury Building attended by Mr. Obama, spent the first 13 of his 20 years in government service working for the Treasury, rising to under secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration.
 His confirmation became unexpectedly complicated this month by the disclosure that he failed to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for 2001-4, when he was a senior official at the International Monetary Fund. As an international organization, the I.M.F. does not withhold taxes for American employees, though it does provide statements of their estimated liabilities and pays them an amount equal to the employer share of payroll taxes.
 Mr. Geithner ultimately paid a total of more than $48,000 in back taxes and interest, making one payment after an I.R.S. audit in 2006 and the rest last November. Privately and at his confirmation hearing last week before the Finance Committee, he apologized to senators for what he called an innocent mistake. 
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, one of 10 Republicans to vote for Mr. Geithner, praised his credentials on the floor Monday, though he said Democrats would probably not have shown the same deference toward a Republican president's nominee with similar violations. 
 Three Democrats -- Senators Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Tom Harkin of Iowa -- voted against the nominee, as did an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
 In a floor speech, Mr. Harkin said, ''How can Mr. Geithner speak with any credibility and authority as America's chief tax enforcement officer?''

HEADLINE: At $235 Million, Bloomberg Was Biggest Giver in U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg can now claim to be No. 1 in a category he cares deeply about: giving his money away.
 Mr. Bloomberg, the self-made billionaire founder of the Bloomberg financial information firm, donated $235 million in 2008, making him the leading individual living donor in the United States, according to a list released online on Monday by The Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's top designation applies to people who have actually written checks, not just pledged money. And it does not apply to people who died last year and donated money via their estates, with Leona M. Helmsley's $5.2 billion bequest to her charitable trust, dedicated to the welfare of dogs, topping the list.
 The mayor contributed to more than 1,200 organizations promoting arts, education and health care, like Johns Hopkins Medicine; the Robin Food Foundation, an antipoverty group; and Stand Up to Cancer, a research organization in Pasadena, Calif.
 The previous year, Mr. Bloomberg gave to about 1,100 groups, and his total contributions of $205 million trailed those of several people, including Jon M. Huntsman, the chemicals magnate, and the financier George Soros.
 Mr. Bloomberg's donations have increased steadily over the last decade, including a doubling of contributions in 2000 to $100 million from $47 million, at a time when he was laying the groundwork for his run for mayor. His fortune was estimated to be $20 billion before the current recession.
 ''As the economy took a turn from bad to worse, I felt it was the right time -- the essential time -- for someone like me, someone who's been so fortunate in my own life, to step up and give back even more,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement. ''I don't think of it only as a responsibility, but as a privilege.''
 Mr. Bloomberg generated controversy a few months ago when he asked some of the local groups that rely on his private donations to publicly support his bid for a third term in office. But administration officials say that Mr. Bloomberg separates his philanthropy from his job as mayor, and that the organizations that endorsed his third-term endeavor have worked with the city for years.
 Still, Mr. Bloomberg, 66, does have a long way to go before he fulfills his ultimate goal. He intends to give away most of his fortune, and he has said that the best measure of a philanthropist is that the check to the undertaker bounces.

HEADLINE: Defense and No Apologies From Author of Fiscal Bill

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When House Republicans look at the $825 billion economic package headed toward a vote this week, they do not see President Obama. To them, the bill personifies Representative David R. Obey, the prickly Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee and has spent 40 years in Congress as a champion of federal spending.
 Included in the package is $30 billion to subsidize health insurance for those who lose their jobs, $20 billion to accelerate new health care information technology, $1 billion to renovate community health centers, $600 million to train health care workers, $15 billion to increase college Pell Grants and $4 billion to help communities buy and improve distressed properties. 
 Indeed, it was Mr. Obey, the third-most-senior member of the House, who, in large measure, shaped the bill, in concert with other House Democratic leaders. And though Mr. Obama has embraced the bill, not a single House Republican has lent it support. The president himself is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to address Republican concerns that Mr. Obey and others are using the legislation to push vast amounts of money into health care and other favored initiatives.
 ''It is pretty obvious we are funding the chairman's priorities,'' said Representative Jerry Lewis of California, the senior Republican on the appropriations panel. Mr. Lewis described Mr. Obey as driven by a ''pent-up desire to spend money in existing programs.''
 But the plan is expected to pass with or without Republican support, and Mr. Obey makes no apologies for its contents. An essential part of responding to any economic crisis, he said, is looking out for those on the receiving end of the turmoil.
 ''You have to take into account the fact that there are certain people in this society getting crushed by this economy,'' said Mr. Obey, whose work on the package left him worn down and struggling to regain his voice. ''They lose their jobs, they lose their health insurance, they lose their ability to keep their kids in college.
 ''If you didn't have two million additional people out of work, you wouldn't have to be looking for ways to help them. What the hell do you do if the economy goes to hell and two or three or four million more people are out of work?''
 Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, sees it differently. ''This is 1936 economics,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''But it reflects David's ideology and his economic doctrine. They took everything in their file cabinet that has been piling up for 100 years, threw it in this bill and called it economic stimulus.''
 Mr. Obey, 70, the product of a Catholic blue-collar upbringing in Wausau, said that if he had sole ownership, he would have turned out a costlier measure with more health spending. He said his role was to fashion a package that could balance the competing interests and ideas of a range of lawmakers, the new administration and outside groups, and roll it into a bill that could pass -- and lift the economy.
 ''This is my honest effort,'' he said, ''to find a point of equilibrium where a majority of people in the place can feel comfortable with what we have done, and then you hope it works.'' 
 It is just the latest in a series of big spending bills overseen by Mr. Obey, who has been at the center of Congressional money wars for decades since his election in 1969. 
 The bearded and bespectacled Mr. Obey is often seen racing between his office in the Capitol and the House floor just steps away. Friends say they gauge his mood by the number of sharpened No. 2 pencils stuck in his pocket: the higher the number, the more caution to use when approaching. 
 ''David is tough and doesn't suffer fools lightly,'' said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, a longtime colleague who credits him with a ''masterful job'' in putting the plan together. ''He was given a mission, and there wasn't anybody else who would put in the time, the energy and the effort to meet the demands everyone had on him.'' 
 Mr. Obey's impatience, temper and occasionally cutting tone are well known. Even as he outlined the economic plan before Mr. Obama's inauguration, he flippantly referred to the new president as ''the crown prince.'' The remark was evidence that Mr. Obey, like other veteran chairmen involved in writing the stimulus package, might not be entirely deferential to the new president until he proved he could exert his influence.
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California placed Mr. Obey in charge of producing the economic measure and shares his view that the spending for health, nutrition and unemployment programs is justified and a quicker way than tax breaks to pump money into the economy. Ms. Pelosi is very loyal to the chairman, who was a top ally in her 2001 race for Democratic whip.
 Putting the economic bill together turned out to be challenging. Mr. Obey and a contingent of Democratic staff members worked over the holidays, meeting with other lawmakers. They were in talks with Rahm Emanuel, who was soon to be the White House chief of staff, and Rob Nabors, a former staff director of the Appropriations Committee who had left to join the Obama team as a budget official.
 ''I virtually have done nothing else but this since November,'' Mr. Obey said.
 As the deadline for delivering a bill neared, the effort went well into the night. Mr. Obey told reporters that he informed fellow Democrats who raised questions about the bill in a private meeting that they had to take into consideration that it was finished at 4 a.m. after four martinis -- a crack he quickly clarified as a joke.
 One top Democratic official acknowledged privately there was some frustration that the legislation was being used to push money into favored Democratic programs. But the official said that that was a small element of the overall measure and that existing programs were the most efficient way to distribute money quickly.
 While Republicans are shaking their heads at the 647-page bill, Mr. Obey said the legislation met Mr. Obama's goals of renewing consumer buying power through job creation, aiding those most severely hit by the downturn and transforming the economy. 
 ''With all due respect,'' he said, addressing his critics, ''I would say the vast majority of the Congress, the new White House and the vast majority of the country will favor this package or something very close to it.''

HEADLINE: The Same Old Song

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
What's up with the Republicans? Have they no sense that their policies have sent the country hurtling down the road to ruin? Are they so divorced from reality that in their delusionary state they honestly believe we need more of their tax cuts for the rich and their other forms of plutocratic irresponsibility, the very things that got us to this deplorable state?
 The G.O.P.'s latest campaign is aimed at undermining President Obama's effort to cope with the national economic emergency by attacking the spending in his stimulus package and repeating ad nauseam the Republican mantra for ever more tax cuts. 
 ''Right now, given the concerns that we have over the size of this package and all the spending in this package, we don't think it's going to work,'' said Representative John Boehner, an Ohio Republican who is House minority leader. Speaking on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Boehner said of the plan: ''Put me down in the 'no' column.''
 If anything, the stimulus package is not large enough. Less than 24 hours after Mr. Boehner's televised exercise in obstructionism, the heavy-equipment company Caterpillar announced that it was cutting 20,000 jobs, Sprint Nextel said it was eliminating 8,000, and Home Depot 7,000.
 Maybe the Republicans don't think there is an emergency. After all, it was Phil Gramm, John McCain's economic guru, who told us last summer that the pain was all in our heads, that this was a ''mental recession.''
 The truth, of course, is that the country is hemorrhaging jobs and Americans are heading to the poorhouse by the millions. The stock markets and the value of the family home have collapsed, and there is virtual across-the-board agreement that the country is caught up in the worst economic disaster since at least World War II.
 The Republican answer to this turmoil?
 Tax cuts.
 They need to go into rehab.
 The question that I would like answered is why anyone listens to this crowd anymore. G.O.P. policies have been an absolute backbreaker for the middle class. (Forget the poor. Nobody talks about them anymore, not even the Democrats.) The G.O.P. has successfully engineered a wholesale redistribution of wealth to those already at the top of the income ladder and then, in a remarkable display of chutzpah, dared anyone to talk about class warfare.
 A stark example of this unholy collaboration between the G.O.P. and the very wealthy was on display in the pages of this newspaper on Jan. 18. The Times's Mike McIntire wrote an article about the first wave of federal bailout money for the financial industry, which was handed over by the Bush administration with hardly any strings attached. (Congress, under the control of the Democrats, should never have allowed this to happen, but the Democrats are as committed to fecklessness as the Republicans are to tax cuts.)
 The public was told that the money would be used to loosen the frozen credit markets and thus help revive the economy. But as the article pointed out, there were bankers with other ideas. John C. Hope III, the chairman of the Whitney National Bank in New Orleans, in an address to Wall Street fat cats gathered at the Palm Beach Ritz-Carlton, said:
 ''Make more loans? We're not going to change our business model or our credit policies to accommodate the needs of the public sector as they see it to have us make more loans.''
 How's that for arrogance and contempt for the public interest? Mr. Hope's bank received $300 million in taxpayer bailout money.
 The same article quoted Walter M. Pressey, president of Boston Private Wealth Management, which Mr. McIntire described as a healthy bank with a mostly affluent clientele. It received $154 million in taxpayer money.
 ''With that capital in hand,'' said Mr. Pressey, ''not only do we feel comfortable that we can ride out the recession, but we also feel that we'll be in a position to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves once this recession is sorted out.''
 Take advantage, indeed. That, in a nutshell, is what the plutocracy is all about: taking unfair advantage.
 When the G.O.P. talks, nobody should listen. Republicans have argued, with the collaboration of much of the media, that they could radically cut taxes while simultaneously balancing the federal budget, when, in fact, big income-tax cuts inevitably lead to big budget deficits. We listened to the G.O.P. and what do we have now? A trillion-dollar-plus deficit and an economy in shambles.
 This is the party that preached fiscal discipline and then cut taxes in time of war. This is the party that still wants to put the torch to Social Security and Medicare. This is a party that, given a choice between Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, would choose Ronald Reagan in a heartbeat.
 Why is anyone still listening?

HEADLINE: DuPont Cuts Its '09 Forecast And 8,000 Contractors' Jobs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The chemical maker DuPont reported a $629 million fourth-quarter loss on Tuesday as a result of lower sales and a huge revamping charge. The company also cut its earnings forecast for 2009. 
 The company, based in Wilmington, Del., said its loss for the quarter was 70 cents a share, compared with a profit of $45 million, or 60 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding a charge of $380 million from a previously announced overhaul program, the fourth-quarter loss was $249 million, or 28 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by ThomsonReuters, on average, expected a loss of 24 cents a share. The analyst estimates typically exclude one-time items.
 Net sales in the quarter dropped 17 percent, to $5.8 billion, from $6.98 billion. Higher prices in all regions and across all business segments were more than offset by volume declines and negative currency effects.
 The company said declines in consumer spending, construction and motor vehicle sales led to a sharp drop in demand and a steep decline in global industrial production.
 Its full-year earnings for 2008 were $2 billion, or $2.20 a share, down from $2.9 billion, or $3.22 a share a year ago.
 The company lowered its full-year earnings estimate for 2009 to $2 to $2.50 a share, down from its previous guidance of $2.25 to $2.75 a share. It also announced that it would cut 8,000 contractors from its work force.
 Last month, DuPont announced that it would cut 2,500 jobs and was releasing 4,000 contractors by the end of 2008.

HEADLINE: An Insider Takes the Helm at the New York Fed

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Within the byzantine corridors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley is a consummate insider. From his small office near rows of flickering trading screens, he has quietly orchestrated the central bank's response to the crisis in the financial markets. 
 Now Mr. Dudley, an economist with a knack for reading the markets, is stepping into the spotlight as the Fed's senior statesman on Wall Street. On Tuesday, Mr. Dudley, 56, was appointed to succeed Timothy L. Geithner, the new Treasury secretary, as president of the New York Fed. 
 Running the New York Fed, the most powerful of the 12 regional Fed banks, is a complex job in the best of times. But Mr. Dudley, 56, confronts challenges few of his predecessors faced. He must navigate a painful recession while leading the Fed's sweeping efforts to stabilize the nation's troubled financial industry.
 Analysts said Mr. Dudley, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, is up to the task. At Goldman and at the Fed, he has forged strong relationships within the financial community and in Washington. Many praise his pragmatism.
 As executive vice president of the Fed's markets group, Mr. Dudley oversaw the central bank's domestic open market and foreign exchange trading operations, through which the Fed interacts with the financial world. He gave regular briefings to the 12-member Fed panel that sets interest rates, a group he now joins, and presided over a string of new Fed programs aimed at thawing the frozen credit markets. 
 Mr. Dudley is also close to Mr. Geithner, who played a crucial role in the government's rescues of Bear Stearns and the American International Group, as well as its controversial decision to let Lehman Brothers fail.
 Some members of the Fed's search committee saw only one potential liability for Mr. Dudley: his years at Goldman Sachs, whose alumni include the former Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and a raft of other top financial policy makers. 
 ''Bill will be a breath of fresh air,'' said Christopher Whalen, managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics. ''He will be much more attuned to making the Fed's policies practical and effective, as opposed to reactive.'' 
 Mr. Dudley comes to the job at a time when the Fed is assuming a greater role in supervising the financial industry. That could hand more influence to the New York Fed and its new president. 
 Mr. Dudley, who joined the Fed in January 2007 after nearly 20 years at Goldman, emerged as the leading contender for the job after a two-month search led by Korn/Ferry International. The New York Fed's board interviewed six candidates. Prospects included Kevin M. Warsh, a Federal Reserve governor; David H. McCormick, a senior Treasury official; Terrence J. Checki, another New York Fed official; H. Rodgin Cohen, the chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell and a prominent Wall Street lawyer; and Paul Calello, chief executive of Credit Suisse's investment bank.
 ''Bill has led our markets group at a crucial time and helped conceptualize, develop and manage many of the Fed's responses to these extraordinary financial conditions,'' Denis M. Hughes, the New York Fed's deputy chairman and a member of the search committee, said in a statement. ''Under his leadership, the New York Fed will continue to work closely with the Treasury and the board of governors in dealing with the economic situation we confront.'' 
 In announcing the appointment on Tuesday, the chairman of the New York Fed's board, Stephen Friedman, said that Mr. Dudley's ''deep economics background, extensive working knowledge of the markets and hands-on policy-making role make him an outstanding choice to succeed Tim Geithner.''

HEADLINE: Days Before the Super Bowl, the Game Plans Change

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
YES, Virginia, and the other 49 states, there is a Super Bowl on Sunday, despite the awful economy. And it appears that NBC will be able to sell all 33 1/2 minutes of commercial time the network intends to run in the game, even at a record price estimated to average $3 million for each 30-second spot.
 Still, the uncertainties of this challenging year are manifesting themselves in the days before Super Bowl XLIII as advertisers think, rethink -- and rethink again -- what they intend to do.
 The problem is not so much Hamlet-like indecision. Rather, Madison Avenue is worried that its myriad, carefully laid plans will turn out to be inappropriate or unseemly for the unusual national mood of pervasive gloom leavened with a soupcon of hope. 
 For instance, Hyundai Motor America decided months ago to buy two 30-second commercials in the game, both for the 2010 Hyundai Genesis coupe. But as the financial crisis unfolded, the company began to reconsider that, to perhaps add a spot that would directly address the economy. Such a spot would promote an insurance policy called Hyundai Assurance, which offers car buyers the chance to undo their deals if they lose their jobs.
 The idea was ''to take advantage of the fact Hyundai has some unusual positioning in the market right now'' for reasons that include the insurance policy as well as the lower prices of its cars, said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman of the Hyundai agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group.
 ''These guys do have something to say,'' he added. ''It's a question of whether you have the money or not.''
 On Tuesday afternoon, Hyundai announced that it had indeed rethought its lineup. There will be one spot in the game for Hyundai Assurance, and one saluting the 2009 Genesis sedan for winning a ''car of the year'' award.
 One spot for the Genesis coupe, with the rock musician Billy Corgan, is being moved to the pregame show, where Hyundai will also run a second spot for Hyundai Assurance along with a second spot for the Genesis sedan. Those three commercials will earn Hyundai a title sponsorship of that program.
 In the end, the other spot for the Genesis coupe, featuring the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, ''didn't make the cut,'' said Joel Ewanick, vice president for marketing at Hyundai Motor America.
 Asked how Mr. Ma could make the inauguration ceremony but not the Super Bowl, Mr. Ewanick laughed and replied that the Ma spot would run instead during the Academy Awards on Feb. 22. 
 Like Hyundai, Cars.com, owned by a consortium of media companies like Gannett and McClatchy, took another look at its Super Bowl playbook after the economy worsened last fall.
 The goal was to find ''what's the right tone for the current environment,'' Carolyn Crafts, vice president for marketing at Cars.com, said in an interview on Tuesday where she shared the company's revised plans, while at the same time reflecting that the Super Bowl is typically ''a big entertainment event'' for viewers regardless of the economic climate.
 The 60-second commercial that Cars.com is buying during the game will take a gentler, more lighthearted approach than the two spots the company ran during the Super Bowl last year. The 2009 commercial will play up the premise that using Cars.com to buy a new or used car will bolster the buyer's confidence that he or she is making the best deal.
 Typically, the PepsiCo North America Beverages unit of PepsiCo has its lineup of Super Bowl commercials decided well before the game. But on Tuesday, at a news conference in Midtown Manhattan, executives acknowledged their plans for Sunday were still in flux.
 The company and its agencies have completed or are finishing many more commercials than can fit into the air time they previously purchased, said Massimo d'Amore, chief executive at PepsiCo North America Beverages.
 As a result, ''we're talking to NBC right now,'' he added, ''to buy more time.'' The company originally bought about three to four minutes of commercial time in the game.
 One decision has been made: which beverage brands will be advertised during the game. There will be two commercials by the Arnell Group in New York, part of Omnicom, for varieties of SoBe Life Water; one spot will be in 3-D, as part of a promotion for a new film, ''Monsters vs. Aliens,'' from DreamWorks Animation.
 (A 3-D commercial for the film, to be placed by DreamWorks Animation and the Paramount Pictures division of Viacom, will precede the SoBe spot, creating what may be the first ''pod,'' or cluster, of 3-D commercials during a Super Bowl.)
 Other PepsiCo North America Beverages brands to be advertised will be in spots created by the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of another Omnicom agency, the TBWA/Chiat/Day division of TBWA Worldwide. They will be for Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola and Pepsi Max.
 For Gatorade, there may be one 60-second or two 30-second spots, part of a new campaign that refers to Gatorade as ''G.'' Teaser ads in the campaign have drawn considerable comment on blogs and other Web sites.
 Concepts for the spot or spots for Gatorade are being tested online, said Julie Hamp, senior vice president at PepsiCo, which is ''a new approach'' for the company's Super Bowl ads.
 Pepsi-Cola may have more than one commercial, possibly with a spot that features the singers Bob Dylan and Will.i.am. Pepsi-Cola is also getting a new campaign, carrying the themes ''Refresh everything'' and ''Every generation refreshes the world.''
 More certain are the Super Bowl plans for Pepsi Max, which call for two spots, one 15 seconds and the other 30. There is also a new campaign for that brand, formerly called Diet Pepsi Max.
 The PepsiCo beverage executives ''are taking every minute they can, right up to the final deadline, to decide what to put in the game,'' said John D. Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade publication, who attended the news conference.
 ''They've got a very, very full platter with the range and depth of changes they're making across the entire beverage portfolio,'' which in addition to new campaigns include new brand-names and redesigned packaging.
 In another example of how mercurially some marketers are behaving, one Super Bowl advertiser arranged to be interviewed by a reporter on Monday to describe its commercial for this column. But executives at the company had second thoughts and called off the interview.
 On the other hand, Anheuser-Busch InBev, which often does not complete its Super Bowl ad plans until a day or two before the game -- and has been known to switch beer spots around mere hours before game time -- told reporters on Tuesday that its lineup for Sunday was set.
 ''I think this is it, locked down,'' said Bob Lachky, chief creative officer at Anheuser-Busch, listing three commercials for Bud Light; three for Budweiser, all featuring the Clydesdale horses; and one for Bud Light Lime.
 The plans call for at least one spot in each quarter, Mr. Lachky said, adding that a commercial for a new brand, Budweiser American Ale, would appear if the game went into overtime.

HEADLINE: U.S. Infrastructure Is in Dire Straits, Report Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
More than a quarter of the nation's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Leaky pipes lose an estimated seven billion gallons of clean drinking water every day. And aging sewage systems send billions of gallons of untreated wastewater cascading into the nation's waterways each year.
 These are among the findings of a report to be released Wednesday by the American Society of Civil Engineers, which assigned an overall D grade to the nation's infrastructure and estimated that it would take a $2.2 trillion investment from all levels of government over the next five years to bring it into a state of good repair. 
 The society had planned to release the report in March, but moved it up to try to influence the debate over the $825 billion economic stimulus bill being negotiated by the Obama administration and Congress. Advocates for greater investment in public works projects have expressed disappointment that less than a third of the current proposal -- which could be approved by the House on Wednesday -- would be spent on infrastructure, and an even smaller part of that would go toward traditional concrete-and-steel projects like roads and transit.
 ''Crumbling infrastructure has a direct impact on our personal and economic health, and the nation's infrastructure crisis is endangering our future prosperity,'' the president of the society, D. Wayne Klotz, said in a statement. ''Our leaders are looking for solutions to the nation's current economic crisis. Not only could investment in these critical foundations have a positive impact, but if done responsibly, it would also provide tangible benefits to the American people, such as reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, clean and abundant water supplies and protection against natural hazards.''
 The current stimulus plan is weighted toward tax cuts, aid to the states, and an expanded safety net for people struggling to make ends meet. Much of the infrastructure spending it does contain would be in unusual areas. The plan devotes money to creating a database of health records, for example, and would spend more money making federal buildings energy-efficient than on repairing roads and bridges. In part this is because of questions about how soon major building projects can begin, because the goal of the bill is to inject money into the parched economy as quickly as possible.
 The American Society of Civil Engineers, which has been sounding the alarm about the nation's deteriorating infrastructure for years, and whose members would benefit from a major new investment in building and repair projects, paints a bleak picture of the state of the nation's roads, transit systems, aviation system and levees. And it warned that in area after area, spending was being far outpaced by needs. 
 The society gave the nation's roads a D-minus, noting that Americans are spending an estimated 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic and that 45 percent of major urban highways are congested. Transit and aviation did not fare much better, getting D grades. The society noted that while mass transit use increased 25 percent from 1995 to 2005, nearly half of American households still lacked access to bus or rail transit. And it said that the increasing delays faced by airline passengers highlighted the need to modernize the outdated air traffic control system.
 For the first time, this year the group examined the nation's levees, and gave them a D-minus. The report warned that many of the nation's levees were built more than 50 years ago to protect crops, but now protect communities. It warned that the cost of repairing and rehabilitating them could exceed $100 billion.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Plan Offers Road To Retooling Social Policy

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The economic stimulus plan that Congress has scheduled for a vote on Wednesday would shower the nation's school districts, child care centers and university campuses with $150 billion in new federal spending, a vast two-year investment that would more than double the Department of Education's current budget.
 The proposed emergency expenditures on nearly every realm of education, including school renovation, special education, Head Start and grants to needy college students, would amount to the largest increase in federal aid since Washington began to spend significantly on education after World War II.
 Critics and supporters alike said that by its sheer scope, the measure could profoundly change the federal government's role in education, which has traditionally been the responsibility of state and local government. 
 Responding in part to a plea from Democratic governors earlier this month, Congress allocated $79 billion to help states facing large fiscal shortfalls maintain government services, and especially to avoid cuts to education programs, from pre-kindergarten through higher education. 
 Obama administration officials, teachers unions and associations representing school boards, colleges and other institutions in American education said the aid would bring crucial financial relief to the nation's 15,000 school districts and to thousands of campuses otherwise threatened with severe cutbacks.
 ''This is going to avert literally hundreds of thousands of teacher layoffs,'' Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Tuesday.
 Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House education committee, said, ''We cannot let education collapse; we have to provide this level of support to schools.'' 
 But Republicans strongly criticized some of the proposals as wasteful spending and an ill-considered expansion of the federal government's role, traditionally centered on aid to needy students, into new realms like local school construction. 
 And they were joined by some education experts from across the political spectrum in wondering how school districts could spend so many new billions so fast, whether such an outpouring of dollars would lead to higher student achievement, and what might happen in two years when the stimulus money ends.
 Analysts were also turning up surprises in the fine print. 
 One provision, which was sought by the student lending industry and went unmentioned in early Congressional summaries of the stimulus package, would temporarily increase subsidies to banks in the guaranteed student loan program by tying them to a new index, partly because recent federal intervention in the credit markets has invalidated the previous index. A spokesman for Sallie Mae, one of the largest student lenders, said the change was needed to keep student loan markets fluid. Critics said it represented a potential new windfall for lenders.
 ''This just continues the well-established tradition of welfare for the student loan industry,'' said Barmak Nassirian, an expert in student lending.
 The formulas by which the stimulus money for public schools would be allocated to states and local districts are complex, but take into consideration numbers of school-age children in poor families. The level received per student would vary considerably by state, according to an analysis by the New America Foundation, a research group that monitors education spending. New York would be among the biggest beneficiaries, at $760 per student, while New Jersey and Connecticut would fall near the bottom, with $427 and $409 per student, respectively. The District of Columbia would get the most per student, $1,289, according to the foundation's analysis. 
 The foundation contends, however, that the formula does not effectively allocate the most money to states with the greatest need.
 In recent years the federal government has contributed 9 percent of the nation's total spending on public schools, with states and local districts financing the rest. Washington has contributed 19 percent of spending on higher education. The stimulus package would raise those federal proportions significantly.
 The Department of Education's discretionary budget for the 2008 fiscal year was about $60 billion. The stimulus bill would raise that to about $135 billion this year, and to about $146 billion in 2010. Other federal agencies would administer about $20 billion in additional education-related spending.
 ''This really marks a new era in federal education spending,'' said Edward Kealy, executive director of the Committee for Education Funding, a coalition of 90 education groups. 
 The bill would increase 2009 fiscal year spending on Title I, a program of specialized classroom efforts to help educate poor children, to $20 billion from about $14.5 billion, and raise spending on education for disabled children to $17 billion from $11 billion. 
 Those increases respond to longtime demands by teachers unions, school boards and others that Washington fully finance the mandates laid out for states and districts in the Bush-era No Child Left Behind law, and in the main federal law regulating special education.
 ''We've been arguing that the federal government hasn't been living up to its commitments, but these increases go a substantial way toward meeting them,'' said Joel Packer, a lobbyist for the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union.
 Frederick Hess, an education policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, criticized the bill as failing to include mechanisms to encourage districts to bring school budgets in line with property tax revenues, which have plunged with the bursting of the real estate bubble.
 ''It's like an alcoholic at the end of the night when the bars close, and the solution is to open the bar for another hour,'' Mr. Hess said.
 The bill would, for the first time, involve the federal government in a significant fashion in the building and renovation of schools, which has been the responsibility of states and districts. It includes $20 billion for school renovation and modernization, with $14 billion for elementary and secondary schools and $6 billion for higher education. It also includes tax provisions under which the federal government would pay the interest on construction bonds issued by school districts. 
 Mr. Duncan said the bill's school renovation provisions would create a ''huge number of construction jobs,'' because so many school buildings need repairs. 
 But Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California and the ranking minority member of the House education committee, said, ''By putting the federal government in the business of building schools, Democrats may be irrevocably changing the federal government's role in education in this country.''
 In higher education, the bill would increase spending on Pell Grants, the most important federal student aid program, to $27 billion from about $19 billion this year. 
 ''It's a very good idea to increase Pell Grants in the stimulus,'' said Terry Hartle, a senior vice president for public affairs at the American Council on Education, which represents colleges and universities. 
 But Mr. Hartle said that even he was having difficulty tracking all the new spending.
 ''A lot of things will go through, and only later will we know exactly what happened,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Report Cites Unexplained Costs of New Parks in the Bronx

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
With costs ballooning to replace two Bronx parks that were bulldozed for the new Yankee Stadium -- the latest estimate is almost $195 million -- the city's Independent Budget Office said on Tuesday that more than $16 million of the higher expense ''remains to be explained.'' 
 The latest cost is almost $79 million over the 2005 estimate of $116 million, which itself was considerably more than the $96 million figure based on ''conceptual designs'' in an environmental impact statement using 2004 dollars. 
 The Yankees will be using their new $1.3 billion ballpark for opening day in April, but Little Leaguers, tennis players and picnickers are unlikely to have access to all eight replacement parks until the end of 2011, a year later than promised, the budget office said in a report. 
 ''Since the plans were announced, the costs of these projects have risen significantly,'' said the budget office, a publicly funded agency that provides nonpartisan information about city finances. 
 Part of the increase, the budget office said, was caused by expansion of the project and unanticipated cleanup costs. But, it said, since the parks department is withholding some figures until bidding is complete, ''more than a fifth of the increase, $16.3 million, remains to be explained.'' 
 The Department of Parks and Recreation called the findings old news. ''It's consistent with what we've been saying all along,'' said Jama Adams, a spokeswoman. ''None of these numbers are new. There have been cost increases just like every other construction project.''
 Ms. Adams attributed the increases in part to the costs of removing buried oil barrels and other toxic waste. But she said some new parks would be available long before 2011. 
 A spokeswoman for the Yankees, Alice McGillion at Rubenstein Associates, said the team, which is paying for the stadium with the help of city incentives such as tax-exempt bonds, had put up $10 million for the new parks but had no control over the scheduling of their construction. 
 Building the new stadium one block north of the old one at East 161st Street and River Avenue required demolition of Macombs Dam Park and a portion of John Mullaly Park, totaling more than 22 acres. Because state law requires replacement of lost parkland, the city agreed to create eight smaller parks totaling more than 32 acres.
 The largest is to be Waterfront Park, nearly 10 acres near the Harlem River and the Major Deegan Expressway, with 16 tennis courts (replacing the 16 lost at Macombs Dam Park), a beach, a seasonal ice rink, and a tennis and skating house in the former powerhouse building of the Bronx Terminal Market. 
 Also at nearly 10 acres, the new Heritage Field at the site of the old stadium is set to include ball fields and a promenade to the new Macombs Dam Park, more than seven acres atop a new Yankee Stadium garage. Smaller pocket parks are to be interspersed nearby. 
 In its report, the budget office said $30 million of the increased parkland cost was due to an expansion of the program, to more than 32 acres from an original conception of fewer than 25. Costs have risen 42 percent since 2005 just for the projects in the original plan, it said. In its expanded form, the project is 67 percent more expensive than estimated. Demolishing the old stadium and building Heritage Field and the promenade would end up costing more than $72 million, more than what was anticipated, the report said. 
 Before the economic downturn, construction costs outpaced inflation, it said. And there was another factor, it added: ''Published reports also indicate that to the extent that New York City, as well as other public-sector entities, is perceived as a difficult client, potential bidders are reluctant to bid on city contracts, and many observers believe that those who do bid include a premium for working with the city.''

HEADLINE: Home Prices Fell Again in November, and Consumer Confidence Ebbed in January

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Battered home values in 20 of America's biggest metropolitan areas fell even farther in November, according to a widely watched measure of housing prices released Tuesday.
 Home prices in November dropped 18.2 percent from a year earlier, not quite as bad as economists had expected, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Prices in 11 of the 20 metropolitan areas surveyed fell at record rates, and 14 areas reported double-digit declines from November 2007.
 The 20-city index for November fell to 154.59, its lowest point since January 2004. 
 ''The disappointing news is that the declines are still accelerating,'' said Adam York, an economic analyst at Wachovia. ''It emphasizes just how much stress the housing market is under.''
 The problems were most pronounced in parts of the country like southern California, south Florida and the Southwest, where prices of houses and land once doubled, or even tripled, in a single year, and developers rushed to lay out quilts of new subdivisions and build condos.
 In the Phoenix metro area, home prices fell 32.9 percent in November from a year earlier, and they tumbled 31.6 percent in Las Vegas. In the San Francisco metropolitan area, prices declined 30.8 percent from last year.
 Not one of the 20 cities in the index posted a gain in prices from October to November, or from last November to this year. But Denver and Dallas fared the best, with home prices in Dallas falling 3.3 percent from last year, and 4.3 percent in Denver.
 David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at Standard & Poor's, said he was heartened to see that, after months of worse-than-expected declines in housing statistics, the real data weren't drastically worse than the expectations.
 Still Americans are not getting any more optimistic as the yearlong recession digs in. The private Conference Board reported that consumer confidence continued to fall in January, hitting a new low of 37.7. Only 6.4 percent of 5,000 households surveyed reported that business conditions were good.
 For millions of Americans, a drop in gasoline and energy prices has been the only glint of positive economic news over the last six months. Unemployment has risen to 7.2 percent and could top 9 percent in the next year; employers are trimming work weeks and laying off workers by the thousands; and people's retirement accounts have been devastated by the turmoil in the financial markets.
 The continuing erosion of housing values poses a threat to millions of Americans who overreached to take on big mortgages or home equity loans, gambling that ever-rising home prices would keep them above water.
 But tumbling values because of foreclosure sales and forced sales have also prompted a mini-boom in some parts of the country, where rock-bottom prices have lured buyers back into the market. The National Association of Realtors reported Monday that existing-home sales rose 6.5 percent in December, the largest monthly bounce in years.
 ''It's the beginning of what I think will be a regular drumbeat of reports of pickup of home sales,'' said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America. ''I'm at the optimistic end of the spectrum. I think home sales will pick up throughout the first half of this year, and by the second half, we'll see homebuilders pick up their tools in selected markets.''
 Housing inventories at the end of December fell 11.7 percent from a month earlier, to 3.68 million homes, down from 4.2 million unsold homes in November.

HEADLINE: Big Insurer, Denied Rate Increase, Says It Will Quit Florida Property Market

BYLINE: By GARY FINEOUT

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 

 BODY:
Rebuffed by regulators in its efforts to raise homeowner rates by nearly 50 percent, Florida's largest private insurer of property announced Tuesday that it would shutter all its property insurance business in the state. 
 The decision, by State Farm Florida, a subsidiary of the giant insurer State Farm Mutual, affects more than a million policyholders and is another financial setback to a state with one of the nation's highest foreclosure rates and rising unemployment. It could also increase the burden on a state-created insurance company, which must accept customers if they have nowhere else to go. 
 The announcement followed by two weeks a decision of the Florida insurance commissioner, Kevin McCarty, to reject the company's request for a statewide homeowner rate increase of 47.1 percent. 
 State Farm Florida, badly hurt like other insurers by a record eight hurricanes in 2004-5, says that it has been unable to repay loans that those storms forced it to acquire from its parent company, and that it continues losing money on its Florida property business. The denial of the rate increase, those officials say, has made it impossible to continue in that business.
 ''This is not an action we wanted to take, but one we must take given the realities of the Florida property insurance market,'' Jim Thompson, president of State Farm Florida, said in a statement.
 Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican who has consistently criticized insurance rates as too high, sounded defiant Tuesday when asked about State Farm's decision.
 ''I think Floridians will be much better without them,'' Mr. Crist told reporters. 
 Asked if he thought the company was bluffing in an effort to win a rate increase, he replied, ''I don't really know, and I don't really care.''
 But State Senator Mike Fasano, a Republican from New Port Richey, said he would file legislation that would cap the number of policies a company could drop in any given year. The measure would apply retroactively.
 ''We can't allow State Farm to further an economic crisis by unloading one million policies,'' Mr. Fasano said.
 State Farm Florida said its plan, presented to regulators on Tuesday, called for a shutdown of its property insurance business over the course of two years. The company has 1.2 million property insurance policyholders. Most are homeowners, although there are also renters, boat owners and business owners.
 Regulators have 90 days to review the plan, though they have little power to stop it. Once it is approved, the company must wait six months before it can begin dropping policyholders.
 The company said it had no plans to abandon its business in auto, health and life insurance.
 State Farm employs nearly 5,000 people across the state, in addition to 5,300 contractors who sell State Farm insurance exclusively. Chris Neal, a spokesman for State Farm Florida, could not say how many jobs might be lost as a result of its move.

Message to Davos: 
 Keep Capitalism
 The world is in the midst of a financial crisis. But it does not have to turn into a crisis of capitalism in which government intervention and protectionism swamp the creative potential of free markets.
 The political and business leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos should make it their goal to prevent this. Otherwise, rising resentment among the swelling armies of unemployed and others suffering from the global economic downturn could sweep away much of the good with the bad -- and make the world still poorer. 
 To start to get this message across, there should be big slices of humble pie all round. It should be ingested not only by bankers -- who have rightly been lambasted for running amok -- but also by politicians. They bear a share of the blame for the pickle the global economy is now in. They need to admit it.
 Governments did more than set the lax regulatory framework from which bankers took their cue. They were also responsible for loose monetary and fiscal policies that helped fuel the bubble. And they failed to find a solution to the global trade imbalances that, for many years, allowed the United States and other Western economies to finance consumption binges with heaps of cheap borrowed money from Asia.
 Acknowledging past mistakes should be the first step. Then the Davos elite can start looking for solutions. There are three main ones. 
 The first is deep reforms to make the financial system safer. But governments must resist the temptation to pin everything on the banking industry, which has become a convenient scapegoat. Officials also need to put their own house in order. Credible promises to balance budgets as soon as the crisis is past, even as deficits mount in the short run, should be high on the agenda. Central banks should also make commitments to take account of credit growth and asset prices, rather than looking only at consumer prices, when they set interest rates.
 If such pledges are backed up with enough details, they will do more than help prevent future bubbles. They will also provide reassurance that the governments themselves are not going to run amok as they try to battle the immediate crisis with dangerous moves like printing money.
 Indeed, governments need to mount some form of responsible medium-term plan to make sure that financial markets do not lose confidence. If investors start to boycott government bonds when fiscal deficits are rising fast, the current crisis could get even worse. Governments could resort to default, inflation or tax increases.
 Political leaders must also commit themselves to steadily rebalancing the global economy, so as to avoid a glut of savings in one part of the world and a glut of consumption in another. Of course, it takes two to tango, and China has not yet shown itself willing to dance to this tune. Nor for that matter has the United States been prepared to wean itself off borrowing.
 The Davos meeting, which officially opens Wednesday, should be a good opportunity to press this message. Wen Jiabao, China's premier, will be attending along with many Western leaders. Everybody should realize that there is a huge benefit to rebalancing the global economy, quite apart from reducing the risk of future crises. It would mean the United States, Britain, Spain and others were living within their means, while the Chinese could take off their hair shirts and enjoy themselves more.
 If political leaders can articulate a framework for medium-term stability, they will then be well placed to defend what is good in capitalism, namely free trade and free markets. At this point, nobody should be so naive as to pretend that these can flourish in the absence of an effective framework of regulation.
 But a return to nationalization, state aid and protectionism -- which were featured, for example, in the United States after the Great Depression -- would be calamitous for everybody. 
 The mission for those gathering in Davos should be to ensure that the valuable elements of free trade and free markets are encouraged, even as they strive to clamp down on financial excesses. Otherwise, they risk throwing out the baby with the bathwater. HUGO DIXON

HEADLINE: So You Think You Can Do Better? Here's Your Chance

 BODY:
We invited some professional designers to submit proposals (below) for what they think the Super Bowl logo should look like. They were given a blank slate -- no rules or guidelines at all in terms of how the image should look. 
 Now it's your turn. The Fifth Down blog on NYTimes.com wants to publish your proposed Super Bowl logo. Whether you're a professional designer, an amateur designer or have never worked with anything beyond crayons, give it a shot and send it to us via e-mail at sptpix@nytimes.com with your full name and contact information. 
 We'll display the best ones later this week on the Fifth Down.
 Please note: The images must be in the JPEG (*.jpg) format. By sending in your image to The New York Times, you agree that we may use your image in all manner and media of The New York Times and NYTimes.com, that you have all necessary rights (including copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights) to make the image available to us for all such uses, and you agree to the rules of our Member Agreement found online at http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/agree.html.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: AARON DRAPLIN: Draplin Design Co., Portland, Ore. Combine my complete lack of knowledge regarding contemporary pro football and the fact that my dad's perpetual underdog Detroit Lions went 0-16 this year and, well, this is what you get. Back to the basics -- team colors, green grass and a football. Just like when I was 11, playing until sunset with my neighborhood buddies in Central Lake, Mich.
JULIA HOFFMANN: New York Because Super Bowl Sunday is the second-largest U.S. food consumption day, behind Thanksgiving, I propose to mark this unofficial second (or for some people first) national holiday with the elements that any self-respecting football fan or American cannot go without: pizza, burgers and chicken wings. So this logo is a celebration, an ode to the fan and America's favorite pastime. The only graphic requirement is to design each food item in the shape of a football.
MICHAEL STRASSBURGER: Modern Dog Design Co., Seattle The Super Bowl always wants to be bigger, glitzier and more spectacular than every Super Bowl preceding. But with the United States in its current recession, major advertising sponsors pulling out and Tampa having very little hosting money, this Super Bowl will need a government stimulus package to be all it wants to be.
STEFAN G. BUCHER AND JAMES WHITNEY: 344 Design, Los Angeles The Super Bowl audience is stagnant. Any logo designed for the current target will not increase viewership. For the Super Bowl to thrive, we need to tap new audiences. To this end, I've designed a logo to engage the highly energetic, vigorously monetized and entirely underserved nerd segment of the viewing public by connecting the N.F.L. experience with a few of their cultural touchstones. Call it pandering if you must
I call it Brandology(R).
SHOGO OTA: Modern Dog Design Co., Seattle Super Bowl logos all have the same overly commercialized, cheesy, mainstream look. In the spirit of a younger, more rebellious generation, I started with a previous Super Bowl logo and added my own art over the top of it. Much better.
MICHAEL GERICKE, DON BILODEAU, JED SKILLINS: Pentagram, New York A departure from the Roman numerals primarily featured in past Super Bowl logos, a bold symbol celebrates the coming together of the champions of the A.F.C. and N.F.C. Their two overlapping helmets, in the N.F.L.'s colors, embed a football within the center of the design. The ball rests on the 50-yard line, creating the game's iconic trophy.
FELIX SOCKWELL: Felix Sockwell Inc., Maplewood, N.J. Hush little Cardinals, don't say a thing Ben's gonna score Steelers' sixth Bowl ring CHART: There's nothing that's not improved by a healthy dash of Hayao Miyazaki, not even a regulation football. Two IEEE 1394b-2002 ports and two USB 2.0 ports. This football connects. Code 128 Barcode. Scan this logo. I dare you. Go red, white and blue. Geeks are patriots, too. Why stop at Roman numerals, when you can have a sum? Coaches, Dungeon Masters. Tomato, tomahto. It never hurts to throw in a little Masonic something for good luck. Lastly, let's add the team logos. Clear communication is important. And we'll need a snappy slogan. Something with a bit of grandeur. And spaceships to add some pizazz. Prof. John N. Frink Jr., patron saint of geeks, harnessing the power of the testosterone molecule. Latin and binary, the peanut butter and jelly of any nerd sandwich.

HEADLINE: D.I.Y. by the Barrel (Please Keep Your Shoes On)

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
 THE two women walking down Varick Street one recent evening glanced casually at the storefront, perhaps expecting a display of handbags or furniture. Instead, they saw oak barrels -- the kind you might see in Napa Valley -- stacked high on the other side of the glass. After stopping to stare, they entered to examine firsthand this unlikely sight so near the Holland Tunnel in downtown Manhattan. 
 If nothing else, City Winery has novelty going for it. Since the first crush of grapes in October, within hailing distance of scores of yellow cabs, this bizarre juxtaposition of Manhattan streets and winemaking paraphernalia has riveted pedestrians. 
 ''People are always looking in,'' Michael Dorf, the proprietor, said during a tour of the winery last week. ''First they think it's a brewery -- they're used to those -- but then they see all the barrels, and they can't believe it.'' 
 But there it is, 21,000 square feet of downtown real estate, with exposed brick, 140-year-old beams of Southern yellow pine and an all-important loading dock, and it's not just a winery. Mr. Dorf, a music promoter who founded the Knitting Factory, the seminal downtown music spot of the 1980s and '90s, has hedged his bets. City Winery, at 155 Varick Street, is also a music venue with 325 seats, a restaurant with gleaming displays of cheese and salumi, and an event space for classes and tastings. 
 Performances by Philip Glass and Marianne Faithfull are coming up. Klezmer brunches are scheduled on Sundays, cheese classes are offered every other week, and noted winemakers like Didier Seguier of William Fevre in Chablis and Ales Kristancic of Movia in Slovenia are to give talks and tastings. 
 ''Really, it was built selfishly,'' Mr. Dorf said. ''To be able to sit at a table and watch a concert and be able to drink good wine and nibble on good cheese and charcuterie, it's a civilized experience. I'm sure I'm not the only 40-year-old balding guy who's grown up and would rather sit than stand for a concert.''
 Still, the centerpiece is winemaking, which is not as alien to lower Manhattan as it might seem. The Lower East Side was once a center of production for sweet kosher and sacramental wines. But City Winery caters to the reality-show age. It's a kind of interactive building, offering would-be urban winemakers the chance to help make their own. They need only part with anywhere from around $7,000 to almost $12,000 a barrel -- about 21 cases or 232 bottles -- with the price varying by selection of grapes, barrels, winemaking regime, bottles and labels. 
 City Winery is one of several custom winemaking facilities that have opened around the country in the last decade. Crushpad in San Francisco and Portland Wine Project in Portland, Ore., both offer similar hands-on participation, while, compared with those economy-class operations, Napa Valley Reserve in Saint Helena, Calif., offers a piece of a corporate jet, allowing members to help tend the vines and make the wines, for fees beginning around $150,000. 
 It's not exactly a formula made for hard times. City Winery ultimately has the capacity to produce 10,000 cases of wine at a time, the equivalent of a good-size boutique winery. Of the 5,000 cases, or 230 barrels, made in the first harvest, a third have been sold, a third are reserved for the house, and a third are still awaiting ownership. The recession hasn't helped.
 ''I had maybe 100 barrels sold before we opened, and maybe 15 of those came through,'' Mr. Dorf said. ''It's not easy to part with $8,000, no matter how sloshed you are.''
 To oversee production, Mr. Dorf hired a professional, David Lecomte, who was born in the heart of the northern Rhone Valley and most recently worked for Herzog Wine Cellars, a kosher winemaker based in Oxnard, Calif. Mr. Lecomte is the one who has to negotiate the delicate challenges of shipping grapes from far-off vineyards while navigating the myriad demands and questions of his citizen winemakers. 
 Grape procurement over long distance is tricky. Grapes need to be coddled and kept cool so they don't break or bruise, which might set off a premature fermentation. Despite the relative proximity of the Long Island and Finger Lakes wine districts, City Winery went long in its first harvest, buying grapes from Napa, Sonoma and Lake counties in California and the Willamette Valley in Oregon. 
 ''The shipping was perfect, but it did cost a lot of money,'' Mr. Lecomte said. ''We need to work on the financial aspect.''
 More problematic has been communicating with the proud owners of barrels, each of whom has a different set of desires and expectations for the wine. They often know what they like, Mr. Lecomte said, but are not sure how to express themselves. 
 ''That's a very challenging discussion to have with our members, to translate sensations into words,'' Mr. Lecomte said.
 Some of the barrels were sold to absentee owners, who wish only for a finished product to offer as Christmas gifts. Others are more hands-on, like Marc Rosenberg, who owns Lost Highway Films, a production company. Mr. Rosenberg is a wine lover who says he has always nursed a desire to make his own. Then he discovered City Winery right around the corner from his office.
 So far, Mr. Rosenberg is highly involved, tasting his cabernet sauvignon, made from grapes from Haystack Peak Vineyards in Napa Valley, every few weeks.
 ''I'm looking for something that is very well structured, with good tannins, a great nose and that woosh in the mouth,'' he said. ''David understood what I've been looking for, and he's been working with me.''
 Most of the wine will be ready in about a year. As for the remaining unsold barrels, Mr. Dorf is fatalistic. At worst, he'll be sitting on a lot of wine.
 ''If, God forbid, I don't sell the remaining barrels, I can sell it for $8 a glass at the bar and make even more money,'' he said. ''But that's not the model. If we don't do it in year one, we'll do it in year two.''

HEADLINE: The Hearts and Minds of Soldiers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Troubled Minds and Purple Hearts,'' by Tyler E. Boudreau (Op-Ed, Jan. 26):
 A medal for post-traumatic stress disorder would help those veterans who have the condition, although few would wear it with pride. 
 Until recently, PTSD was a stigmatized status equated with cowardice or lack of resilience or, even worse, with malingering to escape service or to receive unmerited compensation. 
 Now there is growing recognition of the medical reality of PTSD, including brain scans showing altered function. The syndrome affects high numbers of combatants. It is unreasonable to judge these men and women by the relatively few malingerers and exaggerators.
 At last, the true suffering from PTSD is acknowledged. This recognition helps veterans, family members, doctors and therapists attend to the injury and its consequences. 
 The Purple Heart should remain an emblem for service on the battlefield resulting in obvious injury. But veterans deserve a separate symbol for hidden wounds that are honorably earned and equally disabling. Frank M. Ochberg
 Okemos, Mich., Jan. 26, 2009
 The writer, a psychiatrist, is the editor of ''Post-traumatic Therapy and Victims of Violence'' and former associate director of the National Institute of Mental Health.
 To the Editor:
 ''Troubled Minds and Purple Hearts'' is definitely a step in the right direction in one sense. Movingly and persuasively written by Tyler E. Boudreau, a former marine, it advocates for an alternative medal to the Purple Heart for those have suffered the hidden wounds of war trauma.
 But from a psychological standpoint, Mr. Boudreau then takes a half step backward when he suggests giving what he calls a ''Black Heart.'' When he says ''the hearts of these soldiers are black,'' he is suggesting something negative, dark and associated with death. That may only add to the stigma of mental illness that has led to this conundrum.
 Why not refer to the ''minds'' noted in the title of his article? How about a ''Mind Medal'' in honor of the damage that can't be physically seen, to be given out in May, our Mental Health Month? There indeed can be light at the end of this dark tunnel.

 To the Editor:
 Tyler E. Boudreau's article is so cogent: ''That far too many of those returning from combat experience deep and long-lasting devastation is irrefutable.'' 
 I would remind readers of the cost of post-traumatic stress to our society, of which suicide is the most tragic and devastating, but also including divorce, physical and emotional abuse, substance abuse and addictions -- a terrible toll to us all. Susan Woodall

 Re ''Troubled Minds and Purple Hearts'' and ''Counting the Walking Wounded,'' by Lawrence M. Wein (Op-Ed, Jan. 26):
 Let us not forget another group of victims deeply affected by the invisible wounds of post-traumatic stress -- the children and spouses of the returning soldiers. Not only should every soldier be screened for PTSD, but the families (particularly children) should also be educated about and treated for its effect on them. Carolina Nadel
 Arlington, Va., Jan. 26, 2009
 The writer is a medical doctor and a children's book writer-illustrator who is working on a picture book to help children cope with parents returning from war with PTSD.
 To the Editor: 
 Lawrence M. Wein's Op-Ed article was well written regarding our war veterans' health needs and statistical data. The central question that was not directly addressed is, Where is the money to finance the program in the worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s? 
 As a creator of the 2008 State of California Bill SB 1401 (screening and treatment of traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress) of our Iraq- Afghanistan war veterans, I strongly recommend that the medical institutions in the 50 states start the health care process. 
 Then, those vets who have the medical illness would be directly referred to V.A. hospitals for treatment. 
 The key to financing this needed health care is to connect the dots and overcome the academic bureaucracy.

HEADLINE: Bright Passage in Publishing: Authors Who Pay Their Way

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The point may soon come when there are more people who want to write books than there are people who want to read them.
 At least, that is what the evidence suggests. Booksellers, hobbled by the economic crisis, are struggling to lure readers. Almost all of the New York publishing houses are laying off editors and pinching pennies. Small bookstores are closing. Big chains are laying people off or exploring bankruptcy. 
 A recently released study by the National Endowment for the Arts found that while more people are reading literary fiction, fewer of them are reading books.
 Meanwhile, there is one segment of the industry that is actually flourishing: capitalizing on the dream of would-be authors to see their work between covers, companies that charge writers and photographers to publish are growing rapidly at a time when many mainstream publishers are losing ground. 
 Credit for the self-publishing boomlet goes to authors like Jim Bendat, whose book ''Democracy's Big Day,'' a collection of historical vignettes about presidential inaugurations, enjoyed a modest burst in sales in the hoopla surrounding President Obama's swearing-in.
 After failing to secure a traditional publishing deal in 2000, Mr. Bendat, a public defender in Los Angeles, paid $99 to publish the first edition of his book with iUniverse, a print-on-demand company. He updated the book in 2004 and 2008, and has sold more than 2,500 copies. IUniverse takes a large cut of each sale of the book, currently on Amazon.com for $11.66.
 As traditional publishers look to prune their booklists and rely increasingly on blockbuster best sellers, self-publishing companies are ramping up their title counts and making money on books that sell as few as five copies, in part because the author, rather than the publisher, pays for things like cover design and printing costs.
 In 2008, Author Solutions, which is based in Bloomington, Ind., and operates iUniverse as well as other print-on-demand imprints including AuthorHouse and Wordclay, published 13,000 titles, up 12 percent from the previous year. 
 This month, the company, which is owned by Bertram Capital, a private equity firm, bought a rival, Xlibris, expanding its profile in the fast-growing market. The combined company represented 19,000 titles in 2008, nearly six times more than Random House, the world's largest publisher of consumer books, released last year. 
 In 2008, nearly 480,000 books were published or distributed in the United States, up from close to 375,000 in 2007, according to the industry tracker Bowker. The company attributed a significant proportion of that rise to an increase in the number of print-on-demand books. 
 ''Even if you're sitting at a dinner party, if you ask how many people want to write a book, everyone will say, 'I've got a book or two in me,''' said Kevin Weiss, chief executive of Author Solutions. ''We don't see a letup in the number of people who are interested in writing.''
 The trend is also driven by professionals who want to use a book as an enhanced business card as well as by people who are creating books as gifts for family and friends.
 ''It used to be an elite few,'' said Eileen Gittins, chief executive of Blurb, a print-on-demand company whose revenue has grown to $30 million, from $1 million, in just two years and which published more than 300,000 titles last year. Many of those were personal books bought only by the author. ''Now anyone can make a book, and it looks just like a book that you buy at the bookstore.'' 
 To be sure, self-publishing is still a fraction of the wider publishing industry. Author Solutions, for example, sold a total of 2.5 million copies last year. Little, Brown sold more than that many copies of ''Twilight'' by Stephenie Meyer just in the last two months of 2008.
 But in an era when anyone can create a blog or post musings on Facebook or MySpace, people still seem to want the tangible validation of a printed book. 
 ''I wanted the satisfaction of holding the book in my hands,'' Mr. Bendat said. 
 As a result of his iUniverse book, the British news channel Sky News asked Mr. Bendat to provide live commentary on Inauguration Day. A group of Washington hotels ordered 500 copies to give to guests who were in town for the event.
 ''O.K., it's not a best seller,'' Mr. Bendat said, ''but I'm happy for what's happening.''
 Vanity presses have existed for decades, but technology has made it much easier for aspiring authors to publish without hefty upfront costs. Gone are the days when self-publishing meant paying a printer to produce hundreds of copies that then languished in a garage. 
 Now, for as little as $3, an author can upload a manuscript or collection of photos to a Web site, and order a printed book within an hour. Many books will appear for sale on Amazon.com or the Web site of Barnes & Noble; others are sold through the self-publishing companies' Web sites. Authors and readers order subsequent copies as needed. 
 The self-publishing companies generally make their money either by charging author fees -- which can range from $99 to $100,000 for a variety of services, including custom cover design and marketing and distribution to online retailers, or by taking a portion of book sales, or both. 
 Some, like Lulu Enterprises and CreateSpace from Amazon.com, allow the author to create the book free, but then make their money on a small printing markup and a profit split with the author. 
 For some authors, the appeal of self-publishing is that they can put their books on the market much faster than through traditional publishers. 
 Of course, authors who take this route also give up a lot. Not only do they receive no advance payments, but they also often must pay out of their own pockets before seeing a dime. They do not have the benefit of the marketing acumen of traditional publishers, and have diminished access to the vast bookstore distribution pipeline that big publishers can provide. 
 Still, many self-publishing companies allow authors to take more than the traditional royalty of 15 percent of the cover price on hardcovers and 10 percent or less on paperbacks. 
 Michelle L. Long, an accountant who advises small businesses, published ''Successful QuickBooks Consulting,'' a guide for others who want to help businesses use a software package made by Intuit through CreateSpace a little more than a year ago. She said she had earned 45 to 55 percent of the cover price on each sale and had made $22,000 in royalties on the sale of more than 2,000 copies. 
 During an economic downturn, books tailored to such narrow audiences may fare better than titles from traditional publishers that depend on a more general appeal. 
 ''A lot of this niche content is doing fairly well relative to the rest of the economy because it's very useful to people who have a very specific need,'' said Aaron Martin, director of self-publishing and manufacturing on demand at Amazon. 
 For many self-published authors, the niche is very small. Mr. Weiss of Author Solutions estimates that the average number of copies sold of titles published through one of its brands is just 150.
 Indeed, said Robert Young, chief executive of Lulu Enterprises, based in Raleigh, N.C., a majority of the company's titles are of little interest to anybody other than the authors and their families. ''We have easily published the largest collection of bad poetry in the history of mankind,'' Mr. Young said. 
 Still, the dream of many self-published authors is that they will be discovered by a mainstream publishing house -- and it does happen, however rarely. 
 When Lisa Genova, a former consultant to pharmaceutical companies, wrote her first novel, ''Still Alice,'' a story about a woman with Alzheimer's disease, she was turned down or ignored by 100 literary agents. 
 Ms. Genova paid $450 to iUniverse to publish the book and sold copies to independent bookstores. A fellow author discovered the book and introduced Ms. Genova to an agent, and she eventually sold ''Still Alice'' for a mid-six-figure advance to Pocket Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, which released a new edition this month. It had its debut on the New York Times trade paperback fiction best-seller list on Sunday, at No. 5.
 Ms. Genova likened her experience to that of young bands or filmmakers using MySpace or YouTube to attract a following. ''It's really tough to break into the traditional model of doing things,'' she said. 
 Louise Burke, publisher of Pocket Books, said publishers now trawl for new material by looking at reader comments about self-published books sold online. Self-publishing, she said, is ''no longer a dirty word.''
 Diamonds in the rough, though, remain the outliers. ''For every thousand titles that get self-published, maybe there's two that should have been published,'' said Cathy Langer, lead buyer for the Tattered Cover bookstores in Denver, who said she had been inundated by requests from self-published authors to sell their books. ''People think that just because they've written something, there's a market for it. It's not true.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Steel's Profit Surges on Pipeline Products

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
The United States Steel Corporation said Tuesday that its fourth-quarter earnings surged, helped by strong sales of pipes and an acquisition-related gain. 
 But the company forecast an operating loss in the current quarter because of the global economic slowdown.
 U.S. Steel reported its earnings amid an industrywide slump in demand for the metal among major buyers in the automotive, construction and industrial equipment sectors. Steel prices, which reached record highs in the first half of 2008, fell later in the year, and production at domestic steel mills hit its lowest levels in a quarter century.
 The company, the largest steel producer based in the United States, said its net income jumped to $308 million, or $2.65 a share, from $35 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. The earlier quarter included charges totaling $117 million, or 98 cents a share.
 Quarterly sales rose to $4.57 billion from $4.54 billion last year, helped by strong sales from the company's tubular steel business.
 The latest results included a gain of $76 million, or 65 cents a share, related to an acquisition.
 U.S. Steel, which is based in Pittsburgh, rose $2.30, or 8 percent, to $31.76 a share.

VISION OF 42ND ST.
With No Cars
It's an idea that at first blush seems almost more fantastic than congestion pricing: closing 42nd Street to vehicular traffic from river to river and creating a 2.5-mile street-level light rail line that would ferry passengers across the entire width of Midtown in a mere 21 minutes. 
The idea -- which has been batted about for at least 25 years -- has drawn new force from a tiny nonprofit organization called the Institute for Rational Urban Mobility. Since 1999, when the institute unveiled Vision42, its proposal for the line, it has given 300 presentations, commissioned three rounds of technical studies and presented its ideas at two community forums.
In a new 49-page report, Roxanne Warren, an architect who is chairwoman of Vision42, and George Haikalis, a civil engineer who is the president of the Institute for Rational Urban Mobility, summarized the key findings from the studies. The light rail line would cost $411.3 million to $582.3 million in 2007 dollars, according to the report, generate $704.9 million in annual economic benefits and yield $175.4 million a year in additional fiscal benefits to the city and state. By speeding up crosstown travel time, the project would raise commercial property values by $1 billion -- a result of ground-floor business revenue, rent and occupancy increases and reduction in accidents -- and increase business in retail shops and restaurants by 35 percent, the study estimates.
The study did not directly address the principal vulnerability of the proposal: It so far does not have support from the Bloomberg administration, although officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have expressed interest.

An Absence Framed in Steel: Released on Tuesday, a photo from above the World Trade Center site reveals the clearest outline yet of the north pool of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.
The sunken pool, which marks the site of 1 World Trade Center, is now almost entirely framed out in structural steel.
Along walls now defined by a network of columns and beams, waterfalls will descend from plaza level to the pool. At the center of the main pool will be a secondary void, into which the water will cascade.
Gillibrand Phones Koch: A few hours before she was sworn in as a United States senator, Kirsten E. Gillibrand placed a call to former Mayor Edward I. Koch.
The conversation began, as most of Mr. Koch's do, with a zinger. ''I was for Caroline Kennedy, but you are fine,'' he told her. They agree on some key issues, like same-sex marriage, which both support -- and differ on others, like gun-owners' rights, which the new senator supports. Mr. Koch declared himself ''delighted with her comments.''

HEADLINE: MoMA Award Goes to Architecture for an Economic Hangover

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
In the wee hours of Sunday night, to blaring music by the Australian band Cut Copy, the architects Hilary Sample and Michael Meredith were putting the finishing touches on a new project, a mix of what could be described as cones, domes, smokestacks, primitive huts, towers or industrial chimneys. 
 By the next morning they were ready to load their architectural model into their station wagon in New Haven for the trip to New York with help from their Yale and Harvard students. They were scheduled to present it Monday afternoon to the Museum of Modern Art and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, which sponsor a competition each year to transform P.S. 1's courtyard in Long Island City, Queens. 
 It didn't fit. 
 ''We had to rent a minivan,'' Mr. Meredith said.
 Their presentation, the last by the five finalists, seemed no more auspicious. The judges were hard to read, Ms. Sample said, and posed tough questions like ''Why are you doing it?'' 
 ''We thought we lost,'' Mr. Meredith said. 
 But on Monday night they learned from Barry Bergdoll, the Modern's chief curator of architecture and design, that they had won the competition, known as the Young Architects Program.
 Talking on a speakerphone after hearing the news, Ms. Sample and Mr. Meredith, who are married and both 37, seemed to search for words.
 ''We haven't had much sleep lately,'' Ms. Sample said. 
 Their project, titled ''afterparty,'' is indeed hard to describe. There is its unusual mix of forms and materials: aluminum, thatching, concrete pools. 
 In their official proposal, the architects say their design is meant to honor and reflect current economic realities. The materials are basic, including a lightweight aluminum frame comprising recyclable parts, with minimal assembly required. ''Today, we find ourselves at the after-party, rethinking and resituating architecture,'' they wrote. 
 Ms. Sample and Mr. Meredith described their installation as ''a temporary urban shelter and passive cooling station'' for the events at the Warm Up summer program at P.S. 1, which includes concerts and outdoor dancing. Air cooled by the courtyard's existing shaded concrete walls and concrete water troughs will be drawn up through the chimneys by induction, they said, creating a breeze. The courtyard installation is to open to the public in late June.
 The architects were inspired in part by the architect Louis Kahn, who ''could go between high tech and very primitive,'' Mr. Meredith said. Ms. Sample said the thatching was added with the textile artist Anni Albers in mind. 
 Mr. Bergdoll expressed admiration for the shapes. ''Some are tall and chimneylike, heroic cones, others more broad and space-grabbing and evocative of the open ruined vaults of the Roman Forum,'' he said.
 Mr. Meredith said the structures were meant to evoke the fading factory vernacular of the P.S. 1 area in Long Island City. ''We're interested in building typologies,'' he said. 
 To some extent the design is an attempt to break free of the courtyard's boundaries, to reach out into the surrounding area and diversify the landscape. ''One of the problems with the courtyard is it's almost hermetic,'' Mr. Meredith said. ''How do you create variable scales of space?''
 The cones, towering over the courtyard walls, will be visible from afar and change the local topography. ''It's kind of a neighborhood landmark,'' Mr. Bergdoll said. ''You'll be able to see it from the subway and from the Long Island Expressway.''
 MoMA and P.S. 1 set a budget limit of $70,000 for each entry. Mr. Meredith and Ms. Sample, who founded their own firm, MOS, in 2003, said they were accustomed to working with limited funds, because their clients are mainly arts and nonprofit organizations and their commissions include modest installations. 
 Their Web site (mos-office.net) describes their firm as ''a collective of designers, architects, thinkers and state-of-the-art weirdos.'' They take almost any work that comes their way. ''We really don't say no,'' Mr. Meredith said. ''That's one of our policies.''
 He and Ms. Sample suggest that the economic downturn will demand a return to such essentials. ''It's not going to be about the exuberant, gestural form,'' Mr. Meredith said. ''It's going to be about a more modest and thoughtful architecture.''
 Mr. Bergdoll said the other finalist firms -- Indie Architecture of Denver, Bade Stageberg Cox of Brooklyn, L.E.F.T. of New York and PARA-Project of Brooklyn -- were similarly mindful of the financial climate. 
 ''All responded to the economy in thinking low-tech, inexpensive materials,'' he said. ''How do we get more out of less? How do we still create a fun party space when clearly the economic party is over?''

HEADLINE: A Nice, Staid Real Estate Corner

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
As the commercial real estate market limps along in the midst of a global recession, some investors say they believe that at least one sector -- medical office buildings -- might serve as a crutch, as it has in past economic downturns.
 ''There certainly are investors who want this type of property in their portfolio,'' said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital Analytics. ''It's kind of a recession-proof bet, if you will. We did have a spike in activity for these properties in the last slowdown in 2002 and 2003.'' 
 Although there was a sharp drop in the sales of medical buildings in the last quarter of 2008, real estate professionals say such properties are still being viewed favorably by lenders.
 ''There is still real leverage out there, and there is still the ability to get these deals done, versus a standard office building or shopping center,'' said Neil R. Shapiro, chairman of the health care finance group at the law firm of Herrick Feinstein in Manhattan.
 William Sanchez, a senior vice president at Bank of America, said: ''Bank of America is active in providing solutions to the health care industry, because of its growth potential, particularly in New York City and across our franchise. This is recognized as an industry that can sustain itself, and in fact grow, during challenging economic periods.''
 Some development of medical office buildings continues. A privately developed 30,000-square-foot medical condominium building will open in February in Manhattan at 429 East 75th Street, just east of First Avenue. Also, a 15,000-square-foot building with medical offices for lease is under development at 261 East 78th Street, between Second and Third Avenues.
 These types of buildings are rare in Manhattan, where doctors typically open on the ground floors of residential towers or take conventional office space, said Paul Wexler, president of Corcoran Wexler Healthcare Properties and a broker of medical buildings for more than two decades.
 He said three sales were under negotiation at 429 East 75th Street, a six-story building where 2,200- to 5,700-square-foot offices are listed at prices of $1,075 to $1,350 a square foot, though there were no signed contracts as yet.
 ''With the medical-space market, there is, for the most part, a shortage of these types of spaces,'' Mr. Wexler said.
 In recent years, landlords have begun viewing doctors as particularly desirable tenants, said Robert J. Coughlan, a principal at the Tritec Real Estate Company, which has developed more than 300,000 square feet of medical offices on Long Island in the last 20 years.
 ''Doctors' groups don't like to change locations,'' he said, leading to leases of eight years on average, compared with terms of three to five years on typical nonmedical leases. ''A few years ago, financial institutions started realizing this, and the fact that doctors have very low default rates. Banks love doctors -- they love the cash flow.''
 Because of changes in the way health care providers are reimbursed by insurers, doctors have been consolidating into larger medical groups. ''From being in about 1,000 square feet, perhaps working out of a home on Main Street, your average medical group now is about 8,000 to 8,500 square feet,'' Mr. Coughlan said. 
 A lack of supply makes the medical office building sector a solid prospect for lenders, he said. Tritec has refinanced two medical buildings in recent months, and is constructing a 40,000-square-foot medical condominium at 4 Technology Drive in East Setauket, N.Y. 
 Banks have been eager to provide financing to doctors to enable them to purchase office space, Mr. Coughlan said. He said he had received signed contracts on 8,000 square feet and had contracts out on another 25,000 square feet. He declined to reveal the price of units.
 ''We found that doctors are looking for ownership,'' he said, ''and with interest rates where they are, doctors are able to afford it.''
 More frequently than in the past, doctors are seeking to buy their medical offices or at least have an equity stake in them, industry experts said. Some doctors have even found themselves developing their own offices.
 Dr. Francis Martinis, who practices at North Shore Urology, a division of Integrated Medical Professionals, formed a real estate development company with his medical partners and built two medical offices, both about 3,000 square feet, in Port Jefferson and Northport, N.Y.
 ''The benefits outweigh any risk to this kind of undertaking,'' Dr. Martinis said. ''Over the course of a medical career, it's nice to build equity in a commercial structure that has resale value.''
 Some health care practitioners have found the medical office market so robust, they've essentially switched professions. Michael Nelin is a chiropractor of more than a decade who initially wanted to build new offices for his pain-management business.
 He is now working with members of his family who work at Nelin Realty to build the proposed 135,000-square-foot Washington Professional Park, under construction at 1500 Route 112 in Port Jefferson Station, N.Y.
 After five years in development, Mr. Nelin is putting the finishing touches on the first 30,000 square feet, with 6,000 square feet of office condominium space occupied and contracts out on another 8,000. 
 While he is charging $360 to $450 a square foot for space, Mr. Nelin is also willing to lease with a purchase option for an annual rent of $25 a square foot under a so-called triple net lease, which requires tenants to pay some operating expenses.
 Mr. Nelin said he would not necessarily recommend that other health care practitioners go into real estate.
 But there should be no shortage of doctors needing office space. While many industries are shrinking, the number of health care jobs in November was up 2.66 percent over a year ago.
 ''Everybody knows the hits that medicine has taken with malpractice rates and with reimbursements leveling off or dropping, but at least we're pretty much guaranteed a job,'' said Dr. Thomas Erhart, a obstetrician-gynecologist who bought 3,000 square feet of space at Washington Professional Park.
 Mr. Shapiro, the lawyer, said the medical office market should at least outperform the office market. ''This is a product in real estate that is not taboo and is still being looked at favorably by the investment markets, lenders, developers and tenants,'' he said.

HEADLINE: News You Can Endow

BYLINE: By DAVID SWENSEN and MICHAEL SCHMIDT. 
David Swensen, the author of ''Pioneering Portfolio Management,'' is the chief investment officer at Yale, where Michael Schmidt is a financial analyst.

DATELINE: New Haven 

 BODY:
 ''THE basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right,'' Thomas Jefferson wrote in January 1787. ''And were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate to prefer the latter.'' 
 Today, we are dangerously close to having a government without newspapers. American newspapers shoulder the burden of considerable indebtedness with little cash on hand, as their profit margins have diminished or disappeared. Readers turn increasingly to the Internet for information -- even though the Internet has the potential to be, in the words of the chief executive of Google, Eric Schmidt, ''a cesspool'' of false information. If Jefferson was right that a well-informed citizenry is the foundation of our democracy, then newspapers must be saved. 
 Although the problems that the newspaper industry faces are well known, no one has offered a satisfactory solution. But there is an option that might not only save newspapers but also make them stronger: Turn them into nonprofit, endowed institutions -- like colleges and universities. Endowments would enhance newspapers' autonomy while shielding them from the economic forces that are now tearing them down.
 In the standard business model, newspapers rely on revenues from circulation and advertising to pay for news coverage and generate healthy profits. In the past decade, however, as Americans embraced the Internet, newspaper circulation has declined every year. Advertising revenues, which are tied to circulation levels, fell even faster. Classified ads, in particular, suffered as the Web offered cheaper, easier and more effective alternatives.
 America's pre-eminent papers exemplify the distress. Average profit margins at The Washington Post over the past five years have been about 25 percent less than what they had been in the previous 15 years. At The New York Times, the decline was more than 50 percent. The debt-laden Tribune Company, which operates The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and six other daily papers, has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
 Newspapers nationwide, struggling to survive the economic turmoil, seek to refinance debt, issue equity and dispose of nonessential assets. These actions are short-term solutions to a systemic problem, Band-Aids for a gaping wound.
 News organizations have cut costs, with grave consequences. Over the past three years, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and The San Francisco Chronicle have trimmed their staffs. The number of American correspondents reporting from abroad fell by 25 percent from 2002 to 2006, and only a handful of American newspapers now operate foreign bureaus. 
 In a move that would have been unthinkable just last year, The New York Times recently began selling display advertising on its front page. Some papers have even shrunk physically, eliminating sections and decreasing paper size. 
 As long as newspapers remain for-profit enterprises, they will find no refuge from their financial problems. The advertising revenues that newspaper Web sites generate are not enough to sustain robust news coverage. Though The New York Times Web site attracted 20 million unique users in October, Web-driven revenues support only an estimated 20 percent of the paper's current staff. 
 As newspapers go digital, their business model erodes. A 2008 research report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Company explained, ''The notion that the enormous cost of real news-gathering might be supported by the ad load of display advertising down the side of the page, or by the revenue share from having a Google search box in the corner of the page, or even by a 15-second teaser from Geico prior to a news clip, is idiotic on its face.'' 
 By endowing our most valued sources of news we would free them from the strictures of an obsolete business model and offer them a permanent place in society, like that of America's colleges and universities. Endowments would transform newspapers into unshakable fixtures of American life, with greater stability and enhanced independence that would allow them to serve the public good more effectively.
 As educational and literary organizations devoted to the ''promotion of social welfare,'' endowed newspapers would benefit from Section 501(c)(3) of the I.R.S. code, which provides exemption from taxes on income and allows tax deductions for people who make contributions to eligible organizations. 
 One constraint on an endowed institution is the prohibition in the same law against trying to ''influence legislation'' or ''participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.'' While endowed newspapers would need to refrain from endorsing candidates for public office, they would still be free to participate forcefully in the debate over issues of public importance. The loss of endorsements seems minor in the context of the opinion-heavy Web.
 Aside from providing stability, an endowment would promote journalistic independence. The best-run news organizations insulate reporters from pressures to produce profits or to placate advertisers. But endowed news organizations would be in an ideal situation -- with no pressure from stockholders or advertisers at all.
 How large an endowment would a newspaper need? The news-gathering operations at The New York Times cost a little more than $200 million a year. Assuming some additional outlay for overhead, it would require an endowment of approximately $5 billion (assuming a 5 percent annual payout rate). Newspapers with smaller newsrooms would require smaller endowments.
 Note that just as endowed educational institutions charge tuition, endowed newspapers would generate incremental revenues from hard-copy sales and online subscriptions. If revenues were to exceed the costs of distribution, the endowment requirement would decline.
 Many newspapers will not weather the digital storm on their own. Only a handful of foundations and wealthy individuals have the money required to endow, and thereby preserve, our nation's premier news-gathering organizations. Enlightened philanthropists must act now or watch a vital component of American democracy fade into irrelevance.

HEADLINE: Outcry Over a Plan to Sell Museum's Holdings

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY and CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The Massachusetts attorney general's office said on Tuesday that it planned to conduct a detailed review of Brandeis University's surprise decision to sell off the entire holdings of its Rose Art Museum, one of the most important collections of postwar art in New England. 
 The decision to close the 48-year-old museum in Waltham, Mass., and disperse the collection as a way to shore up the university's struggling finances was denounced by the museum's board, its director and a wide range of art experts, who warned that the university was cannibalizing its cultural heritage to pay its bills.
 ''This is one of the artistic and cultural legacies of American Jewry,'' said Jonathan Lee, the chairman of the museum's board of overseers, who said that ''nobody at the museum -- neither the director nor myself nor anyone else -- was informed of this or had any idea what was going on.'' 
 Jehuda Reinharz, the university's president, said in a statement that the decision, made on Monday by the university's trustees, was agonizing but necessary as Brandeis faces a deepening financial crisis, with its endowment, once $700 million, significantly diminished. ''Choosing between and among important and valued university assets is terrible, but our priority in the face of hard choices will always be the university's core teaching and research mission,'' he wrote.
 The museum's collection includes some 6,000 works -- among them seminal paintings by artists like Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein -- that are believed to be worth $350 million to $400 million, although they could bring less in the current ailing art market.
 ''It couldn't be a worse time to sell expensive art,'' said Robert Storr, the prominent curator and art historian. ''It is not only unprincipled, but bad economics.''
 He added: ''This sets a terrible precedent. The Rose Art Museum has been known for four decades as a hospitable place to show serious and challenging art in an academic context. They are throwing away one of their prime assets.''
 Mr. Johns, represented in the collection by the 1957 painting ''Drawer,'' which was on view in a large exhibition of his work last year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said when notified on Tuesday of the closing: ''I find it astonishing. I've never heard anything like it.''
 Emily LaGrassa, director of communications for the state attorney general, Martha Coakley, said that Brandeis had informed the office on Monday of its decision, but had not consulted with the attorney general in advance. The attorney general has approval powers over certain actions of nonprofit institutions in the state.
 Ms. LaGrassa said that in the case of Brandeis, the attorney general would review wills and agreements made between the museum and the estates of donors to determine if selling artworks violated the terms of donations. ''We have not yet offered any opinion on any aspect of the proposed sales,'' she said, adding, ''We do expect this to be a lengthy process.''
 Dennis Nealon, a spokesman for the university, said it would have no comment on any legal questions related to the proposed closing and the sale of the art. The university said in a statement that the Rose would shut down by late summer and be turned into a teaching center with a gallery and studio space.
 Like other universities around the country, Brandeis depends on income from its endowment to cover much of its operating expenses. And like most such college endowments, Brandeis's fund has been seriously eroded by the economic downturn, although officials on Tuesday declined to give a figure on the extent of the drop. Several of the university's large donors have been hit particularly hard by losses connected to Bernard L. Madoff, the disgraced financier accused of operating a $50 billion Ponzi scheme.
 David Alan Robertson, president of the Association of College and University Museums and Galleries, said it was by far the largest closing of an academic museum in his memory, and he said he could not think of a mass dispersal of important works from a college or university that would compare. ''One fears that this opens a floodgate,'' said Mr. Robertson, director of the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University. ''And it's a detriment to all of our institutions.''
 Far more limited proposed sales of art by some smaller colleges and universities have already drawn controversy. In 2005 Fisk University in Nashville moved to sell paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe and Marsden Hartley to bolster its finances, but was blocked from doing so by a court that determined that the sale would violate the terms of O'Keeffe's gift of the two works to the institution. Fisk has appealed. In 2007, Randolph College in Lynchburg, Va., sold a Rufino Tamayo painting and proposed selling three other works to raise money for its endowment. The museum's director, Karol Lawson, compared the experience to a mugging and resigned.
 Michael Rush, who has been the director of the Rose Art Museum since 2006, said he heard the news only on Monday afternoon when Marty Krauss, Brandeis's provost, called him into her office. ''She said, 'This is going to be a very difficult meeting -- the university is facing dire financial restrictions and has to close the museum,' '' Mr. Rush recalled. ''I was shocked. I'm still shocked. I feel horrible. It's a sad time for art and for the art world.'' 
 He emphasized that even though the museum might have lacked a large audience -- its annual attendance is 13,000 to 15,000 -- its art is everywhere. ''We have loans in Spain, France, a piece being loaned to the Guggenheim, a Jasper Johns going to the 'Cezanne and Beyond' exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum. Our art is seen by hundreds of thousands of people a month as clearly being identified that they are from us.''
 When the museum opened in 1961, it had no acquisitions budget. So its collection grew mainly through gifts. Among the most significant was a $50,000 donation from the collectors Leon Mnuchin and his wife, Harriet Gevirtz-Mnuchin, to be used to buy contemporary art. The only restriction was that no individual work should cost more than $5,000. With that money, Sam Hunter, the museum's founding director, was able to buy 21 paintings by then-young artists like Rauschenberg, Warhol, Lichtenstein and Mr. Johns that are among the most valuable works in the collection today.
 Robert Mnuchin, the Mnuchins' son, who runs the Manhattan gallery L & M Arts, said he had no idea of Brandeis's plans until he read about them. ''It's such a shame, particularly at this time in the world,'' he said, adding, ''Obviously as a dealer I'd like to be involved either in buying them or selling them. It's emotional for me.''
 Over the years, highlights from the museum's collection have been included in major museum exhibitions around the country. Among its masterpieces is Warhol's ''Saturday Disaster,'' from the artist's car-crash series, this one from 1963-64, a work that experts believe is worth around $30 million. It was included in the Museum of Modern Art's Warhol retrospective in 1989 in New York.
 ''Second Time Painting,'' a work by Rauschenberg that was included in a show of his combines at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2005, could fetch $12 million to $15 million, experts said. Dealers in postwar art said that Mr. Johns's 1957 painting could potentially bring $15 million to $20 million.

HEADLINE: Mayor of Hartford Is Accused of Taking Bribe in a Municipal Corruption Plot

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Another Connecticut politician was engulfed in scandal on Tuesday when the mayor of Hartford, Eddie A. Perez, was arrested on bribery and corruption charges after an extensive investigation.
 Mr. Perez was accused by state prosecutors of deliberately underpaying a local contractor for renovations at his two-story colonial house in Hartford that included a whirlpool, kitchen counters and a remodeled bathroom with a steam sauna. 
 Prosecutors said that the renovations were worth around $40,000 but that the mayor paid the contractor, Carlos Costa, just over $20,000 -- and did so in 2007, about two years after they were done and just as prosecutors were beginning their inquiry. Mr. Perez also requested and received fraudulent billing statements for the work, according to the charges against him. 
 Mr. Costa thought he ''would be blackballed as a contractor in the city'' if he did not do the renovations free, prosecutors said he told them.
 A sober-faced Mr. Perez, 51, a Democrat who is in his third term as mayor, surrendered early Tuesday after being charged with three counts of bribery, conspiracy and falsifying evidence, following a 15-month investigation. He was freed without bail. 
 Mr. Costa, who prosecutors said was a longtime friend of Mr. Perez, has done millions of dollars of work in recent years for the city of Hartford as part of lucrative contracts approved by Mr. Perez and his associates. Mr. Costa, of neighboring West Hartford, was arrested on Monday and charged with the same crimes as Mr. Perez. 
 Mr. Perez apologized in a statement and at a press conference for actions he called ''inappropriate and inexcusable'' but did not resign his office and vowed to fight the charges. 
 William T. Gerace, a lawyer for Mr. Costa, said that ''Carlos is a hard-working contractor who was put in an awkward position and who did what he thought he had to do.'' 
 The charges are a severe blow to the city. 
 In recent years, Hartford had embarked on an ambitious campaign to promote itself as ''New England's Rising Star,'' full of sophisticated restaurants, a growing business community and urban-development projects. 
 Connecticut is the wealthiest state in the nation, thanks to its so-called Gold Coast of billion-dollar hedge fund firms in Greenwich, but it also has an urban underbelly of communities -- including Hartford -- that are struggling with crime and job losses.
 Mr. Perez, a native of Puerto Rico who grew up in the rough-and-tumble Clay Arsenal area north of downtown Hartford and became the city's first Latino mayor, had played a major role in the city's turnaround campaign -- and possessed a personal story to match it.
 In 2006, he told Yankee Magazine that as a youth he belonged to a street gang called the Ghetto Brothers, and was nicknamed ''The Professor,'' but said that he quit to focus on his education and community organizing. 
 Viewed as a rising star in Hispanic circles, he holds a degree in economics from Trinity College, in Hartford, and once served as the college's associate vice president of community and government relations.
 The authorities also arrested a Hartford employee, Edward Lazu, who certifies contractors for municipal jobs, on related charges, and said in a statement that ''additional arrests are expected.''
 Prosecutors from the state's Division of Criminal Justice, which filed all of the charges, have been scrutinizing Mr. Perez since at least early 2007; they searched his home and the offices of Mr. Costa's contracting company in August 2007. 
 The charges against Mr. Perez emerged from information provided to a grand jury empanelled in October 2007 to investigate suspicions of corruption and misuse of state funds. 
 Hartford now joins a grim roster of Connecticut cities hit by embarrassing corruption scandals -- and worse.
 The former three-term mayor of Bridgeport, Joseph P. Ganim, is serving a nine-year sentence after being convicted in 2003 on federal charges of bribery, racketeering, extortion and mail fraud.
 Also that year, the former three-term mayor of Waterbury, Philip A. Giordano, was sentenced to 37 years on federal charges involving sex with two girls, 8 and 10, while in office.
 In 2005, former Gov. John G. Rowland received a year-long sentence stemming from a federal corruption investigation.
 Douglas Rae, a professor of management and political science at Yale University who has studied American cities, said that Hartford ranked among the lowest of cities when it comes to transparent and responsible government.
 But Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, said in an interview on Tuesday that perhaps Connecticut was simply better at rooting out corruption, compared with other states.
 Mr. Costa runs a company called USA Contractors that has received millions of dollars of city contracts, including a $7.3 million project to develop the Park Street area near Trinity College.
 Mr. Costa performed an estimated $2,600 worth of work on a driveway and sidewalk for Mr. Lazu, the city employee. Prosecutors quoted Mr. Lazu as saying that he paid $1,100 for the work and they quoted Mr. Costa as saying that he did the work free because it was ''the cost of doing business'' in Hartford.
 Mr. Perez is scheduled to appear in Hartford Superior Court next Tuesday.

HEADLINE: The Mini-Madoffs

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE; Lynnley Browning contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Their names lack the Dickensian flair of Bernie Madoff, and the money they apparently stole from investors was a small fraction of the $50 billion that Mr. Madoff allegedly lost of his clients' savings. 
 But the number of other people who have been caught running Ponzi schemes in recent weeks is adding up quickly, so much so that they have earned themselves a nickname: mini-Madoffs.
 Some of these schemes have been operating for years, and others are of more recent vintage. But what is causing them to surface now appears to be a combination of a deteriorating economy and heightened skepticism about outsize returns after the revelations about Mr. Madoff. That can scare off new clients and cause longtime investors to demand their money back, which brings the charade tumbling down.
 ''There is no way for a Ponzi to survive given the large number of redemptions and a lack of new investors,'' said Stephen J. Obie, the head of enforcement at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The agency has experienced a doubling of reported leads to possible Ponzi schemes in the last year, and its enforcement caseload has risen this year. 
 On Monday, at a suburban New York train station, Nicholas Cosmo surrendered to federal authorities in connection with a suspected $380 million Ponzi scheme, in which investors paid a minimum of $20,000 for high-yield ''private bridge'' loans that he had arranged. 
 Mr. Cosmo promised returns of 48 percent to 80 percent a year, and none of his investors apparently minded -- or knew -- that Mr. Cosmo had already been imprisoned for securities fraud. In the end, 1,500 people gave him their money, often through brokers who worked on his behalf. 
 And in Florida, not far from the Palm Beach clubs where Mr. Madoff wooed some of his investors, George L. Theodule, a Haitian immigrant and professed ''man of God,'' promised churchgoers in a Haitian-American community that he could double their money within 90 days.
 He accepted only cash, and despite the too-good-to-be-true sales pitch, he found plenty of investors willing to turn over tens of thousands of dollars. 
 ''The offices were beautiful, and I was told it was a limited liability corporation,'' said Reggie Roseme, a deliveryman in Wellington, Fla., who lost his entire savings of $35,000 and now faces foreclosure on his home.
 According to federal regulators who have accused him of operating a Ponzi scheme, Mr. Theodule bilked thousands of investors of modest means, like Mr. Roseme, out of $23 million in all, and put $4 million in his own pocket. This money helped pay for two luxury vehicles for Mr. Theodule, a wedding, a lavish house in Georgia and a recent trip to Zurich that federal authorities are now investigating. The fate of the other $19 million is still unknown. 
 Investors in Idaho say they lost $100 million in a scheme that promised 25 percent to 40 percent annual returns. In Philadelphia, a failed computer salesman tried his hand at trading nonexistent futures contracts for 80 investors and surrendered to federal authorities this month after losing $50 million. 
 A Ponzi scheme in Atlanta that promised investor returns of 20 percent every month through something called ''30-day currency trading contracts'' was shut down this month after losing $25 million. And Tuesday, Arthur Nadel, a prominent money manager in Sarasota, Fla., and philanthropist turned himself in to the authorities. He had disappeared this month, just days before the Securities and Exchange Commission charged him in a $300 million investment fraud that may be a Ponzi scheme. 
 Investors in many of the schemes were told that their money would go into stocks, foreign currencies and other investments and earn above-average returns -- a deception backed up with what appeared to be legitimate monthly statements and fancy offices. Now, Ponzi-related losses are adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 The S.E.C. does not keep statistics on Ponzi fraud, but it has brought cases involving losses of over $200 million since the beginning of October last year, including one against the disgraced Democratic donor Norman Hsu. Mr. Hsu was accused of using money from a $60 million Ponzi scheme to make campaign donations to leading candidates, including President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton later donated the money to charities.) 
 Regulators, chastened by failing to uncover the Madoff scandal, are focusing more on such swindles. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for instance, has established a new Forex Enforcement Task Force to prosecute Ponzi cases in which investors were told their money was being invested in foreign currencies. In 2008, the agency prosecuted 15 Ponzi schemes and expects that number to increase this year. 
 Last Thursday, Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who are both influential members of the Senate Banking Committee, introduced legislation to provide $110 million to hire 500 new F.B.I. agents, 50 new assistant United States attorneys and 100 new S.E.C. enforcement officials to crack down on such crimes. 
 ''Ponzi schemes are against the law,'' Mr. Schumer said in an interview. ''But we have not had enough law enforcement officials. Madoff should have been stopped. Our proposal would not just provide more resources, but it would work like a posse to go after this fraud.'' 
 Lawsuits brought by bilked investors and federal regulators are piling up in courts.
 One case brought by the federal government against a North Carolina company called Biltmore Financial describes an apparent $25 million fraud going back for 17 years that drew in more than 500 investors, many of whom were members of a Lutheran community in that state. 
 For an investment of as little as $1,000, investors were told they were buying packages of mortgages with 10 to 20 percent annual returns. In reality, the money went to buy an Aston Martin convertible, a $1 million recreational vehicle and vacation and rental properties for the head of the company, J. V. Huffman, who was charged by the S.E.C. last November. 
 Last week, the S.E.C. charged James G. Ossie of Atlanta with taking $25 million from 120 investors -- who had to invest a minimum of $100,000 with him. Mr. Ossie even held periodic conference calls describing his trading strategy, which promised 10 percent monthly returns. 
 In the South Florida Haitian-American community, Mr. Theodule turned to churches. But his scheme fell apart in November when 40 investors showed up at Mr. Theodule's office to try to get their money back. 
 ''Theodule had been the king and lived in the community, and then one day he vanished,'' said Mr. Roseme, the investor who lost $35,000 in savings. 
 He described Mr. Theodule as ''friendly, someone you could trust, a real positive guy.''
 Nerline Horace-Manasse, a 31-year-old Haitian immigrant with six children, saw her life's savings of $25,000 disappear. 
 Statements showed her money had grown to $90,000, but when Ms. Manasse asked questions of Mr. Theodule, ''he advised he could not tell me where he was putting the money because there were a lot of copycats out there and he'd go out of business.'' 
 Now Ms. Manasse and Mr. Roseme are part of a class-action suit against Mr. Theodule. 
 Mr. Theodule's attorney, Matthew N. Thibaut, did not return a call for comment. But in court papers, Mr. Theodule said, ''Theodule admits he has told persons that he wants to help build wealth in the Haitian community.''

HEADLINE: Movie Production Incentives Are Said to Help New York

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Costly state incentives to lure film production and jobs may be paying off, at least in New York.
 A study of New York's tax breaks for movie and television production suggested that a 30 percent credit offered by the state, with an additional 5 percent offered by New York City, could be expected to keep or create about 19,500 jobs while yielding $404 million in tax revenue, at a cost of $215 million in credits. 
 But the benefits were heavily weighted toward New York City, which attracted by far the largest share of production with New York-based television series like ''Ugly Betty'' and ''30 Rock'' and movies like ''Notorious,'' a rap music drama released by Fox Searchlight this month. The city collects about 6.4 times as much in taxes from film as it spends on incentives, the study said.
 The study, completed last week, was conducted by the accounting firm Ernst & Young for both the Motion Picture Association of America and the film office of New York State. 
 In recent years, states like New York, Michigan and Louisiana have used aggressive subsidies to compete for film jobs, but comprehensive reviews of their impact have been few and far between. 
 In 2005, a study by the chief economist of Louisiana's legislative fiscal office said that state's incentives, among the country's highest, created only a modest number of jobs and did not generate enough tax revenue to offset their costs.
 New York State's subsidies were raised from 10 percent of qualified expenditures to 30 percent in April 2008, in a move to stem the flow of productions to competing states, including Connecticut and Massachusetts.
 In its assessment, Ernst & Young noted that New York State's film office received 100 applications for movie and television shoots from April 23, when the new subsidy became effective, until the end of the year. Spending on those projects was estimated at $1.8 billion, up from $940 million in all of 2007.
 Applying the new 30 percent subsidy rate and current tax rates to the level of activity that occurred in 2007, Ernst & Young figured that the state would have spent $184.4 million, while getting $208.7 million back in taxes. New York City, meanwhile, would get $195.3 million from a tax credit expenditure of only $30.7 million.
 Ernst & Young said it figured about 7,000 jobs were gained or retained in direct film employment, while an additional 12,500 came from related economic activity, not counting any increase in tourism spending.
 If the subsidies are indeed working for New York, that can only be bad news for California, the film production capital, which has seen jobs and income flee and which offers no major subsidies. 
 Last year, according to FilmLA, which tracks location shoots in Los Angeles, days of feature film production outside of studio walls fell 14 percent, to 7,043 days, the lowest level since the count began in 1993.

HEADLINE: A Last Bastion of the Necktie Throws in the Towel

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
THE earth held firm in its orbit. The continents did not founder. Martial law was not imposed. This, despite the fact that the ''21'' Club has loosened its tie for the first time since it opened at 21 West 52d Street 79 years ago. 
 The power-dining oasis, where Manhattan's surviving masters of the universe daily attempt critical mass, announced last Thursday that the restaurant, virtually the last in town with a neckwear rule, had abandoned its tie requirement at dinner in its two dining rooms, the Bar Room and Upstairs at 21. 
 Ties are ''preferred,'' it said -- indeed, ''greatly appreciated.'' And mind you, gentlemen, your jackets must stay on.
 Actually, ''21'' instituted the policy ''after Labor Day, a soft opening if you will,'' said Bryan McGuire, the manager for the last, yes, 21 years. ''We wanted to be on a more level playing field with our competitors,'' he said, adding, ''We didn't think it was that big a deal.'' Especially since, during lunch, the tie policy was ixnayed in 1996, he said. 
 The restaurant's publicist, Diana Biederman, said she issued the release so people could ''know about the policy in these challenging times.''
 Mr. McGuire, though, insisted that the decision was not recession-driven. 
 But he allowed that the policy ''could help the restaurant greatly in a time of difficulty.'' Revenue, $18.5 million last year, is off by ''double digits,'' he said. 
 The restaurant has made other concessions to the economy, including free parking for all dinner patrons. 
 (For the record, he noted, ties are required in the 20-seat private dining room, the Wine Cellar.)
 The Zagat 2009 New York City Restaurant guide has starred the Rainbow Room (which offers dinner on ''selected'' Friday and Saturday nights even as its landlord seeks to terminate its lease for nonpayment of rent) as the only other public restaurant requiring a tie among 13 that demand jackets. 
 ''It is the final victory of Los Angeles,'' Tim Zagat said. 
 So far, diners have responded with both fulmination and forbearance. 
 ''Etiquette is on a downward spiral, and politeness is disappearing,'' said Michael O'Keeffe, the dapper owner and proprietor of the River Cafe, who said that jacket and tie have been his unvarying uniform since his days at Fordham Preparatory School. ''I will miss the tie policy at '21.' It held up an example of what etiquette could be.'' 
 He added that while the River Cafe requires jackets, it hasn't insisted on ties in decades, because ''it made no sense, to some very stylish people, that style had anything to do with ties.''
 John F. Hennessy III, chairman of the American Council of Engineering Companies, a regular customer at ''21'' for 35 years who dined in the restaurant with both his father and grandfather, said, ''I'm not shocked at the news,'' adding: ''It is an appropriate change.'' 
 And Bill White, 42, president of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, who first ate at ''21'' when he was 21, allowed that ''now Bill Gates and the Google guys can come in.'' 
 But to Alan Flusser, a men's wear designer in Manhattan who has been dining at ''21'' for 34 years, the no-tie policy ''is unfortunate.'' He added, ''I'm a traditionalist, and I don't think this sends the right message to young people.''
 After the new tie policy was announced, one blog, Lost City (which describes itself as ''a running Jeremiad on the vestiges of Old New York as they are steamrolled under'') asked: ''Couldn't we get the old-school La Grenouille to uphold the old ways and begin requiring ties again?'' 
 Not likely, said Charles Masson, general manager of the 47-year-old restaurant that abandoned its tie-only policy in 2003 (but not its jacket requirement). ''There used to be a time when men wore white wigs, too,'' he said. 
 Julian Niccolini, a partner at The Four Seasons restaurant, asked simply, ''Why should I tell people how to dress?'' He said his restaurant stopped enforcing its tie policy in 1977. 
 The tie drawer in the ''21'' cloakroom -- where generations of patrons have repaired their faux-pas -- is as much a part of the restaurant's lore as its checked tablecloths and the ceiling dangling with dozens of (obsessively dusted) toy airplanes, ships and football helmets (including that of Frank Gifford). The restaurant's publicist, Ms. Biederman, said it would continue to proffer ties to the needy who prefer them. 
 ''I remember one night they loaned me a navy blue fly-fishing tie -- you know, with the flies on it,'' Mr. Hennessy recalled. ''I told them I liked it -- and they gave it to me! I still have it.''

HEADLINE: Same Sign Outside, but a New Owner

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
A few years ago, AT&T became an active player in the real estate market -- not as a buyer but as a seller. The telecommunications giant sold its office towers in a number of cities, including Dallas, Cleveland and Chicago, but has continued to occupy and control these buildings.
 Taking advantage of a healthy market for so-called sale-leaseback transactions allowed the company to free as much as $1.5 billion, according to one broker's estimate. Among the properties sold were the 42-story office tower at 909 Chestnut Street in St. Louis and the 47-story building at 675 West Peachtree Street in Atlanta, which AT&T had acquired in its merger with BellSouth. 
 The sale-leasebacks were ''part of a strategy to get out of the real estate business, which is not a core business or interest of our company,'' said an AT&T spokesman, Fletcher Cook. 
 Large corporations are usually loath to say much about the process of transforming themselves from owners to tenants, and often the transactions are not even made public. Mr. Cook would not estimate how much real estate AT&T had sold in recent years.
 But brokers say that AT&T's timing was good. Like all forms of real estate investment, the sale-leaseback market flourished in mid-decade but has all but stalled in recent months as financing has dried up. 
 Sale-leaseback deals of industrial, office and retail properties last year totaled $7.3 billion, compared with $15 billion in 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm that tracks sales of $2.5 million or more. In the last quarter of the year, only $514 million in sale-leasebacks were recorded.
 The pool of buyers has diminished as some of the more active participants, including GE Real Estate, IStar Financial, First Industrial Realty Trust and Lexington Corporate Properties Trust, have been sidelined by financial difficulties. 
 Investors in sale-leasebacks have been especially skittish since HSBC, the British bank, sold its headquarters in London's Canary Wharf to a Spanish developer, Metrovacesa, in April, 2007 for $:1.09 billion ($1.5 billion) and the buyer was unable to refinance the loan it took out to close the deal, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics. The bank repurchased the building for $:838 million.
 Yet as the economy has worsened, an increasing number of corporations -- especially those whose bond ratings are less than investment grade -- are clamoring to divest themselves of their real estate through sale-leasebacks. ''The companies interested in doing it are the ones that people want to stay away from,'' said Randy Blankstein, the president of Boulder Net Lease Funds, a company in Northbrook, Ill., that invests in buildings with single tenants. ''A lot are being offered, but few are being executed.''
 Last fall, for example, General Motors explored the possibility of selling its Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit, but the distressed auto company found no takers. 
 For troubled companies, sale-leasebacks provide an alternative means of financing that can be used to pay down debt. The seller can free up the entire value of the property rather than just 50 percent or 60 percent, the maximum loan-to-value that would be allowed today. In addition to rent, the seller continues to pay taxes, and utility and maintenance costs. 
 Many investors insist that the seller's credit be rated investment grade. ''There are deals you could have done in 2007 that you just can't do today,'' said Sidney Domb, the president of United Trust Fund, a Miami company that (in a joint venture with GE Real Estate) owns the corporate headquarters for Belk department stores in Charlotte, N.C.
 Some companies, however, are willing to take on riskier deals, but they expect to be compensated accordingly. ''Investors are much more cognizant of the differences in credit than they were a year or a year and a half ago,'' said Brian H. Scott, who manages the sale-leaseback group at CB Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate company. ''There has been a repricing of risk.''
 Last week, The New York Times Company confirmed that it was in advanced negotiations with one leader in the sale-leaseback industry, W. P. Carey & Company of New York, to sell 19 floors of its new headquarters building on Eighth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan for an undisclosed price. (The Times Company had said it was seeking a price of up to $225 million.) 
 Under the terms of the deal, the Times Company, which owns 58 percent of the 52-story building, would continue to occupy and manage its space for the 10-year life of the lease. On Friday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's unsecured senior bonds, taking the same step that Standard & Poor's took in October.
 Neither W. P. Carey nor the Times Company would comment on their negotiations. 
 Michael M. Rotchford, an executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield who is advising the Times Company on the sale-leaseback, also declined to talk about the pending deal. 
 Popular in the 1970s and 1980s, sale-leasebacks lost their appeal for a while when certain tax advantages were eliminated. But as the demand for real estate intensified in the middle of this decade, the market for sale-leasebacks caught fire, said David W. Cobb, chief executive of BentleyForbes, a Los Angeles real estate investment company that used to focus only on such transactions. 
 But it broadened its business to include buildings with several tenants in 2005 because of the growing risk that it saw in sale-leasebacks. ''The terms of the deals had swung heavily toward the tenants versus the landlord,'' Mr. Cobb said. Sellers were able to insist on greater flexibility, including shorter lease terms and the opportunity to give up some of their space if their business contracted, he said. 
 These days, however, buyers enjoy the upper hand. Unlike the proposed 10-year lease for the headquarters of the Times Company, the normal lease term now is 20 years, said Gerald J. Levin, who leads the sale-leaseback practice at Mesirow Financial, a company based in Chicago.
 The New York Times deal would be unusual in other respects. Sale-leasebacks are rare in New York because most building have multiple tenants. In 2007, however, Deutsche Bank sold its 47-story headquarters building at 60 Wall Street to the Paramount Group for nearly $1.2 billion in a 15-year leaseback arrangement. (The bank also financed the deal.)
 Gordon J. Whiting, a managing director at Angelo, Gordon & Company of New York, which recently acquired the headquarters and distribution center for Conney Safety Products in Madison, Wis., said owners of Manhattan real estate do not want to miss out on the likelihood that their building will increase in value over time. ''They haven't wanted to sell them because they think they're giving up that appreciation,'' Mr. Whiting said.
 Another unusual feature of the proposed agreement with W. P. Carey would give the Times Company the right to buy back the space for a predetermined price. That would mean the lease would be listed on the company's balance sheet as a liability, rather than as an off-balance sheet transaction that does not add to its debt, leaseback specialists said. Many companies seek sale-leasebacks to improve their balance sheet. 
 For W. P. Carey, a 35-year-old public company that also operates four nontraded real estate investment funds -- marketed to the public by financial advisers -- the deal with the Times Company would offer not only a stable rental stream but also a chance to capture a negotiated increase in the property's value. The company says its annual returns since 1979 have averaged 11.56 percent.
 In its most recent annual report, W. P. Carey described its investment philosophy: ''We seek to invest in properties that are strategically important to the operations of the tenant company, so that even if that company has some financial difficulty, it needs to keep the lights on in our buildings to run its business.''

HEADLINE: A Stimulus With Merit, And Misses

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
Email: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 How much of a difference will the stimulus make?
 Two weeks ago, a Congressional committee posted a table of numbers on its Web site that gave an early answer. The numbers came from the Congressional Budget Office and seemed to show that only 38 percent of the money in the bill would be spent by September 2010. That didn't sound very stimulating, and the numbers soon caused a minor mediasensation.
 But anyone who looked closely would have seen something strange about the table. It suggested that the bill would cost only $355 billion in all, rather than its actual cost of about $800 billion. 
 Why? It turns out that the table was analyzing only certain parts of the bill, like new spending on highways, education and energy. It ignored the tax cuts, jobless benefits and Medicaid payments -- the very money that will be spent the fastest.
 On Monday evening, the Congressional Budget Office put out its analysis of the full bill, and it gave a very different picture. It estimated that about 64 percent of the money, or $526 billion, would be spent by next September.
 That timetable may still be slower than ideal, and short of the 75 percent benchmark President Obama has promised, but it isn't terrible. Spending hundreds of billions of dollars takes time. In fact, for all the criticism the stimulus package has been getting, it does pretty well by several important yardsticks. 
 First of all, the package really is stimulus. It will quickly give money to the people who have been hardest hit by the recession and who, not coincidentally, will be most likely to spend that money soon. The spending also has a chance to do some long-term good, by paying for the computerization of medical records, the weatherization of homes and other such investments. 
 By my count, the current package has just one major flaw. It could do a lot more to change how the government spends its money. It doesn't have nearly the amount of the fresh, reformist thinking as Mr. Obama's campaign speeches and proposals did. Instead, the bill is mostly a stew of spending on existing programs, whatever their warts may be. 
 I understand that this approach reflects the realities of political negotiations. It even has some economic merits: it may help speed the flow of money out the door. But it still is a missed opportunity in a few instances.
 The biggest is infrastructure. Transportation experts had hoped the package would be the start of not only more spending on infrastructure but also smarter spending on highways, mass transit, sewer systems and other public works. So far, the experts are disappointed.
 In the current system, the federal government sends money to states without any real effort to evaluate whether it will pay for worthy projects. States rarely do serious analyses of their own. They build new roads before fixing old ones. They don't consider whether those new roads will lead to faster traffic or simply more traffic. They spend millions of dollars on legislators' pet projects and hulking new sports stadiums. In the world of infrastructure, cost-benefit analysis is still a science of the future.
 A couple of weeks ago, Ed Rendell, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, came to Washington to talk up infrastructure. He is a member of a tripartisan threesome -- along with Michael Bloomberg, New York's independent mayor, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's Republican governor -- trying to persuade the country to get serious about infrastructure.
 In his talk, Mr. Rendell said he understood that the stimulus bill couldn't come close to solving all these problems. But it could make some progress, and Mr. Obama's sky-high approval ratings gave him a wonderful chance to do so. ''This is the time to put down some markers -- this is the time,'' Mr. Rendell said.
 And the bill does include a couple of markers. It will list on the Web the projects that the federal government is financing -- an idea that, amazingly enough, is considered radical -- and will require that mayors and governors sign off on projects. That will make it harder for them to lobby for projects now and criticize those same projects later, as Gov. Sarah Palin did with the Bridge to Nowhere. At least one version of the bill also sets aside $5.5 billion to be awarded by the transportation secretary, supposedly on the merits of a project.
 But it's not clear how that will work, and there is so much more that could be done. The bill could create a small-scale version of an ''infrastructure bank,'' a free-standing entity that could make more merit-based decisions than Congress does (an idea that Mr. Obama supports). The bill could also finance the creation of new state offices to conduct cost-benefit analyses. It could also help cover the budget shortfalls of public transit systems, instead of simply allocating another $30 billion for the construction of new highways.
 Fifty-one transit systems have recently proposed service cuts or fare increases, including those in Atlanta, Denver, New York, Phoenix, St. Louis, San Diego and Washington. If these cuts go through, they will make it harder for people to get to work (or look for work), and they will undermine one of the long-term goals of the stimulus package: laying the groundwork for a greener economy.
 It's not just infrastructure, either. The bill includes big, admirable increases in college financial aid -- but appears likely to do little to use those increases to improve higher education. The package will also sprinkle millions of dollars on some debatable projects, like the renovation of the National Mall.
 The standard that I'm setting here may seem a bit high. Even with its current flaws, the bill has much to recommend it. It will indeed try to encourage significant changes in health care and K-12 education, for example.
 The bill is certainly superior to a huge package of tax cuts, which might be politically popular but end up in people's bank accounts rather than stimulating the economy. By now, we should know that tax cuts are not a cure-all. The cuts of 2001 and 2003 couldn't keep the recent expansion from being one of the weakest on record or the current recession from being so deep.
 This bill should help the economy in both the near term and the long term. But the government doesn't go out and spend about $800 billion every day. The details matter.

HEADLINE: Aides Say Obama's Afghan Aims Elevate War Over Development

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama intends to adopt a tougher line toward Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, as part of a new American approach to Afghanistan that will put more emphasis on waging war than on development, senior administration officials said Tuesday. 
 Mr. Karzai is now seen as a potential impediment to American goals in Afghanistan, the officials said, because corruption has become rampant in his government, contributing to a flourishing drug trade and the resurgence of the Taliban.
 Among those pressing for Mr. Karzai to do more, the officials said, are Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 The officials portrayed the approach as a departure from that of President Bush, who held videoconferences with Mr. Karzai every two weeks and sought to emphasize the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civil institutions. 
 They said that the Obama administration would work with provincial leaders as an alternative to the central government, and that it would leave economic development and nation-building increasingly to European allies, so that American forces could focus on the fight against insurgents. 
 ''If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of Central Asian Valhalla over there, we will lose,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who served under Mr. Bush and is staying on under Mr. Obama, told Congress on Tuesday. He said there was not enough ''time, patience or money'' to pursue overly ambitious goals in Afghanistan, and he called the war there ''our greatest military challenge.''
 Mr. Gates said last week that previous American goals for Afghanistan had been ''too broad and too far into the future,'' language that differed from Mr. Bush's policies. 
 NATO has not met its pledges for combat troops, transport helicopters, military trainers and other support personnel in Afghanistan, and Mr. Gates has openly criticized the United States' NATO allies for not fulfilling their promises. 
 Mr. Holbrooke is preparing to travel to the region, and administration officials said he would ask more of Mr. Karzai, particularly on fighting corruption, aides said, as part of what they described as a ''more for more'' approach. 
 Mr. Karzai is facing re-election this year, and it is not clear whether Mr. Obama and his aides intend to support his candidacy. The administration will be watching, aides said, to see if Mr. Karzai responds to demands from the United States and its NATO allies that he arrest associates, including his half-brother, whom Western officials have accused of smuggling drugs in Kandahar. 
 Shortly before taking office as vice president last week, Mr. Biden traveled to Afghanistan in his role as the departing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He met with Mr. Karzai and warned him that the Obama administration would expect more of him than Mr. Bush did, administration officials said. He told Mr. Karzai that Mr. Obama would be discontinuing the video calls that Mr. Karzai enjoyed with Mr. Bush, said a senior official, who added that Mr. Obama expected Mr. Karzai to do more to crack down on corruption. 
 After his return from Afghanistan, Mr. Biden, who has had a contentious relationship with Mr. Karzai, described the situation there as ''a real mess.'' 
 An election is scheduled to be held no later than the fall, under Afghanistan's Constitution. Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan-American who is a former United States ambassador to the United Nations and is viewed as a possible challenger to Mr. Karzai, warned that the Obama administration must tread carefully as it recalibrated its Afghanistan policy.
 ''If it looks like we're abandoning the central government and focusing just on the local areas, we will run afoul of Afghan politics,'' Mr. Khalilzad said. ''Some will regard it as an effort to break up the Afghan state, which would be regarded as hostile policy.''
 Mr. Obama is preparing to increase the number of American troops in Afghanistan over the next two years, perhaps to more than 60,000 from about 34,000 now. But Mr. Gates indicated Tuesday that the administration would move slowly, at least for now. He outlined plans for an increase of about 12,000 troops by midsummer but cautioned that any decision on more troops beyond that might have to wait until late 2009, given the need for barracks and other infrastructure.
 With the forces of the Taliban and Al Qaeda mounting more aggressive operations in eastern and southern Afghanistan, administration officials said they saw little option but to focus on the military campaign. They said Europeans would be asked to pick up more of the work on reconstruction, police training and cooperation with the Afghan government. They also said much of the international effort might shift to helping local governments and institutions, and away from the government in Kabul.
 ''It's not about dumping reconstruction at all,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic delicacy of the subject. ''What we're trying to do is to focus on the Al Qaeda problem. That has to be our first priority.'' 
 Mr. Gates said Tuesday that under the redefined Afghan strategy, it would be vital for NATO allies to ''provide more civilian support.'' In particular, he said, the allies should be more responsible for building civil society institutions in Afghanistan, a task that had been falling to American forces. He also demanded that allies ''step up to the plate'' and defray costs of expanding the Afghan Army, an emerging power center, whose leaders could emerge as rivals to Mr. Karzai. 
 Mr. Gates added that the United States should focus on limited goals. ''My own personal view is that our primary goal is to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a base for terrorists and extremists to attack the United States and our allies, and whatever else we need to do flows from that objective,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Can He Hang? The Bad Judge And His Image

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
Charles L. Brieant Jr., a federal district judge in New York for 37 years, died last summer at 85, and as court personnel began packing up his chambers, they confronted an unusual legacy.
 Hanging on the wall, along with portraits of Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, was an oil painting of an obscure judge that Judge Brieant had rescued from a courthouse storage room, paid to have cleaned and enjoyed showing visitors.
 The portrait was of Martin T. Manton, who sat for two decades on the prestigious federal appeals court for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, and who was almost appointed to the United States Supreme Court. But in 1939, he resigned in disgrace. He was accused of taking large sums in gifts and loans from parties in cases, was tried and convicted and spent 19 months in prison. 
 Judge Brieant (pronounced BRY-ent) told people that he displayed the painting as a reminder of the fallibility of judges, particularly those above him on the Second Circuit, whom he liked to needle and call the Second Circus. Now a question has arisen in the courthouse about what should be done with the painting. Should it continue to be displayed? Should it be thrown in a closet? And who has the jurisdiction to make that call -- the District Court, where it hung for years, or the Court of Appeals, where Judge Manton spent most of his career and which would rather not see his face?
 ''This is a key piece of its historical memory that has always been, at least since 1939, the sort of unspeakable embarrassment,'' said John Q. Barrett, a law professor at St. John's University and a legal historian. ''Judge Brieant's kind of twinkling interest in Manton and the Manton portrait sort of pokes back at that.''
 But the chief judge of the Second Circuit, Dennis Jacobs, wrote recently to Kimba M. Wood, the chief judge of the District Court, suggesting it was time to banish the painting from view. ''The portrait is not much in the way of art,'' Judge Jacobs wrote. ''It is just an old picture of a person best left unremembered.''
 In some ways, the legacy of Judge Manton has already been erased from the legal annals: two federal judges in Manhattan recalled that when they were law clerks, their judges admonished them never to cite Judge Manton's opinions. 
 But some district court judges are not so ready to sweep the Manton story under the rug.
 Judge P. Kevin Castel, who has studied and written about the Manton case, said he agreed with Judge Brieant: ''He viewed Manton as a scoundrel, but it was a morality tale and important to keep the story alive. You don't hide that.'' 
 Judge Jacobs, the Second Circuit's chief, was a friend of Judge Brieant's. He described him as a ''funny, irreverent person with a love of history.'' 
 That is a fair description of Judge Jacobs as well. And he said it was in that spirit that he resolved, after Judge Brieant's death, that the portrait should no longer hang in public. He said he believed that only the most inspirational of appellate judges should be honored with courthouse art, like Learned Hand and Henry J. Friendly, whose busts are on display in the Second Circuit courtroom.
 As for Judge Manton, Judge Jacobs could barely hide his contempt. ''I'm kind of hoping that Judge Manton will disappear,'' he said. 
 But he acknowledged that he first had to get his hands on the painting, which was completed in 1922. On Oct. 10, he wrote to Judge Wood of the District Court, saying it was time for the Second Circuit to ''regain rightful possession of the portrait.''
 He noted that Judge Manton had sat on the District Court for a scant two years before spending ''all the rest of his long career'' -- 1918 to 1939 -- on the appellate bench. As for Judge Brieant, he had been indulged because of his ''highly developed sense of humor,'' Judge Jacobs wrote.
 ''But, if it has been a joke, it is now an old joke,'' he said, adding that he would be happy to make arrangements for the Court of Appeals to pick up the painting.
 Many portraits, some dating to the 1800s, grace chambers and courtrooms. 
 The Manton portrait, on the other hand, sat for years in musty storage, its canvas torn and covered with dirt, according to a 1980 conservator's report.
 Basically, said Clifford P. Kirsch, the court's senior executive, ''no one wanted it.'' 
 Judge Brieant found it in the 1980s. He paid to have it cleaned and repaired, said his son, Charles L. Brieant III, a lawyer. The judge hung it first when he sat in the federal courthouse at Foley Square, and took it with him when he moved to White Plains, another site for the District Court.
 After Judge Brieant's death in July, the painting, measuring about 4 feet by 3 feet, was sent for repairs and cleaning to the Julius Lowy Frame and Restoring Company, on East 80th Street, which has restored many paintings for the court. 
 One morning last fall, the company's president, Larry Shar, who said he had been unaware of Judge Manton's past, examined the portrait with a hand-held ultraviolet light. He pointed out scratches and discoloration, and said the judge's hands had at one point been painted over clumsily. The portrait needed work, he said. 
 Then he stepped back. ''It's a nice portrait, by the way,'' he remarked. ''I mean, it's very painterly. 
 ''There's a mood. There's expression. This is a trained artist that is showing anatomy; he's built up the face in such a way that it's sort of an Old Master technique.''
 The artist's signature is hard to read, but appears to be that of Jassa Salganik, a Russian immigrant who died in 1937 at the age of 50. 
 On Oct. 21, Judge Wood of the District Court responded to Judge Jacobs's letter. 
 She had long admired Judge Brieant, who was a giant in the law and a mentor to younger judges. At his memorial service in September, she cited his breadth of knowledge, sense of humor, erudite opinions and love of history.
 In her letter, Judge Wood joked about Judge Jacobs's apparent portrait-banishing plans, and made clear she had no intention of assisting. She wrote cheerily that she looked forward to discussing ''how best to publicize Judge Manton's legacy.''
 In an interview, she added that because of the economic crisis, her court would postpone the portrait's restoration, estimated to cost $10,000. She said that the ownership tussle would be left for another day. ''I look forward to it,'' she said.
 Judge Manton's own daughter, Catherine, 91, located on the West Coast, said she had never heard of the painting. Her son, Peter J. Denning, chairman of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., said, ''If somebody would like to offer it to the family, we'd love to have it.''
 As to why Judge Brieant was so enamored of the painting, a clue lies in his papers, which his widow, Virginia Brieant, keeps in scrapbooks at their home in Ossining, N.Y.
 There is a 1998 letter containing a cryptic reference: ''Did you move the portrait to White Plains?''
 It was signed by Frederick B. Lacey, a former federal judge in New Jersey. In an interview, Mr. Lacey, now 88, said he remembered the portrait. Judge Brieant, a friend, had once asked him, ''Do you know who that is?'' 
 ''I said, 'No.'
 ''He said, 'Martin Manton.'
 ''I said, 'What? You've got him hanging up there?' ''
 Judge Brieant explained that he wanted to shake things up a bit. 
 ''He wanted to stir the pot,'' Mr. Lacey said. ''He said: 'Get that up here. It'll be a topic of conversation wondering why I've done it,' '' Mr. Lacey recalled. ''That's what made Charlie so interesting.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Socialist Jet-Setters

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 As President Obama spreads his New Testament balm over the capital, I'm longing for a bit of Old Testament wrath.
 Couldn't he throw down his BlackBerry tablet and smash it in anger over the feckless financiers, the gods of gold and their idols -- in this case not a gilt calf but an $87,000 area rug, a cache of diamond Tiffany and Cartier watches and a French-made luxury corporate jet?
 Now that we're nationalizing, couldn't we fire any obtuse bankers and auto executives who cling to perks and bonuses even as the economy is following John Thain down his antique commode? 
 How could Citigroup be so dumb as to go ahead with plans to get a new $50 million corporate jet, the exclusive Dassault Falcon 7X seating 12, after losing $28.5 billion in the past 15 months and receiving $345 billion in government investments and guarantees?
 (Now I get why a $400 payment I recently sent to pay off my Citibank Visa was mistakenly applied to my sister-in-law's Citibank Mastercard account.)
 The ''Citiboobs'' -- as The New York Post, which broke the news, calls them -- watched as the car chieftains got in trouble for flying their private jets to Washington to ask for bailouts, and the A.I.G. moguls got dragged before Congress for spending their bailout on California spa treatments. But the boobs still didn't get the message. 
 The former masters of the universe don't seem to fully comprehend that their universe has crumbled and, thanks to them, so has ours. Real people are losing real jobs at Caterpillar, Home Depot and Sprint Nextel; these and other companies announced on Monday that they would cut more than 75,000 jobs in the U.S. and around the world, as consumer confidence and home prices swan-dived.
 Prodded by an appalled Senator Carl Levin, Tim Geithner -- even as he was being confirmed as Treasury secretary -- directed Treasury officials to call the Citiboobs and tell them the new jet would not fly.
 ''They woke up pretty quickly,'' says a Treasury official, adding that they protested for a bit. ''Six months ago, they would have kept the plane and flown it to Washington.''
 Senator Levin said that the financiers will not be able to change their warped mentality, but will have to be reined in by Geithner's new leashes. ''I have no confidence that they intend or desire to change,'' Levin told me. ''These bankers got away with murder, and it's obscene that close to nothing is being asked of financial institutions. I get incensed at the thought that a bank that's getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money is out there buying fancy new airplanes.''
 New York's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, always gratifying on the issue of clawing back money from the greedy creeps on Wall Street, on Tuesday subpoenaed Thain, the former Merrill Lynch chief executive, over $4 billion in bonuses he handed out as the failing firm was bought by Bank of America. 
 In an interview with Maria Bartiromo on CNBC, Thain used the specious, contemptible reasoning that other executives use to rationalize why they're keeping their bonuses as profits are plunging.
 ''If you don't pay your best people, you will destroy your franchise'' and they'll go elsewhere, he said.
 Hello? They destroyed the franchise. Let's call their bluff. Let's see what a great job market it is for the geniuses of capitalism who lost $15 billion in three months and helped usher in socialism.
 Bartiromo also asked Thain to explain, when jobs and salaries were being cut at his firm, how he could justify spending $1 million to renovate his office. As The Daily Beast and CNBC reported, big-ticket items included curtains for $28,000, a pair of chairs for $87,000, fabric for a ''Roman Shade'' for $11,000, Regency chairs for $24,000, six wall sconces for $2,700, a $13,000 chandelier in the private dining room and six dining chairs for $37,000, a ''custom coffee table'' for $16,000, an antique commode ''on legs'' for $35,000, and a $1,400 ''parchment waste can.''
 Does that mean you can only throw used parchment in it or is it made of parchment? It's psychopathic to spend a million redoing your office when the folks outside it are losing jobs, homes, pensions and savings. 
 Thain should never rise above the level of stocking the money in A.T.M.'s again. Just think: This guy could well have been Treasury secretary if John McCain had won. 
 Bartiromo pressed: What was wrong with the office of his predecessor, Stanley O'Neal?
 ''Well -- his office was very different -- than -- the -- the general decor of -- Merrill's offices,'' Thain replied. ''It really would have been -- very difficult -- for -- me to use it in the form that it was in.''
 Did it have a desk and a phone?
 How are these ruthless, careless ghouls who murdered the economy still walking around (not to mention that sociopathic sadist Bernie Madoff?) -- and not as perps? 
 Bring on the shackles. Let the show trials begin.

HEADLINE: Obama, Visiting G.O.P. Lawmakers, Is Open to Some Compromise on Stimulus

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama made a campaign trip of sorts on Tuesday to seek bipartisan support for his economic stimulus plan, visiting Republicans on Capitol Hill and suggesting that he was open to some limited revisions that would address their demands for more tax cuts.
 In a session with House Republicans, Mr. Obama said he would not compromise on a central element of his plan that has drawn particular Republican opposition: his campaign promise for a middle-class tax credit that would also go to low-wage workers who earn too little to pay income taxes but are subject to payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Most Republicans oppose granting such credits to people who do not pay federal income taxes, saying they then amount to a welfare payment.
 But, Republicans interviewed after the meeting said, Mr. Obama told them he would listen to proposals to expand on provisions cutting taxes for small businesses and would be open to corporate tax cuts as well if Republicans cooperated to close tax loopholes for big business. 
 Democrats said Mr. Obama could also support a demand from a senior Senate Republican, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, to add a provision adjusting the alternative minimum tax so that it does not hit millions of middle-class taxpayers this year. That would add costs of nearly $70 billion over 10 years to a package that Republicans already say is too big. 
 Several hours after Mr. Obama's visit to the Capitol, the Senate Finance Committee approved Mr. Grassley's proposal as an amendment to the emerging Senate economic recovery plan. The full Senate is expected to take up a stimulus bill next week, following the expected passage of the $825 billion House version on Wednesday.
 The White House encouraged other gestures as well. As the House version of the legislation came to the floor on Tuesday, Democrats stripped from it a provision that Republicans had ridiculed as having nothing to do with economic stimulus, one expanding federal Medicaid coverage of family planning services. (The Congressional Budget Office had estimated that the provision would actually save the government $200 million over five years by reducing pregnancy and postnatal-care expenses.)
 Trying to forestall other Republican attacks, Democrats also stripped out $200 million for restoring the National Mall, another provision that the minority had mocked.
 Both parties expect a vote largely along party lines in the House on Wednesday. They say the degree to which the legislation can win any real bipartisan support will depend on what happens in the Senate, where the measure could be altered to attract at least some moderate Republicans.
 ''The statistics every day underscore the urgency of the economic situation,'' Mr. Obama said before heading into lunch with Senate Republicans. 
 ''I don't expect a hundred percent agreement from my Republican colleagues,'' he added, ''but I do hope that we can all put politics aside and do the American people's business right now.''
 If Mr. Obama's separate sessions with House and Senate Republicans on Tuesday did not win him any immediate additional support, they got high marks from Republicans for outreach. 
 Republican lawmakers said his efforts were a good start toward building a relationship with them that would be vital as Congress and the administration turned to politically divisive issues like health care, tax reform and the long-term financial problems facing Medicare and Social Security.
 ''This was not a drive-by P.R. stunt, and I actually thought it might be,'' said Representative Zach Wamp, Republican of Tennessee. ''It was a substantive, in-depth discussion with our conference, and he's very effective.''
 ''He knows that the debt and the deficit are huge long-term problems as well,'' Mr. Wamp said, ''and he made a compelling case. He sounded, frankly, a lot like a Republican.''
 The White House has let House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, take the lead so far in pushing the bill -- and in drawing fire from Republicans, allowing Mr. Obama to remain at least somewhat detached from the partisan wrangling. But in courting Republican support, whether substantively for the economic package or for longer-term political purposes, Mr. Obama has also risked some tension with members of his own party.
 While he is relatively new to Washington, having served less than one term in the Senate, many Democrats who have served longer harbor rancor from past years when Republicans ran Congress and, with George W. Bush in the White House, excluded Democrats from lawmaking. 
 The Republicans' main appeal to Mr. Obama was that he should press Congressional Democrats to reach out to the minority. Several Republicans told him that House Democrats had never consulted them in drafting the economic stimulus package.
 ''The House Democrats have failed at bipartisanship, I think that's clear, and I think he acknowledged that'' by not explicitly disagreeing with complaints he heard from Republicans, said Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama.
 House Democrats said the Republicans undercut their own call for bipartisanship when their leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, told his colleagues in a meeting before the president arrived that he was going to oppose the House package and that they should, too. That suggested the Republicans were not open to Mr. Obama's overtures, the Democrats said.
 ''They have taken a political stance,'' said the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland.
 Mr. Hoyer called that ''unfortunate'' but also telegraphed his own reluctance to embrace Republican proposals on economic recovery. ''I am hard put,'' he said, ''to take the advice or counsel of people who have followed policies that have put us deeply into debt and led to the weakest economy since the 1930s.''
 Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware, who is among the few moderate Republicans left in the House, said even he was not ready to vote for the House Democrats' package. But the final compromise with the Senate, assuming it includes more tax cuts and less spending, could get 10 to 15 House Republican votes, Mr. Castle said.
 Mr. Obama spoke to House Republicans for about 10 minutes and then took about a dozen questions for an hour, members said. He emphasized the seriousness of the economic emergency and lamented, ''I would love to not have to spend this money.''
 When reminded that he was late for his Senate meeting, he joked that ''my former colleagues can wait,'' drawing his biggest applause from the House lawmakers. And while they were not receptive to his policy message, the Republicans were more than happy to have their photographs taken with him as the session wound down.
 Mr. Obama brought along his chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, but never turned to him for assistance, Republicans said. 
 Senate Republicans, though skeptical, were still not willing to issue blanket opposition to the plan emerging in their chamber. They also said Mr. Obama seemed open to changes that could attract Republican support.
 ''We're going to continue to try to encourage the majority here in the Congress to incorporate a number of our ideas,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
