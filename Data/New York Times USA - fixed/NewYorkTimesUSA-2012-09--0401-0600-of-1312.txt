HEADLINE: Does Delhi Need a Cap on Car Ownership?

BYLINE: MALAVIKA VYAWAHARE


HIGHLIGHT: Should India learn from China, and limit car ownership? 

 BODY:
Is it time for India to take lessons from China about pollution and congestion?
The municipal government of Guangzhou, one of China's biggest auto manufacturing centers, plans to halve the number of new cars on the streets, The New York Times reported, by introducing "license plate auctions and lotteries."
The move comes as the city struggles to address traffic congestion issues and curb pollution - issues that also bedevil India's biggest cities, particularly its capital. Despite the current slowdown, India is still one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and, according to a World Economic Forum study released this year, also has the world's worst air pollution.
The problem is particularly acute in Delhi, where an average of 1,335 vehicles were added to Delhi's roads every day during 2010 and 2011. Infrastructure improvements have not kept pace with the influx of vehicles, mostly cars and motorcycles, and the city faces a capacity crisis in less than a decade, an expert says.
"The capacity of roads in Delhi will be exceeded by 2021 on most major roads and junctions," Geetam Tiwari, a professor of transport planning at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi who is also associated with the city's contentious Bus Rapid Transport pilot project, told India Ink.
So far, the Delhi government has been mulling measures to discourage private vehicle use and promote other methods of transportation, like B.R.T., rather than direct limits on ownership.
"Increasing vehicular population is a major challenge facing the city, and we will have to take tough decisions to deal with it," a senior Delhi official said in an interview with The Jagran Post last week.
The "tough decisions" so far include making parking more expensive, levying congestion charges on certain routes during peak hours and upgrading the public transportation system, all of which are being gradually implemented in Delhi. The government is also considering a proposal to levy parking charges in residential areas, unlikely to be a popular idea among car owners, who are the city's wealthiest and most influential people. The B.R.T. project, for example, has spawned vociferous opposition, especially among the car-owning population. A recent court order, in response to their complaints, allows other vehicles to use the bus-only corridor, negating its benefit for those not using private cars.
Some cities in India, however, are already experimenting with rules to check car ownership.
Aizawl, the capital of the northeastern state of Mizoram, has linked the granting of licenses to parking availability. Vehicle owners have to show that they own garages before their vehicles can be registered. But as a consequence, "a number of vehicles have been left unregistered due to the inspectors' inability to verify that the garages exist," the local news media reported.
In Jaipur in the western state of Rajasthan, the state government was directed by the high court to register only those vehicles whose owners submit an affidavit that they have a parking space for the vehicle. The order came into force on May 1 and local transport officials have not encountered the same difficulties as their peers in Aizawl, for a simple reason. "We were asked to get the affidavits from the vehicle owners. The high court did not direct us to crosscheck the affidavit," officials told the The Daily Bhaskar.
Vehicle ownership levels remain fairly low in Delhi at 85 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with a developed country like Britain, which has 760 vehicles per 1,000 people. But owning one remains a goal for many. "Rising appetites for personal mobility are buttressed by the association of car ownership with high social status," a report on changes in bus transportation pointed out.
Growth in car sales remains a strong point in India's economy. In a mid-term review of the Automotive Mission Plan 2006-2016, the government outlines plans to make India a "destination of choice in the design and manufacture of automobiles." According to the review, vehicle production in the country increased from 9.7 million units in 2006 to 20 million in 2011.
India's courts have occasionally addressed questions about the addition of more cars to India's roads. Dismissing the Municipal Corporation of Delhi's plea this year to limit the cycle rickshaws on Delhi roads, a Supreme Court judge said the government was not prepared to put limits on cars. "In your so-called vision, you must have thought that by scrapping rickshaws there will be enough space for cars and other vehicles on the roads," The Hindu quoted him as saying.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of the Center for Science and Environment and head of the transport planning program, said the government should focus on influencing commuting choices and encouraging people to use cars less and public transportation more.
"A quota system should be a last resort," Ms. Roychowdhury said. "But that is something Delhi would have to consider if the current government policies do not solve the transport problems soon."

HEADLINE: Making Mandarin Mandatory - in U.S. Kindergartens

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: A school district in Georgia has begun teaching Mandarin to its youngest pupils -- the classes are mandatory -- in an effort to have every student fully bilingual by the time they graduate from high school. With instructors from a program underwritten by the Chinese government, the ambitious new curriculum is not without its skeptics. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Bibb County sits smack-dab in the center of Georgia, and 150 years ago it was at the very center of the Confederacy. Its foundries supplied weapons and ammunition to the rebel army, and no county supplied a larger percentage of its men to the cause. Toward the end of the Civil War, the only local men not carrying a musket for the South were elderly, blind or disabled. 
Times are still tough in Bibb County. Some 20 percent of the residents live below the poverty line, and its public schools are among the lowest performing in the state. About half the kids don't graduate from high school.
But the county has just embarked on a bold plan to have all its children fully bilingual - in English and Mandarin - by the time they graduate from high school. In recent weeks, children from pre-kindergarten through third grade began mandatory Mandarin classes, part of a curriculum that in three years will include middle school and high school students. 
"Students who are in elementary school today, by 2050 they'll be at the pinnacle of their career," the school superintendent Romain Dallemand said in an interview that aired Saturday on NPR. "They will live in a world where China and India will have 50 percent of the world GDP. They will live in a world where, if they cannot function successfully in the Asian culture, they will pay a heavy price."
The new curriculum has had some pushback, to say the least, and the word communism has often been raised. Jane Drennan, a deputy superintendent, told a TV station in Macon, the county seat, that she and other school officials had heard from many parents who said, "I don't want my kid learning Chinese."
"I understand there may be some fears involved in moving a different culture into our community," Ms. Drennan said. "People have concerns we won't be teaching English as much, which is not true. This is an addition to our curriculum."
Ms. Drennan said learning another language, whether it's Chinese or French, "enhances your learning in everything else."
"Bibb County is not known for producing the highest-achieving graduates," Dina McDonald, a Macon resident and the mother of a ninth-grader, told NPR. "You'll see that many of them can't even speak basic English."
"Do you want to teach them how to say, 'Do you want fries with that?' in Mandarin?"
A number of parents have asked why Spanish is not the default second language, especially with the increasing number of Hispanic residents in the county. 
"My wife is a Latina, and so I fully understand," said Mr. Dallemand, who was born in Haiti, adding a saying from Arthur C. Clarke: "It is important for communities to educate our children for their future, not our past."
The new Mandarin teachers, about 25 in all, are being supplied by the Confucius Institute at Kennesaw State University, north of Atlanta. Hailing from mainland China, the teachers live in the local Bibb County communities, teach and work full-time at the schools and cost the district $16,000 each. 
For the past three weeks, Jie Jiang has been teaching second-graders at Burdell-Hunt Elementary School in Macon. She told the Macon Telegraph that the "kids are really nice and they learn fast." And the newspaper's story described this classroom scene: 
During Wednesday's class, students practiced saying "good morning," "good afternoon" and "good evening" aloud as Jiang held flashcards depicting different times of day.
"Now let's see if you can write some Chinese," Jiang said after the flashcard exercise. "This is a little difficult, but I think you can do it."
On the board, Jiang wrote the characters for "good evening," pronounced "wan shang hao."
Second-grader Immanuel Hawkins volunteered for the task, writing his characters underneath Jiang's and beaming when she congratulated him in Mandarin.
The Confucius Institutes, organized and financed by the Chinese government, are now located in about 70 colleges and universities in the United States, and there are a couple hundred more worldwide. Part of Beijing's soft power efforts abroad, the institutes are often welcomed by host schools as ready-made Chinese-language departments. 
The first institute was set up at the University of Maryland, in 2004, and the program there has had "no interference and no pressure at all" from the Beijing government or the sponsoring school, Nankai University, according to the program director, Chuan Sheng Liu, a physics professor at Maryland. 
My colleague D.D. Guttenplan reported in March on the controversy that sometimes surrounds the government-run Confucius Institutes:
To proponents, the institutes offer a chance for greater engagement with one of the oldest civilizations in the world - and the fastest-rising power of the new millennium. For cash-strapped university administrators, the institutes can seem like a godsend, bringing not just Beijing-trained and -financed language teachers and textbooks but also money for a director's salary and a program of public events. 
"When you set up a Confucius Institute you get a ready-made partner," said Nick Byrne, executive director of the Confucius Institute at the London School of Economics, which is paired with Tsinghua University in Beijing. Tsinghua sends Chinese language teachers to London; the institute also funds a number of scholarships at Tsinghua for British graduate students. 
Critics worry that such largess comes with strings attached. 
"There is a whole list of proscribed topics," said June Teufel Dreyer, who teaches Chinese government and foreign policy at the University of Miami. "You're told not to discuss the Dalai Lama - or to invite the Dalai Lama to campus. Tibet, Taiwan, China's military buildup, factional fights inside the Chinese leadership - these are all off limits."
In a 2010 story in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Ms. Dreyer said the institutes "perform a propaganda function."
"It would be stupid," she said, "for the Chinese government to spend money on something that did not further its interests."

HEADLINE: In the Caribbean Coral Die-Off, Myriad Wrinkles

BYLINE: EMMA BRYCE


HIGHLIGHT: The causes are many, from overfishing to the warming of the seas, and damage is far more dire in some places than others. 

 BODY:
At its ongoing conference in South Korea, the International Union for Conservation of Nature released a report on Friday indicating that live coral coverage on reefs in the Caribbean has plummeted from nearly 50 percent in the 1970s to less than 10 percent today. Yet describing the entire Caribbean as a region where reefs are in a state of general collapse tends to cloud the problem's complexity, the study suggests.
Michael Lesser, a program director for biological oceanography at the National Science Foundation, acknowledges that the region is the "poster child" for the global destruction of reefs. "The pronouncement that the Caribbean itself would be in dire straits is no surprise - we've been talking about this for a long time now," he said. 
Overfishing has left its mark, as has the decline of species like the parrotfish and the spiny black urchin known as Diadema antillarum, which graze on algae and ideally keep it from stifling the reefs. Ocean warming and acidification add more pressure, bleaching and weakening coral networks. "It's a sort of double whammy," Dr. Lesser said. 
But the conservation group's report shows that the destruction is not spread uniformly. Spots like the Cayman Islands have up to three times more live cover than afflicted reefs in Jamaica and in the United States Virgin Islands, which also have noticeably smaller fish and an abundance of algae. There is also uncertainty about what causes coral decline in certain places, pointing up the need for varying strategies across the Caribbean instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.

Jamaica, for instance, struggles economically and is highly dependent on its marine resources, so overfishing is a primary concern there. Enforcing species protection and establishing minimum size limits for catch would therefore be a crucial strategy there, Dr. Lesser said. 
Regulation of development and agriculture could help stave off a major threat to the United States Virgin Islands, where reefs are affected by land-based pollution and runoff that makes its way to the sea, the report noted. Ultimately, the study suggests that understanding all of the local factors will help tailor approaches for the long run and for the wider Caribbean.
As for a time scale for recovery, "We're talking decades," Dr. Lesser said. Yet hope persists because coral reefs have bounced back in the past - Australia's Great Barrier Reef, for one. 
Inevitably, though, success depends on the resources that countries have at their disposal to protect marine habitats. Given that countries with a low gross domestic product like Belize or Jamaica will have fewer resources to deploy, Dr. Lesser hopes that a greater global pull toward coral conservation can be mobilized. 
To people in places where coral reefs are healthier, he advises: "Look ahead to the Caribbean. It has the possibility of being a road map."

HEADLINE: Christie Talks of a Comeback, but Jobs Data May Say Otherwise

BYLINE: MICHAEL POWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Gotham Extra: Gov. Chris Christie is implying that the unemployment rate is flawed and that critics should focus on job creation. But is New Jersey really in better shape than it looks? 

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has caught a case of the cognitive dissonance blues.
For months he's thumped on about the New Jersey comeback and the jobs he's created. And we noisome critics keep pointing to the state's unemployment rate, which has remained stubbornly high. The state now ranks fourth in the nation in unemployment. 
 So the governor, fresh from his me-me-glorious-me keynote address at the Republican National Convention, has taken a new tack, implying that the unemployment rate is flawed and that critics should focus on job creation.
 "I get so weary of the press's desire to keep writing negative stories," Mr. Christie said to New Jersey reporters the other day. "The numbers of jobs we create has nothing to do with the unemployment rate."
 This is a familiar theme. New York City officials complain a lot of late that the city's 10 percent unemployment rate overstates its problems. Several experts believe they have a point - the Fiscal Policy Institute issued a report last week noting that the city's real unemployment rate is most likely closer to 9 percent than to the official 10 percent. (A 9 percent rate is still higher than that of the nation as a whole. And the Bronx, with about a 13 percent rate, is the hardest hit county in the state).
 I asked James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, if the same could be said of New Jersey. Is the Garden State perhaps in better shape than it looks?
 Not really, he says.
 Since the national recession began, he noted, New Jersey has a 4.5 percent net job loss while the United States's loss stands at 3.4 percent. New York State, by contrast, has gained 0.3 percent.
 New Jersey too has lost more construction, finance, manufacturing and professional service jobs than the nation as a whole. And, more to the point, if there's a disconnect between job creation and state unemployment rates, it has occurred during the past two years.
 During that time period, the United States and New York State experienced job gains of 2.5 percent and 2.8 percent respectively. But New Jersey's job gain during the same period stands at 1.1 percent.
 "It is plausible," Mr. Parrott noted, "that New Jersey does really have a high unemployment rate."
 Governor Christie, too, may have added to his headaches. He tends to talk of public workers as so many anchors on the state's economy. Cut away enough of them, and the state economy eventually will set sail.
 There's remarkably little evidence for his assertion. The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal policy center in Washington, D.C., last week noted that, nationwide, the public sector has cut 680,000 jobs in the past four years, which is akin to a starving man insisting on going on a diet.
 Few Northeast governors embraced this less-is-more strategy with more gusto than Mr. Christie. Governments in New Jersey have cut jobs by 4.1 percent during the recession, compared with a 2-percent decline for the United States. (Not all of these are state cuts, of course. But Mr. Christie certainly rejected anything that looks like fiscal pump priming, as he declined billions of dollars in federal transportation money to build a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River, a project that would have created thousands of well-paid union jobs).
 Finally, what about those private-sector jobs that the governor talks about so much? It's true that New Jersey has added jobs in 9 of the last 11 months. It's also true that federal data shows the majority of those jobs offer low wages, and come without benefits. 
 And private-sector job growth ground to a halt last month: New Jersey, The Record newspaper noted, lost 7,100 private-sector jobs and 4,900 public-sector jobs in July as the nation saw an increase of 163,000 jobs.
 Mr. Christie rapped the New Jersey press corps, saying they were rooting for negativity. The record would indicate they were more likely looking at reality.

HEADLINE: A 1973 Hostage Situation, Revisited

BYLINE: EMILY S. RUEB


HIGHLIGHT: Retro City: A 47-hour-long hostage situation at a sporting goods store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is still one of the longest in the city's history and a turning point in police practices for handling similar situations. 

 BODY:
"We know some of you are hurt. We want to help you," boomed a bullhorn on top of an armored police vehicle. "Please come out with your hands on your heads and you will be treated. There is no place for you to go. The building, the block and the entire area is surrounded."
It was the winter of 1973 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and four men in their 20s who had vowed to fight to the death were holding about a dozen hostages inside John and Al's, a sporting goods store on a busy commercial block of Broadway. The siege would last 47 hours, one of the longest such dramas in the city's history, and mark a turning point in the New York Police Department's approach to hostage situations. 
Instead of brute force, the police used psychology, firearm discipline and patience to end the siege, techniques that would be codified in the department's hostage-negotiating training program, begun later that year.
The police arrived at about 6 p.m. on Jan. 19, a Friday, foiling an attempted robbery of the store by four Sunni Muslims seeking guns, rifles, pistols and ammunition for "a holy crusade." A three-hour shootout ensued. Gunfire crackled and boomed in the evening air.
Several officers on the scene were pinned down behind cars and elevated track pillars as shotgun blasts and gunfire raged. Stephen R. Gilroy, 29, an officer who had been behind an elevated train pillar wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the head and killed on the scene. Two other officers were wounded, as was one of the gunmen inside the store. 
Dozens of pedestrians were trapped in nearby restaurants and shops on the thoroughfare near the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.
After the initial gun battle, the police did not fire another bullet.
A Muslim minister was one of several religious leaders who tried to establish a dialogue with the kidnappers, who had ripped out all the phone lines in the store.
"If you want us to leave as Muslims, to go home, fire three shots," he said from the tank's bullhorn.
Three shots were fired in rapid succession.
Scores of police personnel, psychologists and firearms experts agonized over the next steps as the standoff continued.
Hundreds of onlookers lined the sidewalks. Residents in nearby apartment buildings were trapped indoors for the weekend.
By the next afternoon, two hostages had been released and a third was let go in exchange for a doctor bringing medical supplies to treat the injured gunman. 
Dr. Thomas W. Matthew (left in photo above), an activist and head of the National Economic Growth and Reconstruction Organization, was accompanied by a nurse into the store. They collected a bullhorn and a walkie-talkie from the glass-strewed pavement; the gunmen would later use them to order sandwiches and cigarettes.
Over the course of several trips, Dr. Matthew also established a phone line.
At about 1 p.m. on Sunday, the third day, 43 hours after the siege began, the nine remaining hostages were left unattended by the gunmen when they heard footsteps in the adjacent furniture store. 
Led by a store manager, Jerry Riccio, the seven men and two women tore through half-inch plasterboard to get to a hidden staircase that led to the roof. There, they appeared, one by one, to the surprise of the police officers standing guard.
The gunmen had lost their leverage, but not their stockpile of weapons and ammunition. And for several tense hours, it was unclear if they would fight to the death, as they had vowed to do. 
Relatives of the gunmen tried to talk them into peacefully surrendering.
Later that afternoon, at about 4:45 p.m., one of the haggard gunmen appeared with his hands over his head. The others gave in shortly after.
A train on the elevated BMT line rumbled past for the first time since the ordeal had begun.
The gunmen, who were identified as Salih Ali Abdullah, Shulab Abdula Raheem and Dawd A. Rahman, were escorted to the 90th Precinct station house on Union Avenue. The fourth gunman, Yusef Abdullah Almussudig, who was suffering from a gunshot wound to the abdomen, was taken to Kings County Hospital.
In 1974, the men were tried in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. A a jury found them guilty of 41 counts, including murder, kidnapping and robbery.
 In an installment of "Taking Questions," Frank A. Bolz Jr., a retired New York City Police Department detective captain who helped create the department's hostage-negotiating team and guidelines, answered reader questions about hostage negotiation.

Treasury to Cut A.I.G. Stake Below 50% | The Treasury Department said on Sunday that it was planning its biggest sale of shares in the American International Group to date, making the federal government a minority shareholder in the bailed-out insurer for the first time since it took control of the company four years ago.
With the sale of at least $18 billion worth of shares in A.I.G., a number that could grow to $20.7 billion if investors prove enthusiastic, the Treasury Department could reduce its holdings to as little as 15 percent from 53 percent.
Taking the government's stake in A.I.G. below 50 percent is the realization of a long-held goal by both the Obama administration and the company, helping to cut ties to one of the most controversial bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis.

The announcement comes as Robert W. Dudley, chief executive of BP, is raising money to pay cleanup costs and potential fines resulting from a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.
He is also trying to use the divestitures to slim down the company and focus more on what he thinks it does best: high-risk, high-return frontier exploration and production, including deepwater fields. The British company has said it is in talks to sell its 50 percent stake in its Russian joint venture, TNK-BP. A sale of older, smaller assets in the Gulf of Mexico would be in keeping with this effort to sell mature fields. DealBook » |

HEADLINE: Why Facebook Is Paying the Tax Tab on Employee Compensation

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: Facebook's restricted stock program was a clever solution to the problem of keeping the company private under securities laws, but it left its employees with a tax problem. 

 BODY:
Facebook announced last week that it planned to use cash to pay off a $1.9 billion tax bill related to restricted stock units that Facebook had granted to employees over the years. It's odd timing for a tax bill. Why would Facebook, not the employees, owe tax on compensation income? 
The short answer is that Facebook isn't really paying tax. It's just remitting the tax on behalf of the employees. 
Restricted stock units are a form of equity compensation similar to restricted stock. Instead of giving the employees stock, Facebook made a contractually binding promise to give them shares later, after the I.P.O. Facebook is now "net settling" the restricted stock units by withholding the amount of tax due at an estimated combined federal and state tax rate of 45 percent. Still, because the Internal Revenue Service doesn't accept payment in stock certificates, Facebook has to come up with almost $2 billion in cash. Paying the I.R.S. in cash, instead of selling new shares, allows Facebook to reduce the number of fully diluted shares on its financial statements. In turn, this might buck up its sagging stock price, much like a stock buyback would. 
 The colossal tax bill can be traced back to Mark Zuckerberg's desire to keep Facebook from becoming a public company. If Facebook had issued traditional restricted stock, the employees' tax bill would have been smaller, and it would have been paid a long time ago. But Facebook would have been forced to go public earlier.
Restricted stock became popular in Silicon Valley after an accounting change in 2004 required companies to treat stock options as a compensation expense. To keep accounting income looking healthy, some companies began issuing restricted stock, which minimizes share dilution and spreads the compensation expense over the vesting period of the stock. Restricted stock gives employees the economic incentives of a stockholder, but employees cannot sell the stock until they meet years of service requirements or performance hurdles.
Restricted stock also gives employees a great tax advantage. When employees receive restricted stock, they may choose to take the current value of the stock into income by making a special "section 83(b)" tax election. Accelerating ordinary income with an 83(b) election can be risky, as there is no guarantee that the stock will appreciate in value, and it is generally preferable to defer paying taxes as long as possible. Indeed, executives of public company often do not make the election. But for employees of start-ups, the election is routine for one simple reason: any appreciation in the stock is taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate of 15 percent. 
To illustrate, suppose Max, a hotshot software engineer, received 100,000 restricted shares of Facebook stock at $1 per share in 2007. Thinking ahead, he made an 83(b) election and recognized $100,000 of taxable income immediately. Accelerating taxable income is usually a bad idea, but this is the exception to the rule. When Max sells those shares at $20 a share in 2012, the appreciation would be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 15 percent. He would walk away with $1.67 million ($2 million minus $45,000 tax paid in 2008 and $285,000 tax paid in 2012).
The problem with restricted stock was that Facebook wanted to delay becoming a public company. Under the securities rules in force at the time, if Facebook had 500 or more shareholders, including all those software engineers,it would been forced to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's disclosure requirementsfor public companies even before it conducted an I.P.O.
 Facebook instead issued restricted stock units, which give employees the economics of an equity interest in the company without the actual shares. The restricted stock units contained both a vesting restriction and a liquidity restriction, meaning that the actual shares would not be issued until a liquidity event occurred, like an I.P.O. or getting acquired by a public company. An S.E.C, No-Action letter allowed Facebook to issue restricted stock units without counting the recipients as shareholders for purposes of the 500 shareholder rule. 
The restricted stock units plan was a clever workaround of the securities laws, but it left the Facebook employees with a tax problem. Because the restricted stock units are not "property" for tax purposes - merely a promise to pay shares later - the employees could not make an 83(b) election to get capital gains treatment on any appreciation. So Max, our hypothetical software engineer, will actually receive $1.1 million - $2 million less $900,000 in taxes - or about half a million less than if he had received restricted stock and made the 83(b) election. 
This adverse tax treatment might create a sense of inequity among Facebook employees. Founders pay tax at capital gains rates, while employees, subject to the same market risk on their equity compensation, pay tax at ordinary income rates. On the other hand, it's possible that savvy software engineers negotiated pay on an after-tax basis; perhaps Facebook had to grant more restricted stock units to reflect the greater tax hit to the employees.
Indeed, Facebook probably should have granted more restricted stock units, as it gets the benefit of a much larger tax deduction than if it had issued restricted stock. Facebook will take a tax deduction equal to the amount that the employees take into income - in this case, almost $2 billion. At Facebook's 35 percent tax rate, that deduction is worth about $700 million. 
The interesting question is whether restricted stock units confuse investors. Because the restricted stock units create an issuance of shares only after a liquidity event - in this case, six months after the I.P.O. - Facebook will suddenly recognize a huge share-based compensation expense on its income statement. 
This strikes me as an odd result from an accounting perspective; it's as if Facebook were paying compensation for all its employees' work now, as opposed to spreading the expense over time. Facebook's best hope is that as a one-time expense, investors will shrug off the restricted stock units and focus on how the actual business is doing. Facebook's chief financial officer has enough to worry about.

Knoll, "The Section 83(b) Election for Restricted Stock: A Joint Tax Perspective," 59 SMU Law Review 721 (2006).

HEADLINE: Treasury's A.I.G. Stock Sale Is Priced at $32.50

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Treasury Department priced its massive offering of shares in the American International Group at $32.50 each on Monday, as the government pared its stake in the bailed-out insurer below 50 percent. 

 BODY:
9:25 p.m. | Updated 
As the government looks to pare back its stake in the American International Group, the Treasury Department priced a large offering in the bailed-out insurer at $32.50 a share on Monday, the Treasury said Monday evening. 
At $32.50 a share, the offering is below A.I.G.'s Monday closing price of $33.30, since banks running stock sales normally include a discount to entice investors to buy. Even at that level, the price remains above the $28.73 that Treasury has identified as the break-even for its investment in the insurer. The Treasury said Monday that it had agreed to sell 553,846,153 shares in the offering.
With the sale, the Treasury Department and A.I.G. realized a long-held goal of reducing the government to a minority ownership position, helping hasten an end to one of the most contentious bailouts of the financial crisis. The Obama administration announced on Sunday that it planned to sell at least $18 billion worth of shares, and potentially up to $20.7 billion. On Monday, the sale was set at $18 billion. The sale represents a separate milestone in the bailout of A.I.G., as the $182 billion used to rescue the insurer during the financial crisis is now fully recovered, the Treasury said in a statement. 
 "Taking action to stabilize A.I.G. during the financial crisis was something the government should never have had to do, but we had no better option at the time to protect the American economy from the damage that would have been caused by the company's collapse," Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said in the statement. "To stabilize and then restructure the company with a very substantial positive gain for the American taxpayer is a significant accomplishment, but we need to continue the critical task of implementing Wall Street reform so that the American economy is never put in this position again."
Shares in A.I.G. fell 2 percent on Monday, as existing investors fretted over the enormous slug of stock that would hit the markets.

Dr. Jeff Cornwall questions your intestinal fortitude: "Having guts to be an entrepreneur does not imply that you take careless risks - quite the contrary. Having guts to be an entrepreneur means that you are ready through experience to carefully and prudently manage and mitigate the risks that lie ahead."
Roger Altman explains why he thinks the economy may surprise us all: "The U.S. has made a huge leap in industrial competitiveness. Unit production costs are down 11 per cent over the past 10 years, while costs have risen in almost every other advanced nation. The differences in labor costs compared with China are narrowing. Consider the automotive sector. In 2005, Detroit's hourly labor costs were 40-percent higher than at U.S. plants owned by foreign car makers, according to research by Evercore Partners. Today these costs are virtually identical and the Big Three car makers have regained market share. Furthermore, personal savings rates are up to 4 per cent - from near zero before the crisis - and are expected to stabilize. This will spur higher levels of private investment and even further productivity gains."

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Matt Bai on Ohio's Comeback

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of the cover article answers questions about who deserves credit for Ohio's recovery. 

 BODY:
Ohio, to claim credit for the state's economic uptick. Bai is a staff writer and chief political correspondent for the magazine; his most recent articles were about the former senator Bob Kerrey, the debt deal crisis, the former weapons inspector Scott Ritter, Tea Party politics in South Carolina and Newt Gingrich.
Why Ohio? Did you consider other swing states that are also doing marginally better?
I did. In particular, I also considered Florida, which is in a similar situation and is, of course, also crucial to the election. The reasons for choosing Ohio were somewhat personal. First, I really love the state and did two very long pieces from there in 2004, so I liked the idea of returning eight years later. Some people like Vegas or Key Biscayne. I like Ohio. The state has every kind of American community. Columbus is one of my favorite cities. Florida's a tougher state to traverse, and it really encompasses several ministates, so in some ways I feel like what happens in Florida is harder to apply to the rest of the country. Also, I knew Governor Kasich from interviewing him for that previous piece and knew he'd be a really engaging character for the piece.
To determine whether the president or the governor is more responsible for improvements in Ohio, couldn't one look at another state that received similar federal funding over the same period but that has a Democratic governor?
It's tempting to compare states that way, but it's also perilous. For instance, Ohio is deeply affected by the auto bailout in a way that, say, Minnesota is not. Governor Kasich makes the same case you're making - that if his state is doing so much better than others that it must be his policies, and not the president's, that are responsible. But then, as Secretary Geithner points out in the piece, most states, including Ohio, have been following the same basic trajectory since 2010. So you can use comparisons with other states to support either case.
Were you surprised that Obama and his aides didn't want to make the case for what they'd done in Ohio and passed you on to Geithner instead?
I was surprised, and I was disheartened on our readers' behalf. You always hear the president's people say that we in the media only care about polls and process. Here was a case where we were writing about the most substantive and central issue in the campaign, and all I really wanted was for the president (or vice president) to make the case that their policies had worked in a very concrete way. That they wouldn't makes me wonder if they really believe they can win a debate on their record.
Did anything surprise during your time in Ohio?
I'm always surprised by what I find reporting. Here I sort of assumed that what most people told me was true - that Mitt Romney was off-key in Ohio because he was the only guy out there saying the economy was still awful. But after traveling around I reached a different conclusion - that in fact Romney was reflecting reality as it appears to a lot of Ohioans, and maybe even most. And it's Kasich and Obama who seem a little off-key if you live in a place like Mansfield.
Obama is saying if it weren't for his policies, things would be even worse. Romney is saying things are still bad. Even if Obama has facts on his side, is his the harder argument to make?
It's a harder argument to make, but not that much harder, in my view. This is a hard-hit, industrial state that voted for the president last time around - there's no reason to think he won't get a careful hearing. The question is whether Obama has enough faith in voters and his own record to make that argument, or whether his team would rather just attack Romney and rally the base and gin up turnout. Which could also work, I suppose.
If small economic improvements have been made, but Ohioans are still feeling poorer than they were before Obama, do improvements really matter all that much when it comes to the presidential race?
It's a good question, of the tree-in-the-forest variety, I guess the data can be used to persuade people that things really are moving in the right direction, even if they don't feel it just yet. But I'm not sure either party feels much like persuading anyone anymore. They prefer to talk to the people who already are with them.

HEADLINE: What Romney Could Learn From the N.F.L.

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Heavily regulated and thriving, the National Football League offers lessons as well as excitement, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
In a recent speech, Mitt Romney likened the election to a football game. I wonder if he has considered the merits of the National Football League's regulatory regime.
I became an N.F.L. fan after reading the management expert Roger Martin's "Fixing the Game," which explains how the league has discouraged player involvement in gambling and improved competitiveness.
All business leaders, not just the one who wants to be chief executive of the "American company" should take notice.
Plenty of management gurus have renounced the principle of maximizing shareholder value, asserting that it leads to excess emphasis on short-term profits at the expense of long-run performance. 
Professor Martin makes the point particularly vividly, observing that the way we currently reward corporate C.E.O.'s is roughly equivalent to rewarding football teams for exceeding expectations rather than winning games. 
Consider the New England Patriots, who were unbeaten in the 2007 season but offered gamblers little payoff, because they seldom won by more than predicted (gambling on football usually involves a "point spread," the expected margin of victory; to determine the outcome of the bet, that number of points is added to the points scored by the underdog).
Professor Martin sees an analogy with companies like Microsoft, which reported steady increases in revenue between 2000 and 2010 but saw its share price stagnate because it was unable to surpass expectations of what its earnings would be.
Rewarding football teams for beating the point spread would give players perverse incentives to manipulate expectations rather than to win games. That's one reason why the N.F.L. enforces strict rules against player gambling.
By contrast, corporate pay practices that give managers short-term stock options encourage them to gamble. The easiest way for them to win big is to beat the market's expectations, rather than to deliver steady performance.
Professor Martin draws other lessons from the N.F.L., which takes particularly effective measures to ensure team competition and - as a result - creates more suspense and excitement for fans.
Hard ceilings (known as caps) on the amount of money each team is allowed to spend on player contracts make it hard for rich teams to buy their way to success. Strict revenue-sharing from national television contracts acts like a progressive tax, giving each team an equal share regardless of their market size and local broadcast audience, enabling teams in relatively small cities including Green Bay, Wis., (population about 105,000) to be competitive.
Other professional sports have similar but sometimes weaker measures. In Major League Baseball, the disparity between the rich and the not-so-rich is particularly great. The New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Red Sox spend more than three times as much on players as some competitors. As the Red Sox and Phillies have demonstrated this season, money doesn't always buy success, though in the long run, it strongly influences outcomes.
Professional sports associations often adjust game rules to help balance offense and defense. They realize that competitive teams, like small businesses, need good rules and tough referees to guarantee fair play. They also realize that the well-being of individual teams depends, in large measure, on the success of the league as a whole.
The NFL's regulations, in particular, have contributed to professional football's success. Professor Martin notes that the average nationally broadcast regular-season N.F.L. game attracts more television viewers than baseball's World Series games. The collective value of N.F.L. teams is considerably higher than those of any other league, although the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers rank among the most valuable sports teams, according to Forbes.
Many Republicans are football fans. They tend to oppose government regulation almost on principle; how they feel about industries' self-regulation -- and whether it has ever worked in finance, banking or accounting -- is less clear. Mitt Romney favors a rollback of rules governing financial reform and environmental protection.
Democrats generally favor stricter rules. Maybe President Obama, known for liking basketball and golf, should call the N.F.L. to his side.

HEADLINE: How the iPhone 5 Could Bolster the G.D.P.

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Economists at JPMorgan Chase estimated that the coming release of the iPhone 5 could add one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point to the annualized growth rate of gross domestic product next quarter. 

 BODY:
11:54 a.m. | Updated with additional comments from Mr. Feroli and link to article about Apple competitors who might be hurt by the release. Forget QE3. Maybe the way to stimulate the economy is to force Apple to release more new iPhone models.
O.K., that's not exactly right. But Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and estimated that the upcoming release of what is expected to be the iPhone 5 could add one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point to the annualized growth rate of America's gross domestic product next quarter.
From the note he sent to clients today:
Our equity analysts believe around 8 million iPhone 5's will be sold in the US in Q4, even while sales of previous generation iPhones are maintained at a solid pace. While we have no idea how much these will retail for, if it is similar to previous launches it would be around $600. Likewise, if the imported cost component is similar to previous leading generation phones it would imply around a $200 per phone addition to imports (which is a subtraction from GDP). The difference between these two figures, $400, would represent the trade margins, which figure into GDP. Thus, calculated using the so-called retail control method, sales of iPhone 5 could boost Q4 GDP by $3.2 billion, or $12.8 billion at an annual rate. This would boost annualized GDP growth in Q4 by 0.33%-point. If hedonically adjusted constant quality prices of phones declined due to newer or better features -- a reasonable conjecture -- then the lift would be even greater, though past iPhone releases don't bear a visible impact on the relevant CPI components. The third of a percentage point lift would limit the downside risk to our Q4 GDP growth projection, which remains 2.0%.
This estimate seems fairly large, and for that reason should be treated skeptically. However, we think the recent evidence is consistent with this projection. The last iPhone launch was at a similar time last year. In October of last year, when the iPhone 4S first became widely available, overall retail sales that month significantly outperformed expectations. Essentially all iPhone sales occur either on-line or in retail stores. Over half of the 0.8% increase in core retail sales last October occurred in two categories: on-line sales and computer and software sales, which combined had their largest monthly increase on record. The incremental growth of Q4 sales at those stores over Q3, if due to the iPhone, would have added between 0.1% to 0.2%-point to Q4 growth, after subtracting the import drag. Given the iPhone 5 launch is expected to be much larger, we think the estimate mentioned in the first paragraph is reasonable.
 By the way, from what I can tell, the analysis seems to assume that there's no competitive effect -- that is, that the people buying the new iPhone 5 would not have otherwise bought an Android or another phone already on the market. Another analyst at JPMorgan has noted that some of the other smartphone makers will indeed take a hit, as might Windows-based PC makers. 
Update: I passed along some reader questions about the math here to Mr. Feroli, and he responds:
I was almost thinking of sending out a follow-up given how confused people are by GDP math...I think de-annualizing GDP is one correct approach to getting the 0.08% (the other is to annualize the $3.2bn). With either approach that gets you to the 0.08% *sequential* GDP growth, which if this were e.g. Europe, we'd be done. In the US, however, the convention is to look at GDP growth *at an annual rate* i.e. to the fourth power, which is how I get 0.33%.

HEADLINE: Does Mitt Romney Deserve Credit for Bin Laden's Death?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Some Ohio Republicans say he does. 

 BODY:
The obvious answer to the question in the headline is no, he doesn't. But Public Policy Polling has a new survey showing that six percent of Ohioans, and 15 percent of Ohio Republicans, think Mitt Romney "deserves more credit" for the killing of Osama bin Laden than Barack Obama.
How can that be? The Times doesn't generally report on PPP surveys, since that company uses automated questionnaires, which we think may distort results. But I doubt methodological problems are at issue here. It's more likely that some Ohio Republicans are simply proving their partisanship. They don't want to praise the president, even implicitly-by acknowledging a historical fact-so instead they choose the obviously incorrect answer to make a point.

In his take on the PPP poll, Dylan Matthews of The Washington Post says that at least some of Romney-got-Bin-Laden respondents are engaging in "psychological trickery," which I assume means the same thing as choosing the incorrect answer to make a point. But he also cites academic studies on partisan bias suggesting that ideology affects voters' perception of reality.
In one 1988 poll, "voters were asked several questions that were politically relevant, but had objective, factual answers," such as did unemployment go up or down under Ronald Reagan? And did inflation get better or worse during his presidency? The answers, respectively, are it went down, and it got better, but Democrats were less likely than Republicans to accept, or at least admit, these facts. (In this area, at least, both sides really are at fault.)

HEADLINE: Romney Pollster Calls Post-Convention Poll Results a 'Sugar High'

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Neil Newhouse, Mitt Romney's pollster, had a message for voters on Monday morning: "Don't get too worked up about the latest polling." 

 BODY:
Neil Newhouse, Mitt Romney's pollster, had a message for voters on Monday morning: "Don't get too worked up about the latest polling."
In a memo released by the campaign, Mr. Newhouse acknowledged that President Obama had emerged with more of a post-convention bump in some polls after two weeks of back-to-back party conventions, but dismissed it as "a sugar high."
"While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly," he wrote. "The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama presidency, and Mitt Romney will win this race." 
The mere existence of the memo seemed to place Team Romney on the defensive, forced to publicly assert that it is still in a position to win on Election Day. But the Romney campaign used the memo to underscore what has been its existing rationale for his candidacy -- the struggling economy, which has not improved as quickly as Mr. Obama and most voters had hoped.
"The key numbers in this election are the 43 straight months of 8 percent or higher unemployment, the 23 million Americans struggling to find work, and the 47 million Americans who are on food stamps," Mr. Newhouse wrote, citing the disappointing jobs report that came out on Friday. "Americans are not better off than we were four years ago, and that is why President Obama has struggled in this race."
In the memo, the campaign also pointed to the expanding map of swing states, as well as its post-convention cash advantage, as reasons why it expects to win in November.

HEADLINE: No, Nicki Minaj Did Not Endorse Mitt Romney

BYLINE: DAVE ITZKOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Nicki Minaj confirms on Twitter that she did not really endorse Mitt Romney in a song. In other news, there is no evidence that Johnny Cash ever shot a man in Reno just to watch him die. 

 BODY:
Ha! Thank you for understanding my creative humor & sarcasm Mr. President, the smart ones always do... *sends love & support* @BarackObama
- Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ)10 Sep 12
Lest there be any lingering confusion: sometimes performers say things in the context of their work that they do not mean literally - political endorsements included.
Following a convention week in which Mitt Romney learned that celebrity testimonials were not all they are cracked up to be - just ask Clint Eastwood and his chair - the Republican presidential nominee received an unexpected shout-out from the hip-hop musician Nicki Minaj.
In a guest appearance on the track "Mercy," from the Lil Wayne mixtape "Dedication 4," Ms. Minaj, an artist known for her garishly imaginative outfits and a range of cartoonish voices to rival Mel Blanc's, rapped, "I'm a Republican, voting for Mitt Romney." She then completed the verse by rhyming it with a vulgar line about "lazy" people who were wreaking havoc on the economy.
While nothing about Ms. Minaj's music is as simple as it may seem, some listeners took "Mercy" (which started appearing online around Sept. 3) at face value. Music Web sites like rapdose.com reported on the lyric with headlines that read "Nicki Minaj Endorses Mitt Romney," while the gossip blog Gawker hedged its bets, asking readers, "Did Nicki Minaj Really Endorse Mitt Romney?"
However, there were clues in the song that Ms. Minaj was not describing a factual set of circumstances. For example, in the very next line of the song, she raps: "Out in Miami I be chillin' with a zombie."
There would also seem to be a general rule that applies to pop songs and other works of performance, under which artists are allowed to adopt fictional personae in the service of evoking an audience's emotions. (To date, there is no evidence that Johnny Cash ever shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.)
President Obama appeared to suggest as much in an interview with the Orlando, Fla., radio station Power 95.3. Asked whether he thought Ms. Minaj's lyric was an authentic endorsement of his rival, Mr. Obama said: "I'm not sure that's actually what happened. I think she had a song on there, that - a little rap that said that. But she likes to play different characters."
Ms. Minaj gave credence to the president's interpretation of the song on Monday, writing in a post on her Twitter account: "Ha! Thank you for understanding my creative humor & sarcasm Mr. President, the smart ones always do..."

HEADLINE: Ryan Says He Stands With Emanuel on Chicago Teachers' Strike

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: By praising Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Paul Ryan sought to put President Obama on the spot. 

 BODY:
There may be no stranger bedfellows than Representative Paul D. Ryan and Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, the former White House chief of staff, but on Monday Mr. Ryan declared his support of Mr. Emanuel in the Chicago teachers' strike.
"We know that Rahm is not going to support our campaign, but on this issue and this day we stand with Mayor Rahm Emanuel,'' Mr. Ryan said.
Mr. Emanuel and the teachers' union are at loggerheads primarily over a new evaluation system tied to student test scores and whether laid-off teachers should have priority to fill future job openings.
Education has been only a side issue in the presidential race, partly because many reforms pushed by the Obama administration are ideas that Republicans long championed. The teacher evaluation system at the heart of the Chicago strike was introduced through President Obama's Race to the Top initiative. 
Mr. Ryan's praise of Mr. Emanuel was double-edged: he sought to put Mr. Obama on the spot and declare whose side he is on. The White House tried to remain neutral in its statements today. "We hope that both sides are able to come together to settle this quickly and in the best interest of Chicago's students," Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said on Monday.
"This does not have to divide the two parties,'' Mr. Ryan said at a fund-raising event in Portland, Ore., according to a pool report. "And so we were going to ask, where does President Obama stand? Does he stand with his former chief of staff, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, with the children and the parents, or does he stand with the union?''
Mitt Romney also issued a statement condemning the Chicago Teachers Union and accusing the Obama administration of being beholden to unions at the expense of children.
Although teachers' unions are traditionally strong supporters of Democrats, the Obama administration has strained that relationship at times. Arne Duncan, the education secretary, used to run the Chicago schools and clashed with the union.
Mr. Romney often speaks generally of putting "kids and their parents first" and "the teachers' union behind.'' Mr. Ryan, who has not spoken out about K-12 education issues since he joined the Republican ticket, echoed that idea.
"In a Romney-Ryan administration we will not be ambiguous, we will stand with education reform, we will champion bipartisan education reforms,'' Mr. Ryan said.
In Mr. Romney's major public school initiative to date, he proposed a voucherlike system to replace $25 billion in federal education aid now distributed to school systems for disabled and economically disadvantaged students. Mr. Romney argued that it would give parents more choice of schools and that schools would compete, raising standards.
The proposal, which reverses a decades-long trend to give the federal government a central role in assuring equality of access to public education, goes further than any previous initiative with bipartisan support.

HEADLINE: Plot Twist in the A.I.G. Bailout: It Actually Worked

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: As distasteful as the effort was, it should be clear by now that the rescue of the American International Group - often called a backdoor bailout of Wall Street - was a success. 

 BODY:
"Some people just don't like movies with happy endings."
That's what the White House said about Neil Barofsky, then the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, when he complained two years ago that the Treasury Department was fudging its math about its investment in the American International Group.
At the time, the Treasury Department said that it was likely to lose only about $5 billion on the bailout. Mr. Barofsky declared that the number was "manipulated" as part of a "publicity campaign touting the positive aspects of TARP" ahead of the midterm elections.
Fast forward to this week. The Treasury Department announced it planned to sell $18 billion of its A.I.G. stake, putting it on a path to actually turn a profit. It was a remarkable feat and one that nobody - including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner - anticipated four years ago at the peak of the crisis during the $180 billion bailout of the company.
Critics of the A.I.G. bailout - it was the most loathed of the rescues and a centerpiece of the Occupy Wall Street movement - had insisted it was going to be a huge black hole.
Given the latest news, I called Mr. Barofsky to see if he had any regrets about his earlier pronouncements now that the rescue of A.I.G. appeared profitable.
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! They are not making money!" Mr. Barofsky, now a senior fellow at New York University School of Law, said when I reached him. "They are on the path to very significant losses!"
What?
Mr. Barofsky, who recently wrote a scathing book about the Treasury Department called "Bailout," refused to admit defeat, saying, "I was right then and I am right now."
He said that the government is "really engaged in half-truths and creative accounting." After that assertion, he quickly followed up with, "Is the timing keyed to the election?"
Mr. Barofsky continues to claim the Treasury Department is playing fast and loose with how it calculates profitability. The Treasury says its break-even cost for A.I.G. shares is $28.73, so that any sale of shares at a higher price - the government is selling its A.I.G. shares for $32.50 - means it stands to make a profit.
Mr. Barofsky says that calculation is "absurd." He says the real break-even price for TARP is $43.53 a share. But Mr. Barofsky - and other critics of the bailout that have sought to portray the rescue effort as a money-losing failure - may be engaged in half-truths and creative accounting of their own.
Mr. Barofsky is focusing on how much the government paid through the TARP program for A.I.G. shares, not how much the taxpayer will ultimately make - including through a separate investment made by the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Barofsky is technically correct that if you isolate the original cost to TARP for its investment in A.I.G., $43.53 a share is the break-even number.
But that conveniently excludes the huge stake that the Federal Reserve received in exchange for its original $85 billion rescue in September 2008. The Federal Reserve's stake was later rolled into the Treasury's stake through a series of complicated transactions.
If you include the TARP stake and the Federal Reserve stake, the break-even sale price for A.I.G. shares is the $28.73 that the Treasury has proclaimed.
And that's the number that taxpayers should care about.
Mr. Barofsky, however, told me that "it's just not accurate" for me or anyone else to accept Treasury's view of profitability because "they mixed the pot."
He explained: "The Fed's cost basis is zero and they essentially gifted the shares to Treasury," adding that the government should disclose its math. "It's a question of transparency."
When Mr. Barofsky first raised this issue in 2010, the White House, in a rare rebuke of an inspector general, said he had "sought to generate a false controversy over A.I.G. to try and grab a few, cheap headlines."
As we approach the four-year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rescue of A.I.G. next week, sadly, much of the public - and people like Mr. Barofsky, as well-intentioned as he is - are still criticizing and debating the merits of the bailout. It's almost become a cottage industry.
In his book, Mr. Barofsky wrote, "Treasury's desperate attempt to bail out Wall Street was setting the country up for potentially catastrophic losses."
As distasteful as the rescue effort was, it should be clear by now that without it, we faced an economic Armageddon. And the results thus far of bailing out the big banks, and A.I.G., indicate a profit.
The Government Accountability Office, which is not swayed by politics, estimated in May that taxpayers will receive a profit of about $15 billion from the A.I.G. bailout. That includes the profit the Fed had already made as part of the broader rescue. There may still be parts of the bailouts to debate: how they were executed, whether they were as effective as they could have been and, perhaps, whether taxpayers should have received an even bigger return for their investments given the risk.
But on the whole, the rescue of A.I.G. - often called a backdoor bailout of Wall Street - should be considered a success.
Toward the end of my phone call, Mr. Barofsky said it himself: "The government had no choice but to bail out A.I.G." Then he added that Treasury's sale of A.I.G. stock "is unambiguously good news for the country."

HEADLINE: The Envelope, Please | Students from Across the Country (and Abroad) Blog Their College Searches

BYLINE: TANYA ABRAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Eight high school seniors &#8212; from Seattle, Kenya, India, Arkansas, Las Vegas, Ohio, New York City, and Kansas &#8212; are sharing videos in a series of first-person blog posts about their college searches. 

 BODY:
Nothing can quite convey the roller coaster of emotions of applying to college - bewilderment, elation, dejection, hope, fear - as powerfully as the voices of the applicants themselves. And so, as in years past, The Choice blog has selected eight high school seniors to tell their stories throughout the new school year as part of the latest installment of a first-person series we call "The Envelope, Please." 
As their predecessors in the series have, they will invite Choice visitors into their college application process through blog posts and videos, beginning today and continuing through May. To give readers time and space to get to know them, we will introduce one writer in the series a day, each morning through Sept. 17. Their submissions will then appear frequently throughout the school year. 
Jacques Steinberg, who edits The Choice, and I are especially excited about this year's group of bloggers because, for the first time, we are featuring two students from around the world. Maimuna Abdi Yussuf, a Somali student, was raised in Kenya and attends African Leadership Academy, a private school in Johannesburg, South Africa. Sush Krishnamoorthy, from New Delhi, attends Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, a private school in India. They are part of a "Choice" class that includes student-bloggers from Topeka; Seattle; Rogers, Ark.; Las Vegas; New York City and Hunting Valley, Ohio.
Like their American peers, our two international bloggers are anxious about applying to colleges and universities in the United States. As they share their college search experiences from afar, they will help us provide a more comprehensive view of this generation's experience of attempting to get ahead in an increasingly global society, one that has been jolted by economic crises.
Each of the eight students showcased in this year's "Envelope" series bring a unique perspective on the college admissions process, and we are grateful for their willingness to share what they are learning about applying to college, in real time, as well as their decision-making and outcomes. 
Each of the bloggers was selected by us from a larger pool assembled through recommendations of college counselors at various public and private high schools. When taken together as a group, they represent prospective applicants to a broad sampling of colleges and universities across the spectrum of higher education: Ivy League institutions, large state universities and small liberal arts colleges, as well as colleges off the beaten path that are closer to home.
Most of this year's student-bloggers - just like those who wrote for The Choice in years past - express grave concerns about the cost of college, so much so that many are citing it as perhaps the most important factor in their decision. It's true for Ms. Krishnamoorthy, who is hoping to find a university that offers sufficient financial aid for international students; it's also true for Thanh-Tran Nguyen, of Seattle, Wash.; Chandler Buckingham in Rogers, Ark.; and Candice Childress, of Las Vegas, whose home state of Nevada was devastated by the economic downturn.
For Leobardo Espinoza Jr., a first-generation college student whose parents never attended high school, applying to college will be more of a mystery. It wasn't until he joined a program called A.V.I.D. - which stands for Advancement Via Individual Determination - that he realized what college actually was. Now, as a senior at Topeka High School, a public school in Kansas, he is hoping to maximize his own academic potential as he tries to find his college fit.
Will Walker, who will begin our series today, says he hasn't a clue about his future plans; his tastes are so diverse that the only certainty, so far, seems to be a need for a liberal arts education.
Two of his peers, their self-identities assured, are hoping that college will help them advance their causes. Ms. Childress, who enjoys "all those wonderful, moth-bitten old grandma things," is hoping to restore the film industry to its former glory. Bryan Stromer, a student with cerebral palsy who attends a public high school in New York City, is hoping to be an advocate for students with disabilities.
We are very much looking forward to watching these students' videos and following their journeys, and we hope you are, too. To start the series, we will feature one student a day, every day, until next week. But please check in often and join the discussion as these students from around the globe make a college list, navigate the application and financial aid processes, find out where they've been accepted, and, finally, make their college choice.
 Other high school seniors and their families are encouraged to share their stories about the college admissions process, using the comment box below.

HEADLINE: British Agencies See Opportunity In the Americas

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to the advertising and media industries, the trans-Atlantic traffic between the United States and Britain has long been robust. Initially, the flow was West to East, but in recent years it has largely trended the other way.
That directional shift is being underlined as two firms based in London set up shop in this country. One, Frank PR, is establishing its American operation, called Frank PR USA, in New York. The other firm, Grace Blue, which specializes in finding senior executives for agencies and media companies, is opening offices in New York and on the West Coast. 
The two newcomers typify a change in the expansion plans of British firms in that both are independently owned rather than units of giant holding companies. Of course, the reason may be just that by now, almost every major firm with British roots and a well-heeled parent is already in the United States.
Whatever the ownership profile of the British arrivals, the start-ups tell a story that has been heard for some time: despite the woes of the American economy, the opportunities arising from a presence in the United States outweigh the risks.
''We're certainly entering in with caution and humility,'' Andrew Bloch, the vice chairman of Frank PR who founded the British firm in 2000 with Graham Goodkind, said during an interview last week in New York. ''Someone once said to me that Madison Avenue is littered with the carcasses of failed U.K. agencies, and those words have rung in my head.''
Still, Mr. Bloch said, ''the U.S. is an incredibly exciting market,'' partly because of its size and partly because ''a lot of our U.K. clients are U.S. companies.''
Jay Haines, chief executive of Grace Blue, which has been conducting executive searches since 2006, echoed Mr. Bloch.
''It is interesting how many people'' from Britain arriving in the United States ''haven't gotten it right,'' Mr. Haines said in a separate interview, also last week in New York.
''They assume because their companies were successful there they would be successful here,'' he added.
Even so, ''we have to be in this part of the world'' because ''there is no more important market,'' Mr. Haines said, and ''more and more of our work is coming out of the United States.''
Mr. Haines, who is 37, said he would move from London to an office in New York -- at 41 East 11th Street, at University Place -- from which he would oversee the firm's operations in North and South America.
''Out of respect to this market, you have to do that,'' Mr. Haines said of his relocation. The West Coast office will probably be in Los Angeles, he added. (Back in London, Juliet Timms, a partner, will oversee operations in Europe and Asia, and Mr. Haines's mother, Gay, formerly of the Kendall Tarrant search firm, continues as chairwoman of the British operation of Grace Blue.)
To help Grace Blue with its expansion, Mr. Haines is hiring Mark Goldstein, a longtime American advertising executive, to serve as nonexecutive chairman for North and South America. Mr. Goldstein, 64, will continue as chief executive of Eleven, a consultant firm he recently started in Naples, Fla.
Asked if Grace Blue was late in entering the crowded American market, Mr. Goldstein quoted a proverb: ''The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is today.''
''There's an interesting way Jay talks about how they look at their business,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''They look for the best possible person, not the best available person.''
Grace Blue will have five or six employees in the New York office in addition to Mr. Haines and at least two on the West Coast.
To start its American outpost, Frank PR -- which also has a field office in Manchester, England, and an office in Sydney, Australia -- has hired an American, Jim Dowd, to be managing director of Frank PR USA. Mr. Dowd, 38, had most recently been senior vice president for global media at the New York office of GolinHarris, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
''The opportunity to work with a British-based company has always been a dream of mine,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''They think more creatively; they take more risks.''
Frank PR USA is starting with several clients, among them AMC Networks, which owns cable channels like AMC and Sundance Channel; the television personalities Bill and Giuliana Rancic; and Trulia, the real estate search Web site.
''Jim and I have the same philosophy about public relations, that you can't control the conversations but you can participate in the conversations,'' said Ken Shuman, head of communications at Trulia. That reflects how Frank PR positions itself as specializing in ''public reactions'' rather than public relations.
Mr. Shuman said he ''brought Frank PR USA in to help us with a project,'' an event on Wednesday at an apartment on Central Park South once owned by Billy Joel.
He is so pleased with the results, he added, that ''I imagine we'll continue some degree of engagement with them.''
The Frank PR USA office -- at 441 Broadway between Howard and Grand streets -- has five employees. Mr. Dowd said he was ''absolutely looking for new hires immediately.''
Talk about public reactions; imagine the reaction to that from the unemployed and underemployed of New York.

HEADLINE: Why Men Fail

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
You're probably aware of the basic trends. The financial rewards to education have increased over the past few decades, but men failed to get the memo.
In elementary and high school, male academic performance is lagging. Boys earn three-quarters of the D's and F's. By college, men are clearly behind. Only 40 percent of bachelor's degrees go to men, along with 40 percent of master's degrees.
Thanks to their lower skills, men are dropping out of the labor force. In 1954, 96 percent of the American men between the ages of 25 and 54 worked. Today, that number is down to 80 percent. In Friday's jobs report, male labor force participation reached an all-time low. 
Millions of men are collecting disability. Even many of those who do have a job are doing poorly. According to Michael Greenstone of the Hamilton Project, annual earnings for median prime-age males have dropped by 28 percent over the past 40 years.
Men still dominate the tippy-top of the corporate ladder because many women take time off to raise children, but women lead or are gaining nearly everywhere else. Women in their 20s outearn men in their 20s. Twelve out of the 15 fastest-growing professions are dominated by women.
Over the years, many of us have embraced a certain theory to explain men's economic decline. It is that the information-age economy rewards traits that, for neurological and cultural reasons, women are more likely to possess.
To succeed today, you have to be able to sit still and focus attention in school at an early age. You have to be emotionally sensitive and aware of context. You have to communicate smoothly. For genetic and cultural reasons, many men stink at these tasks.
But, in her fascinating new book, ''The End of Men,'' Hanna Rosin posits a different theory. It has to do with adaptability. Women, Rosin argues, are like immigrants who have moved to a new country. They see a new social context, and they flexibly adapt to new circumstances. Men are like immigrants who have physically moved to a new country but who have kept their minds in the old one. They speak the old language. They follow the old mores. Men are more likely to be rigid; women are more fluid.
This theory has less to do with innate traits and more to do with social position. When there's big social change, the people who were on the top of the old order are bound to cling to the old ways. The people who were on the bottom are bound to experience a burst of energy. They're going to explore their new surroundings more enthusiastically.
Rosin reports from working-class Alabama. The women she meets are flooding into new jobs and new opportunities -- going back to college, pursuing new careers. The men are waiting around for the jobs that left and are never coming back. They are strangely immune to new options. In the Auburn-Opelika region, the median female income is 140 percent of the median male income.
Rosin also reports from college campuses where women are pioneering new social arrangements. The usual story is that men are exploiting the new campus hookup culture in order to get plenty of sex without romantic commitments. Rosin argues that, in fact, women support the hookup culture. It allows them to have sex and fun without any time-consuming distractions from their careers. Like new immigrants, women are desperate to rise, and they embrace social and sexual rules that give them the freedom to focus on their professional lives.
Rosin is not saying that women are winners in a global gender war or that they are doing super simply because men are doing worse. She's just saying women are adapting to today's economy more flexibly and resiliently than men. There's a lot of evidence to support her case.
A study by the National Federation of Independent Business found that small businesses owned by women outperformed male-owned small businesses during the last recession. In finance, women who switch firms are more likely to see their performance improve, whereas men are more likely to see theirs decline. There's even evidence that women are better able to adjust to divorce. Today, more women than men see their incomes rise by 25 percent after a marital breakup.
Forty years ago, men and women adhered to certain ideologies, what it meant to be a man or a woman. Young women today, Rosin argues, are more like clean slates, having abandoned both feminist and prefeminist preconceptions. Men still adhere to the masculinity rules, which limits their vision and their movement.
If she's right, then men will have to be less like Achilles, imposing their will on the world, and more like Odysseus, the crafty, many-sided sojourner. They'll have to acknowledge that they are strangers in a strange land.

HEADLINE: Traffic and Congestion Unmoved by Uprising

BYLINE: By SCOTT SAYARE; Asmaa Al Zohairy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- It seems a measure of how little has changed since Egypt's revolution that Nasr Mohammed Ghaleb still peddles tamarind juice here beneath an overpass, 15 cents a glass, amid the smog and piercing horns of the line of traffic he is blocking.
''The people in the cars coming this way are all hot, and so they want something to drink,'' Mr. Ghaleb, 43, said the other day from behind his stand in Ramses Square. The people are hot, in part, because of the traffic, and the traffic is bad, in part, because of Mr. Ghaleb.
''I'm off to the side,'' he insisted, smiling and looking a bit embarrassed.
So it was before the revolution, so it is now. Police officers come, sometimes, to clear out the street vendors -- there are thought to be thousands, if not tens of thousands, in this massive city's vast informal economy -- and to ease the flow of traffic. The street vendors return, with nowhere else to go, and so does the congestion. 
Mohamed Morsi, the Islamist leader who is Egypt's first democratically elected president, has inherited far larger problems: an economy devastated by unrest, a broken system of food and fuel subsidies and plunging foreign currency reserves. He has turned to the International Monetary Fund for assistance in the form of a $4.8 billion loan, to Saudi Arabia and Qatar for aid and investment, to the United States for debt relief. His country is desperate to attract tourists and investors.
Mr. Morsi has also pledged to remove the street vendors and improve traffic, though, echoing the promises of decades of other officials who have sought to tame Cairo's infamous crush of jalopies and buses and taxis and motorbikes. Mr. Morsi has called traffic a high priority for his first 100 days in office, not least because of its tremendous cost to the economy: as much as $8 billion in lost productivity, delays and excess fuel consumption, according to the World Bank. That amounts to about 3 percent of gross domestic product, putting Cairo's rate several times higher than that of comparable cities. It is one of several basic but intractable problems still troubling Egypt, one that belies the revolutionary fervor of early 2011 and speaks to the longstanding challenges this country still faces.
Everything has changed, many Egyptians say, and nothing has changed.
''Chaos is the master of the situation,'' said Saad Hagras, a columnist and the managing editor at a business newspaper, Al Alam Al Youm, describing traffic in Cairo but also life in Egypt, more generally. ''Politics has been brought back to life,'' to be sure, Mr. Hagras said, but the revolution has solved little else. Crime and violence are up, he noted, with fewer police officers on the streets since the uprising that deposed President Hosni Mubarak. Poverty remains extensive -- more than 40 percent of the population is thought to live on less than $2 per day -- and unemployment is high and rising.
''The citizen's life is worse now than it was before the Jan. 25 revolution,'' Mr. Hagras said.
Mohammed Ahmed, 31, who sells pirated software and videos in the street in Ramses Square, echoed that sentiment. ''It's no different now than under Mubarak,'' Mr. Ahmed said at his stand in central Cairo, outside the city's principal railway station. Commuters flow out into the shaded road here, between the cars and battered microbuses that crawl around the pilings of the bridge overhead. The police come most weeks to chase him off the street, Mr. Ahmed said. ''We're causing a problem, yes,'' he said, referring to the traffic, ''but we're not the main reason for it.''
Designated parking spaces are difficult to come by in Cairo, so drivers park in the street. The traffic police often appear wildly unpreoccupied by traffic. Gas is subsidized and inexpensive, and stoplights are rare, the World Bank notes in a report, and the city's transportation infrastructure was simply never meant to handle so many vehicles or human beings. While accommodations have been made -- bridges, a ring road, a subway system, a bus network -- they have not kept pace with the city's growth.
About 2.2 million vehicles now ply Cairo's streets, a number that has risen an average of 4 percent each year since the 1970s, said Safwan Khedr, an engineering professor and transportation expert at the American University in Cairo. Egypt's population has grown by about 13 million in the past decade, a rise of nearly 20 percent; greater Cairo has absorbed much of that growth, to reach 18 million residents.
Road accidents kill about 1,000 people -- half are pedestrians -- in greater Cairo each year, and injure 4,000 more, according to the World Bank. Ambulances here are equipped with loudspeakers; emergency workers plead with drivers to find room for them to pass.
Local driving habits are famously problematic, too. Cairenes often shrug off stoplights and traffic rules and what more timid souls might call prudence, Dr. Khedr noted, and the revolution has done nothing to change this. Many Egyptians learn to drive from friends or family, he said, not in classes, and licenses are generally awarded without a road test.
''If a person is doing something wrong, he should know he is doing something wrong,'' said Dr. Khedr, a bit exasperated.
Police checkpoints, to check drivers' licenses, often cause traffic problems as well.
''To check drivers' licenses, would you make the whole country stop moving?'' asked Mohammed Hedi, 49. He stopped his white taxicab in the middle of the road along the Sixth of October bridge to point to several rows of halted midday traffic below.
There are the street vendors, too. Mr. Morsi's government has suggested placing the vendors at designated markets once a week; the vendors complain that they would never be able to feed their families with just one day's work. There are vague plans to build new market areas, off the pavement, but the appropriate land has yet to be identified or prepared. Nor is it altogether clear where, in central Cairo, such land might be found.
''Where do they want us to go?'' asked Mr. Ahmed, the salesman of pirated software. ''Do they want us to stay home?''
Business has fallen sharply since last year, he said, with customers concerned about the country's stability. He now sells no more than about $50 of goods a day, he said, and takes home just a fraction of that to support his wife and twin boys.
But he has yet to pass judgment on Mr. Morsi, who took office in late June, despite his pledge to clear out the street vendors; two months is too little time, Mr. Ahmed said. ''We'll give him a chance,'' he said. ''We hope God is on his side.''
Still, Mr. Ahmed has every intention of keeping his stand here amid the traffic, where it has been for nearly eight years, though he does not much like the work or the noise.
''Every day, I wake up and say, 'I hope God will let me stop coming here,' '' he said, laughing. ''But I keep coming.''

HEADLINE: Revisiting 47 Hours of Fear in 1973

BYLINE: By EMILY S. RUEB

 BODY:
"We know some of you are hurt. We want to help you," boomed a bullhorn on top of an armored police vehicle. "Please come out with your hands on your heads and you will be treated. There is no place for you to go. The building, the block and the entire area is surrounded."
It was the winter of 1973 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and four men in their 20s who had vowed to fight to the death were holding about a dozen hostages inside John and Al's, a sporting goods store on a busy commercial block of Broadway. The siege would last 47 hours, one of the longest such dramas in the city's history, and mark a turning point in the New York Police Department's approach to hostage situations. 
Instead of brute force, the police used psychology, firearm discipline and patience to end the siege, techniques that would be codified in the department's hostage-negotiating training program, begun later that year.
The police arrived at about 6 p.m. on Jan. 19, a Friday, foiling an attempted robbery of the store by four Sunni Muslims seeking guns, rifles, pistols and ammunition for "a holy crusade." A three-hour shootout ensued. Gunfire crackled and boomed in the evening air.
Several officers on the scene were pinned down behind cars and elevated track pillars as shotgun blasts and gunfire raged. Stephen R. Gilroy, 29, an officer who had been behind an elevated train pillar wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the head and killed on the scene. Two other officers were wounded, as was one of the gunmen inside the store.
Dozens of pedestrians were trapped in nearby restaurants and shops on the thoroughfare near the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.
After the initial gun battle, the police did not fire another bullet.
A Muslim minister was one of several religious leaders who tried to establish a dialogue with the kidnappers, who had ripped out all the phone lines in the store.
"If you want us to leave as Muslims, to go home, fire three shots," he said from the tank's bullhorn.
Three shots were fired in rapid succession.
Scores of police personnel, psychologists and firearms experts agonized over the next steps as the standoff continued.
Hundreds of onlookers lined the sidewalks. Residents in nearby apartment buildings were trapped indoors for the weekend.
By the next afternoon, two hostages had been released and a third was let go in exchange for a doctor bringing medical supplies to treat the injured gunman.
Dr. Thomas W. Matthew (left in photo above), an activist and head of the National Economic Growth and Reconstruction Organization, was accompanied by a nurse into the store. They collected a bullhorn and a walkie-talkie from the glass-strewed pavement; the gunmen would later use them to order sandwiches and cigarettes.
Over the course of several trips, Dr. Matthew also established a phone line.
At about 1 p.m. on Sunday, the third day, 43 hours after the siege began, the nine remaining hostages were left unattended by the gunmen when they heard footsteps in the adjacent furniture store.
Led by a store manager, Jerry Riccio, the seven men and two women tore through half-inch plasterboard to get to a hidden staircase that led to the roof. There, they appeared, one by one, to the surprise of the police officers standing guard.
The gunmen had lost their leverage, but not their stockpile of weapons and ammunition. And for several tense hours, it was unclear if they would fight to the death, as they had vowed to do.
Relatives of the gunmen tried to talk them into peacefully surrendering.
Later that afternoon, at about 4:45 p.m., one of the haggard gunmen appeared with his hands over his head. The others gave in shortly after.
A train on the elevated BMT line rumbled past for the first time since the ordeal had begun.
The gunmen, who were identified as Salih Ali Abdullah, Shulab Abdula Raheem and Dawd A. Rahman, were escorted to the 90th Precinct station house on Union Avenue. The fourth gunman, Yusef Abdullah Almussudig, who was suffering from a gunshot wound to the abdomen, was taken to Kings County Hospital.
In 1974, the men were tried in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. A a jury found them guilty of 41 counts, including murder, kidnapping and robbery.
This week on City Room, Frank A. Bolz Jr., a retired New York City Police Department detective captain who helped create the department's hostage-negotiating team and guidelines, will be answering your questions about hostage situations in the city.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ecuadoreans Close Ranks In Assange Standoff

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador -- Juan José Illingworth has English bona fides that are hard to beat. He is the sixth-generation namesake of an Englishman who became one of Ecuador's national heroes, fighting for independence from Spain, helping to lead the young nation, founding its naval academy and drafting the law that freed the country's slaves.
But for all of Mr. Illingworth's keen appreciation of his family's ties to the old sod, when the British authorities threatened last month to enter Ecuador's embassy in London to seize the asylum-seeking founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, his sentiments went decidedly against Mother England.
''I've always believed that an embassy is a bulwark of protection,'' said Mr. Illingworth, a software executive and a former legislator. ''England cannot violate that.'' 
Bear in mind, Mr. Illingworth is no fan of Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, who made the decision to grant asylum to Mr. Assange. And like others here, he sees political motives behind the move. Mr. Correa certainly has a predilection for grand public stances that portray him as fearless and defiant, whether he is daring rebellious police officers to kill him if they are ''brave enough,'' kicking out the World Bank's representative, expelling the American ambassador or refusing to let the American military use a prominent base on Ecuadorean soil.
But when the tussle over Mr. Assange turned into a fight pitting tiny Ecuador against a powerful and imperious Britain, many in this politically divided country rallied around him.
Miriam Vilela, 40, a seamstress, who sat on a recent afternoon in Navy Park here near a statue of Mr. Illingworth's famous relative, had only a vague notion of who Mr. Assange was, recalling merely that he had ''something to do with the Internet.''
But what she was clear about was that Britain had tried to bully Ecuador, and she was glad that Mr. Correa had stood his ground. It reminded her of a phrase used by a former president of Ecuador, Sixto Durán Ballén, to rally the country during its 1995 war with Peru.
''Not one step backward,'' said Ms. Vilela, who supports Mr. Correa because of his policies that help the poor. ''Never retreat. What's ours is ours.''
Britain ultimately backed off its threat to invade the embassy, and Ecuador said this week that it would resume talks aimed at resolving the standoff. There seemed to be little hope for a quick fix, however. Mr. Assange, who has taken refuge in the embassy since June 19 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning on allegations that he sexually assaulted two women, told Telesur, a channel based in Venezuela, that he expected to remain in the building for 6 to 12 months.
Still, London is far away, and large numbers of Ecuadoreans are busy worrying about making ends meet. On the streets of Guayaquil, the country's biggest city, and Quito, the capital, more than half of the people questioned said they had not heard of Mr. Assange or of the embassy standoff.
Nonetheless, a few walls in Quito have been spray-painted with an end-of-days-like slogan: ''Assange is coming. Get ready.''
There have been a handful of small rallies in support of Mr. Assange's asylum and against Britain's bullying. Last Sunday, a half-dozen activists showed up at the main square in Quito, Independence Plaza, taking turns holding up a large banner that said ''Welcome Assange'' and another one calling for a ban on bullfighting.
Felipe Ogaz, 34, one of the activists, said that he would gladly offer Mr. Assange the use of the couch in his two-room apartment, if he ever made it to Ecuador.
''He is an icon who has made Ecuador be seen not just as a small country but as something important,'' said Patricio Melo, 26, a student who passed by and took a couple of posters of Mr. Assange.
Mr. Correa has made many broadly popular changes, improving health care, education, roads and social services. But he is a lightning rod and delights in picking fights and taunting his opponents. He has been criticized by human rights groups for cracking down on popular protests and by dissident groups for seeking to intimidate and restrict the press.
In granting asylum to Mr. Assange and butting heads with Britain, Mr. Correa both stirred a sense of national pride and confirmed some skeptics' views of him.
Carlos Soria, 45, the owner of a tiny hardware store near the Quito airport, said he cherished Ecuador's tradition of offering refuge to those who need it and approved of giving asylum to Mr. Assange. ''We had to do it for humanitarian reasons,'' he said.
But Mr. Soria, who said he had never voted for Mr. Correa and did not plan to in the future, questioned the president's motives. ''I think he did it to get a political advantage, to increase his popularity,'' he said. ''This president is always trying to draw attention to himself.''
Enrique Ayala, the president of Simón Bolívar Andean University in Quito, said he believed that Mr. Assange had been politically persecuted and ran the risk of being accused of a crime by the United States for the release of secret documents and diplomatic cables. But he said that granting asylum was a mistake.
''It isn't in the best interests of Ecuador to have taken this step, which creates conflict with various countries,'' Mr. Ayala said. ''The country doesn't gain anything. I think it loses.''
Meanwhile, Mr. Illingworth and his relatives have a privileged perspective on Ecuadorean-British relations.
Their famous ancestor, Juan Illingworth, born John in 1786 in Heaton Norris, near Manchester, was one of many Englishmen who came in the early 19th century to fight against the Spanish for South American independence, encouraged by a government back home that was in constant conflict with imperial Spain.
Illingworth fought in many battles on sea and land; befriended Simón Bolívar, the independence leader; and was named a general and an admiral. He settled in Guayaquil, married into a prominent family and had an illustrious political career.
His descendants have continued to play a major role in the country. An Illingworth has served as vice president, and there have been many cabinet ministers and legislators.
That includes Juan José, who served in the National Assembly from 1996 to 1998. During and after his term in the legislature, he championed greater autonomy for Guayaquil -- a position that earned him his own WikiLeaks moment. Mr. Illingworth is mentioned in a 2005 State Department cable on the autonomy movement, which was among tens of thousands of diplomatic cables made public in 2010 by WikiLeaks.
The family has a strong sense of history and its place in it. Its members walk through a city that has an Illingworth Street and an Illingworth Passage.
There are at least two statues and a bust of the Admiral, as their famous forebear is usually called. (The base of the statue in Navy Park contains a coffer with the Admiral's remains. Mr. Illingworth was present a few years ago at the exhumation and was happy to see that, more than 150 years later, ''his skull was in perfect condition,'' he said.)
And what would the Admiral have thought about the conflict over Mr. Assange?
''He would have felt uncomfortable,'' Mr. Illingworth said. ''Part of his heart was with England and part with Ecuador.''

HEADLINE: Russian Farm, Chinese Farmer

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
OSTANINO, Russia -- When a Chinese investor bought a farm outside this village a few years back, he was pleased enough to name it Golden Land. The soil was rich, the sunshine and rain bountiful.
The land, deep in rural Russia, was also largely devoid of people.
No more. Today, row upon row of greenhouses here teem with dozens of Chinese farmhands picking tomatoes. And in a season with a bumper crop of tomatoes, the foreman said he would happily have employed hundreds more.
The influx of Chinese farm labor in Russia reflects the growing trade and economic ties between the two countries, one rich in land and resources, the other in people.
For years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, both countries have struggled to convert these complementary strengths into real business opportunities. A few mining ventures are succeeding. And state companies have struck big oil, coal and timber deals that form the backbone of the economic relationship. 
Although China's ventures into Russian agriculture have been on a smaller scale, they could end up being just as important -- not least because they raise tensions about the role of immigrants similar to those seen in the United States over migrant Mexican farm laborers.
According to the World Food Program, Russia has the world's largest reserve of arable yet now fallow land, a legacy of the collapse of the Soviet collective farm system and the depopulation of rural Russia over the last two decades. Russia's population is 141 million, compared with 1.3 billion in China.
China has perennial worries about securing enough food and finding enough work for its rural population. Some Chinese-run farms in Russia ship their soybean crops to China, and as the Chinese presence in the farm sector grows, so will the potential for more food exports. (Vegetable farms such as Golden Land sell their produce locally.)
As food prices spiked five years ago, before the financial crisis, the Chinese government opened talks on investing in Russian farmland. The program came to fruition this year with a $1 billion contribution by the China Investment Corporation in a joint Russian-Chinese fund investing in agriculture and timber in Russia and other former Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
Under a Russian government-backed program, Chinese companies also formally lease about a million acres of farmland, much along the border with northeast China. In addition, Chinese companies lease about two million acres of Siberian forests, where Chinese lumberjacks fell timber for export back to China.
In some cases, Chinese investors are purchasing land in Russia. Golden Land is one of nine Chinese farms in the Sverdlovsk region in central Russia, according to the local ministry of agriculture. Far more have sprung up to the south, in the Chelyabinsk region. Chinese vegetable farms even operate outside Moscow and St. Petersburg, thousands of miles from the border.
Golden Land's business could grow as easily as the chest-high tomato vines do in the hothouses here, said Zhang Wei Dong, the foreman, who goes by the Russian nickname Lyosha and doubles as an interpreter when needed. ''Look at the empty land,'' he said, gesturing about.
Mr. Zhang had a Federal Migration Service quota this year for 70 immigrant farm laborers, but said he could use many more.
Recruiting workers is not the problem. Chinese weeders, planters and pickers are more than willing to make the journey, a cramped, sweaty third-class rumble across Siberia from Manchuria. It is a trek toward economic opportunity familiar to countless Mexican grape collectors in California, Filipino nannies in Dubai or Algerian street sweepers in France.
Unfolding from her stoop over a tomato bed, Li Hunlao, a farmer from near the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin, explained, through an interpreter, why she ventured so far from home: ''I came for the money, what do you think?'' Salaries of about $650 a month are five times the salaries of field hands in China, she said.
The Kremlin's foreign policy has recently emphasized better ties with China, as Europe's economy wobbles near recession, a theme last week at the summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization in Vladivostok.
''We have been through times of sunshine which were very beneficial,'' President Vladimir V. Putin said in an interview with the Russian state-owned RT television released on Thursday.
As host, Russia set the meeting agenda. Tellingly, given Russia's bounty of land, Mr. Putin chose food security and agriculture as a top topic, in recognition of Russia's large and growing role in exporting grain to developing nations.
The Russian government has set a goal of increasing trade with China to $200 billion a year, from $80 billion in 2011. By comparison, trade between the United States and China was $503 billion in 2011, according to the Department of Commerce.
Skeptics of further economic ties between Russia and China point to deep mistrust dating to border skirmishes fought along the Ussuri River in 1969 that froze all development for decades. The border, in fact, was only fully demarcated in 2009.
Russians also harbor fears that broadening economic cooperation will lead to a wave of Chinese immigrants taking over sparsely populated territories, a concern heard in this village, too.
''Why are these people here?'' said Nadezhda A. Kolyesova, a saleswoman out for a stroll recently through Ostanino, a picturesque jumble of wooden homes overlooking a pond, birch forests and the Golden Land farm.
''I have nothing against them,'' she said. ''But Russia is for Russia, and China is for the Chinese.''
After some contemplation, she conceded, ''I suppose it's all right, so long as they don't enslave our children in the future.''
The farm has a policy of giving free vegetables to any local who shows up, mostly older people. The Chinese workers live in makeshift dorms made of plywood and scrap lumber, and patronize the village store for cigarettes, vodka, sausage and ice cream.
Once, a fight broke out between young Russian and Chinese men. No romances have been reported, but the consensus of several grandmothers at the local market was that, in fact, Russians and Chinese can live peaceably side by side in rural Russia.
Today about 400,000 Chinese migrants live in Russia, making up only a tiny portion of all immigrants in the country, most of whom come from former Soviet states in Central Asia. Chinese migration could well increase, however.
In past seasons, Golden Land, a farm created out of an empty field five years ago, obtained at least enough permits to work its greenhouses, though bureaucratic tangles in Russia's temporary work visa program reduced the quota this year.
Vladimir Balasanyan, a local from Ostanino who works as a manager at the farm, and in whose name the Chinese investor initially formulated the land title, said few Russians wanted farm jobs these days. ''Our government wants our farmers to work,'' he said. ''But Russians don't want to work on a farm.''
The Chinese investor in Golden Land had traded for years in a market in the nearby city of Yekaterinburg, according to Mr. Balasanyan. He obtained the land by buying shares in a defunct collective farm from villagers. He now lives in Harbin and recruits farmhands for Golden Land by word of mouth in surrounding Chinese villages.
The owner, Piao Chen Nan, pays a higher salary to the Chinese than they would earn at home. He can afford it because he earns more on the sale of tomatoes -- a pound sells wholesale for about 25 cents in this part of Russia, compared with about 8 cents in northern China, Mr. Balasanyan said.
In the late fall, workers set up iron stoves in the greenhouses, and through the first frosty nights, feed them with split birch firewood from the forest, extending the growing season for a few weeks. Inevitably, though, the Russian frost sets in and the Chinese leave, retracing their journey home along the trans-Siberian railway until the next season.

HEADLINE: In Caribbean Coral, a Complex Picture

BYLINE: By EMMA BRYCE

 BODY:
At its ongoing conference in South Korea, the International Union for Conservation of Nature released a report on Friday indicating that live coral coverage on reefs in the Caribbean has plummeted from nearly 50 percent in the 1970s to less than 10 percent today. Yet describing the entire Caribbean as a region where reefs are in a state of general collapse tends to cloud the problem's complexity, the study suggests. 
Michael Lesser, a program director for biological oceanography at the National Science Foundation, acknowledges that the region is the "poster child" for the global destruction of reefs. "The pronouncement that the Caribbean itself would be in dire straits is no surprise - we've been talking about this for a long time now," he said.
Overfishing has left its mark, as has the decline of species like the parrotfish and the spiny black urchin known as Diadema antillarum, which graze on algae and ideally keep it from stifling the reefs. Ocean warming and acidification add more pressure, bleaching and weakening coral networks. "It's a sort of double whammy," Dr. Lesser said.
But the conservation group's report shows that the destruction is not spread uniformly. Spots like the Cayman Islands have up to three times more live cover than afflicted reefs in Jamaica and in the United States Virgin Islands, which also have noticeably smaller fish and an abundance of algae. There is also uncertainty about what causes coral decline in certain places, pointing up the need for varying strategies across the Caribbean instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.Jamaica, for instance, struggles economically and is highly dependent on its marine resources, so overfishing is a primary concern there. Enforcing species protection and establishing minimum size limits for catch would therefore be a crucial strategy there, Dr. Lesser said.
Regulation of development and agriculture could help stave off a major threat to the United States Virgin Islands, where reefs are affected by land-based pollution and runoff that makes its way to the sea, the report noted. Ultimately, the study suggests that understanding all of the local factors will help tailor approaches for the long run and for the wider Caribbean.
As for a time scale for recovery, "We're talking decades," Dr. Lesser said. Yet hope persists because coral reefs have bounced back in the past - Australia's Great Barrier Reef, for one.
Inevitably, though, success depends on the resources that countries have at their disposal to protect marine habitats. Given that countries with a low gross domestic product like Belize or Jamaica will have fewer resources to deploy, Dr. Lesser hopes that a greater global pull toward coral conservation can be mobilized.
To people in places where coral reefs are healthier, he advises: "Look ahead to the Caribbean. It has the possibility of being a road map."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Options Open on Economy

BYLINE: By ESWAR S. PRASAD

 BODY:
China's economy has been the leading contributor to global growth since 2009 and became the second largest in the world in 2010. Small wonder that fears of a growth slowdown in China are causing trepidation around the world.
The fears are palpable given that virtually all indicators of economic activity are pointing down. Growth in gross domestic product, industrial production and retail sales have all slowed markedly. Alternative indicators like electricity consumption suggest an even sharper slowdown. Foreign trade has not helped, with export and import growth falling sharply as well.
Then there are the longer-term concerns that a rapidly aging population is going to limit the economy's growth potential, snaring China in the ''middle-income trap.'' With fear in the air, foreign capital is no longer pouring into China and some domestic investors are even taking capital out.
Inflation has eased to 2 percent and some of the froth has come off the property market, but these are seen by many as signs of deeper malaise rather than as positive developments. All told, it appears to be the season for China bears, who are exulting as their views appear -- finally -- to be validated. 
The burden of pulling along world growth while the major advanced economies -- the United States, Europe and Japan -- continue to post anemic growth and remain in a state of policy paralysis has clearly taken its toll on the Chinese economy. Moreover, many emerging markets and even some advanced economies that rely on commodity exports have been riding on China's coattails during a difficult period in the world economy. Thus, China's growth is seen as a bellwether of an even rockier period ahead for a global economy whose recovery has stalled.
For all the angst about China's growth, the government does have room to stimulate the economy through fiscal and monetary policies. This is in contrast to many advanced economies, which seem to have exhausted their policy options. With a leadership transition looming, the Chinese government appears to be holding some of its fire to be able to respond strongly to external shocks.
Attaining this year's growth target of 7.5 percent is likely to be difficult but not insurmountable. The real challenge Chinese policy makers face is how to sustain growth in the short run without creating more risks over the longer term.
A bank-financed investment surge lifted economic growth during the global financial crisis. The temptation to use this policy tool again is strong. But another wave of bank-financed investment would also create big risks, including excess capacity in many industries and more bad loans in the banking system.
The mix of policies also has implications for making growth more balanced. Until recently, the Chinese economy was beset by two imbalances -- an external one, reflected in a high trade surplus, and an internal imbalance, reflected in a low and falling ratio of private consumption to G.D.P.
The external imbalance has dissipated, at least temporarily. China's trade surplus has fallen steadily from its recent peak of 7.6 percent in 2007 to 2.1 percent in 2011, and below 2 percent in the first half of this year. Part of this decline is because China has been growing far more strongly than its trading partners. Another factor is that the currency, the renminbi, has appreciated in value against the currencies of China's major trading partners, reducing export competitiveness.
By contrast, domestic growth remains unbalanced, with investment still accounting for a major share of G.D.P. growth. The share of private consumption in G.D.P., which is only about one-third -- already much lower than in virtually every other economy -- continues to decline.
There was a spark of hope in the first quarter of 2012, when private consumption accounted for the major share of G.D.P. growth. But this proved fleeting, and investment has once again taken over as the main driver of growth. Investment-led growth of the sort China has experienced is not entirely a plus -- it does not lift employment growth by much, has deleterious environmental consequences and limits the benefits that the average household gets from fast growth.
What is to be done? Fiscal policy, if well targeted, would be a better tool to stoke demand in the short run without creating too many long-term risks. For instance, a better safety net would help spread the benefits of China's strong economic performance more evenly and reduce the incentives for households to ''self-insure'' against risks of unemployment by saving more. Raising social expenditures on health and education would not only give households more incentive to spend rather than save but also help improve the productivity of labor.
For the longer term, the main priority for the government is to improve productivity rather than rely on high investment or an expanding labor force. This will also require a better financial system and more effective policy tools.
The financial system needs to improve its efficiency in allocating capital to more productive uses, including providing capital for small and midsize enterprises that could generate more employment, and providing savers with a higher return on their deposits. A better monetary policy would help in this objective and that, in turn, requires a greater freeing up of the exchange rate over time so that the central bank can use interest rates to guide credit allocation.
The economy faces other enormous challenges, including corruption and dismal corporate governance at Chinese enterprises. The twelfth five-year plan, issued last year, laid bare these problems and deficiencies in the policy-making process. An authoritarian government can certainly do what would be infeasible in a democracy, where such an admission would be politically fatal. But it is difficult to think of another government, democratic or not, that so bluntly acknowledges major problems and areas where its policies have failed to deliver much progress. In the midst of the gloom, that allows a glimmer of hope that Chinese policy makers will continue to embrace an agenda of much-needed reforms.
Despite the difficult economic environment and a looming, rockier-than-anticipated political transition, there has been progress. This includes modest but significant steps taken in recent months toward greater flexibility of the renminbi's exchange rate, liberalization of domestic interest rates, and freeing up of restrictions on capital inflows and outflows.
This opportunistic and gradual approach to economic overhauls is one way to make progress given the significant constraints, both political and institutional, that the government faces. But China's leaders may not have the luxury of time or a benign environment, either domestic or global, to limit themselves to such a slow, even if steady, pace.
The country's policy makers have proven adept at managing a high-wire balancing act for a number of years, keeping growth strong even while managing the many problems the growth process has created. Gusting winds from abroad have now exposed many of these tensions and threaten to bring the act crashing down.
A more aggressive push for reforms is needed to help secure short-term growth while improving future prospects and reducing risks. Not moving forward on these reforms may be the biggest risk of all.

HEADLINE: Bigger Pig Farms Offer China a Way to Calm Pork Prices

BYLINE: By LUCY HORNBY | REUTERS

 BODY:
JINHUA, CHINA -- The Jiahua Pig Breeding farm in Zhejiang Province is on the front line of Chinese efforts to control food inflation, a prime example of how a shift in farming practices could someday stabilize the price of the nation's favorite meat -- and soothe a perennial headache for Beijing.
Pork prices are so volatile and have such an influence on inflation in the Chinese economy, the world's second-largest, after that of the United States, that some Chinese joke that C.P.I. stands for China pork index, not Consumer Price Index. 
Annual inflation in China ticked up slightly to 2 percent in August from a 30-month low in July, reflecting in part a turnaround in pork prices, which climbed after a summer dip, returning to levels last seen in May.
For the moment, pork supplies are ample. Record profit margins for pork last year meant that people of all stripes, peasants and coal millionaires, invested in pigs.
That is good news for the Chinese Communist Party, which is sensitive to any potential for public unrest before its once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year. The party blames inflation for demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in Beijing more than 20 years ago and keeps a lid on prices by fiat if necessary.
But though inflation has trended unusually low in China this summer, pork prices and overall food inflation are at risk of rising higher in coming quarters, testing the government's resolve to keep a lid on prices, even as it faces a cooling economy.
In the long run, China's move from backyard pigpens to huge industrial farms like Jiahua Pig Breeding, which benefit from economies of scale and more stable production plans, could help calm volatile boom-bust pork cycles and bring inflation more under control.
''The faster the trend to scale up and the faster that backyard breeding is phased out, the more volatility will be dampened,'' Hua Jianqing, Jiahua's president and principle investor, said from his headquarters in rural Zhejiang, south of Shanghai.
''It won't be a year or two,'' he said. ''My analysis is that it will take three to five years to reach the balancing point.''
Jiahua keeps 5,000 breeding sows at a time and raises 100,000 pigs a year.
Squirming and oinking, young sows are lined up daily for buyers peering through a glass window. Those that are picked can be shipped hundreds of kilometers to help seed yet another huge farm. Large-scale operations with about 3,000 pigs each now account for about 20 percent of China's herd, but huge, American-style farms of Jiahua's size account for only about 2 percent.
The record-high margins last summer created a classic boom in investment in pigs, but now a drought in the United States is pushing up the price of grain used for feed, prompting owners of small farms to slaughter their animals and setting the stage for a possible supply shortage in months to come.
Small farms still produce enough hogs -- about one-third of the national herd -- that their decisions to buy more piglets or sit out a season can have a big influence on prices.
''If fewer choose to raise, in the third quarter of 2013 we see a shortage of pork and a run-up in prices,'' said Andy Rothman, China strategist for the brokerage firm CLSA in Shanghai.
The risk of a sharp increase in food inflation is one of the concerns keeping Beijing from doing more to stimulate the economy, even as the vast manufacturing sector shows signs of contracting.
Although an 18.5 percent drop in pork prices in the year ending in August helped bring food inflation to 3.4 percent last month, food prices are still up 5.9 percent so far this year, running above Beijing's overall inflation target of 4 percent.
The huge investment necessary to create a large commercial operation means larger farms will stay in business even during a downturn, unlike many smaller operations.
Jiahua, for example, cost 110 million renminbi, or about $17.4 million, to set up its site, which covers 73 hectares, or about 180 acres, and includes 32 long brick pens. The farm employs 200 people.
Mr. Hua is investing 300 million renminbi in a farm under construction north of Shanghai that will be three times the size of the Jiahua site.
Shi Tao, an analyst for eFeedlink, an agriculture research company in Shanghai, said, ''We think of pig raising as supplementing farm household income, but nowadays you need to be rich to raise pigs.''
While larger farms are, in theory, better able to weather rising costs, few have reached a scale at which they can hedge grain prices on volatile Chinese futures markets. Jiahua obtains grain from a regular supplier in the north, buying more when it looks as if prices are rising. To cut costs, the farm has its own feed mill.
''This year, prices have not been too stable, but we buy in scale to hold down costs,'' said Zhong Dongshan, a manager of a farm with 3,000 pigs in Jiangsu Province, north of Shanghai. ''We buy corn by the container and buy medicines wholesale.''
The march to bigger operations may benefit Chinese consumers and the Chinese government by keeping pork prices stable, but investors may find it takes longer than expected to turn a profit.
The current short, sharp cycles in pork prices will lengthen as farms get larger, with each downturn in the future becoming longer and more severe as low-cost producers tough it out, said Mr. Shi of eFeedlink.
In the past, ''peasants reacted immediately to price drops by selling the pigs they had and not raising more,'' he said. ''Now the larger-scale farms won't cull sows; they can absorb losses longer while smaller producers drop out.''

HEADLINE: Trade Data Confirms Economic Slowdown in China

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Exports from China inched up in August and imports shrank unexpectedly, data released Monday showed, cementing the view that the Chinese economy has slowed abruptly in recent months despite a string of government measures devised to bolster it. 
The data, released by the Chinese customs agency, capped a series of feeble statistics for August and fanned expectations that the government would speed up the flow and range of stimulus measures.
Growth in exports, which represent about 25 percent of the Chinese economy and account for millions of jobs, slowed sharply in recent months because of weaker economic growth and austerity measures in Europe. Exports were up 2.7 percent from the level of a year earlier.
Although that increase was better than the 1 percent growth recorded in July, it fell short of analysts' expectations and was well below the double-digit growth rates that the export sector has managed in the past.
Given the lingering turmoil in Europe and the anemic pace of recovery in the United States, there is little prospect that exports will rebound anytime soon.
An unexpectedly sharp slump in imports to China showed that domestic demand, too, had weakened. Imports fell 2.6 percent in August from a year earlier; analysts had expected, on average, a gain of 3.5 percent.
''Demand for the hard commodities, such as iron ore and coal, is likely to remain soft for a while, given a large amount of port inventories,'' Liu Li-gang, chief economist for China at Australia and New Zealand Banking, said in a note.
The government has moved to counter the slowdown by approving more infrastructure investment and trying to get banks to increase lending.
The measures have come in dribs and drabs, however, and judging from the weak data, they have failed so far to provide the punch needed for a marked increase.
''We believe government policy will become more proactive, and further supportive policies will be rolled out in September,'' Zhiwei Zhang, China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, said in a research note.
Further stimulus measures are likely to take the form of tax rebates for exporters, incentives to encourage consumption, more infrastructure projects and further cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for banks, which would free up more cash for them to extend as loans.
Although many economists say they believe that such measures will bolster economic growth later this year, many have cut their forecasts for China.
UBS, for example, lowered its forecast for 2012 on Friday to 7.5 percent from a previous projection of 8 percent. Its 2013 forecast was cut to 7.8 percent from 8.3 percent.

LOWVILLE, N.Y. -- ''Has anyone here ever had canned beef?''
Around the room, heads nodded, faces lighted up. Catherine Moore smiled.
''Canned beef is wonderful,'' she said. ''It's just the best.''
But before she led the dozen or so hunters and cooks to the kitchen where pint jars were waiting, Ms. Moore, a dietitian, had some warnings: do not use mayonnaise jars; leave an inch for expansion; do not cheat on processing time. 
She flashed slides to drive home her point: a mathematical equation of multiplying botulism cells; an Oregon family who lost 12 people to botulism around 1924.
''They think it was the green beans,'' Ms. Moore said.
Ms. Moore's preservation class was one of dozens offered over the weekend at the Cornell University Cooperative Extension of Lewis County's first Homesteading Fair, an event that drew 700 people to this small rural village about an hour north of Utica.
The fair is among hundreds of similar events across the country this month, including goat-keeping classes in Cherry Log, Ga., and cheese-making workshops in Santa Rosa, Calif., celebrating International Homesteading Education Month, a project of Mother Earth News and Grit magazine.
Whether driven by economic or environmental concerns, interest in sustainable living -- canning food, using solar power to live off the grid, gathering honey from a backyard beehive -- is booming.
Michele Ledoux, executive director of the Lewis County extension, said the fair was meant to support landowners who are wondering how to start small farms, raise animals and learn the preservation skills of a previous generation.
''So many people now are into learning back-to-land skills,'' Ms. Ledoux said. ''Maple sugaring is huge, canning is huge, what's old is new. Here, we tried to offer a broad perspective of workshops to really educate so people will know what they're getting into.''
While speakers offered hands-on lessons -- a horticulturalist layered lettuce and coffee into compost; a woman worked a spinning wheel for passers-by -- the workshops focused less on the romantic realities of owning animals and working the land and more on advice: chain-saw safety, deworming goats and what to do when chickens get lice.
By midday Saturday, Alexis Kadleck, 32, from Carthage, had heard about the basics of keeping sheep: the dangers of parasites, the need for fresh air and how to coax affection from the aloof animals (hand feeding them pretzels should do the trick).
''We moved here from Texas to seek out a cleaner, more sustainable lifestyle,'' Ms. Kadleck said. She and her husband, an aircraft mechanic at Fort Drum, are raising two daughters under the age of 3 with the goal of ''living as close to the earth as possible.''
She laughed. ''If I could grow wheat I would,'' she said.
The fair, held in picture-perfect barns at the Maple Ridge Center, drew visitors from northwestern New York, as well as Connecticut, Massachusetts and even Long Island.
Heidi and Andy DiGiovanni, frustrated by what they described as a lack of local offerings, drove six hours from Glen Cove, on Long Island, to attend.
''We're finding it harder and harder to try and sustain ourselves naturally,'' Ms. DiGiovanni, 54, said. A mother of three, she, like many other visitors, bemoaned the high costs of fresh produce and heating bills.
''I'm looking for different ideas that can work, that can raise the quality of life on Long Island.''
More than 50 people packed back-to-back lectures on energy efficiency and simple living by James Juczak, a self-described King of Scrounge from Adams Center, in nearby Jefferson County, who built his house -- round and topped with an earthen roof -- from scavenged and castoff materials: a masonry stove made from scrap cement, interior beams from a bowling alley.
Mr. Juczak spoke of his used $700 Mercedes, powered by vegetable oil, and the compost toilets he built in his guesthouse. He counseled the crowd to be aware of treasures too easily thrown away and then revealed a photo of his family's bicycle collection, most of which had been found in trash containers, left there for the crime of having flat tires.
Mr. Juczak shook his head.
''I don't know who these people are,'' he said, ''but I am really glad they exist.''

HEADLINE: Awaiting Clearer Signs, Investors Take Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market slipped on Monday as investors locked in gains from a recent rally, ahead of possible economic stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve this week, while weakness in Intel's shares weighed on the Nasdaq composite index.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last week closed at highs not seen in well over four years, motivating some investors to pull back from those gains on Monday before the Fed announces its decision on Thursday. 
''The markets are up a lot, so the short-term risks are on the downside,'' said Jim Awad, managing director at Zephyr Management in New York.
Investors are on guard against several events this week, including a ruling by Germany's constitutional court on Wednesday on the legality of the euro zone's permanent financial rescue fund, as well as the Fed's policy-making meeting.
Expectations for more monetary stimulus from central banks in the United States and Europe have underpinned markets in recent weeks.
Some traders expect the Fed to begin a third round of bond purchases this week in a renewed effort to revive the economy, and a number of economists said the weak report on jobs for August last Friday might convince Fed leaders that a looser monetary policy was needed soon.
Analysts said the uptrend for markets remained intact, and traders were eyeing the 1,440 level on the S.& P. 500 as the next barrier to further gains.
Michael Gibbs, co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James in Memphis, said that when central banks provided loose monetary conditions, there was basically a floor under stock prices. ''Any weakness that does develop should be somewhat contained,'' he said.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 52.35 points, or 0.4 percent, at 13,254.29. The S.& P. 500 declined 8.84 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,429.08. The Nasdaq dropped 32.4 points, or 1 percent, to 3,104.02.
The Federal Reserve reported on Monday that Americans cut their credit card use in July, as consumer borrowing fell $3.3 billion from June, to a seasonally adjusted $2.705 trillion.
Intel shares on Monday lost 93 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $23.26 after several brokerage firms cut their price targets. Shares in Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company by market value, dropped $17.70, or 2.6 percent, to $662.74, pulled down by the general weakness in technology stocks.
Investors sold some big-capitalization technology stocks that have done well all year. Worse-than-expected data on imports from China added to selling in the sector. Chinese import data showed a fall of 2.6 percent on the year in August, far short of expectations for a 3.5 percent increase. Exports grew 2.7 percent, below forecasts for a 3 percent rise, according to economists surveyed by Reuters.
Shares of the American International Group shed 69 cents, or 2 percent, to $33.30 after the Treasury Department said it would sell most of its stake in the company, making the government a minority investor for the first time since it provided a $182 billion lifeline to bail out the insurance company in the depths of the financial crisis four years ago.
Stock in Plains Exploration Production dropped $4.24, or 10.5 percent, to $36.09, after the company agreed to buy BP's stake in some deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells for $5.55 billion to increase its oil production. BP's American depositary receipts edged up 11 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $42.04.
In the bond market, interest rates slipped. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32, to 99 24/32, while its yield dropped to 1.65 percent, from 1.67 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: As Low Rates Depress Savers, Governments Reap the Benefits

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Liz Alderman and Elvire Camus contributed reporting, and Gu Huini contributed research.

 BODY:
A consumer complaint is ricocheting around the world: low interest rates are eating away at savings.
Bill Taren, a retiree near Orlando, Fla., discovered in August that his credit union would pay only 0.4 percent annual interest on his saving account, even though inflation averaged 2.8 percent over the last year. So he and his wife decided to just stuff their money in the mattress, he says, because at least there ''we can see the cash when we want.''
Jeanne and André Bussière, in Annecy, France, have a stable pension and a bank account that pays 2 percent interest -- ''almost nothing,'' they say -- even though the consumer price index rose an average of 2.5 percent over the last year.
Jiang Rong, an information technology professional in Xiamen, China, decided to dive back into the speculative real estate market rather than watch his savings wither at the bank. In China, too, the cost of living is outrunning savings, as local restaurants nearly double their prices. 
The fact that interest yields are so low in so many parts of the world is no coincidence. Rates are determined not only by markets, but also by government policy. And right now many governments say they have good reason to keep their own borrowing costs as low as they possibly can. Just last week, the government's report on job growth in the United States showed continued weakness, and an international forecasting group warned that the European economic powerhouse, Germany, will fall into recession later this year.
Though bad for people trying to live off their savings, low interest rates happen to be quite good for anyone borrowing money, like governments themselves. Over time, interest rates below the inflation rate allow governments to refinance, erode or liquidate their debt, making it easier to live within their budgets without having to resort to more unpalatable spending cuts or tax increases.
Along with keeping rates low, governments are using a variety of tactics to encourage captive audiences, like pension funds and banks, to buy their debt. Consumers, in other words, are subtly subsidizing governments without even knowing it. Economists have compared this phenomenon to a hidden tax on people's wealth.
''If you ask a central banker is that what you're doing, and why you're doing it, they'll say 'No, we're just trying to get the economy going by making it easier for the private sector to borrow,' '' said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse. ''But I have a syllogism for you: The government makes the rules. The government needs the money. So why should it surprise if the rules encourage you to lend the government money?''
This is not the first time governments have benefited by depressing interest rates, something economists refer to by the ominous name of ''financial repression.''
In the three and a half decades after World War II, interest rates in the developed world were on average below zero after adjusting for inflation, according to Carmen M. Reinhart, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. This helped Europe, the United States and Japan slowly whittle away much of their war debt as their economies grew faster than their debt burden.
''The difference is that the postwar period was one of strong growth, when rebuilding and capital investment was going on across the Continent, and there were strong demographics,'' said Stefan Hofrichter, the chief economist at Allianz Global Investors. ''But these elements are not necessarily in place today.''
For that reason, economists are less certain that the success of the strategy will be repeated.
Many major economies are already slowing down, if not outright contracting. And the actions taken by governments to keep interest rates low can restrain how much savers have to spend and force fragile banks and pension funds to take on more risk. Ultimately, it could crowd out private borrowing.
Governments have different mechanisms to keep their borrowing costs artificially low.
The Chinese government can just make a call to banks and dictate how much they will lend and at what interest rate.
''By forcing them to lend at low interest rates, China's central bank is taxing banks at high rates,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''They make it up to the banks by dictating that banks pay depositors even lower rates, so consumers are getting taxed too.''
Inflation-adjusted interest rates on one-year deposits have been below zero since late 2003, he said. China tightly controls how much money can leave the country, so individuals cannot seek higher yields elsewhere. As a result, Chinese families have been investing their growing incomes in real estate, which has led to a huge real estate bubble in some Chinese cities.
Democracies use more roundabout techniques.
''They have to work with their captive audiences -- the pension funds, domestic insurance policies, banks, any domestic buyers they can find -- to force-feed sovereign debt, sometimes under the euphemism of 'macroprudential regulation,' '' said Professor Reinhart.
Ireland and France, for example, have required or ''encouraged'' pension funds to invest in more government debt.
In Spain, fragile banks have been arm-twisted into lending to the government, which forces down the interest rates that the banks can pay to depositors. The Spanish government also capped the amount of cash that could be withdrawn from bank accounts, which prevented people from seeking higher yields elsewhere.
And in the United States, the Federal Reserve is buying up government debt to keep interest rates even lower than what markets would otherwise pay (and rates were low to begin with because investors from all over the world are buying up American debt because it seems relatively safe).
In the nearly four years that the Fed set its benchmark interest rate at zero, the government has saved trillions of dollars in interest payments. If interest rates today were what they were in 2007, the Treasury would be paying about twice as much to service its debt.
Inflation in the United States is very low by historical standards, but interest rates are so paltry that savers are losing money anyway.
''I got hit a couple of years ago pretty badly in the stock market, so now my savings are weighted mostly toward bonds,'' said Dorothy L. Brooks, 65, who lives in Garland, Tex., and retired about a decade ago. She recently decided to go back to work as an assistant at a local school. ''Now both investments are terrible. And I can't put my money in a money-market account because that's crazy. That just pays nothing.''
Of course, any economic policy will produce winners and losers, and it seems unlikely that policy makers are deliberately sacrificing retirees either to stimulate the economy or to grind down government debt. More likely, older Americans and other savers are just unintended casualties of policies aimed at other economic targets, particularly the policy making it easier for consumers and companies to borrow.
''If you care about the distribution effects of these policies, and being fairer to the elderly or other people, that seems to argue for carefully designed fiscal stimulus,'' said Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale. ''With fiscal stimulus you have more control over who gets taxed at what rate and so on. At least it's more transparent anyhow.''
But, he added, ''the whole reason we like using monetary policy is that it avoids those very political discussions of who gets taxed.''

HEADLINE: New York Is Lagging as Seas And Risks Rise, Critics Warn

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
With a 520-mile-long coast lined largely by teeming roads and fragile infrastructure, New York City is gingerly facing up to the intertwined threats posed by rising seas and ever-more-severe storm flooding.
So far, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has commissioned exhaustive research on the challenge of climate change. His administration is expanding wetlands to accommodate surging tides, installing green roofs to absorb rainwater and prodding property owners to move boilers out of flood-prone basements.
But even as city officials earn high marks for environmental awareness, critics say New York is moving too slowly to address the potential for flooding that could paralyze transportation, cripple the low-lying financial district and temporarily drive hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.
Only a year ago, they point out, the city shut down the subway system and ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people as Hurricane Irene barreled up the Atlantic coast. Ultimately, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and spared the city, but it exposed how New York is years away from -- and billions of dollars short of -- armoring itself. 
''They lack a sense of urgency about this,'' said Douglas Hill, an engineer with the Storm Surge Research Group at Stony Brook University, on Long Island.
Instead of ''planning to be flooded,'' as he put it, city, state and federal agencies should be investing in protection like sea gates that could close during a storm and block a surge from Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean into the East River and New York Harbor.
Others express concern for areas like the South Bronx and Sunset Park in Brooklyn, which have large industrial waterfronts with chemical-manufacturing plants, oil-storage sites and garbage-transfer stations. Unless hazardous materials are safeguarded with storm surges in mind, some local groups warn, residents could one day be wading through toxic water.
''A lot of attention is devoted to Lower Manhattan, but you forget that you have real industries on the waterfront'' elsewhere in the city, said Eddie Bautista, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, which represents low-income residents of industrial areas. ''We're behind in consciousness-building and disaster planning.''
Other cities are also tackling these issues, at their own pace.
New shoreline development around San Francisco Bay must now be designed to cope with the anticipated higher sea levels under new regional regulations imposed last fall. In Chicago, new bike lanes and parking spaces are made of permeable pavement that allows rainwater to filter through it. Charlotte, N.C., and Cedar Falls, Iowa, are restricting development in flood plains. Maryland is pressing shoreline property owners to plant marshland instead of building retaining walls.
Officials in New York caution that adapting a city of eight million people to climate change is infinitely more complicated and that the costs must be weighed against the relative risks of flooding. The last time a hurricane made landfall directly in New York City was more than a century ago.
Many decisions also require federal assistance, like updated flood maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that incorporate sea level rise, and agreement from dozens of public agencies and private partners that own transportation, energy, telecommunications and other infrastructure.
''It's a million small changes that need to happen,'' said Adam Freed, until August the deputy director of the city's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability. ''Everything you do has to be a calculation of the risks and benefits and costs you face.''
And in any case, Mr. Freed said, ''you can't make a climate-proof city.''
So city officials are pursuing a so-called resilience strategy that calls for strengthening the city's ability to weather the effects of serious flooding and recover from it.
Flooding Threat Grows
Unlike New Orleans, New York City is above sea level. Yet the city is second only to New Orleans in the number of people living less than four feet above high tide -- nearly 200,000 New Yorkers, according to the research group Climate Central.
The waters on the city's doorstep have been rising roughly an inch a decade over the last century as oceans have warmed and expanded. But according to scientists advising the city, that rate is accelerating, because of environmental factors, and levels could rise two feet higher than today's by midcentury. More frequent flooding is expected to become an uncomfortable reality.
With higher seas, a common storm could prove as damaging as the rare big storm or hurricane is today, scientists say. Were sea levels to rise four feet by the 2080s, for example, 34 percent of the city's streets could lie in the flood-risk zone, compared with just 11 percent now, a 2011 study commissioned by the state said.
New York has added bike lanes, required large buildings to track and reduce their energy use, banned the dirtiest home heating oils, and taken other steps to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming. But with shoreline development that ranges from public beaches to towering high rises -- and a complex mix of rivers, estuaries, bays and ocean -- the city needs to size up the various risks posed by rising seas before plunging ahead with vast capital projects or strict regulations, city officials argue.
Yet the city's plan for waterfront development dismisses any notion of retreat from the shoreline. Curbing development or buying up property in flood plains, as some smaller cities have done, is too impractical here, city officials say, especially because the city anticipates another million residents over the next two decades.
Rather, the city and its partners are incorporating flood-protection measures into projects as they go along.
Consolidated Edison, the utility that supplies electricity to most of the city, estimates that adaptations like installing submersible switches and moving high-voltage transformers above ground level would cost at least $250 million. Lacking the means, it is making gradual adjustments, with about $24 million spent in flood zones since 2007.
Some steps taken by city agencies have already subtly altered the city's looks. At Brooklyn Bridge Park, a buffer between the East River and neighborhoods like Dumbo, porous riprap rock and a soft edge of salt-resistant grass have been laid in to help absorb the punch of a storm surge. Sidewalk bioswales, or vegetative tree pits that can fill up with rainwater to reduce storm water and sewage overflows and also minimize flooding, are popping up around the city.
Over all, the city is hoping to funnel more than $2 billion of public and private money to such environmental projects over the next 18 years, officials say.
''It's a series of small interventions that cumulatively, over time, will take us to a more natural system'' to deal with climate change, said Carter H. Strickland, the city's environmental commissioner.
Planning experts say it is hard to muster public support for projects with uncertain or distant benefits.
''There's a lot of concern about angering developers,'' said Ben Chou, a water-policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
New York planners have proposed requiring developers to assess the climate-change risks faced by new buildings so they can consider protection like retractable watertight gates for windows. But no such requirements have been imposed so far.
While some new buildings are being elevated or going above current required flood protections -- like a new recycling plant on a Brooklyn pier and the Port Authority's transit hub at the World Trade Center site -- most new construction is not being adapted to future flood risks yet, industry representatives said.
Some experts argue that the encounter with Hurricane Irene last year and a flash flood in 2007 underscored the dangers of deferring aggressive solutions.
Klaus H. Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University's Earth Institute, said the storm surge from Irene came, on average, just one foot short of paralyzing transportation into and out of Manhattan.
If the surge had been just that much higher, subway tunnels would have flooded, segments of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and roads along the Hudson River would have turned into rivers, and sections of the commuter rail system would have been impassable or bereft of power, he said.
The most vulnerable systems, like the subway tunnels under the Harlem and East Rivers, would have been unusable for nearly a month, or longer, at an economic loss of about $55 billion, said Mr. Jacob, an adviser to the city on climate change and an author of the 2011 state study that laid out the flooding prospects.
''We've been extremely lucky,'' he said. ''I'm disappointed that the political process hasn't recognized that we're playing Russian roulette.''
With more rain and higher seas, some envision more turmoil -- like mile after mile of apartment buildings without working elevators, lights or potable water.
''That's a key vulnerability,'' said Rafael Pelli, a Manhattan architect who serves on a climate-change committee that advises the Department of City Planning. ''If you have to relocate 10,000 people, how do you do that?''
Barriers to Block Tides
Some New Yorkers argue that the answer lies not in evacuation, but in prevention, like armoring city waterways with the latest high-tech barriers. Others are not so sure.
At a recent meeting of Manhattan community board leaders in Harlem, Robert Trentlyon, a resident of Chelsea, argued for sea gates.
A 2004 study by Mr. Hill and the Storm Surge Research Group at Stony Brook recommended installing movable barriers at the upper end of the East River, near the Throgs Neck Bridge; under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge; and at the mouth of the Arthur Kill, between Staten Island and New Jersey. During hurricanes and northeasters, closing the barriers would block a huge tide from flooding Manhattan and parts of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and New Jersey, they said.
City officials say that sea barriers are among the options being studied, but others say such gates could interfere with aquatic ecosystems and with the flushing out of pollutants, and may eventually fail as sea levels keep rising.
And then there is the cost. Installing barriers for New York could reach nearly $10 billion.
There is more agreement on how to protect the subway system. Several studies have advised the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to move quickly to increase pumping capacity at stations, raise entrances and design floodgates to block water from entering.
In 2009, a commission warned that global warming posed ''a new and potentially dire challenge for which the M.T.A. system is largely unprepared.''
Five years ago, a summer-morning deluge brought about 3 1/2 inches of rain in two hours and paralyzed the system for hours, stranding 2.5 million riders.
That prompted the transit agency to spend $34 million on improvements like raising some ventilation grates nine inches above sidewalks and building steps that head upward, before descending, at flood-prone stations. All the money came from the agency's capital budget, which also pays for subway cars and buses.
''This is a vicious circle of the worst kind,'' Projjal Dutta, the transportation agency's director of sustainability, said of the financial effect. ''You're cutting public transportation, which cuts down greenhouse gases, to harden against climate change.''

HEADLINE: Plot Twist In a Bailout: It Worked

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
"Some people just don't like movies with happy endings."
That's what the White House said about Neil Barofsky, then the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, when he complained two years ago that the Treasury Department was fudging its math about its investment in the American International Group.
At the time, the Treasury Department said that it was likely to lose only about $5 billion on the bailout. Mr. Barofsky declared that the number was "manipulated" as part of a "publicity campaign touting the positive aspects of TARP" ahead of the midterm elections. 
Fast forward to this week. The Treasury Department announced it planned to sell $18 billion of its A.I.G. stake, putting it on a path to actually turn a profit. It was a remarkable feat and one that nobody - including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner - anticipated four years ago at the peak of the crisis during the $180 billion bailout of the company.
Critics of the A.I.G. bailout - it was the most loathed of the rescues and a centerpiece of the Occupy Wall Street movement - had insisted it was going to be a huge black hole.
Given the latest news, I called Mr. Barofsky to see if he had any regrets about his earlier pronouncements now that the rescue of A.I.G. appeared profitable.
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! They are not making money!" Mr. Barofsky, now a senior fellow at New York University School of Law, said when I reached him. "They are on the path to very significant losses!"
What?
Mr. Barofsky, who recently wrote a scathing book about the Treasury Department called "Bailout," refused to admit defeat, saying, "I was right then and I am right now."
He said that the government is "really engaged in half-truths and creative accounting." After that assertion, he quickly followed up with, "Is the timing keyed to the election?"
Mr. Barofsky continues to claim the Treasury Department is playing fast and loose with how it calculates profitability. The Treasury says its break-even cost for A.I.G. shares is $28.73, so that any sale of shares at a higher price - the government is selling its A.I.G. shares for $32.50 - means it stands to make a profit.
Mr. Barofsky says that calculation is "absurd." He says the real break-even price for TARP is $43.53 a share. But Mr. Barofsky - and other critics of the bailout that have sought to portray the rescue effort as a money-losing failure - may be engaged in half-truths and creative accounting of their own.
Mr. Barofsky is focusing on how much the government paid through the TARP program for A.I.G. shares, not how much the taxpayer will ultimately make - including through a separate investment made by the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Barofsky is technically correct that if you isolate the original cost to TARP for its investment in A.I.G., $43.53 a share is the break-even number.
But that conveniently excludes the huge stake that the Federal Reserve received in exchange for its original $85 billion rescue in September 2008. The Federal Reserve's stake was later rolled into the Treasury's stake through a series of complicated transactions.
If you include the TARP stake and the Federal Reserve stake, the break-even sale price for A.I.G. shares is the $28.73 that the Treasury has proclaimed.
And that's the number that taxpayers should care about.
Mr. Barofsky, however, told me that "it's just not accurate" for me or anyone else to accept Treasury's view of profitability because "they mixed the pot."
He explained: "The Fed's cost basis is zero and they essentially gifted the shares to Treasury," adding that the government should disclose its math. "It's a question of transparency."
When Mr. Barofsky first raised this issue in 2010, the White House, in a rare rebuke of an inspector general, said he had "sought to generate a false controversy over A.I.G. to try and grab a few, cheap headlines."
As we approach the four-year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rescue of A.I.G. next week, sadly, much of the public - and people like Mr. Barofsky, as well-intentioned as he is - are still criticizing and debating the merits of the bailout. It's almost become a cottage industry.
In his book, Mr. Barofsky wrote, "Treasury's desperate attempt to bail out Wall Street was setting the country up for potentially catastrophic losses."
As distasteful as the rescue effort was, it should be clear by now that without it, we faced an economic Armageddon. And the results thus far of bailing out the big banks, and A.I.G., indicate a profit.
The Government Accountability Office, which is not swayed by politics, estimated in May that taxpayers will receive a profit of about $15 billion from the A.I.G. bailout. That includes the profit the Fed had already made as part of the broader rescue. There may still be parts of the bailouts to debate: how they were executed, whether they were as effective as they could have been and, perhaps, whether taxpayers should have received an even bigger return for their investments given the risk.
But on the whole, the rescue of A.I.G. - often called a backdoor bailout of Wall Street - should be considered a success.
Toward the end of my phone call, Mr. Barofsky said it himself: "The government had no choice but to bail out A.I.G." Then he added that Treasury's sale of A.I.G. stock "is unambiguously good news for the country."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Plasma Gasification Raises Hopes of Clean Energy From Garbage

BYLINE: By RANDY LEONARD

 BODY:
David Robau tours the country promoting a system that sounds too good to be true: It devours municipal garbage, recycles metals, blasts toxic contaminants and produces electricity and usable byproducts -- all with drastic reductions in emissions.
Mr. Robau, an environmental scientist for the Air Force, has been promoting a method that was developed with the Air Force to dispose of garbage with neither the harmful byproducts of conventional incineration nor the environmental impact of transporting and burying waste. It is one of several innovative techniques that the United States military has been researching to provide alternatives to the open-pit burns that some veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars say have made them ill.
Already some waste companies and cities like New York have shown an interest in technology similar to what Mr. Robau has been promoting, known as plasma arc gasification. Proponents say the process can break chemical bonds and destroy medical waste, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), asbestos and hydrocarbons, some of which can be hazardous if disposed of in landfills or traditional mass-burn incinerators.
Still, some environmentalists are leery. They say the ability to fully dispose of waste will discourage recycling and the development of renewable products, and the gasification will still result in toxic substances like dioxins. 
Mr. Robau maintains that the process is earth-friendly. ''This is not incineration,'' he said. ''This is gasification, so it's a lot cleaner, a lot better for the environment.''
Mr. Robau, who also heads a nonprofit organization based in Gulf Breeze, Fla., has overseen testing of the small-scale plasma arc gasification system, which cracks complex molecules into simple elements using energy as intense as the sun's surface, making fuel for about 350 kilowatts of electricity from about 10 tons of garbage each day, enough to run the system.
The system has been hard at work in a 6,400-square-foot building at Hurlburt Field Air Force base in Florida's panhandle. A mechanical shredder cuts household garbage into pieces no bigger than two inches. An airtight auger feeds the waste into an oxygen-poor gasification chamber, where temperatures reach more than 9,000 degrees.
In an instant, wood disintegrates, plastics turn to gas. Bits of metal and glass fall into a molten pool.
From two graphite electrodes, an arc of electricity leaps about a foot to the molten slag, producing a cloud of ionized particles known as plasma, which heats the chamber. Most heavier metals settle to the bottom of the pool, below a layer of liquid silica and other oxides. The metals are removed, cooled and used for steel or other products.
''Effectively, 100 percent of all the metals on the base are being recycled,'' Mr. Robau said.
The liquid oxides are removed and form a glassy solid when cooled. The slag traps contaminants like errant lead molecules and other heavy metals in a vitreous matrix that takes up 1 percent of the volume of the original waste, Mr. Robau said, a tenth of the volume left over after traditional incineration.
The vitrified component meets standards for disposal and may even be suitable for use as a construction aggregate, according to Mr. Robau and other industry professionals.
In the chamber, organic gases break down into hydrogen and carbon monoxide -- the components of a fuel called synthesis gas, or syngas -- which exits the furnace.
The gas passes through a plasma torch polisher, which breaks down remaining complex molecules and soot.
Injected water cools the syngas to less than 200 degrees. The extreme temperature of the plasma followed by quick cooling inhibits the formation of dioxins and furans (another organic compound), according to Mr. Robau and other industry experts.
The lack of dioxin creation would be a benefit over traditional incinerators and other types of gasifiers, in which lower temperatures and incomplete burning result in toxic compounds.
Emissions rules forced a 99 percent cut in dioxin and furan emissions and a 96 percent reduction in mercury from traditional incinerators between 1990 and 2005, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, companies have to dispose of the toxic ash filtered from mass-burn facilities.
After water quenches the gas in the Hurlburt system, stripping processes produce sodium bisulfate and hydrochloric acid, which can be sold, Mr. Robau said.
The gas passes through three types of filters to catch remaining impurities. The resulting syngas is as clean or cleaner than natural gas, and the system produces less than half the nitrogen oxides and 5 percent of the sulfur oxides and mercury of a traditional incinerator, Mr. Robau said. The Air Force uses the syngas to produce enough electricity to power the system.
Companies have used plasma arc technology in steel refining for more than a century. Some small-scale plasma gasifiers are specialized to process materials like asbestos or medical waste.
In Japan, a plasma facility originally designed to zap residue from automobile shredding now handles up to 150 tons of municipal solid waste each day in the city of Utashinai. And construction on a plant of similar size, designed to process industrial waste and wood chips, wrapped up this summer in Morcenx, in southern France.
Companies have been eying plasma gasification of municipal waste with eager hopes, but until recently financing has lagged. Plasma facilities are expensive, and the energy-hungry arcs and torches can consume half of the generated electricity. On the other hand, the systems can also handle medical and hazardous waste, which can command two to four times the fees associated with municipal waste.
''The problem has been over the years trying to find that economic sweet spot,'' said Joe Vaillancourt, who evaluates newer technologies for Waste Management, a $15.4 billion company with headquarters in Texas.
In the past five years, with increased interest in energy independence and sustainability, venture capitalists and companies have financed testing of small-scale systems, including a 25-ton system built and run by InEnTec in Arlington, Ore., Mr. Vaillancourt said. Waste Management now holds an equity stake in InEnTec.
Last month the Agriculture Department announced a conditional $105 million loan guarantee for Fulcrum BioEnergy to build a much larger system outside Reno, Nev. It will use three InEnTec plasma melters to process 400 tons of garbage a day, an unprecedented scale for a plasma municipal waste facility, said Mr. Vaillancourt and others in the industry. Fulcrum plans to create ethanol from the syngas, and expects the Reno plant to be running in 2014.
New York City, too, is looking for innovative technology to deal with some of the city's waste. In March, the Bloomberg administration requested proposals to build a facility that would use newer techniques like plasma gasification or anaerobic digestion to process as much as 900 tons of garbage a day.
''New Yorkers want their trash to be handled in an environmentally friendly way,'' said Caswell F. Holloway, deputy mayor for operations. ''Anything would be better than putting it in the ground.'' The city is reviewing the proposals.
Still, some environmental groups, like the Sierra Club and the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, lump these techniques in with traditional incinerators, claiming that they still produce dioxin. They also oppose renewable energy credits for these facilities.
Allen Hershkowitz, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he believed there was a place for waste-to-energy operations, but only after recycling and composting programs had been maximized.
He said he still believed that communities could reach recycling rates of 60 to 70 percent. In his view it is premature for a city like New York, with a recycling rate of about 15 percent, to be considering setting up a new waste facility. ''They're not even at the point where they should be thinking about waste-to-energy,'' Mr. Hershkowitz said.

HEADLINE: Master Campaigner Summons the Spotlight for Obama (and Himself)

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Elvis is back in the building, and everyone is singing from his song sheet. Twelve years after leaving the White House, four years after his wife's failed presidential campaign and six days after his well-received convention speech, Bill Clinton is hitting the campaign trail as the role model both sides claim to emulate.
Energized by his return to the stage, Mr. Clinton has agreed to barnstorm battleground states like Florida starting Tuesday for President Obama, who has embraced the former president and appropriated his best lines. But as Mr. Clinton promotes his fellow Democrat, Republicans promote him as everything Mr. Obama is not, a ''real president,'' as Newt Gingrich put it, not a ''pretender'' like the incumbent. 
Mr. Clinton's encore performance is the latest in a political drama that has played out again and again over a quarter century. The spotlight has a way of following him even when he is not in the leading role. For days, some Democrats have lamented that Mr. Clinton outshines the president he is trying to help, a conclusion Mitt Romney has encouraged. Along the way, Mr. Clinton has reinvented himself as a bipartisan figure from a mythical era of across-the-aisle cooperation.
Indeed, just a day before he hits the trail as a campaign surrogate, Mr. Clinton announced Monday that both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have agreed to address his annual philanthropic gathering, known as the Clinton Global Initiative, this month. Perhaps only Mr. Clinton could bash the other party's nominee one day and host him the next.
Mr. Clinton's campaign involvement underscores an alliance of expedience with Mr. Obama. Whatever their past tensions, Mr. Obama has concluded the race is tight enough that he needs Mr. Clinton and will swallow whatever tradeoffs come with that, including the inevitable unflattering comparisons and the off-message comments that cause temporary dustups.
David Axelrod, the president's strategist, said Mr. Clinton is a useful surrogate because the prosperity of the 1990s gives him credibility when he backs Mr. Obama's economic program. ''We will take as much of his time as he's able to give between now and November to help spread the word,'' Mr. Axelrod said.
The day of Mr. Clinton's address at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., represented one of the campaign's largest online fund-raising hauls, aides said.
Mr. Clinton has agreed to campaign as often as his schedule allows, aides said, with potential trips to Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire in addition to the two-day Florida visit starting Tuesday. He has agreed to fund-raising events on the East and West Coasts in October and to appear in more campaign commercials.
''He'll do whatever the president asks him to do and be very happy to do it,'' said Joe Lockhart, his former White House press secretary and one of many longtime advisers consulted on the final edit of Mr. Clinton's convention speech.
Still, for all the energy Democrats drew from his convention speech, Mr. Clinton is hardly guaranteed to transfer his popularity to others. He made more than 100 campaign stops during the 2010 midterm elections, but could not stop Republicans from sweeping to a landmark victory in taking the House and gaining seats in the Senate.
In typical Clinton form, much of his convention speech was extemporaneous. The text fed into the teleprompter was just a little more than 3,000 words, while the version he delivered topped 5,000 words. Many of the most memorable lines were not in the text; in effect, Mr. Clinton ad-libbed back in much of the material the campaign had edited out.
The result was an address that by some measures overshadowed Mr. Obama's the next day. Republicans, eager to drive a wedge between the men, tried to fuel that assessment.
''He really did elevate the Democrat convention in a lot of ways,'' Mr. Romney said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, ''and frankly the contrast may not have been as attractive as Barack Obama might have preferred.''
Mr. Gingrich, who as House speaker was Mr. Clinton's main nemesis during the 1990s, said on CNN's ''State of the Union'' on Sunday that the former president's speech was ''eerily anti-Obama if you listened to the subtext,'' because in recalling his own accomplishments, he seemed to diminish the current president.
If Mr. Obama was bothered, he has not shown it. At campaign stops since the convention, he has cited Mr. Clinton. ''Somebody e-mailed me after the speech and said, 'You need to appoint him secretary of explaining stuff,' '' Mr. Obama told an audience in Portsmouth, N.H.
But the narrative around Mr. Clinton as some sort of representative of a more cooperative age seems a product of calculation and fuzzy memories. ''It wasn't exactly that way, no,'' said Robert Walker, a leading House Republican at the time. ''A lot was forced on him.''
When he did compromise with Republicans, Mr. Walker said, it was ''very reluctantly.''
Mr. Clinton's presidency was marked by titanic partisan battles. His first budget plan passed without a single Republican vote, and he was impeached for giving false testimony under oath about his affair with a former intern, Monica S. Lewinsky. Even when the two sides arrived at a mutual goal, it involved great conflict. Mr. Clinton signed a welfare overhaul bill only after vetoing the first two, and a balanced budget deal in his second term was reached only after a budget deadlock that shut the government in his first.
''The difference between the '90s and now is the bipartisan cooperation only occurred after partisan Armageddon,'' said Joel P. Johnson, a former counselor to Mr. Clinton. ''Everyone crawled out of the crater and got back together.''
Today, he said, they remain in the crater.

CHANGE OF PLANS The Commodity Futures Trading Commission scrapped plans to publicly enact rules intended to protect customer cash after the agency's chairman was hospitalized over the weekend. 
Gary Gensler, left, who is overhauling an array of financial rules as head of the regulatory agency, cracked several ribs on Sunday when he fell at his Maryland home. He remains in the hospital, although his spokesman called it ''a precaution.'' BEN PROTESS
UNWINDING BAILOUTS The Treasury Department announced on Sunday the biggest sale yet of its holdings in the American International Group, taking its stake below 50 percent.
It is a big step in unwinding one of the most contentious bailouts of the financial crisis. But there are other rescue programs to dismantle. The government still owns about 32 percent of General Motors and 74 percent of Ally Financial, formerly known as GMAC. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED
ON THE MARKET J. Michael Evans, below, a Goldman Sachs vice chairman, paid $27 million this summer for a Fifth Avenue apartment. Yet, he still owned a 5,000-square-foot penthouse duplex off Central Park West.
Mr. Evans will list his Upper West Side condominium for $26 million this week, according to people familiar with his plans. He has also put up for sale another apartment that he owns in the building -- the Park Laurel at 15 West 63rd Street -- for $2.75 million. PETER LATTMAN

HEADLINE: It Will Be Tricky for Romney to Keep Best of Health Law While Repealing It

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney's pledge to guarantee access to health insurance for people with longstanding medical problems confused some experts and highlighted the difficulty of repealing the new health care law while keeping some of its popular features.
''I'm not getting rid of all of health care reform,'' Mr. Romney said over the weekend on the NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''Of course, there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I'm going to put in place. One is to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage.'' 
Mr. Romney did not explain a significant feature of his proposal: he would explicitly guarantee insurance for people with existing conditions only if they have maintained coverage without a significant gap. That could exclude millions of Americans with medical problems like cancer, heart disease and asthma.
This qualification was clear in a statement that Mr. Romney issued in March, when he called for repeal of the 2010 law and presented his own vision for health care. Mr. Romney said then that he would ''prevent discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions who maintain continuous coverage.'' Thus, aides to Mr. Romney said, he was not breaking new ground with his comments over the weekend.
Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said Monday that Mr. Romney's comments were misleading because they left an impression that he supported protections for people with existing conditions like those in President Obama's health care overhaul.
And what about people with medical problems who have never had health insurance or have had a gap in coverage for months or years?
Mr. Romney says many of them could obtain coverage through health plans known as high-risk pools. Many states have such pools, which generally operate at a loss. And the federal government is running a high-risk pool, as a temporary measure under the new health care law, in more than 20 states.
Mr. Romney has not said whether or how he would regulate premiums or subsidize the costs of coverage in a high-risk pool.
''It will need to be subsidized,'' said Gail R. Wilensky, a Republican who ran Medicare and Medicaid in the first Bush administration. ''Otherwise, people who are predictably high users of health care cannot get health insurance or can get it only at very high cost.''
Prof. Joseph P. Newhouse, a health economist at Harvard, said that guaranteeing insurance to people with existing conditions could work without a mandate as long as sufficiently large subsidies were offered as an incentive for everyone, healthy or sick, to buy coverage. Mr. Romney would offer a tax break to people who buy insurance individually in the open market, so they could enjoy an advantage like that available to workers who get insurance through their employers.
''I think the mandate is not as important as the level of subsidies,'' Mr. Newhouse said. ''If the subsidies are large enough, people will buy in.''
Under Mr. Obama's health care law, the federal government will subsidize the purchase of private health insurance for many low- and middle-income people, starting in 2014. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the government will spend $1 trillion on subsidies from 2014 to 2022.
In addition, the Obama administration is counting on large numbers of healthy people to buy insurance and pay premiums that will help defray the costs of care for people with chronic or catastrophic illnesses or disabilities. Without a pool that includes many healthy people, insurance does not work, insurers say.
A 1996 federal law already limits the ability of health plans to exclude coverage for existing conditions. But under that law, consumers may lose some of their rights if, for example, they do not buy an individual insurance policy within 63 days of losing group coverage.
The Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, estimates that 36 million to 122 million adults under 65 have existing conditions. As many as 17 million of them lack insurance.
Breaks in coverage are common. A recent report by the Commonwealth Fund found that 89 million Americans went without health insurance for at least one month in the period from 2004 to 2007, perhaps because they had lost jobs, been divorced or lost eligibility for a public insurance program. Of those, 23 million saw their insurance lapse more than once in the four-year period.
The accountability office has analyzed ways of encouraging people to obtain insurance without a mandate. An alternative cited by many experts is a late enrollment penalty, like the ones in Medicare. Under Medicare, beneficiaries may have to pay higher premiums if they delay enrollment beyond the time when they first become eligible.
James C. Capretta, a health policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, has endorsed the idea of guaranteeing access to insurance for people who maintain continuous coverage. ''What happens to people who have been outside the health insurance system and want to get in?'' Mr. Capretta asked. ''There should be an opportunity, a window of time, during which they can enter the system and secure this new right.''

HEADLINE: Coming-Of-Age Tale for Chinese Cinema

BYLINE: By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW

 BODY:
China's film business is booming, and foreign filmmakers have long been eager for a piece of the fastest-growing major movie market in the world. But piracy, censorship and a confusing, centrally planned industry that is instinctively hostile to foreign-made products have made it a tough market to crack.
Yet there are signs that something is shifting.
After years when going to the movies meant sitting in a drafty hall or a village square watching a film chosen by a local government committee, the Chinese middle class has embraced the idea of taking in a movie as leisure activity -- one in which, increasingly, they want to choose their fare from an array of global offerings. 
Chinese filmmakers, too, are slowly changing their view of foreign filmmakers from invaders to partners in expanding the market for all their products. A growing number of alliances attests to the shift in attitude. And the government, while still fiercely protecting the domestic industry, is starting to soften its stance because it wants China's cultural importance in the world to match its economic prowess.
China's moviegoing market is still relatively small -- total ticket sales were just over $2 billion last year, compared with the $10 billion spent in the United States -- but it is growing fast, by 40 percent every year, according to the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, known as Sarft.
Revenue from film advertising is expected to rise to 20.6 billion renminbi, or $3.24 billion, this year from 16.8 billion in 2011, according to Entgroup, an industry research firm.
The country is also becoming a global player. That was underlined in May when Dalian Wanda Group bought AMC Entertainment, the second-largest U.S. theater chain, after Regal Entertainment Group, for $2.6 billion to become the world's biggest cinema owner. It was also the biggest purchase of a U.S. company by a Chinese company to date.
A major vote of confidence in the increased internationalization of the Chinese market came in August, when James Cameron announced he was setting up a Chinese unit of his Cameron Pace Group production company.
Mr. Cameron, director of two of the three biggest-grossing films of all time in China -- ''Avatar'' ($208 million) and ''Titanic 3D'' ($153 million) -- is one of the few foreign filmmakers whose name is recognizable to Chinese people. Cameron Pace Group will offer Chinese filmmakers three-dimensional camera technology but will not be involved immediately in producing films.
Driving the rise of the Chinese film market has been a remarkable increase in the number of cinemas, largely due to a construction boom in commercial property that saw shopping malls, with shiny new cinema multiplexes, spring up in nearly every city.
Last year there were 803 new theaters and 3,030 screens added, an average of 8.3 new screens a day, for a total of 2,800 movie theaters and 9,200 screens across the country. Analysts expect the number of screens to reach nearly 12,000 by the end of the year, the slowdown in the real estate market notwithstanding.
The China-Hollywood co-production engine has been gathering steam since February, when, under pressure from Hollywood and the World Trade Organization, China agreed to raise the quota of imported movies by 14 films, to around 34, including 3D and Imax movies.
The deal was brokered by Xi Jinping, China's vice president, who is widely expected to take over as president in a leadership changeover later this year. The deal also raised the amount of the box-office revenue that reverts to the studios, to 25 percent from around 16 percent.
Half a year later, the changes are showing benefits. According to official data from Sarft, total box-office receipts in China in the first half of the year are up 40 percent from a year earlier, to 8.07 billion renminbi.
Raising the quotas has increased pressure on domestic filmmakers because around two-thirds of ticket sales in the first half came from foreign films, and nine of the top 10 were from Hollywood -- a result the Chinese news media labeled ''a crushing defeat'' and ''rather embarrassing.''
Domestic filmmakers know it. ''China has to improve the quality of domestic films,'' said Xue Lin, vice president of Enlight Pictures, a private production company. ''The output is enough'' -- more than 600 films will be produced in China this year, he said, ''but the quality isn't.''
Officially, Beijing is backing the domestic film industry as part of broader efforts to increase China's ''soft power,'' or match its growing economic muscle in the cultural sphere. In the 12th Five-Year Plan, presented last year, the government committed itself to ''deepening reform of China's cultural industries.''
Sometimes that support looks like protectionism. For example, the government has arranged for three major Hollywood films -- ''The Amazing Spider-Man,'' ''The Dark Knight Rises'' and ''Prometheus'' -- to open within a week of each other this autumn. The timing benefited a Chinese film, ''Painted Skin: The Resurrection,'' which was released during the summer and became the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time, bringing in nearly $108 million.
In fact, the Hollywood-China relationship is warming so fast that film officials are getting cold feet. The deputy head of Sarft, Zhang Peiming, told domestic media in late August that some Chinese-foreign co-productions were ''getting around the quota system, taking domestic investment away and threatening Chinese movies.'' Mr. Zhang warned that co-productions must have one-third of their funding from China, the main cast must be Chinese, and part of the movie must be shot in China.
The Chinese film industry does still feel under siege in part because Chinese films, unlike foreign films, also must grapple with widespread piracy in their home market. That means that most Chinese movies are unable to make any money in China beyond what they earn at the box office. Foreign films, by contrast, sell into a global marketplace.
That is one reason that Chinese filmmakers believe cooperation across borders is the way forward, and that ties with foreign producers are multiplying as a means of mutual market access.
In May, News Corp. bought a 20 percent stake in Bona Film Group, a leading Chinese private production company. In August, DreamWorks Animation said it would team up with its state-owned Chinese partners to co-produce the next installment in the ''Kung Fu Panda'' franchise in China in 2016.
DreamWorks' rival, Walt Disney, has also announced co-production deals in China. It said the third part of its ''Iron Man'' franchise would be co-produced with DMG Entertainment, which is based in Beijing and Los Angeles.
Even the hedge fund crowd is getting into the act. Legendary Pictures, a production studio founded by Thomas Tull, a private equity investor, has named Peter Loehr, the former director of the Beijing office of the Creative Artists Agency, the head of Legendary East, which aims to make blockbuster co-productions that work in China and the rest of the world.
Han Sanping, president of the China Film Group, a state-owned entity that oversees the release of imported films, has spoken about the importance of achieving a balance between making good Chinese movies and importing quality films.
''We must try and attract more foreign technologists, expertise, producers, investors, distributors, directors, actors and artists, to come and collaborate with us on high-quality co-productions,'' Mr. Han said. ''And then learn from them.''

HEADLINE: The Shallow End of the Campaign

 BODY:
If the first weekend of Mitt Romney's general election campaign is any indication, the country is in for eight weeks of wild, often random answers to some of the most important policy questions. Voters trying to understand the positions of Mr. Romney and Representative Paul Ryan are going to have a harder time than ever.
On issue after issue raised in the first weekend of interviews after the conventions, Romney and Ryan actively tried to obscure their positions, as if a clear understanding of their beliefs about taxes, health care or spending would scare away anyone who was listening. Aware that President Obama's policies in these areas are quite popular once people learn about them, the Republicans are simply sowing confusion. Here are a few examples: 
HEALTH CARE After more than a year of denouncing Mr. Obama's health care law, Mr. Romney said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC on Sunday that maybe parts of it weren't so bad. ''There are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I'm going to put in place,'' he said, such as coverage of pre-existing conditions.
There's just one problem: guaranteeing coverage to people with serious diseases means that sick people would sign up en masse for coverage, driving premiums up for everyone. That's why Mr. Obama's law required everyone to have insurance to spread the risk around.
Mr. Romney remains opposed to the mandate (though he supported it in Massachusetts). So his campaign was forced to issue a clarification: he supports coverage for pre-existing conditions only for those with continuous insurance coverage. That jettisons sick people who have lost their jobs or never had coverage. It's been the law since 1996. But those who only watched the interview won't know that.
TAXES As an important independent tax study showed, Mr. Romney's plan to cut tax rates for the wealthy by 20 percent and offset the lost money by eliminating loopholes won't work because there aren't enough available loopholes to make up for the rate cut. Taxes on the middle class would have to go up to keep the plan from lowering overall revenues.
Asked about this on ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Romney said the study was wrong and promised that the plan would work. He cited a Harvard study, among others, that backed him. But that Harvard study, by Martin Feldstein, Ronald Reagan's chief economist, does no such thing. As The Washington Post has noted, Mr. Feldstein's study showed Mr. Romney's plan would require substantial tax increases on taxpayers making between $100,000 and $200,000, which most people would consider the upper end of the middle class.
DEFENSE SPENDING On ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, Mr. Ryan tried to wriggle out of admitting that he voted for the law that led to the sequester of $500 billion in defense spending that he is now blaming on Mr. Obama. He told the interviewer, Norah O'Donnell, that she was mistaken in stating the plain fact of his vote. He fully supported the Republican Party's decision to hold the government's credit rating hostage for spending cuts and is trying to hide from that.
Mr. Romney thought the weak economy would give him a pass on specifics. But voters expect answers, and the Republicans are demonstrating only shallowness.

HEADLINE: In Standoff, Latest Sign of Unions Under Siege

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The high-stakes strike by 26,000 public school teachers in Chicago is only the latest episode in which the nation's teachers' unions have been thrown on the defensive in the face of demands for far-reaching changes.
In community after community -- even in major cities with strong pro-union traditions, like Los Angeles and Philadelphia -- teachers' unions have faced a push for concessions, whether it is to scrap tenure protections or to rely heavily on student test results to determine who gets a raise and who gets fired.
And now comes this high-profile showdown in President Obama's own hometown, a labor stronghold. Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic mayor and Mr. Obama's former chief of staff, is demanding a raft of concessions that are anathema to union leaders and their members. At the same time, with many teachers and their unions already viewed unfavorably by many Americans, the union is taking a gamble by engaging in a battle over changes that some education advocates believe are needed to improve the nation's schools.
The battle underlines just how much teachers' unions, which have provided sizable donations and many grass-roots volunteers to countless Democratic campaigns, have been thrown back on their heels in recent years. 
If the famously feisty Mr. Emanuel wins this confrontation, he could set the table for a major setback for teachers' unions nationwide and a potential rethinking of teachers' enthusiasm for Democrats in this year's elections. Advocates of sweeping education changes like Michelle Rhee, the former head of the school system in Washington, will be able to declare that if Chicago's mighty union was willing to accept such changes, so should teachers' union locals across the nation.
''The teachers' unions are on the defensive on many more fronts than they used to be,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., a longtime education analyst who heads the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education policy group in Washington. ''It used to be they could just fight vouchers and charter schools. But now they face this huge set of issues,'' not to mention budgetary pressures that have caused large-scale layoffs. Weakening the unions' leverage and ranks, more than 300,000 school employees have lost their jobs since the recession ended in June 2009.
The 1960s and 1970s in many ways were the heyday of teachers' unions. Membership exploded as many states gave public school teachers the right to bargain collectively, turning the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers into two of the nation's largest unions. Together, they have 4.5 million members.
Governors and mayors rushed to do them favors, and their campaign dollars have often helped elect union-friendly school boards. But while those two giant unions still pack quite a punch in federal, state and local political campaigns, their winning percentage in legislative fights has fallen in recent years as frustration with low-performing schools and rising property taxes has exploded, and as Republicans have won control of far more governor's mansions and legislatures.
And two recent movies have hit teachers' unions hard, ''Waiting for 'Superman' '' and ''Won't Back Down,'' casting them as villains whose inflexibility has kept many schools and students from improving.
''Clearly the teachers' unions are under attack and under siege,'' said Diane Ravitch, an education historian at New York University who often defends the unions. ''There is almost this full-court press by the right against the teachers' unions.''
She said many conservative groups, like the American Legislative Exchange Council, were eager to weaken teachers' unions because they view them as powerful political supporters of Democrats and bothersome opponents of budget cuts.
What happened in Wisconsin last year was an undeniable watershed for teachers' unions. Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law that severely restricts the ability of public sector unions to bargain collectively. In an embarrassing defeat, unions failed in their effort to oust Mr. Walker in a recall vote in June. But last November, teachers' unions did help persuade a majority of Ohio voters to repeal a similar law.
Eager to improve Chicago's schools, Mr. Emanuel has taken several steps -- among them pressing the school board to rescind a promised 4 percent raise -- and made numerous demands that have infuriated the Chicago Teachers Union. He wants student test performance to count heavily in evaluating teachers for tenure, even though the union insists that is a highly unreliable way to assess teachers. And with Mr. Emanuel intent on shuttering dozens of poorly performing schools, the union is pressing him to agree to strong provisions to reinstate teachers in other schools when theirs are closed.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the parent union of the striking teachers, acknowledged that her union was on the defensive. But she said it had gotten the message that it needed to do more to embrace changes to improve the nation's schools. She has repeatedly boasted of innovative contracts like the one in New Haven, which softens tenure protections and calls for steps to improve underperforming teachers, and Cincinnati, where the union is working closely with the school board to train teachers for new, tougher core standards.
Still, Mr. Finn, the analyst, said that while there were some showcase contracts, teachers' union locals in various cities -- he pointed to Los Angeles -- continued to strongly resist change.
He said the Chicago walkout would sully the image of teachers' unions. ''It's probably about the dumbest thing they could do from a national standpoint,'' he said. ''It will remind everybody that teachers' unions are about teachers, not kids.''
Ms. Weingarten said the Chicago strike did not mean that the union was truculent in resisting change. Rather, she said, the walkout resulted from Mr. Emanuel's making the teachers feel ''completely disrespected.''
''Everyone is focused on Chicago, but we have reached 10 different agreements in the last month,'' she said, pointing to San Francisco, Albuquerque and Central Falls, R.I. She added that the union had agreed to more flexible rules on tenure at the state level in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
''There's been a big change,'' she said. ''You have lots of teachers' unions and their districts working together like never before.''
Even so, Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a liberal-leaning research group, said that not only Republicans but also many Democrats were aiming their fire at teachers' unions.
''They're getting very little support from some Democrats,'' he said. ''The Obama administration has adopted a center-right position on issues like nonunion charter schools and performance pay. The places where teachers' unions used to look for support are no longer coming through for them.''

HEADLINE: Nominees Leave Congressional Candidates to Stump Alone

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Out on the campaign trail, President Obama talks about Medicare (Republicans would gut it), tax cuts (Mitt Romney wants to give them to rich people like himself) and Osama bin Laden (Did you know? He's dead.). 
He even talks about the unemployment rate (it is still too high, but job growth has increased 30 straight months after the economic mess that greeted him when he took office). And he talks about Congress (lawmakers should get moving and pass his jobs bill).
But what the president never talks about is getting more of his party members elected to the House and the Senate. And, for that matter, neither does Mr. Romney.
It is the survival of the fittest on the presidential campaign trail these days. With a close election expected and a dog-eat-dog fight for swing states, who has time to spend stumping for other politicians? Certainly not the president or Mr. Romney, despite the stakes in this year's Congressional elections.
Instead, each is focused on his own fate. Unlike the 2010 midterm elections, when Mr. Obama campaigned heavily for Democrats all over the country, this year he is focusing almost exclusively on the eight swing states where his own political fortune is believed to be up in the air: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin.
So if you are a Democrat running for office in one of those states, you might have a small chance of getting some help from the top of the ticket. Tim Kaine, a former Virginia governor running for Senate, sometimes campaigns with the president on his too-many-to-count trips to Virginia, a crucial swing state.
In Mr. Romney's case, perhaps he is cognizant of the abysmal Congressional approval ratings and sees no gain in associating himself with a branch of government that so many Americans think is dysfunctional and ineffective.
And campaigning on behalf of members of Congress could risk alienating swing voters, many of whom seem to prefer bipartisan government and dislike one-party rule.
That is not to say that Mr. Romney keeps Congressional Republicans at an arm's length. In fact, his campaign stops over the last week or so have featured a few notable members, including Speaker John A. Boehner and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who appeared with him at a rally in Cincinnati, and Representative Steve King of Iowa, who introduced him at an event near Sioux City
But even then, there is little talk of Republican domination at the polls in November. Mr. Romney instead likes to pile on the praise, saying this member or that is a ''great congressman'' or the kind of person ''we need in Washington.''

HEADLINE: Broken Windows and the iPhone 5

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Bully for obsolescence. 

 BODY:
There's been some buzz about a report suggesting that the iPhone 5 could, all by itself, give a significant boost to the US economy. I can't judge how plausible the sales estimates are; but it's worth pointing out how the economic logic of this suggestion relates to the larger picture.
The key point is that the optimism about the iPhone's effects has nothing (or at any rate not much) to do with the presumed quality of the phone, and the ways in which it might make us happier or more productive. Instead, the immediate gains would come from the way the new phone would get people to junk their old phones and replace them.
In other words, if you believe that the iPhone really might give the economy a big boost, you have -- whether you realize it or not -- bought into a version of the "broken windows" theory, in which destroying some capital can actually be a good thing under depression conditions.
Of course, it's nice that the reason we're junking old capital is to make room for something better, not just for the hell of it. But you know what would also be nice? Building useful stuff like infrastructure employing labor and cash that would otherwise sit idle.

HEADLINE: Happy First Birthday, India Ink

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: Looking back at some of the year's most-read pieces. 

 BODY:
A year ago, we launched India Ink, The New York Times's first country-specific blog/news journal, with a promise to provide "more in-depth, on-the-ground coverage of the world's biggest democracy - and of a people who know that no matter how far they roam, their hearts will always be Indian."
Since then we've reported from India's major metropolises and minor villages, from Jaipur, Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, London, Mumbai, Israel, New York and numerous other locations. We've covered Tibetan protests, expensive wedding planners, living at (or below) the poverty line in India, "meaningless cricket," the difficulties of "flying while Khan," Indian women who suffer after divorce, Bangalore's "Maybe Virgin" generation and hundreds of other topics.
Along the way we've gained millions of readers, inspired thousands of comments and, hopefully, prompted some serious and not-so-serious discussions.
A year on, things seem a bit darker in India. Economic growth forecasts have been sharply downgraded, from over 7 percent in 2011 to as low as 5 percent today. The energy and optimism that surrounded the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement have morphed into a still-potent disdain for the current governing parties but one that is accompanied by more pessimism. What seemed like a one-time request by the government, asking social media companies in India to censor and screen content, now could be read as a more sinister plan to curb criticism and dissent.
Looking back at the top essays and articles we wrote in the past 12 months, you could say that one running theme is conflict - not physical conflict, but a conflict between the way things are, and how our readers and the subjects of these articles want them to be. Our writers, and readers, seem frustrated and thrilled with India and the position of Indians around the world in equal measure, and they despair of the shortcomings they see, while working to fix them.
Here are our top posts from the past 12 months, by number of readers:
1. Why I Left India (Again): The I.T. professional Sumedh Mungee's heartfelt essay on hating the man he became when he returned to India, which we published in October 2011, is still getting responses. An excerpt from the essay:
2. An Open Letter to India's Graduating Classes: Mohit Chandra, a partner with an international consulting company based in India, innocently submitted this to India Ink after interviewing job candidates. He (and we) didn't anticipate the hornet's nest it would stir up when it was published in May. An excerpt:
3. India Asks Google, Facebook to Screen User Content: Our report on the private meetings that the acting telecommunications minister Kapil Sibal held with top executives from social networking sites in India showed both the government's discomfort with Internet criticism and its misunderstanding of how technology works. An excerpt:
4. Meet Aparna, Mumbai's Teenage Sex Educator: Neha Thirani's article on Aparna, the 16-year-old daughter of a prostitute, who candidly and cheerfully conducts sexual education classes for underprivileged girls, inspired a flood of offers for help to further Aparna's education. An excerpt from the article:
5. Being Sikh in America: Amardeep Singh's essay, penned after the shootings at a Wisconsin gurdwara in August, detailed the sometimes perilous position in which Sikhs find themselves in America, where they are often mistaken for Muslim, or just singled out for being different. An excerpt:
This top five list is just the tip of the iceberg, of course. We've had Sonia Faleiro's keenly observed and often heartrending reporting on communities outside the Indian mainstream (like this one on Durga, a girl who lives on a pavement in Mumbai); Samanth Subramanian's Long View column, looking at current events through the lens of history, Naresh Fernandes on music and Mumbai, Vivek Dehejia on economics, Saritha Rai from Bangalore and the longtime New York Times reporter Hari Kumar on politics and corruption, and dozens of other excellent writers.
To our India Ink audience: Thank you, thank you. If there's something you've loved or something you've hated, or something you just want to get off your chest, send us an e-mail at IndiaInk@nytimes.com or leave a message in the comments below.

HEADLINE: University Ranking Shows Boom in Global Student Mobility

HIGHLIGHT: More and more university students are choosing to study abroad, according to a new league table ranking the world's top academic institutions. Is it a positive trend and how important are the rankings in picking the right school? 

 BODY:
LONDON - The compilers of a leading league table of the world's top universities on Tuesday reported an "unstoppable rise" in the numbers of students choosing to travel abroad to study.
"Global student mobility is on a seemingly unstoppable rise, with those seeking an overseas education targeting the leading universities," wrote John O'Leary, an academic adviser to the consulting and research firm Quacquarelli Symonds in London, which produces the annual QS World Universities Rankings.
"Even after considerable growth in recent years, the latest rankings show an extraordinary rise of almost 10 percent in international student numbers at the top 100 universities," he wrote.
This year's listings saw the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) overtake Cambridge University as the top place in the influential league table, which is based on a range of factors that include the opinions of academics and prospective employers. 
U.S. and British institutions continued to dominate the QS rankings, which were introduced in 2004, occupying all of the top 10 places.
QS's methodology factors foreign student and faculty numbers into the rankings and that was reflected in this year's outcome. 
"Cambridge, for example, has seen a significant increase in international students, but has dropped five places in this measure, contributing to its fall from first to second place in the overall ranking," Mr. O'Leary wrote.
Similarly, a drop in the ranking of the University of California at Berkeley - to 22nd place from 2nd in 2004 - reflected not only a comparatively poor faculty-to-student ratio, but also "low attractiveness for international faculty and students," according to Martin Ince, also a QS adviser.
QS noted that the most successful universities competed to attract the world's best students and faculty. "Simple evaluations of the proportion of international students and international faculty serve as indicators of an institution's diversity and international attractiveness," it said.
With a growing number of academic rankings being produced to help would-be students make their choice of university, criticism has been voiced about just how objective and scientific they are. 
Ben Sowter, QS's director of research, acknowledged last year that rankings "were designed on an Anglophone model of what a university looks like." 
But D.D. Guttenplan quoted him in the IHT also saying that, with 3.4 million students studying outside their home countries, QS was committed to "helping international students make more informed choices."
As my Rendezvous colleague Mark McDonald wrote this year, "Many Chinese families hire agents to help them navigate the applications process, and an agent's fee can range up to $10,000, plus an equally large bonus if the student gets into a school highly ranked by U.S. News & World Report, the QS rankings and the so-called Shanghai List."
Traveling abroad to study has obvious attractions for students who want the best education available globally. There is also an economic incentive for the institutions themselves, and the countries that host them, in terms of fees and foreign earnings.
But mobility depends on the readiness of governments to allow access to foreign students. QS's Ben Sowter told the BBC that tougher British visa rules for international students could deter some from applying to British universities.
Tell us where you stand on the globalization of education. Should student mobility be encouraged or does it just favor a rich minority that can afford a top-ranked university abroad? Do rankings help or are they too unscientific to give a true measure of excellence?

HEADLINE: Too Much Protection for Derivatives in Bankruptcy

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: Several courts have lately been expanding the already broad protections that derivatives and repo contracts enjoy. 

 BODY:
I have written before about my opinions regarding the "safe harbors" in the bankruptcy code. These are the provisions that exempt derivatives and repo contracts from the automatic stay, the prohibition on termination of contracts with the debtor, the prohibition on constructively fraudulent transfers and the prohibition on obtaining preferential treatment on the eve of bankruptcy.
In general, I think the current safe harbors are too broad and amount to little more than a subsidyto the derivatives industry. Similar provisions protect "securities contracts," and open up the argument that any transaction that occurs in the general vicinity of a broker-dealer is immune from the normal rules of bankruptcy. 
Maybe Congress wants to subsidize the industry, but it probably should stop pretending that these provisions are vital to protect mom, apple pie and the American economy from systemic risk. You could do that with narrower provisions, as I have shown.
My latest concern with regard to the safe harbors is not so much the statutory provisions, but the role that courts have come to play in expanding the provisions beyond their already broad statutory language. 
 These sorts of expansions come in two forms. First, there is the expansion that comes from seeming inattention. A recent example can be found in Judge Jed S. Rakoff's opinion dismissing virtually all of the Madoff trustee's preference and fraudulent transfer claims against the owners of the New York Mets.
The judge assumes the applicability of the safe harbor provisions with little analysis. The apparent basis of the ruling was Bernard L. Madoff's registration as a stockbroker. But the bankruptcy code does not define stockbrokers by registration, instead referring to stockbrokers as persons "engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities."
One might wonder whether Mr. Madoff actually qualified under that test, but the opinion does not discuss it and simply presumes the answer.
Then there is the expansion that comes from an effort to embrace the apparent aims of Congress and run with it. 
Kind of like a young person who is a bit too eager to please, these courts find a Congressional intention and take it to places even Congress might not have wanted to go.
A nice example of the latter is a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Lightfoot v. MXEnergy Electric Inc. The court ruled that a requirements contract for the delivery of electricity was a protected "forward contract" under the bankruptcy code. Yet the contract did not specify any quantity or a delivery date.
Instead, the putative contract provided that the debtor's "full electricity requirements" would be met and the debtor would be charged based on metered usage. If that is a forward contract, any contract involving a commodity (itself a rather vague term, since its includes "or any similar good, article, service, right, or interest which is presently or in the future becomes the subject of dealing in the forward contract trade") that does not provide for immediate performance upon execution becomes a forward contract, and thus is not subject to the normal rules of bankruptcy.
The Fifth Circuit acknowledged this risk, but basically said it was bound by terms that Congress had given it. A court acting like a robot is cute, but it is a basic rule of interpretation that you define provisions in the context in which they are used.
Practically every corporate finance text you look at defines a forward contract as an agreement between two people for the delivery of an asset at a negotiated price on a set date in the future. 
The Fifth Circuit Court's certainty that Congress wanted Section 101(25)(A) of the bankruptcy code to change that normal understanding seems like more than a bit of a stretch.

HEADLINE: Its First Graduates on the Job, Venture for America Looks for Fresh Recruits

BYLINE: JESSICA BRUDER


HIGHLIGHT: The organization is gearing up to recruit a fresh batch of 100 fellows and exploring a handful of cities for expansion in 2013. The long-term objective is to create 100,000 jobs by 2025. 

 BODY:
For more than a year now, Andrew Yang has been traveling the nation evangelizing Venture for America. From gritty inner cities to college campuses and the White House, the former corporate lawyer has made dozens of stops pitching the nonprofit organization, which he hopes will become a Teach for America for young entrepreneurs.
Ten months after we covered his early efforts to send fresh talent to start-ups in struggling cities, the first 40 Venture for America fellows have made it through a five-week boot camp. They've fanned out across New Orleans, Las Vegas, Detroit, Providence and Cincinnati. They're now starting two-year jobs at an eclectic array of start-ups, ranging from Are You a Human, which designs game-based verification systems to thwart spam bots, to Kickboard, an online dashboard that helps teachers track student performance and behavior. 
"At school, you learn how to learn, but not how to do. I want to learn how to build things and make them successful," said Kathy Cheng, 22, who graduated in June from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and took a Venture for America fellowship at Doodle Home, a Detroit-based company whose Web site helps interior designers manage projects, request product samples and quotes, and build profiles to woo potential clients. The 15-employee firm was started two years ago by Jennifer Gilbert - her husband, Dan Gilbert, is the founder of Quicken Loans - and it operates from a slick downtown tech hub called the M@dison that Mr. Gilbert unveiled in January as part of a broader effort to re-energize the Motor City.
"If you'd asked me last year, Detroit was the last place I thought I'd end up," Ms. Cheng said. Joining a start-up wasn't a part of her plan either. That changed last year. While interning for the Small Business Administration, she heard Mr. Yang give a talk; he suggested she apply for a fellowship. And Ms. Cheng began thinking about the potential of entrepreneurship to revitalize cities.
"Back then, I thought I wanted to do management consulting," she said. "But you know how sometimes things just click into place? It was like that." As a business analyst for Doodle Home, she plans to study how designers interact with the company's online platform. She sees her fellowship as a way "to empower creative people to do their best work."
(Some of her peers just sounded relieved to avoid Wall Street; as one Wharton grad wrote on Venture for America's blog: "I had been looking through endless job postings for I-banking and other finance-related positions on my school's career Web site, trying not to vomit, when I came across Venture for America.")
Meanwhile, Mr. Yang is gearing up to recruit a fresh batch of 100 fellows and exploring a handful of cities - Baltimore, Cleveland, New Haven, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Raleigh-Durham - for possible expansion in 2013. His long-term objective is even more ambitious: creating 100,000 jobs by 2025.
"Our goal is to give rise to a virtuous cycle," Mr. Yang said. "Let's say someone like Kathy, when her time at Doodle Home is at an end, she decides she likes the area, she's friends with people there, she has a network. So she decides to start her own thing. If she wants to hire some young, smart, inexpensive venture fellows, we're essentially creating a massive pool of people for her to choose from. You can imagine it in five to 10 years from now. The current fellows will be the leaders of a new generation of companies."
If you had a mission to restore the economy and a team of fresh college graduates at your disposal, where would you send them?

HEADLINE: Does It Pay to Become a Teacher?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The average primary school teacher in the United States earns about 67 percent of the salary of an average college-educated worker in the United States. The comparable figure for all of the developed world is 82 percent. 

 BODY:
Fortuitously, in the midst of the contentious Chicago teachers union strike, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has released its annual report on the state of education and investment in education around the developed world. It might help provide some context for what Chicago teachers are fighting over.
Here's one particularly striking figure from the report, showing the ratio of teacher salaries to the earnings of other workers who went to college:

The United States spends a lot of money on education; including both public and private spending, America spends 7.3 percent of its gross domestic product on all levels of education combined. That's above the average for the O.E.C.D., where the share is 6.2 percent.
The annual spending per student by educational institutions of all levels is also higher in the United States than it is in any other developed country.
Despite the considerable amount of money channeled into education here, teaching jobs in the United States are not as well paid as they are abroad, at least when you consider the other opportunities available to teachers in each country.
In most rich countries, teachers earn less, on average, than other workers who have college degrees. But the gap is much wider in the United States than in most of the rest of the developed world.
The average primary-school teacher in the United States earns about 67 percent of the salary of a average college-educated worker in the United States. The comparable figure is 82 percent across the overall O.E.C.D. For teachers in lower secondary school (roughly the years Americans would call middle school), the ratio in the United States is 69 percent, compared to 85 percent across the O.E.C.D. The average upper secondary teacher earns 72 percent of the salary for the average college-educated worker in the United States, compared to 90 percent for the overall O.E.C.D.
American teachers, by the way, spend a lot more time teaching than do their counterparts in most other developed countries:
So tell me: Given the opportunity costs of becoming a teacher instead of using your college degree to enter another, more remunerative field, are the psychic rewards of teaching great enough to convince America's best and brightest to become educators?

HEADLINE: For a Brazilian Vacation, 7 Rules to Save By

BYLINE: SETH KUGEL


HIGHLIGHT: From fares to food, pousadas to Portuguese, the Frugal Traveler has advice for seeing Brazil on a budget. 

 BODY:
Brazil is too expensive for budget travelers. Or is it?
Evidence in the affirmative is strong. Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo are now the most expensive cities in the Western Hemisphere, by some measures. The dollar that used to get you 3 or almost 4 Brazilian reais at various points in the last decade now gets you just 2. Flying to Brazil from New York takes at least nine hours and can easily run $1,000.
But there is no need to be intimidated.
By following just a few guidelines, a trip to this country of astonishing cultural, geographical, economic, ecological, musical and culinary diversity might just be affordable. Or at least more affordable than you think.
Here are the Frugal Traveler's Seven Rules for making every dollar (or every real, for that matter) count.
1. 'CONSOLIDATE' A LOWER FARE
It's just plain dumb to book a flight to Brazil through big online travel companies or the airlines' sites. Yes, dumb - as in feeding-cash-to-a-paper-shredder dumb. Instead, to find much lower fares, check with consolidators (agencies that negotiate with airlines for special rates) that specialize in Brazil. I generally call BACC Travel (800-222-2746), but this time, for variety's sake, I tested a competitor, AirProjects.com. Searching online for a 10-day trip from New York to Rio de Janeiro four weeks out, I found a $923 (taxes and fees included) nonstop fare on the Brazilian carrier TAM. Repeating the search on Kayak and Expedia, the best prices were $998 with a layover or $1,109 for nonstop.
Also, for travel within Brazil, don't be tricked by the international travel sites that show only one or two airlines operating domestic flights there. As in the United States, multiple airlines (which in Brazil include TAM, Avianca, Gol, Webjet and Azul) compete bitterly over domestic routes, often slashing prices below bus rates if you reserve well in advance. (Beware, though, that it can occasionally be tricky to reserve these online with an American credit card.)
2. CUT COSTS IN RIO ...
When most Americans imagine a trip to Brazil, they're thinking about Rio de Janeiro: Ipanema beach, the Christ the Redeemer statue, samba and caipirinha cocktails. That's a caricature, of course, but not a horribly inaccurate one. The city is painfully gorgeous, its residents famously festive and its offerings ever more culturally sophisticated. You shouldn't skip it.
But it is expensive, so here's one way to cut costs: Don't go during Carnival, New Year's or during other big events (say, the Confederations Cup soccer tournament in June), when hotel prices soar.
You can also save by staying outside the well-to-do neighborhoods of Ipanema and Leblon or the tourist epicenter of Copacabana. Consider neighborhoods like Glória, Flamengo and Botafogo. Avoid Barra da Tijuca (too far and too bland) and downtown (too dicey).
Apartment rentals can also be great deals, but think beyond Airbnb.com. Search online instead for "rio apartments" and you'll find a ton of local agencies. I use Vinicio Flats, but that's just habit; there are lots of good ones. Finally, the site camaecafe.com.br offers good deals for home-stay-like B&Bs in Santa Teresa, a gorgeous Bohemian neighborhood up in the hills above the center of the city. (Cama e Café means "bed-and-breakfast.")
3. ... AND THEN LEAVE RIO
You can't stay in Rio the whole time, both because it's pricey and because you'll leave with a warped view of what Brazil is - much like a foreign visitor who comes to the United States and sees only Manhattan.
So how about a hop up to the Amazon, you say? Nope. Too far, too pricey, too complicated. Instead, I suggest traveling to Minas Gerais, one state north of Rio. Its waterfall-studded countryside is great to explore: its 17th- and 18th-century colonial mining towns are well preserved and romantic, and not expensive (the most well known are Ouro Preto, Diamantina and Tiradentes). The area's farm-fresh pork-and-stews-and-greens-and-sweets cuisine is what I consider the soul food of Brazil.
4. WEIGH WHAT YOU EAT
São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are full of great restaurants; too bad many of them are absurdly overpriced. But even in those cities, and certainly in the rest of the country, there are tons of reasonably priced alternatives. Two genres of dining spots worth seeking are "self-service" buffets where you pay by weight, and diners sometimes called lanchonetes, where set meals are often under 10 reais. Juice stands (which also sell healthy sandwiches) abound in Rio.
5. PICK A POUSADA
Instead of booking hotels, look for pousadas, inns that often include breakfast and whose prices range from very reasonable (well under $100 a night) to stratospheric. Some pousadas come up on search sites like Hotels.com, but in general you need to do some digging.
How? Start with guidebooks (you know, the paper ones), which list lots of options. Then try a site called hiddenpousadasbrazil.com, a rare English-language pousada site nicely curated by an expatriate Englishwoman, Alison McGowan. Beyond that, simply Google "pousada" and the city or town you're looking for. (Then, if the site is only in Portuguese, run it through Google Translate.)
6. SPEAK (SOME OF) THE LANGUAGE
Brazilians are wonderful people who speak terrible English. That's a pithy generalization, but is broadly true. English speakers are most likely to be found at major hotels, touristy attractions and pricey restaurants, precisely the places a budget traveler must avoid. So get a phrase book and see if your local library offers its members free access to Mango online Portuguese lessons - New York's does. (Note: Your Spanish might help, but not as much as you think.)
7. DISAPPOINT MUGGERS
Rio, São Paulo and the other big cities are not nearly as dangerous as you might think from watching Brazilian movies like ... well, like just about all of them. Except for the rarest of exceptions, tourists don't get killed or kidnapped. But they do get mugged from time to time. So aside from not walking alone at night and taking other appropriate precautions, simply don't go out with anything you couldn't stand losing. I take a bit of cash, one credit card and a copy of my passport.

HEADLINE: Seeking Critical Mass of Gender Equality in the Boardroom

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: European Union leaders are considering a law to require that 40 percent of a company's directors be women, but the Deal Professor asks whether that will make a difference in how companies are run. 

 BODY:
There's a remarkable lack of women in corporate boardrooms around the world. The European Union is considering a remedy that would require that 40 percent of a company's directors be women. This may be a milestone for gender equality, but the question is, will it make any difference in how companies are run?
The number of women directors remains stubbornly low. According to Catalyst, a nonprofit organization devoted to furthering women in business, American companies have the fourth-highest average of women directors in the world. The average board of a Fortune 500 company in the United States is 16 percent women.
Among other Western countries, Catalyst finds that Britain is at 15 percent, Germany is at 11.2 percent, and Japan is near the bottom at less than 1 percent. Nordic countries occupy the top three positions, with Norway being the world leader. Norway's boards on average are 40.1 percent women.
That Norway is the leader is no coincidence. The country passed a law in 2003 to ensure that 40 percent of directors for all public companies were women. The proposed European Union law is likely to be based on the Norwegian one, and the idea behind both is simple: to take away any excuse for a company to avoid gender equality.
The principles behind these laws are social and economic. The social element is based on the idea that the lack of women on boards is not a result of competency issues, but the clubby nature of these institutions. Lacking the ties to the men already on these boards, women are unjustly denied the opportunity to serve.
But there is also an economic argument that is sometimes made to support the role of women on boards. The claim is that boards with women become better decision makers, increase companies' profits and lead them to be more humanely run.
These assertions are based on research that in general makes the unsurprising conclusion that men and women are different, something some of us may have read about in "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus." That book was about love and relationships, but studies have found that women in the boardroom have different values, make decisions differently and engender a more cooperative atmosphere.
There's even an Israeli studythat finds that the more girls in a school class, the better both boys and girls do on test-taking, and another onethat finds that orchestras with a greater representation of women have improved organizational performance in the long run, at least as perceived by the players. That women can have a positive effect on men is something that anyone observing a third-grade class could agree on, and perhaps surprisingly, it seems to work in the boardroom.
That men and women are different may be true, but this still doesn't mean that the more women there are, the better the company's profits. In two studies of the Norwegian experiment thus far, neither were supportive of the role of women on boards. One study foundthat Norwegian firms declined in value, while the other founda decrease in profitability.
A few commentators explained the findings by noting that the mass appointment of Norwegian women at once led to younger and more inexperienced boards. The question remains, what happens when there is an equal weighting of women and experience?
The couple dozen general studies on the role of gender in the boardroom are more mixed. They come to differing conclusions, some finding women to be a benefit, others a negative, only creating more uncertainty over the issue.
Because of this, the focus these days is on whether several women make a difference rather than having a token woman director. In this area, there is more support that women do have an effect.
One study found that in German companies with a board composition that was greater than 40 percent women, firm performance was positive.
Another recent study, by Miriam Schwartz-Ziv of Israeli, found that boards with three women directors or greater were "approximately twice as likely both to request further information and to take an initiative" and have better performance.
While these studies are promising for advocates of women on boards, the bottom line is that the effect of women directors has yet to be established. Whether they add value just by their presence is undetermined because the number of women on boards remains low. The true test will be when there are a number of companies with boards comprising 50 percent or more women that can be compared against those with less. We're not there yet.
The European Union is seeking to fulfill this goal. According to reports, the European Union justice commissioner is keen to introduce its law in the coming months. France and Italy are instituting quotas at the 20 percent level, and India recently required certain public companies to have at least one woman director. But passage of the European Union law is not certain. Britain has already issued a letter protesting the effort, asserting that voluntary measures should be given time.
As for the United States, we're clearly not there yet. Even talking about gender stereotypes makes many uneasy because it paints women and men with a uniform brush and doesn't recognize that women and men are different depending on their individual qualities. And there is little likelihood of a quota system being enacted anytime soon.
Gender equality is one goal, but those who think that the number of women directors will reach a critical mass and change the way boards are governed are likely to be disappointed.
Even if it is true that women are different, the way boards are run in the United States may make these differences meaningless.
Boards are inherently behind the curve in decision-making and monitoring the all-powerful chief executive, something we saw in the years leading up to the financial crisis when boards failed to monitor their companies' risky financial bets.
In addition, American directors largely come from the same class and business background, meaning these people can lull themselves into groupthink where diverse views are muted.
Even if more women directors are added, they are likely to come from this same background and class as their male counterparts. And these dynamics will mean that when women join boards, they're more likely than not to act just as the men already there.
So if we are really serious about changing boards, we need to not only add new voices to the board, but find a way for the board itself to change.

HEADLINE: Treasury Sells Additional $2.7 Billion Worth of A.I.G. Shares

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that it had sold an additional $2.7 billion worth of its holdings in A.I.G., as underwriters for the offering exercised what's known as an overallotment option to meet higher-than-expected demand. 

 BODY:
Apparently, $18 billion worth of American International Group shares weren't enough for investors.
The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that it had sold an additional $2.7 billion worth of its holdings in the bailed-out insurance giant, as underwriters for the offering exercised what's known as an overallotment option to meet higher-than-expected demand.
At $20.7 billion, the offering is the single-biggest sale of Treasury's holdings in A.I.G. to date.
 The banks running the stock sale priced the shares on Monday night at $32.50, which is above the $28.73 that the government says is its break-even price on its investment.
The expanded offering means that the federal government's stake in A.I.G. has now fallen to about 15.9 percent, down from 53 percent before the stock sale. As recently as April of 2011, the Treasury Department held a 92 percent stake in the financial firm.
The department added in a statement that it and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had recovered about $197.4 billion from their collective rescue of A.I.G. in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, pulling in more than the $182 billion that the government had made available for the bailout. But that calculation includes the cancellation of roughly $50 billion in potential aid that was never doled out. 
Investors appeared little moved by the news of the offering's terms on Tuesday. Shares in A.I.G. were nearly flat in late trading, at $33.31, though they had fallen 2 percent on Monday in anticipation of the Treasury Department's forthcoming sale.

HEADLINE: Save the Subjunctive!

BYLINE: PHILIP B. CORBETT


HIGHLIGHT: A critique of grammar, style and usage in The Times. This week: a verb form in peril. 

 BODY:
The peril is not new. Indeed, one Ida M. Mason warned darkly of the danger in the pages of The Times back in 1924.
The shadow she feared was, of course, "the frequent disregard of the subjunctive mood, from the pens of those who should know better." And since then - despite my repeated efforts to rally support for Ms. Mason's cause - the crisis has only grown.
For those few still unaware of the stakes, here is a reminder from The Times's stylebook (Garner and the American Heritage usage manual have useful summaries as well):
 subjunctive. Use this form of verb to express a wishful notion or a proposition contrary to fact:
 The mayor wishes the commissioner were retiring this year (not was retiring, because the commissioner is staying on).
 If the commissioner were rich, she could retire (not was rich, because she needs the salary).
 If the bill were passed, taxes could go down (not was passed, because it is still just a hope).
Do not use the subjunctive form (even with a tantalizing if in the sentence) when the intent is merely to convert an is idea to the past tense:
 The mayor asked if the commissioner was rich (the past version of asks if she is rich).
 Secretary Kuzu asked if the bill was going to pass this year (simply the past version of asks if it is). 
But: If the bill were going to pass, Secretary Kuzu would know by now (not was going to pass, but were, because the hypothesis is untrue: the bill is unlikely to pass).
One cue to use the subjunctive is the phrase as though or (preferred) as if. Either phrase signifies that what follows is contrary to fact: Secretary Kuzu acts as if she were (not was) in the White House. The actor looked as if he were sick.
Here are a few examples of lapses, including contributions from sharp-eyed readers (though not from Ida M. Mason):
 One reason is that American workers are particularly ill equipped to cope with the dislocations caused by foreign competition. An American worker who loses her job to trade or technology will find herself in a much worse spot than if she was, say, German or French. 
This is what the grammarians call a contrary-to-fact condition -- the worker is not, in fact, German or French -- and so it requires the subjunctive. Make it "than if she were, say, German or French." (The conditional part of the construction is implied: "in a much worse spot than [she would be] if she were ...")
 The governor, too, is a boisterous guardian of his public image; his video team follows him everywhere and spins out product as if it is a runaway MTV unit. 
Another contrary-to-fact condition - in reality, the New Jersey governor's video team is not a runaway MTV unit. Make it "as if it were a runaway MTV unit." (Or, in this case, we could have stuck with what the writer originally filed: "spins out product like a runaway MTV unit.")
 The store's policy is that whoever has the next number is the next in line. If you would have walked through the front door and said, "I'll give $1,000 to whoever gives me a number that gets me to the front of the line the fastest," there isn't any way you could be stopped. ... 
A good personal policy for what can (and can't) be expensed can be established through this self-directed question: "Is this something I would pay for if I was operating inside my own life, or is this something I'm only doing because I'm not paying for it?"
A column like this strives for a conversational tone, but conversational doesn't have to mean ungrammatical. In the first case, we didn't want the conditional "would have walked" but the subjunctive "had walked." In the second instance, make it the subjunctive "if I were operating."
 Maybe - just maybe - stopping the Keystone pipeline would be worth it if it really was going to change our behavior and help usher in the age of renewable energy. 
Another contrary-to-fact condition. Make it "if it really were going to change ..." 
 He suggested that, if the City Council were unhappy, perhaps Apple could move. The company is Cupertino's largest taxpayer, with more than $8 million in property taxes assessed by local officials last year. 
This one is a hypercorrection; we used the subjunctive when it was not wanted. Sequence-of-tense rules after the past "suggested" required the simple past tense: "if the City Council was unhappy" (see the last example in the stylebook entry above).
 In a Word 
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 Officials from this week's delegation have remained in Egypt to hammer out the details of the American debt assistance, which they said would be completed in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund program. 
This use of a time element as a possessive modifier is awkward and confusing, and "hammer out the details" is a cliché to be avoided.
 Yet if that answer remains elusive, interviews with more than two dozen former and current administration officials offer a portrait of a woman wielding a many-faceted portfolio of power. 
An overstuffed phrase. Simplify. 
 The decision will have no immediate practical effect, because the 2001 law that it overturned was not enforced while lawsuits challenging its constitutionality winded through the courts. 
"Wound," of course. 
 You can agree with everything that Rachel Maddow or Ed Schultz say on MSNBC and still oppose their right to say it. 
"And" would take care of the pronoun-agreement problem.
Example 1:
 This unprecedented three-night stint in Brooklyn's epicenter is a testament to its appeal. 
Example 2:
 When tech meant only hardware and chips, Silicon Valley, home to Stanford's computer science department and large swaths of land for big factories, was the obvious epicenter. 
Do not use "epicenter" as a synonym for "center." It refers to the area on the earth's surface above the origin of an earthquake. (It's also a cliché.)
 NEW ORLEANS - Seven years to the day that Hurricane Katrina and levee failures unleashed a deluge of devastation on the Gulf Coast, Hurricane Isaac brought its own distinctive mode of destruction on Wednesday, drenching the coast not with a quick blow but with an unremitting smothering. 
Idiom requires "after," not "that."
Example 1:
 Amazon has always declined to reveal Kindle sales, and estimates have been all over the map. 
Example 2:
 Klizan, who is ranked 50th, played steadily as Tsonga's game went all over the map: beautiful shots alternating with careless errors hit into the net. 
Two usages of this cliché on one day is too many. 
 DETROIT - The Obama administration issued on Tuesday the final version of new rules that require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025. 
Ideally, the time element goes after the verb and its direct object. If, as here, the object is too long to allow that, put the time element before the verb, not between the verb and object: "The Obama administration on Tuesday issued the final version ..."
 The current argument has a touch of irony. The developers sold the project to the public power entities (municipal electric departments, power authorities and co-operatives) in part with the argument that they could reduce their exposure to the vicissitudes of the electricity marketplace by becoming owners rather than buying on the spot market, and by buying the fuel as well as the power plant, in the form of a 30-year coal supply adjacent to the plant. 
Worth remembering, from the stylebook:
 irony, in precise usage, is a restrained form of sarcasm in which the intent of a phrase differs from its literal meaning, often for rhetorical effect (His brilliant plan nearly bankrupted the company). The looser use of irony and ironically, to mean an incongruous turn of events, is trite. Not every coincidence, curiosity, oddity and paradox is an irony, even loosely. And where irony does exist, sophisticated writing counts on the reader to recognize it.
 Mr. Silver's office would not say on Monday specifically why this case was not referred to the ethics committee, but said that such a case would not be referred only if that is what the victim requested, suggesting that is what had occurred. 
This sentence is almost indecipherable. Try again.
 HARRISBURG, Pa. - Residents of this debt-laden state capital are facing a court-ordered income tax increase of 1 percent as part of an effort to repair the city's perilous finances. 
The tax increase was actually 100 percent, as the article later makes clear: to 2 percent from 1 percent. Make the lede read: "... a court-ordered income tax increase of one percentage point," or "a court-ordered doubling of the city income tax."
 Karlgaard said that six weeks after the position was named, a donor endowed one of Stanford's assistant men's basketball coaching positions in honor of a former board of trustees chair, and that it was mostly unnoticed outside Stanford. 
Our style is "chairman" or "chairwoman."
 Virgil never visited the Bronx, but his legacy endures there as the borough's official slogan, a proverb that seems to have been honored lately more in the breach than in the observance. 
A common misunderstanding of the Shakespeare passage. Here's what the stylebook says:
 more honored in the breach. The passage more honored in the breach than the observance, from "Hamlet," refers to a custom that is more honorably ignored than followed - not one that is more often ignored.

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney, Carried Interest and Capital Gains

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: A device used by money managers to lower their tax liability is a loophole that can be closed without abandoning the lower tax rate for capital gains, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The issue of Mitt Romney's taxes continues to be a political liability for him. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last month found that 36 percent of registered voters have a more negative opinion of him because of the issue, up from 27 percent in January, compared with 6 percent who have a more positive view.
As I have discussed previously, the two years of returns Mr. Romney has been willing to release, for 2010 and 2011, show that he paid much lower effective federal income tax rates in both years than his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, whose income was 85 percent to 90 percent lower than Mr. Romney's in those years.
A key reason for Mr. Romney's low tax rate is that a very substantial amount of his income comes from capital gains - 51 percent in 2011 and 58 percent in 2010. Capital gains, no matter how large, are taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent, whereas wage income can be taxed as much as 35 percent by the income tax plus taxes for Medicare and Social Security. The latter two are not assessed on capital gains.
Significantly, much of Mr. Romney's capital gains income achieved this treatment through a special tax loophole called carried interest. According to recently released documents, executives at Bain Capital, where Mr. Romney made the bulk of his estimated $250 million fortune, saved $200 million in federal income taxes and another $20 million in Medicare taxes because of the carried interest loophole.
The way the loophole works relates to the peculiar method in which money managers are compensated. Typically, they receive a fee of 2 percent of the gross assets under management, much of which comes from employee pension funds, plus 20 percent of any increase in value.
Thus, on $1 billion of assets the managers would automatically get $20 million that would be taxed as ordinary income. If the assets increased 10 percent to $1.1 billion, they would get another $20 million. For tax purposes, this additional $20 million would be treated as a capital gain and taxed at 15 percent.
The theory is that the money managers effectively become part owners of the assets they manage as a result of the fee structure. Critics contend that the distinction between the 2 percent and 20 percent fees is purely artificial -- that in reality all their compensation should be treated as ordinary income and taxed as such.
Among the sharpest critics of carried interest is Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of Colorado. In a Sept. 4 post on DealBook, he explains that the New York attorney general's office is looking into the issue, seeking to determine whether money managers have been illegally converting their 2 percent management fees into lower-taxed capital gains.
The New York Times recently commented in an editorial that while the carried interest loophole is unjustified, the core problem is lower tax rates on capital gains generally. Said The Times, "As long as income from investments is taxed at a lower rate than income from work, there will be no stopping the search for ways, legal or otherwise, to pay the lower rate."
The view that capital gains should be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes is one that is widely shared by liberal tax reformers. They got their wish, briefly, from 1987 to 1990 because Ronald Reagan agreed to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 28 percent from 20 percent in return for a reduction in the top rate on ordinary income to 28 percent from 50 percent, as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
There are three big problems, however, with taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income. First, even if that were the case, capital gains would still be treated more beneficially, because the taxes only apply to realized gains. Those that are unrealized would remain untaxed. Investors needing cash could simply borrow against their assets to minimize their taxes, rather than selling and realizing a capital gain.
To equalize the taxation of capital gains and ordinary income, it would be necessary to tax unrealized gains. In theory, all increases in net wealth should be taxed annually, according to the economists Robert M. Haig and Henry C. Simons. But a 1920 Supreme Court case, Eisner v. Macomber, held that only realized gains could be taxed.
As long as a taxpayer decides when or if to realize gains for tax purposes, that is a very valuable loophole even if gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income. For one thing, a taxpayer can easily match gains with losses to avoid having net taxable gains. And, of course, capital gains would still avoid the 15.3 percent payroll tax, which applies only to wage income.
Second, there is a problem with inflation insofar as capital gains are concerned. Many academic studies have shown that a considerable portion of realized capital gains simply represent inflation, rather than real increases in purchasing power.
While theoretically capital gains could be indexed for inflation, it would be very complicated. For one thing, it is not clear what the appropriate price index should be. For another, there is the problem of also indexing losses. Historically, Congress has felt that simply excluding a certain percentage of capital gains from taxation was a better way to compensate for inflation.
Third, it is a fact of life that those with great wealth are the principal beneficiaries of the capital gains tax preference, and they exercise influence in our political system far out of proportion to their numbers. They will pressure both parties relentlessly to restore a lower tax rate on capital gains and eventually they will be successful. Keep in mind that two Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, signed cuts in the capital gains rate into law.
In short, it is a pipe dream to believe that eliminating the capital gains preference is the key to fixing the carried interest loophole. It can and should be addressed by treating carried interest as ordinary income, without requiring that all capital gains be taxed as ordinary income.

HEADLINE: A Hooters in Queens Is Sued for Racial Discrimination

BYLINE: KIRK SEMPLE


HIGHLIGHT: A Korean-American customer at a Hooters in Fresh Meadows said he was shocked at the word used to refer to him on his receipt. 

 BODY:
Hooters, the restaurant chain widely known for the skimpy outfits of its waitresses, has built its reputation in part on its fun-loving and mildly provocative spirit. But a Korean-American customer has accused a Hooters restaurant in Queens of taking that carefree ethos too far and has sued the company for racial discrimination.
In early July, Kisuk Cha and his girlfriend, both Korean immigrants, walked into a Hooters in Fresh Meadows and ordered buffalo shrimp and chicken wings to go. After they placed their order, they noticed their server and another employee standing at the computer giggling and "gawking at them," according to the lawsuit.
When the server handed them their receipt, Mr. Cha and his girlfriend saw that in the space reserved for the customer's name, the cashier had typed "chinx." 
"I was shocked," Mr. Cha, 25, an unemployed information technology specialist, said in an interview. "My girlfriend was shocked as well." He said he was so distraught that he lost his appetite and, when he got home, threw the food away. 
In the lawsuit, which was filed Monday afternoon in federal court in Brooklyn, Mr. Cha's lawyer, Daniel D. Baek, elaborated: 
"He was so overwhelmed that he just wanted to go to bed to sleep, but was too angry to do so," Mr. Baek wrote. "This incident has continued to cause him mental anguish. He is haunted by the ridiculing giggles and stares of his persecutor. He does not feel welcome at Hooters and indeed questions whether he is welcomed at any non-Korean establishments."
The lawsuit names the chain's parent company, Hooters of America, and the owners of the Hooters franchise in Fresh Meadows. It also includes two employees, one of whom is unidentified and the other of whom is identified only by the name she printed on the receipt, "220 Shenika." It seeks unspecified damages for violations to Mr. Cha's "federal, state and common law rights."
Nicole Conboy, director of human resources for the holding company that owns the Fresh Meadows restaurant and three Hooters on Long Island, said that when Mr. Baek advised the company of the incident, the restaurant management responded swiftly with an internal investigation. During the inquiry, she said, a 17-year-old hostess stepped forward and admitted to committing the act, and the employee immediately resigned. 
"We take all of that very, very seriously," Ms. Conboy said Monday.
The company's lawyer, Edward G. McCabe, said there had been no prior incidents or complaints of a similar nature at the restaurant. 
"It does not reflect the manner in which the restaurant is operated," he said in a letter to Mr. Baek, calling the employee's conduct "egregious" and "deplorable."
Mr. Cha, who emigrated from Korea in 2000 and who lives in Philadelphia, said he remained unconsoled. 
"Recently I got my U.S. citizenship," he said, "and I realized, like, this isn't something I expected when I became a U.S. citizen."

HEADLINE: Sept. 10: Will Obama's Bounce Hold?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The expectation of the model is that President Obama's bounce will decline some over the course of the next week and a half. If he holds his full bounce in the polls, it will be an encouraging sign for him. 

 BODY:
Has President Obama's convention bounce reached its peak? On Monday, his position declined slightly in our forecast for the first time since Aug. 27. 
To be sure, Mr. Obama had a fairly strong day of polling on Monday relative to the long-term baseline. But the data was a little bit more equivocal than in polls released over the weekend -- which may suggest, at least, that he will make few further gains in the polls.
Mr. Obama's gained a single point in the Rasmussen Reports and Ipsos tracking polls on Monday, but held steady in two others from Gallup and the RAND Corporation. (His lead also declined in the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll on Tuesday, which was published after our forecast was updated late Monday night.)
Some of the surveys apart from the tracking polls were erratic and not necessarily so strong for Mr. Obama. He actually declined by several points in one national poll, conducted by TIPP, although a considerable amount of their data was from early last week and did not reflect the key convention speeches.
National polls out on Monday from CNN and ABC News/Washington Post told somewhat contradictory stories. 
In the CNN survey, Mr. Obama moved into a six-point lead among likely voters (and an eight-point lead when the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson was included in the poll) -- up from a tie previously. But he made fewer gains in the survey among the broader universe of registered voters, with whom his lead expanded to eight points from seven.
In the ABC News/Washington Post poll, just the opposite happened. Mr. Obama made substantial gains in that poll among registered voters, going from a one-point deficit to a six-point lead. But the ABC News/Washington Post poll has started to report likely-voter results, and this is where Mr. Obama's gains were not all that substantial, going from a two-point deficit in its August poll to a one-point lead now.
The state polls were also somewhat mixed for Mr. Obama. He received one of his worst polling results of the year in a North Carolina survey conducted by SurveyUSA for the Civitas Institute, which put him 10 points behind Mitt Romney. There are a few things to be mindful of in this poll: most of its data preceded Mr. Obama's acceptance speech last Thursday, and the poll somewhat implausibly showed 30 percent of its African-American respondents voting for Mr. Romney. 
Nevertheless, it's one reminder that candidates probably do not get much, if any, benefit from holding a convention in a swing state; Mr. Romney, for his part, got some middling data in Florida in polling conducted last week.
A better state-level result for Mr. Obama came from an Ohio poll from Gravis Marketing, which put him four points ahead there, reversing a one-point deficit in a poll conducted after the Republican convention. Furthermore, Gravis has had substantial Republican lean in the other polls it has released this year, making these results look stronger for Mr. Obama by comparison. 
For the most part, however, Mr. Obama's stronger state polls on Monday were from places like Minnesota and Washington State that are not as relevant to the Electoral College. We're lacking data so far on what, if any, effect the Democratic convention has had on Virginia, Florida, Colorado and other important swing states.
Given that the forecast model was quite aggressive about pricing in Mr. Obama's convention bounce, we're also going to be monitoring carefully for any signs of its decline.
The expectation of the model is that Mr. Obama's bounce decline some, by a percentage point or two, over the course of the next week and a half. If he holds his full bounce in the polls, it will be an encouraging sign for him.
What makes matters a bit more confusing is that we're still seeing some polls trickle in that were conducted partly or wholly before the major speeches at the Democratic convention. In those surveys, just the opposite is true: it counts as a disappointment if Mr. Obama's numbers fail to improve, as interviews that predate the convention are replaced with newer ones.
This is one time when it's important to carefully check the field dates associated with a poll. It seems pretty clear that the number of polls is likely to proliferate this week, including polls from survey firms that have not been very active before. Although they are often fine polls, some surveys from newspapers and academic institutions have a longer lag time before they report their results.
But at the very least, it appears as though Mr. Obama is not on track for the large bounce in the polls that seemed possible over the weekend, when Mr. Obama's numbers were improving at a prodigious rate in the wake of former President Bill Clinton's speech. 
Mr. Obama almost certainly had the more successful convention than Mr. Romney. But in some sense, his bounce has been fairly ordinary; conventions typically do produce bounces. 
It was the very small bounce that Mr. Romney received in the polls after his convention -- about two points -- that is more unusual historically, and somewhat low even relative to reasonably diminished expectations.
When incumbents receive a bounce in the polls after the conventions, it can potentially be more persistent. In each year between 1988 and 2004, there was little immediate sign of decline in the incumbent party's numbers after its convention, with its results holding in about the same place for up to five weeks.
The reason may simply be that the incumbent party holds its convention last -- and so there is less to interrupt its message. 
I suspect that in future years, we may see the challenging party avoid scheduling its convention so close to the incumbent's, as it that provides it with very little time to build a sense of momentum.
Moreover, polls conducted after both conventions will reflect voters having had a chance to hear both sides of the story. It's not good for Mr. Romney that voters just became much more informed about the election, and the numbers have shifted toward Mr. Obama.
Still, there have also been years, like 2008, when the incumbent party's bounce faded quickly. There have also been years in which the incumbent had a long, gentle fade in the polls between the convention and the election itself. The more advantage an incumbent builds after his convention, the more he'll be able to tolerate shedding a few points in the polls later. 
In 2004, George W. Bush built about a five-point lead after his convention, and lost three points of that by Election Day -- still enough to give him a two-point win over John Kerry.
Four years earlier in 2000, Al Gore had built up just a slightly smaller lead -- four points over Mr. Bush -- but it wasn't quite enough for him to win the Electoral College.
The unusually low volatility in the polls this year also makes Mr. Obama's bounce more difficult to analyze. Since the numbers have been very hard to move, does that imply that when a candidate does see a shift, his numbers are more likely to remain intact and establish a new normal?
Conversely, is the gravity in the race so strong that we're sure to see Mr. Obama's numbers revert to the long-term mean, with about a two-point lead over Mr. Romney, before very long?
Ultimately, the best reason for Mr. Romney's backers to be pessimistic about his chances may be that the normal wasn't that great for him. With a two-point deficit in the polls, Mr. Romney could win the election in any number of ways, but he would nevertheless be an underdog, and especially so on the premise that voters were extremely resistant to changing their minds for any reason.
Still, Mr. Romney needs to take care of first things first, and seeing some steam come out of Mr. Obama's numbers would be his first step on the road to recovery.

HEADLINE: Polls: Obama Gains Ground on Some Measures

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: More media surveys show President Obama gaining some ground in key areas. 

 BODY:
An ABC News/Washington Post poll shows several signs of strength for President Obama after the national conventions, but among likely voters, the presidential race remains deadlocked.
The poll finds Mr. Obama with 50 percent support to Mitt Romney's 44 percent support among registered voters, his best showing since early April in ABC News/Washington Post surveys, a difference that is within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. 
But among likely voters, gleaned through screens used by polling organizations once voters begin paying a lot of attention to the race by late summer and fall, the candidates are running neck and neck, with 49 percent for Mr. Obama and 48 percent for Mr. Romney. 
This week portends to be a very busy reporting period for major media polling organizations, now that the political conventions have ended and surveys are examining whether either candidate has received much of a bounce from the gatherings. So far, polls have shown that Mr. Romney received little or no bounce after the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., while in the time since the Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C., ended last Thursday, survey results for Mr. Obama have generally given him an edge. TheCNN/ORC International poll released on Monday put the president ahead at 52 percent to Mr. Romney's 46 percent.
With only about 1 in 10 voters remaining truly undecided during this election cycle, small gains or losses in the polls are viewed as more meaningful to the campaigns. 
The ABC News/Washington Post survey showed Mr. Obama also gaining ground on a few measures among the larger sample of registered voters, including on handling taxes and Medicare, and being seen as the stronger leader. Enthusiasm among his supporters also grew, and new highs of support came from Democrats and men. Mr. Romney's support eroded among moderates, whites and higher-income voters. 
Mr. Romney was seen by registered voters as better understanding what it takes to build a successful small business, and runs even with Mr. Obama on handling health care policy. However, while more than half of voters disapprove of the president's handling of the economy, a majority said the economy would not have improved under Mr. Romney. 
And as always, it will be up to Mr. Obama and his campaign team to maintain the level of support seen in the ABC News/Washington Post poll in the next eight weeks of campaigning, or if the enthusiasm will diminish.
In addition, Gallup has a new analysis showing that despite Mr. Obama's tepid job approval ratings, a number of important economic and national mood indicators watched by Gallup are higher now than in February 2009, after Mr. Obama's inauguration. 
Gallup's Economic Confidence Index was at negative 58 in Mr. Obama's first full month in office, and after a quick rise and a few dips over the last three and a half years, it is still in negative territory, but has been roughly cut in half, to negative 27 in August 2012. Gallup's Job Creating Index has also risen to a positive 19 from a negative 5 since Mr. Obama took office.
Only 15 percent of Americans were satisfied with the way things were going in the United States in February 2009; that number has fluctuated throughout Mr. Obama's presidency, falling to 11 percent in August and September 2011, but has risen back to 25 percent of Americans being satisfied now. And in August, nearly half of Americans said their standard of living was improving, compared with just over a third who said that in February 2009. 
The ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 7 to 9, among 826 registered voters, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Gallup's analysis is based on trends from both Gallup daily tracking and monthly polls, in which interviews are conducted by telephone among samples of at least 1,000 national adults.

HEADLINE: The Elephant in the Room

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Is the memory of George W. Bush's presidency dragging Mitt Romney down? 

 BODY:
If a polling lead in the first week of September were a guarantee of victory two months later, then John McCain and Al Gore would have both been sworn in as president of the United States. So no, President Obama's convention bounce has not - repeat, has not - sealed the election for the Democrats.
What the Obama bounce has done, though, is dramatically reduce the possibility that this election will turn out like 1980 or 1992, when the electorate broke hard against the incumbent in the last few months of the campaign. The convention period was Mitt Romney's best chance to pull substantially ahead of the president and set himself up to pull away. If Romney wins, it will probably be by a whisker, not a lap.
Judging by the last week's worth of conservative commentary, this post-convention reality - a narrower path to victory for Romney and a stronger likelihood of defeat - comes as a shock to many of his backers. Not that they expected an outright landslide, necessarily. But there's a strong consensus on the right that we should be headed for a much more decisive repudiation of this administration than the current polls suggest is possible.
"If the Republican Party cannot win in this environment," George Will told his fellow panelists on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday, "it has to get out of politics and find another business." He was echoed by the popular radio host Laura Ingraham: "If you can't beat Barack Obama with this record," she told her listeners, "then shut down the party." Likewise the historian and prominent Romney backer Niall Ferguson, who told Newsweek's readers that Obama's robust poll numbers proved that "the law of political gravity has been suspended."
In their quest to explain the president's resilience, conservatives haven't just done the obvious thing and piled all the blame on Romney himself. They've started reaching for structural explanations for Romney's underperformance, from "the left-controlled education system that has profoundly shaped the Millennials" (in the words of National Review's Stanley Kurtz) to liberalism's success at making the "government economy" of "federal welfare benefits" seem more important than the real economy of job creation (to quote the influential conservative blogger John Hinderaker).
Like Kurtz and Hinderaker, I think there are very interesting conversations to be had about conservatism's inherent disadvantages in a welfare-state society with a liberal-tilting cultural establishment. But before we lose ourselves in sociology and poli-sci, it's worth looking yet again at the most obvious explanation for Republican underperformance: the recent presidency of George W. Bush.
Eight years ago this November, Bush was re-elected with 51 percent of the popular vote, and his party gained four seats in the Senate, bringing their majority to 55 seats. Despite the controversy surrounding the Iraq War, the Republican Party of 2004 still retained the reputation that it had gained during the Reagan boom and the successful winding-down of the cold war: A majority of Americans trusted Bush's party to provide effective leadership abroad and to pursue broadly shared prosperity at home, and Karl Rove's vision of an enduring Republican majority seemed viable, if not inevitable. 
Four years later, the dream was dead, and the public's trust on both fronts was all but exhausted. The mismanagement of the Iraq occupation, piled on top of the W.M.D. fiasco, cost Bush's party its reputation for foreign policy competence, while the Bush boom, such as it was, delivered weaker returns to the middle class than either the Reagan or the Clinton expansion - and then the financial crisis undid even those meager gains.
Since Bush left office, conservatives have been willing to acknowledge his failures as a fiscal conservative and to promise more responsibility on deficits and debt. This has been a necessary and important shift, responsible both for the energy of the Tea Party in the 2010 midterm elections and for the current Republican ticket's (relatively) brave proposals on entitlement reform.
But the shift toward fiscal rectitude is the easy part, in a sense, because it just involved calling conservatives back to their principles, without necessarily acknowledging the places where ideology might need to adapt itself to new realities. It's made the Republicans more serious than they were in January of 2008, but it's left the party's post-Bush weaknesses on the economy and foreign policy conspicuously unaddressed.
A presidential nominee could have filled this breach with fresh rhetoric and creative policy, but Romney, compromised and uncourageous, hasn't been the right man for that job. On economics, he's shifted awkwardly between a message that focuses (sensibly) on the struggles of the middle and working classes and a much more conventional right-wing celebration of entrepreneurs and "job creators." On national security, he's campaigned as a by-the-numbers hawk, with barely a hint that hawkishness might have delivered America into difficulties during the last Republican administration.
With unemployment still over 8 percent, he may be able to win with this kind of uncreative message. But the economy is stagnant, not collapsing, which means he's not going to win a big majority just by showing up.
To win the kind of victory that conservatives seem to think they should be winning, the Republican Party needs two things: a domestic agenda that offers more to hard-pressed families than just generic conservative rhetoric about the genius of capitalism and a foreign policy program that reflects the hard lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan.
This is the simple reality of presidential politics in 2012. Americans don't want to give the White House back to the Republicans because they remember the Bush era all too well. If they continue to be disappointed at the polls, conservatives will eventually recognize this problem and grope toward some sort of solution. Until then, the fault for their party's underperformance will lie not in the stars or the structure of our society but in their own stubborn selves.

HEADLINE: 'Is This the Pose of a Free Man?'

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: A new report calls TSA operations "costly, counterintuitive, and poorly executed." 

 BODY:
On the Sunday before the Republican convention, Senator Rand Paul ranted against his least favorite government bureaucracy: The Transportation Security Administration. Addressing a crowd at the University of South Florida, he mimicked the backscatter-machine stance (arms up in the air, legs apart) and asked "Is this the pose of a free man?" 
Outside the Paul family, I doubt many Americans subscribe to the idea that airport security lies on the road to serfdom. But Mr. Paul's vendetta against the TSA has some merit. Nearly 11 years since its establishment, there's plenty of evidence that the TSA is inefficient, and if not ineffective, at least less effective than it should be. 
The House Subcommittee on Transportation Security released a report on Monday that calls TSA operations "in many cases costly, counterintuitive, and poorly executed."

Echoing security experts such as Bruce Schneier, the report says the TSA "maintains a reactive approach to security." After the attempted bombing of American Airlines Flight 63 in December 2001, the TSA required passengers to remove their shoes at checkpoints. After the discovery of the liquid explosives plot in Great Britain in August 2006, the TSA banned liquids and gels. And so on. The report notes, dryly, that "once a procedure is put in place, it is almost never removed." Airport security is a game of catch-up, and it seems the TSA rarely considers whether new technology obviates the need for annoying and intrusive restrictions.
Is it really necessary to ban shampoo and hand cream? Perhaps not. Kip Hawley, a former TSA administrator, argued recently in The Wall Street Journal that the TSA should eliminate the prohibited items list, with the exception of obvious weapons. "The list of banned items has created an 'Easter-egg hunt mentality at the TSA," he wrote. "Worse, banning certain items gives terrorists a complete list of what not to use in their next attack. Lighters are banned? The next attack will use an electric trigger." Banning lighters is just security theater-it just makes airports seem safer.
While the TSA insists on confiscating lighters, it's oddly slow to enforce protocols that actually make sense. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Congress instructed TSA agents to vet foreign flight students. They do; but there's a hitch. The Government Accountability Office said in July that "this vetting does not occur until after the foreign national has obtained flight training." 
The TSA seems like a caricature of a wasteful bureaucracy, spending astounding amounts of money even during a sluggish economic recovery. A couple of highlights from the report:

        
In 2006 the TSA spent $29.6 million on 207 "puffer" machines designed to shake lose explosive particles. They failed to work in dirty, humid airport environments.
        
The TSA employs roughly 62,000 people, including 47,000 screeners, at a cost of more than $3 billion a year in payroll, compensation and benefits. But "there does not appear to be a correlation between TSA's staffing model and the number of travelers that need to be screened." The TSA workforce is larger now than it was in 2005 despite a "net decrease in the number of people traveling" domestically. 
Given that Republicans dominate the subcommittee on transportation security, it's not surprising that many of their proposed solutions involve privatization. The report's concluding paragraph advises the TSA to "begin an immediate shift toward partnering with the private sector for passenger screening and other security operations."
Whether airport security personnel work for taxpayers or privately owned businesses seems, to this liberal, beside the point-although perhaps Rand Paul will feel more like a free man if the screener telling him to spread his legs doesn't depend on government-run health care.
Clearly, though, it's worth changing the TSA's approach. And luckily there's a security byword that sounds almost as good to Republican ears as privatization: Israel. Instead of banning beauty products, the Israelis focus on intelligence. Instead of asking passengers to remove their shoes, they interview them. Their technique isn't cheap, but at least it's logical, and no plane leaving Israel's international airport has ever been hijacked.

HEADLINE: For Top Executives, Richer Retirement Plans

BYLINE: By FRAN HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
WITH traditional pensions disappearing, tax rates and the future of Social Security in flux and even well-known businesses facing financial trouble, many workers are worried that their company retirement plans will not provide enough income.
But for the upper tier of executives, these trends could actually lead to richer corporate perks as management moves to compensate for the uncertainties.
Companies are rethinking their special programs of executive retirement benefits by expanding the eligibility pool, adding investment choices, increasing their corporate contributions and even designing entirely new structures -- all in an effort to keep top executives happy.
''I see a change in the marketplace,'' said Maggie Mitchell, a vice president of ING's American insurance unit, which sells some of the new products for these executive plans. ''People are looking for safer, tax-advantaged retirement income.'' 
The 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, the basic federal pension law, limits the amount of money employees can set aside in a standard tax-deferred retirement plan, like a 401(k), using a formula adjusted each year for inflation. The original idea was to spread the benefits somewhat equally and prevent the plans from favoring higher-ranking managers. But over time, as executives wanted to save more, companies added supplementary plans, generally known as nonqualified deferred compensation.
''For an executive, it's to create a kind of super-retirement plan, because traditional retirement plans might not allow them to put away enough replacement income,'' said Ross Levin, president of Accredited Investors, a wealth management firm based in Edina, Minn., whose clients' minimum account size is $2 million. ''And companies might do it to tether an executive to the company.''
Reliable statistics are scarce, but experts say these benefits are popular among large companies: they were offered at nearly 94 percent of the 300 companies in a Prudential Retirement survey released in May. The range of people covered in a company's upper echelons varies, but typically participants must earn at least $150,000 a year.
These supplemental plans may look like their Erisa counterparts, with similar tax breaks and investment choices, and often the same matching contributions from the company. In some ways these might actually seem better because executives can squirrel away an unlimited amount (depending on corporate policy) and set their own dates for withdrawing the money, even before retirement. However, the plans have two serious flaws, both of which have been magnified by recent events.
The biggest problem is that if the business goes bankrupt, creditors can take all the money, even the executive's own contributions. That is because by law, they are considered company assets. That risk hit home in the 2008-9 financial crisis, as seemingly solid names like the Borders Group, Lehman Brothers and Circuit City disappeared. Mr. Levin said that two of his clients lost several hundred thousand dollars each in deferred compensation in the last five years because their companies went bankrupt.
The second big weakness is that ''there really isn't much you can do today to get your money once the company is in bad straits,'' said Frank Nessel, a senior Erisa consultant at the Vanguard Group. Once an executive selects a withdrawal date, it is almost impossible to retrieve the money sooner. These plans lack the loan and hardship provisions of most 401(k)'s, and amendments to the tax code in 2004 reduced most of the limited flexibility executives used to have.
On the other hand, the bankruptcy risk gives executives a real stake in the company's long-term survival, which fits with the growing trend to tie executive compensation to corporate performance.
The plans are also susceptible to uncertainty over the tax code. Many financial advisers expect taxes on their superrich clients to rise next year, through the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts or in another way. In theory, higher tax rates in the future should make these plans less desirable, because participants are basically delaying paying taxes until they withdraw the assets. For that reason, Mr. Levin suggests that clients contribute only half as much as they did previously.
Other experts, however, say there are too many uncertainties to issue such blanket recommendations. If an executive's income is significantly less in retirement, or he or she moves to a low-tax state from a high-tax one, the tax bill might still be smaller in the future than today, even if rates go up. High and compounded investment returns could also outpace tax increases.
The recession, the increase in bankruptcies, the reduced withdrawal flexibility and the uncertainty over taxes have prompted the financial services industry to come up with new ways to make the executive plans attractive.
The newest Prudential survey showed a small but clear trend in that direction. For instance, during the recession, about one-fifth of the businesses polled had reduced or eliminated their corporate matching contribution to nonqualified plans, just as they did with their 401(k)'s. This year, however, only 5.4 percent cut back, and a handful even expected to start or enhance a match. A further 6 percent said they would add more investment choices.
Sheryl Craun, senior vice president of operations in Fidelity Investments' retirement plan business, said that about 5 percent of clients were adding investment options. The most popular is a self-directed brokerage account, which allows executives almost unlimited choices.
Ms. Craun has also noticed that lower-level managers, even those earning just $75,000, are now allowed in. ''I think companies are becoming more loose, because they're using this as part of their retention program,'' she said. Still, businesses cannot spread the benefit too widely, or they risk losing the nonqualified status and all its privileges.
Employers are trying harder to persuade executives to participate and to invest more, using personalized meetings and online planning tools, said George Castineiras, the senior vice president who heads Prudential's total retirement solutions business.
And financial experts are looking for solutions to the bankruptcy problem. These solutions usually involve creating asset pools that contain real cash in the executive's name. This protects the money from corporate creditors but raises new tax problems.
A few businesses, particularly in industries like tobacco and technology, are taking a second look at so-called secular trusts, said Robert Barbetti, an executive compensation specialist at J. P. Morgan Private Bank. The assets do not have the full tax deferral of a standard nonqualified plan, Mr. Barbetti said, but the employer typically adds enough money to the trust -- ''grosses up'' the executive, as he put it -- to cover the extra liability.
The catch, he said, is this: ''Once you start grossing up for the executives, that catches the shareholders' attention.'' And companies like Citigroup, whose shareholders this spring voted down a $15 million pay package for the chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, have enough trouble on that score.
ING is marketing what it calls a Bonus 162 plan, based on section 162(a) of the tax code, which allows companies to deduct an unspecified amount of ''ordinary and necessary'' business expenses. Despite the name, executives can contribute any after-tax income, not just bonuses. If they invest the money in life insurance products, Ms. Mitchell said, the earnings are tax-free, although executives must pay taxes up front on their initial contributions.
With his own executive compensation plan, Mr. Barbetti said he had decided to extend his withdrawal date by two years, to 2024. (He would not reveal the size of his account.) ''Because of not knowing where the tax rates are going to go,'' he said, ''I wanted to make sure I deferred long enough so that the interest-rate compounding would equal the taxes.''

HEADLINE: Medicare Fraud: Evolving Scourge Requiring Vigilance

BYLINE: By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
DEBORAH GILMAN, 44, a nurse who lives in Newark, Calif., knows that Medicare fraud is out there. But she never thought her father, Jerry Gilman, 68, would become a victim.
Mr. Gilman, a Vietnam veteran, has peripheral neuropathy and other complications from exposure to Agent Orange, his daughter said. He is also the primary caretaker for his wife, who has Alzheimer's disease and recently had a stroke.
''My dad was frequently dizzy and falling and generally having trouble getting around,'' Ms. Gilman said. So last February, father and daughter decided it was time for a motorized chair. 
With the approval of his doctor and Medicare, Mr. Gilman ordered a power chair from Hoveround. When the chair arrived, Mr. Gilman realized quickly that it was not the model he had requested: it was made by a different manufacturer, and it was much smaller and less sturdy. ''I was worried if he used that chair, he'd tip over and really get hurt,'' Ms. Gilman said.
She reported the error to Hoveround and Medicare, but hands were tied all around. Medicare had already put payment through for the wrong chair. Until that order was cleared up, Hoveround could not send a new chair and expect Medicare to pay for it.
Frustrated, Ms. Gilman then sought help from her local Senior Medicare Patrol, part of a federally financed antifraud program. After weeks of sleuthing, they determined that Mr. Gilman's order for the Hoveround chair had been intercepted by someone who then ordered and billed for the erroneous chair.
Debra Silvers, vice president of corporate compliance at Hoveround, agreed that something like that must have happened, but declined to affix blame, surmising only that "someone in Mr. Gilman's doctor's office must have ordered the chair from the other manufacturer.''
But with the patrol's help, Ms. Gilman was able to stop the Medicare payment to the wrong manufacturer, and Mr. Gilman had the correct chair by April.
Medicare abuse and fraud like this costs taxpayers tens of billions of dollars every year. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., estimated that in 2010, the two programs together made more than $65 billion in improper federal payments. An April 2012 study by a RAND Corporation analyst and former C.M.S. administrator estimated that fraud and abuse cost Medicare and Medicaid as much as $98 billion in 2011.
In addition to the cost, Medicare fraud can jeopardize patients' health. Mr. Gilman, for instance, could have been stuck with an inappropriate and potentially dangerous motorized chair. In other cases, patients cannot get the care they need because fraudulent charges have exhausted their allotment of Medicare benefits.
Blanca Reese, program manager for Kern County Aging and Adult Services in California, recalled a recent case in which a woman reported that her doctor refused to see her because Medicare had flagged her number for overuse. ''Turns out thieves had gotten hold of her Medicare number and provider information and had fraudulently billed her doctor's office for 40 visits in one day,'' Ms. Reese said.
Officials are also noticing a huge increase in problems in the home health care and hospice areas. For instance, some Medicare recipients are persuaded to sign up for ''free'' massages in their homes, and Medicare is fraudulently billed for physical therapy. Or, unscrupulous doctors approve patients for hospice care who are not terminally ill and may be experiencing something as minor as recent weight loss.
''These cases are the ones that really break my heart,'' said Julie Schoen, director of California's Senior Medicare Patrol, the office that helped the Gilmans. ''Fraud like this causes Medicare to crack down on hospice benefits, and patients who really need the care can't get it.''
Then there are more subtle abuses, the ones to which younger Medicare recipients may find themselves vulnerable. A patient with a mild case of high blood pressure, for instance, may be persuaded to undergo a battery of heart disease tests that are covered by Medicare but are not necessarily appropriate. ''Patients shouldn't feel pressured into unnecessary tests or treatments,'' said Louis Saccoccio, executive director of the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, an advocacy group of insurers, law enforcement and regulatory agencies.
More commonly, doctors and other health care providers sign off on Medicare bills with little scrutiny. In other cases, busy doctors and their staff may approve requests for medical equipment and supplies without checking with the patient.
The Obama administration has vowed to fight Medicare fraud and abuse. Included in the Affordable Care Act are provisions for more coordinated law enforcement actions; increased standards for medical providers, particularly in the medical equipment and supplies area; and the use of high-tech tools to better identify erroneous and fraudulent billing patterns.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that $4.1 billion was recovered in 2011, a record amount for a single year. But despite the progress, Ms. Schoen said, government and law enforcement agencies have a long way to go before they can catch up with the rampant abuse schemes.

HEADLINE: It Takes One Grape to Reimagine California Wine

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
KELSEYVILLE, Calif.
WITH temperatures here regularly hitting triple digits in the summer, the Clear Lake area, about an hour by car northeast of Healdsburg, Calif., seems awfully hot to grow grapes. The Mayacamas Range blocks the cool ocean breezes from the west; Mount Konocti, an extinct volcano, looms to the east; and at night you can see steam rising from the geothermal fields surrounding Clear Lake, the second-largest geothermal area in the United States after Yellowstone.
Yet Bernie Luchsinger, who has been growing grapes here since he arrived from Chile in 1968, does quite well. He and his daughter, Pilar Luchsinger White, manage Luchsinger Vineyards, which grows sauvignon blanc for the big wine companies, along with other grapes, including a bit of trousseau. Surprisingly, it's the trousseau, an obscure red grape from the Jura region of France, that has won the Luchsingers a small measure of attention and captivated a tiny but influential segment of the California wine trade.
The story of Luchsinger Vineyard's trousseau is a departure from the usual California narrative of success with the great grapes of Bordeaux and Burgundy. Few people outside the Jura had ever heard of trousseau 15 years ago; even today, nobody in his right mind sees trousseau as a great commercial opportunity for the industry. 
Yet the flicker of interest in California trousseau is a sign that the state's wine industry may evolve in unexpected directions, and that its past was more complex than is often thought.
The first indication that the Luchsinger Vineyard might be noteworthy came when Duncan Arnot Meyers and Nathan Lee Roberts, the proprietors of Arnot-Roberts, decided they needed to make a trousseau wine. They already produced superb wines of balance and restraint, and, like many in the wine vanguard, they had developed a taste for the wines of the Jura in the last decade. The problem was, they couldn't find any trousseau in California.
''We had called vineyards and nurseries all over the state,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''Finally, we just typed 'trousseau' into Google and worked backwards.''
The trail led them to the Luchsingers, who, though they grow the grape, had never tasted a trousseau wine. In 2001, Mr. Luchsinger had a brainstorm: imagining that California producers might want to try their hand at fortified wines, he would plant six acres with five of the grapes used to make port. Why not? The Douro Valley of Portugal, where port grapes are grown, is awfully hot, too.
Among the grapes he chose was bastardo, a lesser port grape that historically was used in Madeira, too, and that happened to be identical to the trousseau grape of the Jura. As Mr. Meyers and Mr. Roberts learned, the two acres he planted seemed to be the only vineyard block in California devoted to the grape.
Alas, the Luchsingers found that no producers were interested in making a port facsimile. While they managed to sell a few grapes here and there, the first real interest came when the Arnot-Roberts team arrived for the trousseau in 2009.
The first vintage of Arnot-Roberts trousseau, though a minute quantity, made an immediate impression among like-minded wine producers who sought alternatives to the recent California paradigm of substantial, powerfully fruity wines. Like the best Jura trousseaus, the Arnot-Roberts trousseau is a paradox. It's pale (almost as pale as a dark rosé) and light-bodied, yet it's intense, with a firm tannic grip. It's also energetic, floral-scented and uplifting, with a lovely, refreshing bitterness.
''I'm really surprised that the wine we make from here is as good as it is,'' Mr. Meyers said last month, standing in the vineyard with the heat almost shimmering.
Arnot-Roberts's trousseau so stimulated the imagination of their colleagues that other producers wanted to make their own. Using a cutting from Luchsinger Vineyard, Wells Guthrie of Copain Wines grafted over three and a half acres of his Russian River Valley vineyard to trousseau, and plans to add three more acres, and perhaps some more in another vineyard in Anderson Valley.
Copain's 2011 Russian River trousseau is a gorgeous wine, a little softer and darker than the Arnot-Roberts, but earthy, with underlying mineral flavors. Mr. Guthrie took some to a recent food-and-wine event in Nashville and said it was a big hit.
''People want something off the beaten path,'' he said. ''We're not going to take over the world with trousseau.''
Tegan Passalaqua, the winemaker at Turley Cellars and a leading scholar of old California vineyards, used Luchsinger cuttings last year to graft over one acre of merlot on gravel soil in the Bohan Vineyard on the Sonoma Coast.
''I've had probably 40 people call me and ask me if I'll sell them grapes,'' he said. ''As soon as the word got out, people started calling.''
Rod Smith, a longtime California wine writer, and his wife, Catherine Bartolomei, a proprietor of the Farmhouse Inn and Restaurant in the Russian River Valley, have planted a small block of trousseau in their Lost & Found Vineyard. Up in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, Jason Lett of the Eyrie Vineyards has also planted trousseau. It may be a couple of years before either of these vineyards produce a commercial crop.
Even so, if you were to put together all the trousseau on the West Coast, it would still amount to a dozen or so acres, producing very little wine. Nonetheless, it represents much more than a mere handful of bottles.
For centuries the Old World wine culture developed locally, as each village and valley experimented with grapes, determining what grew best in their particular regions. The United States wine industry, though, developed in a global economy, with a small handful of grapes repeated in region after region, largely for commercial reasons. It's exciting to imagine what the wine landscape would look like if grape selections had evolved more organically.
''I've been steadily disappointed to see everybody working with the same grapes over and over again,'' said Mr. Smith, who has observed the California wine industry for 30 years. ''This kind of exploration is not only fun, it's very substantively leading to a different future, a whole different look to the California wine industry.''
Whether trousseau turns out to be part of California's future, it most definitely has been part of its past. Now that he has had a little experience with trousseau, Mr. Passalaqua said, he realizes that he has seen it repeatedly among the interplanted zinfandel field blends that characterize old Napa vineyards he works with for Turley.
''Hayne Vineyard has quite a bit, and now, it really sticks out to me,'' he said. ''The Moore Earthquake Vineyard, it had a block that was 25 percent trousseau.'' He also mentioned the Library Vineyard in Napa and the Fredericks Vineyard in Sonoma Valley as having discernible trousseau vines.
Mr. Passalaqua traces the grape to the 1860s and the Jackson Research Station, one of the many agricultural research centers in the state. Now, with the grapes he is growing, he and his wife, Olivia, will make a little wine, and he will sell some of the grapes to Arnot-Roberts.
''I applaud the fact that they had the guts to do it,'' he said. ''Their wine was the first that I thought was world class. They opened the door for anyone else who wants to do it.''

HEADLINE: Heading South, but Stopping Short of Florida

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
SCOTT WOODCOCK knew he wanted to move someplace warmer when he retired from his job as an Amtrak engineer based in Philadelphia.
He thought he had a good plan: each year in the five remaining before his retirement, he and his wife, Cinde, would drive down Interstate 95, stopping at one place or another, until they made it to Florida, where his parents had retired.
''I figured we would end up in Florida, but in any case, we would have vacations down the coast,'' Mr. Woodcock said. In the summer of 2007, they decided to visit a friend for some golf in North Myrtle Beach, S.C. ''And we just loved it. We never made it any further. It has everything for us -- the weather, the prices, close to the beach and closer to our kids when they come to visit or we go back up north.''
The Woodcocks became part of what officials in the mid-South say has become a trend -- those initially thinking they would retire to Florida or the Southwest are instead coming to places like the Carolinas, Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia. 
Census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution show that mid-South locations were showing some of the most rapid increases in 65 and older populations. Raleigh, for instance, is at the top of that list, with its 65-and-older population increasing by 60 percent from 2000 to 2010 and its 55-to-64 population growing by 97 percent in that same period.
Other mid-South areas with increases of more than 35 percent of 65-and-older people include Charlotte and its surrounding region, the area north of Atlanta, and the southern Appalachian region near Chattanooga.
''We knew anecdotally we were attracting more and more retirees, but now we want to encourage it,'' said Lynn Minges, assistant secretary for tourism marketing in the North Carolina Commerce Department. In 2010, the state Legislature gave her department the go-ahead to specifically aim a Web site and ad campaign, RetireNC, at people older than 55. There are even certified retirement communities, mostly in smaller towns with hospitals, recreation and available lower-cost housing that would appeal to retirees.
One of them is Lumberton, a hamlet of 23,000 at the crossroads of Interstates 95 and 74, halfway between New York and Florida, and on the way from the Piedmont to the Atlantic. There is nothing historical or otherwise touristically significant, but Connie Russ, Lumberton's downtown development coordinator and, now, retiree recruiter, said there was plenty for the potential retiree.
''Health care is excellent -- our hospital is connected with the Duke Medical Center heart unit. There is golf not far away in Pinehurst and we even have a good arts center,'' she said. The North Carolina Legislature also passed a bill so the state does not tax federal pensions or Social Security. ''Things are just a little slower and yet more vibrant, I think, than Florida. Not everyone here is old like that.''
Paul Klein, in fact, was fed up with Florida. He had moved to Boca Raton from his native New York in his 30s, but by the time he retired 15 years ago at 55, he was starting to get ready to leave.
''It was getting crowded and, frankly, the people were not nice -- and pretentious, too,'' Mr. Klein said. He and his wife, Diane, had taken some trips to the southern Appalachians and had started to get into hiking and just hanging out in the woods.
Four years ago, Diane got a small inheritance and they became what Paul Klein calls ''halfbacks'' -- people who moved to Florida from the North and have progressed partly back. In their case, it is to Blue Ridge, Ga., a foothills resort area about two hours north of Atlanta, just south of the Tennessee border.
''This is not just for the weather. It gets hot here, too,'' said Mr. Klein, who has taken up trap shooting, while his wife has started quilting. ''But it is about the pace of life and the friendliness of the people. They say hello to you when you do business with them. This is just a better lifestyle.''
Tennessee, like North Carolina, has started a retiree recruiting program through its tourism department. Retire Tennessee even has a calculator on its Web site to compare costs between Tennessee towns and those around the country, almost always finding them in favor of retiring in the Volunteer State.
It took Virginia Magada a while, but she is finally migrating from her home of 81 years, Bowling Green, Ohio, to Murfreesboro. Her daughter and son-in-law and his parents already live there. Her daughter teaches at Middle Tennessee State University, but Mrs. Magada, a widow, said she was finally ready to leave behind Ohio weather for that of Tennessee with the rest of her family.
''I love living in college towns. This way, I get the arts and culture and avoid a bit of the snow,'' said Mrs. Magada, a former art professor at Bowling Green University. Because her grandchildren are grown, she doesn't have that duty either. ''I know I will miss where I grew up and lived my whole life, but this is a good substitute.''
According to an AARP spokeswoman, Nancy Thompson, family is a better predictor of a retiree's settlement location than almost anything else. That more and more people are, in general, moving to the mid-South is probably why the region is growing as a retirement area.
''Even in the baby boom, 90 percent of people stay pretty much in the area in which they live when they retire,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''But if they try out some other region first, or have family there, they may be more likely to make a move.''
That is what has happened for Dick and Sue Barrows and Lewis and Norma Beale, two couples who made preretirement moves to North Carolina in the last few years. The Beales were living in the Meadowlands area of North Jersey when Norma, an office manager, wanted to retire. Lewis, a freelance journalist, got a part-time job teaching writing at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington. The pace was a little too slow for them, so they moved to Raleigh two years ago and swear it was the best move they have ever made.
''Look, I miss the Greek coffee shops and the Metropolitan Museum, but little else,'' Mr. Beale said. ''I bought a heavyweight leather jacket before we left New York and it is hanging in my closet unused. There are lots of college sports, plenty of theater and good restaurants, all the concerts come through and all the films are here when they open. We're on the way to Florida, so we get visitors. I think we are here to stay.''
One of those good restaurants is Kitchen, in nearby Chapel Hill, started two years ago by Dick and Sue Barrows, who used to own places in Bucks County and Bethlehem, Pa. Their daughter, Leslie, played field hockey at the University of North Carolina, and they would go to see her games. Oddly, Leslie moved to New York to work after graduation, but the Barrowses were smitten with North Carolina. They sold their restaurant in Bethlehem and moved south in a preretirement foray.
''We still have a few years before retirement, but the slower pace of life has been great,'' said Mr. Barrows, 62. He jokes that the nearby town of Cary stands for Concentrated Area of Relocated Yankees.
''I don't need the winters anymore and a university town makes you feel young again, which is how I see retirement.''

HEADLINE: Amazon, Forced To Collect a Tax, Is Adding Roots

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; Nick Bilton contributed reporting from Santa Monica, Calif.

 BODY:
PATTERSON, Calif. -- At the moment, it is little more than dirt and gravel. But a sunbaked field at the edge of this farming town will play a significant role in one of the most ambitious retailing ventures of the era: the relentless quest by the online mall Amazon.com to become all things to all shoppers.
A million-square-foot warehouse stocking razor blades and books, diapers and dog food will soon rise on this spot, less than a mile from the highway that will deliver these and just about every other product imaginable to customers 85 miles away in San Francisco. It is hundreds of miles closer to those consumers than Amazon's existing centers in Nevada and Arizona.
A similar distribution center is being built on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Others are under way in Indiana, New Jersey, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. 
This multibillion-dollar building frenzy comes as Amazon is about to lose perhaps its biggest competitive edge -- that the vast majority of its customers do not pay sales tax. After negotiations with lawmakers, the company is beginning to collect taxes in California, Texas, Pennsylvania and other states. But Amazon hopes that the warehouses will allow it to provide better service, giving it the ability to up-end the retailing industry in an entirely new way.
Amazon will soon be able to cut as much as a day off its two-day shipping times, said Jeff Bezos, its chief executive, in an interview. This will put the much-rumored same-day delivery -- the elusive aspiration of every online merchant -- potentially within reach in some metropolitan areas.
''We want fast delivery,'' Mr. Bezos said. At a minimum, ''we can work on making it the next day.''
It is a monumental bet, even for a company that consistently defied skeptics on Wall Street and Main Street as it rose to become one of the country's largest retailers. Amazon's delivery of everyday objects needs to be fast enough and cheap enough to wean customers from their local stores. Yet it also must be economically feasible for the retailer, which is investing so heavily in the warehouses that it is barely profitable.
If Amazon can truly deliver on its ambitions, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at the research firm Forrester, ''it will be the dominant retailer in the decade to come.''
Amazon will begin collecting sales tax in California on Saturday. Local merchants have been waiting for this day for more than a decade. Now that it has arrived, though, they are tempering their joy at the company's apparent surrender.
''Amazon is so aggressive on so many fronts,'' said Amy Thomas, the owner of three Pegasus stores in the East Bay of San Francisco that sell new and used books as well as magazines. ''It's hard to keep putting out fires everywhere. They sell e-books. They're becoming publishers. And now they want to do same-day shipping. They're an octopus.''
Despite the attention that Amazon's technology receives -- its latest e-readers were introduced last week to the usual fanfare -- the majority of its sales are old-fashioned three-dimensional objects. The company's retail sales in the United States are on track this year to be roughly comparable to those of enterprises like McDonald's, Sears and Safeway. And while its sales are only about 12 percent that of Walmart, the reigning retail kingpin, they are increasing much faster.
''Amazon is the giant sucking sound in retail,'' said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. But the company, he added, is switching to an untested game plan: ''They have to hope that same-day delivery will offset the price advantage they no longer have.''
Since the company's founding, Mr. Bezos held on tightly to a 1992 Supreme Court decision that said mail-order merchants did not have to collect tax in states where they did not have physical operations. (Consumers were supposed to pay a use tax directly to the state, but few did.)
''The original justification for this de facto tax exemption was that the Internet ought to get some growing space,'' said Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ''Amazon collecting the tax in California, the birthplace of the commercial Internet, says that the Net can compete on a level playing field with traditional retail.''
Amazon executives maintained that the sales tax exemption was not much of an advantage. Its regulatory filings told a different story, noting that collecting taxes could ''decrease our ability to compete.''
California retailers, particularly a handful of remaining independent booksellers, would love to see a dent in Amazon's business. ''Oliver Wendell Holmes said taxes are the price of civilization, but Amazon did not want to pay,'' said Michael Barnard, president of the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association.
Booksellers concede that Amazon, which offers a flat annual rate for fast shipping to encourage frequent orders, is still likely to be cheaper even when it collects taxes. The most Mr. Barnard can hope is that Amazon's notoriously low margins -- it makes little more than a penny for every dollar in sales -- will eventually catch up with it. ''Same-day delivery is very, very expensive,'' he said.
States began aggressively asserting that Amazon should collect taxes in 2008, when New York passed a law compelling the company to do so. Amazon is challenging the law in court but is collecting the tax for now.
The biggest battle was fought last summer in California after Gov. Jerry Brown signed a measure that widened the definition of physical operations to include marketing affiliates. The company initially tried to put the law on the ballot but ended up striking a deal with the state to put two warehouses in California, including the one here, in exchange for a year's exemption from tax collection.
Amazon started collecting taxes in Texas this summer, and in Pennsylvania on Sept. 1. New Jersey's turn will come next summer, and several other states over the next two years. The company seems to be surrendering on the tax issue mostly in those states where it sees strategic value in new warehouses. Company officials say they hoped to see a national sales tax law in place that will supersede state laws.
The Patterson warehouse, which might employ as many as a thousand people, is supposed to open by mid-2013. Local officials were eager to land the project; the county has 15 percent unemployment.
Some residents want more. ''They want to be able to order something and then drive down the street to the warehouse and pick it up,'' said Rod Butler, the city manager. Here, just like everywhere else, shoppers dream of same-day delivery.

HEADLINE: A Real Estate Company Finds Itself Part of a Boom in Boston's Back Bay

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- In a blockbuster deal last fall, Jamestown Properties paid $226 million for a 130,000-square-foot portfolio spread over 28 buildings, mostly on Newbury Street -- the fashionable thoroughfare that hosts shops ranging from a Chanel boutique to nail salons in 19th-century town houses.
Back then, Jamestown, a real estate company based in Atlanta, chased retailers leaving malls for urban downtowns. A year later, Jamestown finds itself in a booming commercial property submarket, with nearly $2 billion in other projects that are planned or already being built. Those developments include new or renovated buildings that will house an expanded Chanel store and a Restoration Hardware outlet, and plans for a $500 million redevelopment of Copley Place mall.
Jamestown bought in Boston's Back Bay because the district had long been a sound property market, said Michael Phillips, chief operating officer at Jamestown. The current boom ''is an added benefit,'' he said. 
The company is progressing on its promise to enhance the Newbury Street shopping experience, but some of that progress is not yet visible. Jamestown has brought in 10 new retailers, begun $4.7 million in renovations and plans to invest another $5 million in building upgrades in the next five years. The current construction will create 15,835 square feet of renovated retail space and 11 rental apartments for a total of 50 luxury residential units. In some of its 28 buildings, Jamestown is creating or refashioning entrances on the lower levels. The largest, most noticeable project is the 10-month rehabilitation of adjoining buildings at 234 and 236 Newbury Street due for completion in the coming winter.
''Last year, our thinking was to follow the migration of better retailers from malls and onto a city street that has a real sense of place, historic architecture and is known as an independent shopping district,'' Mr. Phillips said. Jamestown, which has $4.3 billion in assets and is backed largely by American and European investors, has experience with retail assets in similarly distinctive downtown locations, including Fifth Avenue and the Meat Packing District in Manhattan, Georgetown in Washington and Union Square in San Francisco. New retailers brought to Newbury Street by Jamestown include the clothing boutiques Fred Perry, Bonobos and Jiberish, and the Australian skin care company Aesop.
Jamestown's plans to reinvigorate Newbury Street have been affirmed by about $2 billion in other mixed use development that is under way or being planned on the street and nearby.
''After lagging during the economic slowdown, development and retail activity on Newbury Street and the whole Back Bay has returned to peak levels, making it the city's healthiest retail district,'' said Randi Lathrop, deputy director of planning for the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
The Newbury Street retail market is 3.5 percent vacant, the lowest rate for the city's retail districts, which average 10 percent vacancy, she added.
On Newbury Street, a 49,000-square-foot building under construction will house a three-story Chanel store and six residences. A few blocks down, Restoration Hardware plans to move into a 40,000-square-foot building undergoing renovation. Within a few blocks, Liberty Mutual's $300 million, 590,000-square-foot office building is under construction. AvalonBay Communities, already a major neighborhood landlord, is constructing a $100 million, 188-unit, 28-story apartment building. The Berklee College of Music is building a $100 million tower for academic and residential use.
In the Back Bay, the Simon Group is planning a $500 million redevelopment and expansion of the Copley Place mall. The New England Conservatory of Music recently won city approval for a $130 million development. The city also approved the Christian Science Center plan for a 1.2-million-square-foot mixed-use development. Three other major projects that include offices, residences and retail are being planned around Boylston Street, one block from Newbury Street.
The market for Back Bay offices, whose workers shop and dine in the neighborhood, is stronger than ever, with robust investment sales and little available space, said Robert E. Griffin Jr., president of Cushman & Wakefield New England. ''Pricing is back to the 2007 peak, cap rates are as low as the 4 percent range, and asking rents -- up to $80 a square foot -- are rising,'' he said. With luxury residential development under way, ''strong office fundamentals are drawing investors who crave yield,'' he said.
Leading the latest spate of sales was last year's $930 million purchase by Boston Properties of the John Hancock Tower. That is a 4.3 percent capitalization rate, the initial rate of return on a property, expressed as a ratio of the current income relative to the purchase price, said Mr. Griffin, whose capital markets team brokered the deal. The seller, Normandy Real Estate Partners and Five Mile Capital Partners, bought it in 2009 for $660 million and realized a profit nearing $200 million, industry sources said.
Companies flock to the Back Bay because the employees they seek to attract and retain want to live, work and play in the neighborhood, which is well served by mass transit and highways. As a result, the office market was 4.7 percent vacant by midyear and the average asking rent was $50.95 per square foot, compared with a 12 percent vacancy and average asking rent of $45.34 per square foot for the overall downtown office market, according to Jones Lang LaSalle. Retail sales in the area are up to $1,250 per square foot, while rents are hitting $200 per square foot, said Ted Chryssicas, an executive vice president at Colliers International and a longtime retail specialist. ''Rents are close to peak and likely to rise,'' he said.
For Newbury Street, ''Jamestown is a huge plus, and we'll see the change they bring in three to five years,'' he said. ''With a big portfolio they can execute on their vision to move the street more toward being an international high street reminiscent of those in Europe.'' For example, the street could use more chef-driven restaurants, but for most such businesses, rents may be too high, he said. However, he added: ''Jamestown knows what it takes to bring in the right tenant mix and will subsidize deals.''
Last October, Jamestown bought the bulk of its portfolio, which makes up 15 percent of Newbury Street's buildings, from a joint venture of Taurus Investment Holdings and UrbanMeritage, both based in Boston, and Anglo Irish Private Investors, an affiliate of Anglo Irish Bank. The remaining five buildings were bought from a partnership of Taurus and Federal Realty Investment Trust of Rockville, Md. Taurus and UrbanMeritage took five years to assemble their portfolio, brand it as the Newbury Line and upgrade the tenants.
Previously, Charles M. Talanian, owner of C. Talanian Realty, owned the largest number of Newbury Street buildings. With 22 properties that encompass approximately 250,000 square feet, he is still the dominant presence there, and he said that business was very good with retail sales ranging from $400 to $1,200 per square foot. He is redeveloping two buildings into a retail space with 8,000 square feet, up from 4,000 square feet. For a few years, he said, Taurus and UrbanMeritage were ''buying up a storm,'' paying $1,000 to $1,800 per square foot compared with the customary $800 to $1,000 per square foot. ''Jamestown bought in four months, what it took me and my father 43 years to put together,'' he said. Its renovations and new tenants ''help everyone,'' he added. ''It isn't competition; it will boost my property values.''
In the last year, Jamestown's new leases have raised its occupancy rate to 83 percent, from 76 percent, Mr. Phillips said.

HEADLINE: Britain: British Schools Offer More Upward Mobility For Students Than American Ones, New Report Says

BYLINE: By D. D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
British schools now do a better job than American schools of lifting students up the social ladder, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report published Tuesday. In Britain, a student whose parents never graduated from high school has a 60 percent chance of attending college, while in the United States the odds are just 29 percent, one of the lowest levels among the 34 countries with advanced economies that make up the O.E.C.D., which is based in Paris.

HEADLINE: Seeking Critical Mass of Gender Equality in the Boardroom

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
There's a remarkable lack of women in corporate boardrooms around the world. The European Union is considering a remedy that would require that 40 percent of a company's directors be women. This may be a milestone for gender equality, but the question is, will it make any difference in how companies are run?
The number of women directors remains stubbornly low. According to Catalyst, a nonprofit organization devoted to furthering women in business, American companies have the fourth-highest average of women directors in the world. The average board of a Fortune 500 company in the United States is 16 percent women. 
Among other Western countries, Catalyst finds that Britain is at 15 percent, Germany is at 11.2 percent, and Japan is near the bottom at less than 1 percent. Nordic countries occupy the top three positions, with Norway being the world leader. Norway's boards on average are 40.1 percent women.
That Norway is the leader is no coincidence. The country passed a law in 2003 to ensure that 40 percent of directors for all public companies were women. The proposed European Union law is likely to be based on the Norwegian one, and the idea behind both is simple: to take away any excuse for a company to avoid gender equality.
The principles behind these laws are social and economic. The social element is based on the idea that the lack of women on boards is not a result of competency issues, but the clubby nature of these institutions. Lacking the ties to the men already on these boards, women are unjustly denied the opportunity to serve.
But there is also an economic argument that is sometimes made to support the role of women on boards. The claim is that boards with women become better decision makers, increase companies' profits and lead them to be more humanely run.
These assertions are based on research that in general makes the unsurprising conclusion that men and women are different, something some of us may have read about in "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus." That book was about love and relationships, but studies have found that women in the boardroom have different values, make decisions differently and engender a more cooperative atmosphere.
There's even an Israeli study that finds that the more girls in a school class, the better both boys and girls do on test-taking, and another one that finds that orchestras with a greater representation of women have improved organizational performance in the long run, at least as perceived by the players. That women can have a positive effect on men is something that anyone observing a third-grade class could agree on, and perhaps surprisingly, it seems to work in the boardroom.
That men and women are different may be true, but this still doesn't mean that the more women there are, the better the company's profits. In two studies of the Norwegian experiment thus far, neither were supportive of the role of women on boards. One study found that Norwegian firms declined in value, while the other found a decrease in profitability.
A few commentators explained the findings by noting that the mass appointment of Norwegian women at once led to younger and more inexperienced boards. The question remains, what happens when there is an equal weighting of women and experience?
The couple dozen general studies on the role of gender in the boardroom are more mixed. They come to differing conclusions, some finding women to be a benefit, others a negative, only creating more uncertainty over the issue.
Because of this, the focus these days is on whether several women make a difference rather than having a token woman director. In this area, there is more support that women do have an effect.
One study found that in German companies with a board composition that was greater than 40 percent women, firm performance was positive.
Another recent study, by Miriam Schwartz-Ziv of Israeli, found that boards with three women directors or greater were "approximately twice as likely both to request further information and to take an initiative" and have better performance.
While these studies are promising for advocates of women on boards, the bottom line is that the effect of women directors has yet to be established. Whether they add value just by their presence is undetermined because the number of women on boards remains low. The true test will be when there are a number of companies with boards comprising 50 percent or more women that can be compared against those with less. We're not there yet.
The European Union is seeking to fulfill this goal. According to reports, the European Union justice commissioner is keen to introduce its law in the coming months. France and Italy are instituting quotas at the 20 percent level, and India recently required certain public companies to have at least one woman director. But passage of the European Union law is not certain. Britain has already issued a letter protesting the effort, asserting that voluntary measures should be given time.
As for the United States, we're clearly not there yet. Even talking about gender stereotypes makes many uneasy because it paints women and men with a uniform brush and doesn't recognize that women and men are different depending on their individual qualities. And there is little likelihood of a quota system being enacted anytime soon.
Gender equality is one goal, but those who think that the number of women directors will reach a critical mass and change the way boards are governed are likely to be disappointed.
Even if it is true that women are different, the way boards are run in the United States may make these differences meaningless.
Boards are inherently behind the curve in decision-making and monitoring the all-powerful chief executive, something we saw in the years leading up to the financial crisis when boards failed to monitor their companies' risky financial bets.
In addition, American directors largely come from the same class and business background, meaning these people can lull themselves into groupthink where diverse views are muted.
Even if more women directors are added, they are likely to come from this same background and class as their male counterparts. And these dynamics will mean that when women join boards, they're more likely than not to act just as the men already there.
So if we are really serious about changing boards, we need to not only add new voices to the board, but find a way for the board itself to change.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Grew Slightly As Exports Fell in July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States trade deficit grew to $42 billion in July, widened by fewer exports to Europe, India and Brazil that offset a steep decline in oil imports. 
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that the trade deficit increased 0.2 percent from June's deficit of $41.9 billion.
American exports fell 1 percent, to $183.3 billion. Sales of autos, telecommunications equipment and heavy machinery all declined. Imports dropped 0.8 percent, to $225.3 billion.
Economists noted that the deficit would have grown much faster had it not been for a 6.5 percent drop in oil imports, largely reflecting cheaper global prices. Prices have increased since then, while demand for exports has fallen.
''It won't be long before the deficit widens more significantly as the global slowdown takes a greater toll on U.S. exports,'' said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. Mr. Dales said the trade deficit would most likely weigh on growth in the second half of the year.
A wider trade deficit acts as a drag on growth because the United States is typically spending more on imports while taking in less from the sales of American-made goods. United States growth slowed to a 1.7 percent annual rate in the April to June quarter, well below what is needed to accelerate a slackening job market.
Exports to Europe fell 11.7 percent in July from June. Many European countries are in recession, which has cut demand for American-made goods. The region accounts for about a fifth of United States exports.
Exports also fell in other big emerging economies. American sales of goods to Brazil declined 4.4 percent. Exports to India dropped 1.2 percent.
The United States exported 0.4 percent more goods to China, the world's second-largest economy. But the deficit with China grew 7.2 percent in July, to a record $29.4 billion. United States imports from China jumped 5.6 percent.

HEADLINE: National Schools Debate Is on Display in Chicago

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- What started here as a traditional labor fight over pay, benefits and working conditions has exploded into a dramatic illustration of the national debate over how public school districts should rate teachers.
At stake are profound policy questions about how teachers should be granted tenure, promoted or fired, as well as the place standardized tests will have in the lives of elementary and high school students.
One of the main sticking points in the negotiations here between the teachers union and Mayor Rahm Emanuel is a new teacher evaluation system that gives significant and increasing weight to student performance on standardized tests. Personnel decisions would be based on those evaluations.
Over the last few years, a majority of states have adopted similar systems, spurred by the desire to qualify for the Obama administration's Race to the Top education grants. The Education Commission of the States says that 30 states require that evaluations include evidence of student achievement on tests, and at least 13, and the District of Columbia, use achievement measured by test scores for half or more of a teacher's rating. 
Proponents say these measures are needed to improve teaching in a country where 33 percent of fourth graders are not reading at grade level and about one-quarter of public high school students do not graduate on time, if at all. They say the new rating systems will help districts identify the best and worst teachers.
These efforts are stirring skepticism and anger among teachers, some of whom express a sense that those behind the new evaluations know little about what it is like to be in a classroom. Others fear that heavy reliance on scores will turn schools into test-taking factories.
That sentiment certainly permeated the picket lines and rallies in Chicago this week.
''Children are so much more than data points on a grid,'' said Elizabeth Coughlan, a third-grade teacher of gifted bilingual students, who was marching in a rally where teachers clogged downtown streets on Monday. Another teacher held a sign that read, ''Let's teach kids to think outside the box not fill in circles.''
Advocates of the new evaluation systems say test scores should not be the only measure of a teacher's quality. Even those who believe that such systems can work in theory say that it is important to get teacher buy-in.
''It's tough work because it's hard to get it to be fair,'' said Kathy Christie, a vice president at the Education Commission. ''We've only recently started getting student data that could be traced back to the classroom. It's all very intertwined and complex, and it could fail very easily if people don't get it right. Teachers have very valid concerns.''
Still, she said, efforts to reach a consensus could cause the rating systems to collapse in practice. ''It's like trying to put a man on the moon by committee,'' Ms. Christie said. ''At some point, decisions have to be made.''
In Chicago, the teachers union has bristled at what it sees as a unilateral effort to install a system that will start by basing 25 percent of a teacher's rating on student achievement, going to 40 percent in five years.
The Illinois legislature passed a law in 2010 that requires all districts to develop teacher evaluations based in part on student performance, with Chicago being the first district to begin its system this year. The law, which passed unanimously in the Senate and received only one opposing vote in the House, requires that various test results be used for at least 25 percent of a teacher's rating in the first two years, growing to 30 percent. Classroom observations also figure prominently in the evaluations. A separate law passed in 2011 allows teacher evaluations to be used in tenure and layoff decisions.
.
Chicago's teachers say they would accept a rating where 25 percent was based on student achievement on tests, but balk at the increase to 40 percent, higher than the state standard.
Across the country, critics have seized on the Chicago fight to blast the use of a teacher's ability to raise scores as an unreliable measure. The National Center for Fair and Open Testing put out a statement from its public education director, Robert Schaeffer, saying, '' 'Enough is enough' to so-called reforms based on standardized exam misuse.''
Several studies have shown that teachers who receive high value-added scores -- the term for the effect that teachers have on student test performance -- in one year can score poorly a year later. ''There are big swings from year to year,'' said Jesse Rothstein, associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley. But other studies have shown that students taught by teachers who achieve high value-added scores go on to have lower teenage pregnancy rates, are more likely to go to college and earn higher incomes as adults.
Some studies, including one that looked at a pilot of teacher evaluations here, have shown correlations between teachers whose students' test scores improve and those who receive high marks in classroom observations and on student surveys.
Sara Ray Stoelinga, senior director at the Urban Institute at the University of Chicago who conducted the study, said that using student test scores protects teachers from arbitrary decisions by principals. ''The theory,'' she said, ''is that if you have multiple pieces of information, it gives the most fair and accurate measure.''
But with research at an early stage, other districts and states have stepped carefully. In Colorado, where a sweeping education law passed three years ago stipulating that half of a teacher's evaluation should be tied to student performance, the state is slowly introducing the programs, with training. ''We want to make sure to do it right rather than do it fast,'' said Michael Johnston, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the bill.
And in New Haven, Conn., the district and the union spent more than six months discussing a new evaluation system, and union members felt their feedback was valued. ''We knew we were being treated as equal partners,'' said David Cicarella, president of the New Haven Federation of Teachers. ''It can't just be one test that the kids take one week in March.''
Even those who say there is value in using test scores to measure a teacher's performance say there are plenty of other factors. ''There are other things that teachers do that aren't captured by test scores,'' said Douglas Staiger, an economist at Dartmouth College who has studied the effects of teachers on student achievement. The debate over whether test scores accurately reflect a teacher's ability, he said, should ultimately be about ''how much importance we want to place on academic achievement defined by the test.''

HEADLINE: Hoping to Lure Riders With Scenic Commutes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Titania Inglis, a 33-year-old fashion designer who wears her own flouncy avant-garde creations, likes to take the East River Ferry from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where she keeps her work samples, to the East 34th Street slip in Manhattan and then bicycle to the garment center. Indeed, Ms. Inglis, who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, can wax rhapsodic about the pleasures of sailing on a swift tidal river glistening with sunlight.
''It's about having a fun commute,'' she said, as she wheeled her bicycle off the ferry arriving at 4:10 p.m. at the India Street pier in Greenpoint. ''The wind in your hair, watching the skyline come toward you as you approach Midtown and getting to see New York from this vantage point.'' 
But she was one of only three people to get off that ferry. And the same number got on.
Even at the start of the 5 p.m. rush hour, the commuters getting off and on could be counted on one hand. Though the numbers are more robust during the morning rush hours -- on Monday, 14 people caught the 8:39 ferry to Pier 11 near Wall Street and 21 caught the 8:40 to East 34th Street -- they still raise questions about the popularity and profitability of the service as a whole. The ferries can hold 149 passengers.
Riders almost universally love the seven-stop ferry service, and the city has bet $9 million in subsidies that over a three-year contract, the service will win converts and prompt development in the vicinities of five ferry landings along the reviving industrial waterfront in Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Long Island City, Queens. But after more than a year of operations, the verdict on whether the service will sustain itself is far from clear.
The number of riders on the service as a whole is growing; in its first year, beginning in June 2011, 1.2 million passengers rode the ferries, according to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which oversees the service. Many of those were tourists who used the boats as a cheap sightseeing vehicle -- there is a free bus that takes riders from 34th Street at Avenue of the Americas to the river pier -- and families who saw the boats as a weekend pleasure cruise, one reason the service is deploying 399-passenger models for weekends.
But it is not yet apparent that the ferries can become a daily habit for enough people to keep New York Waterway, which operates the ferry, from losing money, as it has on some other routes. Hunters Point in Long Island City and Schaefer Landing in southern Williamsburg contribute even fewer passengers than Greenpoint, while northern Williamsburg and Dumbo, Brooklyn, are the ridership leaders.
The service, which at peak hours runs boats every 20 minutes at each pier, functions especially well for residents of Brooklyn and Queens who live a short walk from the ferry and have jobs or attend schools near the ferry's two stops in Manhattan. Riders pay $4 a ride, almost double the subway fare, though an unlimited $140 monthly pass reduces the expense. (Having to add subway fare on top of the ferry cost deters many riders, experts say.)
A three-year effort to run a five-stop ferry service on the East River foundered in 2011 because without city subsidies, the revenue ridership was not sufficient to pay for the costs, said Tom Fox, former president of New York Water Taxi, which ran the service. Most transit services, like the subways, buses and the Staten Island Ferry, operate with some sort of government subsidies, but the current East River subsidy is assured for only three years.
''It's difficult to tell what a break-even point would be, but to be successful waterborne transportation would have to have some kind of subsidy because you're competing against a $2.25 subway,'' Mr. Fox said.
Paul Goodman, the chief executive of BillyBey Ferry Company, the division of New York Waterway that operates the East River service, acknowledged that the subsidy had ''enabled frequency of schedule and a price point that makes the service very accessible.''
Seth W. Pinsky, president of the Economic Development Corporation, compared the new service's use to the early days of the subways when lines were built in sparsely populated farmland and the development of apartment houses gradually followed to pack those lines. In cultivating ridership, he said, it was important to have predictable, regular service, so he plans to work with the City Council to extend the ferry service beyond the three-year contract until sufficient ridership is developed.
''If you look at earlier experiments, the service was sporadic and infrequent,'' he said. ''People didn't become habituated.''
The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who is expected to be a leading candidate for mayor in 2013, has been a booster, calling the response by riders ''nothing short of a tidal wave.''
At the India Street pier, riders said they had heard about the service through word-of-mouth or by chance. That means many other residents of the neighborhoods it serves may not understand that it is indeed a viable and far more peaceful alternative to the subway. (In these areas, the G is the only subway line and it does not go into Manhattan.)
Greenpoint is a neighborhood of old row houses and warehouses whose population of 40,000 is a mixture of immigrant Poles, hipsters and, increasingly, people who wear business attire to work. Like Williamsburg before it, the neighborhood has suddenly acquired a counterintuitive cachet and, as a result of a 2005 zoning change, thousands of new condominiums are expected to replace idle or underused industrial buildings. City leaders are hoping that these newcomers take the ferry.
Regular riders are enthusiastic.
Noah Kraft, a broad-shouldered, redheaded 25-year-old who describes himself as a media entrepreneur, called the ferry a ''lifesaver'' because it made his frequent business trips ''incredibly easy.''
''You get the homeyness and neighborhoodness of being in Greenpoint and still have the city at your fingertips,'' he said. ''Having that dichotomy is really beautiful, not to mention that there's great joy in being on the water and not underground.''

HEADLINE: Schools Look to Weed Out Nonresidents

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON and KRISTIN HUSSEY

 BODY:
Like many before her, Susie T. Ponce bought a house in Greenwich, Conn., for the schools. Her son and daughter attend the Hamilton Avenue School, a magnet school that offers foreign languages in kindergarten and a Suzuki music program.
Ms. Ponce also drives a minivan with New York plates, which explains why at 6:30 one morning last school year, she opened her door to find a Greenwich school official checking to make sure that she and her children lived in the house they said they did. Someone had reported those New York plates to the school.
''It was a big surprise,'' she said. ''They do follow up.''
Officials with Greenwich Public Schools are doing more than just making house visits to ensure their students live in the district. A new policy this year requires parents or guardians registering their child for school to complete notarized affidavits testifying to their address. Lying, the document points out, could result in criminal prosecution. 
The district's residency office -- whose duties include checking on people like Ms. Ponce -- has new tools to monitor students' whereabouts, including a lease-tracking database to alert the office when a lease expires. Officials now crosscheck property records with the Greenwich tax assessor's office, the Postal Service and the local newspaper, which lists property transfers every month.
Another new policy required renters to submit notarized affidavits from their landlords attesting that their leases were legitimate and promising to notify the district when they expired. After complaints that the requirement was too burdensome to renters and landlords, officials dropped it last month.
Many school districts around the country, particularly those in wealthier areas, have taken to scrutinizing living arrangements in recent years. With shrinking budgets and a stagnant economy, taxpayers are increasingly vigilant about how their dollars are spent, administrators said, and unwilling to pay for students whose families may be tricking the system to get a better education.
''There are lots and lots of questions about whether the students in our schools are residents,'' said William S. McKersie, superintendent of the Greenwich Public Schools.
Trumbull, a town about 30 miles away, for example, also requires renters -- and their landlords -- to submit notarized affidavits. Gary Cialfi, assistant superintendent for Trumbull Public Schools, said the issue was ''big and getting bigger,'' with his office spending more time rooting out nonresidents.
''We are trying to make sure we are protecting the Trumbull taxpayer from paying for students who are not legitimate enrollees of the school,'' he said. Three years ago, nine students were forced to leave when it became clear they were not residents of the town. The number fell to eight the next year and five this year.
In New York City, where schools in more affluent zones often have kindergarten waiting lists, some principals have begun taking a magnifying glass to enrollment forms. Elizabeth Phillips, principal of Public School 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said the school did home visits when the residency ''is questionable.'' Visits are up in the past five years. At neighboring P.S. 107, a few visits were made last year when there was a long waiting list, but Eve Litwack, the principal, said school officials did not have to make any this year.
In Greenwich, the new process has irked some parents, particularly renters. Michelle Bonitto, who rents in the Riverside section of Greenwich, said she was taken aback by the requirement to have her landlord sign a notarized affidavit to register her son for the first grade at the International School at Dundee. ''The procedure is already quite stringent,'' she said, requiring photo IDs, medical records, previous school records and her son's birth certificate. ''I gave them a copy of my lease, and that should be enough.''
Dr. McKersie, who started as superintendent in the summer, agreed the landlord requirement was unnecessary. ''It's saying a third party adult could have a major say in whether a youngster could attend Greenwich Public Schools,'' he said. ''We weren't willing to let that happen.''
Tom Bobkowski, director of school safety services for Greenwich, said he conducted 61 investigations last year -- all the result of complaints by people suspecting particular students did not belong. By the end of the year, eight students had withdrawn. ''It's a problem that is escalating,'' he said.
Greenwich has 8,770 students, up 11 percent since 1998. It costs $18,516 to educate a student, 95 percent of which comes from local coffers, said Kim Eves, a spokeswoman for the school system. Dr. McKersie said the resources spent investigating were worth it. ''Irrespective of the number of annual withdrawals due to residency verification investigations, we have a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of Greenwich to ensure that the students attending the Greenwich Public Schools are in fact legitimate residents of Greenwich, and/or enrolled as children of town employees,'' he said in an e-mail.
Greenwich may not exactly be known for having a rich racial makeup, but the district's minority enrollment has grown to 31.7 percent from 19.3 percent in 1998. School officials said they were being careful not to single out minority students for scrutiny. ''We don't want aspersions cast as to who is a resident here,'' Dr. McKersie said. ''We have to respect the diversity in this town.''
Many of the complaints in Greenwich, which borders Westchester County, appear to be about parents who drive cars with New York license plates. Ms. Ponce said she had New York plates because she grew up in Queens, her business is in Port Chester, N.Y., and the plates are her last tangible attachment to New York.
Kristen Laczkowski, 40, whose children attend New Lebanon Elementary School, about a quarter mile from the state line, said she had seen dozens of cars with New York plates dropping children off over the last few years.
After sitting in the parking lot and taking notes on two occasions in two different school years, Ms. Laczkowski said she gave a list of more than 30 out-of-state license plate numbers to the school principal and to the school board. ''If I pay property taxes in Greenwich, then I am entitled to the perks of being in Greenwich,'' she said. ''It's not a witch hunt.''
''If you belong to this neighborhood, you belong to this school,'' she said. ''If you don't belong to this neighborhood, you shouldn't be in the school.''

HEADLINE: Lehman Is Biding Its Time to Market Its Real Estate

BYLINE: By MATT HUDGINS

 BODY:
Nearly four years after Lehman Brothers touched off a worldwide financial crisis when it filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15, 2008, the estate of the failed investment bank continues to control more than $10 billion of real estate assets in its $40.5 billion portfolio. And all of it eventually must be converted to cash to repay creditors.
In Manhattan alone, Lehman, which is now a trust company, owns several prominent properties including a 1.2-million-square-foot-office building at 237 Park Avenue, and On The Ave, a boutique hotel at 2178 Broadway on the Upper West Side. Its other assets -- more than 250 positions in all, down from more than 700 immediately after the bankruptcy filing -- range from small vacant lots to the scenic Moonlight Basin ski resort in Big Sky, Mont., the 2,000-acre Boot Ranch golf community in the Texas Hill Country, and hotels and condominium projects in Miami, New York and Maui, Hawaii. 
Its largest asset is Archstone, the Colorado-based apartment giant whose $22 billion takeover in 2007 helped create Lehman's fatal mountain of debt. One of the largest apartment owners in the nation, Archstone had 59,419 rental apartments in 181 properties as of March 31. Last month, Lehman registered Archstone for a public offering, hoping to use those proceeds to help pay its creditors. ''It's not universally known that we still have a very active portfolio that we're managing,'' said Jeff Fitts, head of real estate for Lehman Brothers. Since filing for bankruptcy, Lehman has also reinvested $7 billion into the real estate portfolio, aiming to increase its creditors' ultimate return, he said.
For casual observers, some confusion is understandable. Barclays acquired Lehman's 10,000-employee investment banking arm shortly after Lehman entered into the largest and possibly the most complicated bankruptcy filing in history. Lehman, which had huge mortgage security losses, retained illiquid assets on its balance sheet, including real estate assets or positions in major metropolitan and smaller markets in the United States and Europe.
The plan, then and now, has been to wait for better days in the real estate markets and eventually sell everything at prices unattainable in the financial crisis. And while Lehman was waiting for property values to recover from recessionary lows, the real estate team initiated plans to restructure troubled financing, correct other problems and fill its rentable buildings with tenants before offering them for sale.
''In the early days, the opportunity funds would have gladly bought anything and everything that we were willing to sell for the right price. It just wouldn't have been advantageous to us,'' Mr. Fitts said. ''It's hard to explain to people the amount of restructuring and cleanup work that had to be done early on to get the properties to a state that they could be sold to nonopportunistic buyers.''
Now Lehman is on a mission to extract every dollar from the trust's holdings. Claims allowed against the estate amount to an estimated $361 billion as of March 31, according to a balance sheet review Lehman filed in July. Under its Chapter 11 plan, the trust began a wind-down period in January 2011 that is expected to recover $67.5 billion by the end of 2015, or soon thereafter.
Lehman has already distributed $22 billion to creditors, who will receive about 18 cents on the dollar depending on their class and priority in the bankruptcy. A quarter of the roughly $40.5 billion in assets remaining to be disposed of is in real estate, including debt and equity positions, and Lehman has been gradually listing those properties for sale.
Of the total Lehman has invested in its real estate holdings, some $3 billion went to buy the 53 percent of Archstone that Lehman did not already own, blocking an attempt by Equity Residential to acquire part of the apartment giant. The real estate magnate Sam Zell is chairman of Equity Residential.
The other $4 billion of reinvestments was used to settle disputes, buy out partners, pay off debt or perform needed repairs and improvements to attract tenants and increase resale values. That includes property additions, such as the landscaped rooftop terrace that Lehman is building for tenant use at 816 Congress, an office building the company owns in Austin, Tex. Excluding Archstone, for every dollar Lehman has invested back into the portfolio, it is projecting more than $2 in returns.
''The only way to maximize the value of this real estate is to spend money and enhance it,'' Mr. Fitts said.
In 2010, for example, Lehman invested more than $200 million to retire debt and renovate 10 office properties it owned in partnership with Monday Properties in Rosslyn, a neighborhood in Arlington, Va. When Lehman sold its 78.5 percent ownership interest to Goldman Sachs in October 2011, the three-million-square-foot portfolio was valued at more than $1.25 billion. Lehman would have made only a small fraction of that amount had it sold the portfolio at the time of the bankruptcy filing in 2008, before making improvements and in much softer market conditions, Mr. Fitts said.
Across from Madison Square Park, Lehman restructured the debt on an 845,000-square-foot office building in which it owned equity at 200 Fifth Avenue and then worked with its partner, L&L Holding Company, to bring in tenants. The building was 45 percent preleased when the debt was restructured, but occupancy had risen to 80 percent by the time Lehman sold its majority stake last year.
''In the dark days, our equity position on that building was worth almost nothing, and we pulled out way more than nothing when it sold,'' said Mr. Fitts, although he declined to disclose proceeds from the sale. Such well-located commercial properties, when fully leased to tenants who can be depended upon to pay their rent, are known in real estate circles as ''core'' assets. Core properties fetch higher prices than buildings with vacant space or those in need of investments.
''Our goal is to get a property to a core buyer,'' Mr. Fitts said. ''There are still assets in this portfolio that core buyers won't buy, but the 200 Fifths and the Rosslyns of the world sold to core buyers.''
Lehman was wise to wait for better pricing before trying to sell its New York assets, said James Murphy, executive managing director in the New York office of Colliers International, a commercial real estate company.
The average price per square foot paid for core office buildings in Midtown this year is $741, still short of the peak price level of $947 reached in 2008, Mr. Murphy said. Recent office building sales on Park Avenue, however, have drawn prices ranging from $900 per square foot to nearly $1,100 per square foot, he said. The size and location of 237 Park will attract a variety of core investors, Mr. Murphy predicted.
Real estate was only one of several factors that combined to push Lehman into bankruptcy, according to Lawrence Longua, a clinical associate professor at the New York University Schack Institute of Real Estate. ''It was really a confidence or credibility issue,'' he said. ''Nobody would do business with them.''
But Mr. Longua expressed confidence that Lehman's strategy of waiting for the market to recuperate before trying to convert its assets to cash would result in a greater recovery than would have been generated in a rapid liquidation.
''I admire what Lehman is doing because at the end of the day, what they're doing isn't going to be benefiting anybody at Lehman,'' Mr. Longua said. ''Lehman is still an entity that over the long term is going to be going out of business. The beneficiaries of all of this will be their creditors.''

HEADLINE: Dow Index at Highest Close Since '07

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average reached its highest level in more than four and a half years on Tuesday in light trading as investors continued to wait for decisions from the Federal Reserve and a German court.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index also posted slight gains.
Equities have rallied in recent weeks on hopes that central banks in the United States and Europe will provide monetary stimulus to bolster their economies. On Thursday, traders will be closely watching whether the Federal Reserve announces additional steps to support low interest rates. On Wednesday, Germany's highest court will decide on the legality of the euro zone's new bailout fund. 
Economists have been forecasting a 60 percent chance that the Fed will announce another round of quantitative easing, as its bond-purchasing program is known, at the end of its two-day meeting. A disappointing report on August employment released last Friday bolstered that view.
Jamie Cox, managing partner of the Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Va., is among those anticipating further monetary stimulus from the Fed. But, he said, ''I don't think it's a good idea. I don't think it's warranted.''
Some investors are concerned that much of the anticipated news about additional monetary stimulus has already been priced into equities, exposing the stock market to a decline should the Fed disappoint. They also argue that the Fed's actions have already distorted market prices.
''We're in a technically overbought situation, so those traders are going to take their profits going into the Fed meeting,'' Mr. Cox said. ''The Nasdaq has run up so much over the last couple of days any disappointment by the Fed could cause a reversal.''
On Tuesday, the Dow industrials closed up 69.07 points, or 0.52 percent, to 13,323.36, its highest close since the end of 2007. Shares of energy, industrial and financial companies led the advance. I.B.M. rose $2.32, or 1.15 percent, to $203.27, while Caterpillar added $1.50, or 1.72 percent, to $88.60.
The S.& P. 500 closed up 4.48 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,433.56.
The Nasdaq edged up just 0.50 point, to 3,104.53. Most of its early gains were erased in the afternoon as shares of Apple dropped $2.15, or 0.32 percent to $660.59.
Traders' expectations that the Constitutional Court of Germany would approve the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone's new bailout fund, also bolstered market sentiment. But legal experts believe the court will impose tough conditions limiting Berlin's flexibility on future bailouts, which could be seen as a negative by the markets.
Investors are keeping an eye on big-capitalization technology companies because of their role in global business spending. Technology stocks fell Monday after a warning from Intel that reduced demand will hurt its third-quarter results. Intel stabilized on Tuesday, gaining 8 cents, or 0.34 percent to $23.34 Tuesday.
In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 14/32, to 99 10/32, while its yield rose to 1.70 percent, from 1.65 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Vote for Gay Marriage Rises As Test in Upstate G.O.P. Race

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
TROY, N.Y. -- Before State Senator Roy J. McDonald, a Republican, voted last year to legalize same-sex marriage, he told reporters that anyone unhappy with his position could ''take the job and shove it.''
Now comes the test.
Mr. McDonald, a blunt-spoken son of this old mill city, has held elected office for more than three decades, first as a town supervisor. In recent years, he has focused on issues including disability awareness (he has two grandsons who are autistic) and improving services for veterans (he was an artillery forward observer in Vietnam). Now, he wants to talk about joblessness.
But even in a year in which economic issues are dominating many local and national campaigns, Mr. McDonald, 65, is having a hard time making job development the subject of his bid for re-election. Instead, his campaign has become a referendum on a single decision: his choice last year to cast one of the decisive votes that made same-sex marriage legal in New York State. 
This week, Mr. McDonald, who was first elected to the Senate in 2008, and two other Republicans will try to survive challenges by fellow Republicans who are criticizing the incumbents for voting in favor of same-sex marriage; a fourth Republican who voted in favor decided not to seek re-election. The turnout is expected to be unusually low, because the statewide primary is being held on Thursday, a day chosen by the Legislature to avoid asking voters to go to the polls on Tuesday, which was the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Mr. McDonald's challenger, Kathleen A. Marchione, the Saratoga County clerk, is running an insurgent campaign, dialing voters from a windowless office next to a Subway sandwich shop. She accuses Mr. McDonald of having deceived the voters who elected him by changing his position on same-sex marriage, which he voted to oppose in the past.
''People feel betrayed,'' Ms. Marchione said. ''I've heard that a lot -- that they feel betrayed by our senator, that you said one thing, you do something else.''
Mr. McDonald makes no apologies for his vote.
''I'm in the party of Abraham Lincoln -- I'm very proud of that,'' he said. ''I'm not in a party of a bunch of right-wing nitwits. It's Abraham Lincoln. It's everybody's included. And I feel that's very important.''
The primary is open only to 63,000 Republican voters in a district that stretches from rural farm towns to onetime industrial cities like Troy and Mechanicville to the more affluent Saratoga Springs. The race has national implications: New York was the first state to legalize same-sex marriage with the support of a Republican-controlled legislative chamber, and gay-rights advocates, who have showered Mr. McDonald with campaign contributions, fear that his defeat would discourage Republican legislators in other statehouses from bucking their party to support same-sex marriage.
''The more that the advocates for this are able to tell Republicans that you can do this and live, then the greater success they're going to have,'' said Robert J. Bellafiore, a communications consultant and former press secretary for Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican. ''But it's hard to convince somebody to take their first bungee jump if all they see at the bottom of the jump is a bunch of splattered bodies.''
Ms. Marchione, 58, a resident of Halfmoon, had one previous moment in the statewide spotlight: In 2007, she was among the most vocal opponents of an ill-fated plan by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. In the campaign this year, she often brings up the issue of same-sex marriage -- one of her campaign mailers quoted Mr. McDonald's ''shove it'' comment; another showed side-by-side photographs of Mr. McDonald and President Obama, compared their positions on same-sex marriage and derided the senator as a ''Barack Obama Republican.''
In an interview, Ms. Marchione described Mr. McDonald as ''one of the most liberal senators in the Republican caucus.''
''People come back so many times to me and say, 'I believe marriage is between a man and a woman,' '' Ms. Marchione said. Still, she said, if elected, she would not seek to repeal the Marriage Equality Act. ''This issue has passed,'' she said, given the large Democratic majority in the State Assembly and the presence of a governor who supports same-sex marriage.
Mr. McDonald, who was also once a state assemblyman, said he would not regret his marriage vote even if it ended his political career. But he lamented a modern political culture that he described as filled with vitriol and devoid of compassion.
And while he said he did not want to be seen as a martyr for gay rights -- ''I'm not looking for any more of my 15 minutes of fame; I've had enough. I just want to do my job'' -- he expressed frustration that some Republicans seemed more eager to make the primary about same-sex marriage than, say, chronic unemployment.
At a debate on Tuesday night at Russell Sage College in Troy, Ms. Marchione attacked Mr. McDonald for his vote on same-sex marriage, and the audience was at its most boisterous when the subject was discussed.
Ms. Marchione painted the senator as desperate to keep his office, saying, ''I guess he's changed his mind about taking the job and shoving it.'' She repeatedly suggested that Mr. McDonald's vote had been motivated by the promise of campaign donations.
Mr. McDonald rejected that. ''I did it because I'm a human being that cares,'' he said. ''I could have found an easier way to get re-elected.'' He grew visibly frustrated as the night went on, at one moment pointing to his wife in the audience and saying, ''I, too, believe in traditional marriage.''
The race between Mr. McDonald and Ms. Marchione is the most expensive legislative primary in New York this year. Mr. McDonald has raised more than $926,000 in this campaign cycle, thanks in part to help from supporters of same-sex marriage, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who donated $10,300. Ms. Marchione, by contrast, has raised more than $180,000.
Mr. McDonald is also backed by the Senate Republican majority, even though the caucus's members overwhelmingly opposed same-sex marriage last year.
Advocates on both sides of the issue will be watching the race closely, as legislators in several states, including Delaware and Rhode Island, are expected next year to consider legislation that would allow gay and lesbian couples to marry.
''You only get it done if you create bipartisan support in these legislatures,'' said Brian Ellner, who helped lead the campaign to pass same-sex marriage in New York and is working on the issue in other states.
''It was the key in New York. It's a national model, and that's why it's very important to protect those legislators who showed enormous courage in supporting fairness and equality for all families.''
On the other side of the issue, the National Organization for Marriage sees the race as an opportunity to warn legislators in other states of the political repercussions that it says come with supporting same-sex marriage. A recent fund-raising solicitation from the group said the New York contests offered a chance to ''send a message to the whole country.''
''Regardless of what happens, it is an utter lie to say, 'Vote for gay marriage; it won't have any effect,' '' Brian S. Brown, the organization's president, said. ''I don't think any observer on the left or the right can say that's the case.''

HEADLINE: Moody's Warns That U.S. May Face Debt Downgrade

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jada F. Smith and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional leaders dug in their heels on Tuesday against any quick deal to resolve a looming fiscal disaster before the election, even as a major ratings agency warned that it would downgrade the government's debt if no solution was found by year's end.
Democratic leaders have warned their own members to tone down any discussion of a short-term resolution to the ''fiscal cliff,'' betting that Republican fears over the January deadline will drive them to the negotiating table shortly after the November election. 
Speaker John A. Boehner, reacting to the downgrade notice from Moody's Investor Service, said it underscored the Republican position that the nation's precarious fiscal condition could be addressed only by cutting government spending.
''The threat to American jobs comes not from action on our debt, but from inaction on our debt,'' he said. ''The president and his economic advisers have consistently perpetuated the myth that downgrades are caused by efforts to force the government to stop spending money we don't have.''
The Moody's warning comes a year after its rival, Standard & Poor's, downgraded the United States' credit worthiness after the protracted stalemate over raising the nation's statutory borrowing limit.
Like S&P, Moody's emphasized political dysfunction more than soaring government debt. The agency said Washington must come to agreement to head off billions of dollars in simultaneous tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to begin in January -- and to put the government on a sustainable fiscal trajectory. Only then would the United States keep its AAA rating.
''If those negotiations lead to specific policies that produce a stabilization and then downward trend in the ratio of federal debt to G.D.P. over the medium term, the rating will likely be affirmed and the outlook returned to stable,'' Moody's said in a statement. ''If those negotiations fail to produce such policies, however, Moody's would expect to lower the rating.''
If no agreement is reached, all of the Bush-era tax cuts will expire in January, just as more than $1 trillion in automatic military and domestic cuts begin slicing spending. Numerous economists have warned that the hit to the economy will almost surely send the nation back into recession.
At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, suggested that Congress move now on a long-term framework that sets a target for deficit reduction and establishes the proportion of spending cuts, entitlement changes and revenue increases to get there. If an agreement on a broad outline could be reached, Congress should then push back the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts for six months, provided that revenue increases and spending cuts be enacted to pay for the delay.
The idea landed with a thud. ''It isn't as if people are lining up to sign up for it,'' Mr. Durbin said Tuesday.
Republicans have been pummeling Democrats on the presidential and Congressional campaign trails about the fiscal cliff.
''We continue to want to provide solutions and resolve the differences here in Washington,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said Tuesday on CNBC. ''All there's been over the last couple years is a one-way street.''
Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul D. Ryan, have suggested that the bipartisan deal last summer that set up the automatic cuts was President Obama's idea. Mr. Boehner has accused the president of failing to lead on the issue.
Democrats deny that, pointing to statements from Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan praising the deal when it was struck. Both men voted for it.
So far, Democrats do not appear troubled by the attacks. As Republican warnings over military cuts and tax increases grow louder, Democrats see their leverage growing stronger.
''Republicans talk a big game on defense -- they just don't want to pay for it,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. ''They want to increase defense spending, but they don't want to ask people like Mitt Romney to pay one more dime in taxes.''
If no deal is struck by Jan. 1, Mr. Obama can present Congress a retroactive extension of only the middle-class tax cuts, take it or leave it, Mr. Van Hollen said.
Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said, ''Revenues should be part of any plan, and Democrats should not cave on that.''
With just 11 legislative days remaining before the election, once-uncompromising Republicans in Congress do appear to be reassessing their positions.
Earlier this year, House conservatives demanded a cap on domestic spending for the coming fiscal year that would be $19 billion below the level set by last summer's budget deal. Even Senate Republicans balked. On Thursday, the House is expected to pass a measure keeping the government functioning well into next year at the spending level House Republicans found unacceptable in March, $1.047 trillion.
''My conservative friends in the Senate have taken a position that says that a clean $1.047 number is digestible, so for us to not take that position seriously would be for us not to recognize the reality of Washington today,'' said Representative Tim Scott of South Carolina, who leads the Tea Party-infused Republican freshmen.
But some Democrats are getting nervous about the game of chicken in Washington. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the $109 billion in initial automatic spending cuts should be postponed for six months, then cut at least in half.
''I'm of the opinion that cutting haphazardly at a critical time in the economic progress of the nation is absolutely the wrong thing to do,'' she said Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Met Museum Considers Opening On Mondays

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Every Monday streams of would-be visitors climb the grand stairs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art only to discover that it is closed. Now the museum's director is proposing to open the doors on Mondays, starting next July, so that the Met would be open every day for the first time in more than 40 years.
''We turn away thousands of people every Monday,'' said the director, Thomas P. Campbell. ''We're not really serving our audience.'' 
The museum started closing on Mondays in 1971 to save money, and the proposal to reopen is partly driven by financial considerations as well. Mr. Campbell said rising tourism had brought so many new potential visitors that the economic balance might have changed. According to NYC & Company, the city's marketing and tourism organization, tourism to New York City has grown 16.2 percent in the last five years, to nearly 51 million visitors in 2011 from 43.8 million in 2006.
The Met's attendance has been rising too, to a record-breaking 6.3 million visitors in the fiscal year that ended in June, about 600,000 more than the year before. Met officials say they are calculating how many more staff members would be needed to open on Mondays, and at what cost, and how much revenue the increased traffic would bring in admissions charges (the suggested amount is $25), retail sales and restaurant receipts.
''When you start drilling into it, it seems as though we'll be ahead,'' Mr. Campbell said. He said the proposal was being discussed this week at staff and board meetings, and that a decision was expected in the coming months.
The Met has been experimenting with occasional Monday openings for several years, beginning with members-only previews. In 2003 it started opening on holiday Mondays. And for a few blockbuster exhibitions, including ''Manet/Velázquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting'' and ''Leonardo da Vinci, Master Draftsman,'' in 2003; ''El Greco'' in 2003-4 and ''Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty'' in 2011, it has offered visitors a chance to pay $50 each to see the shows on Mondays, without waiting in long lines or fighting crowds.
Mr. Campbell said seven-day-a-week access had become a topic of discussion among museum directors at conferences here and abroad, partly for financial reasons and partly out of a sense of democratic mission. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is open every day, as is the Prado in Madrid, which was closed Mondays until last November.
''That got me thinking, if others are doing it, why aren't we?'' Mr. Campbell said.
American national museums including the National Gallery of Art in Washington are open every day. So are the major London institutions, including the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, Tate Britain and the Wallace Collection. The Museum of Modern Art has been open on Mondays but closed on Tuesdays, except for the past two summers, when it stayed open every day. (This year it has extended that practice beyond the summer, staying open every day through Sept. 25.)
More Met hours could take visitors away from MoMA at a time when the Met is clearly out to raise its profile in the area of Modern and contemporary art in anticipation of temporarily taking over the Whitney Museum of American Art's Breuer building when the Whitney moves to its new home in the meatpacking district in 2015. Mr. Campbell said competition was not a factor in the consideration of Monday openings.
''It's a mission issue,'' he said. ''At the end of the day it's all about accessibility.''

Opening
AINSWORTH PARK Paige Hospitality Group, which owns several sports bars in the city, has taken over the Gramercy Park-area space that was once home to Japonais, an ambitious import from Chicago, then to Kibo, an equally ambitious Japanese restaurant where Joël Robuchon was a consultant. It now becomes a sports bar with 65 television screens: 111 East 18th Street, (212) 673-2467.
BOOMER ESIASON'S STADIUM GRILL In time for football season, the Stadium Grill in Bowlmor Lanes has been rebranded to highlight its famous new partner: 222 West 44th Street, (212) 690-0252. 
EL MITOTE The folks who own Cafe Frida, Cafe Ronda and Rigoletto Pizzeria on the Upper West Side are opening this spot for pressed Mexican sandwiches (tortas) and drinks. Guacamole, salads and desserts will be served, too, in the space that was Rigoletto Pizzeria, which they are reopening at 141 West 72nd Street. (Opens Saturday): 208 Columbus Avenue (69th Street), (212) 874-2929.
FLATIRON ROOM A sophisticated cocktail lounge, this has hundreds of Scotches, bourbons and other spirits, and some classic pub food served on little boards for sharing. There is a stage for entertainment, mostly jazz and other music; weekly whiskey tasting classes are planned for an upstairs room. (Tuesday): 37 West 26th Street, (212) 725-3860.
THE LEADBELLY This is as retro as its sibling, Fat Radish right across the street, is hip and Brit. Oysters, preferably with cocktails, are the name of the game: 14 Orchard Street (Canal Street), (212) 226-3612.
NIU NOODLE HOUSE A Chinese noodle and dumpling parlor done in 1940s style, it opened in late June. But the chef, Lo Lung Kit, had to return to China and did not come back to New York until late August. Now the restaurant is in full swing. The noodles are similar to Japanese ramen, a dish that was actually brought to Japan from China. The restaurant also serves weekly specials, like pork in garlic sauce: 15 Greenwich Avenue (Christopher Street), (212) 488-9888.
RYU SNACK WINDOW A Japanese restaurant that opened in May has added a window on the street for takeout sales of hand rolls; some hefty Asian-inflected sandwiches like teriyaki cheese steak with Brie; pork tonkatsu; and soft drinks and water. It's open Thursday through Saturday, midnight until 4 a.m., and for lunch on Friday and Saturday, noon to 4 p.m.: 46 Gansevoort Street (Greenwich Street), (212) 776-1446.
URBANSPACE MEATPACKING This outdoor market has been created by the group that organizes holiday markets at Union Square and Columbus Circle, and established the Dekalb Market in Downtown Brooklyn. An empty lot in the meatpacking district has been filled with tented stands for about 70 food, fashion and gift vendors, including Roberta's Pizza, Asia Dog, Red Hook Lobster Pound, Little Muenster and Momofuku Milk Bar. It's open rain or shine Monday to Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday until 10 p.m., and Sunday until 8 p.m.: 860 Washington Street (13th Street), (212) 529-9262.
Looking Ahead
CLARKSON Georges Forgeois, the owner of Café Noir, Bar Tabac and several other French bistros, plans to add this American-style spot for small plates and cocktails to his lineup in November: 225 Varick Street (Clarkson Street).
COCINA ECONOMICA David and Vanida Bank will close their tiny Upper West Side restaurant, Recipe, after dinner on Sept. 30 and reopen it a few weeks later as this new place, with home-style Mexican food by Pedro Hernandez Perez, who was the sous-chef at the Banks's Land Thai Kitchen a couple of doors away: 452 Amsterdam Avenue (82nd Street), (212) 501-7755.
MOTORINO Mathieu Palombino plans to reopen his Brooklyn pizzeria, which closed about a year ago, in a new space in January: 139 Broadway (Bedford Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Chefs on the Move
KATIE BUSCH, who has worked with Christopher Lee, formerly of Aureole, is the new chef at Hospoda, the Czech beer hall on the Upper East Side. She also worked at La Degustation, in Prague, the flagship of the company that owns Hospoda, as did Lukas Pohl, the new pastry chef.
POLO DOBKIN, a graduate of the French Culinary Institute, has announced that he is leaving Dressler, the restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he has been the executive chef for seven years. He said his plans were still evolving but were likely to involve opening his own place. His menus at Dressler have been based on local seasonal ingredients, and his cooking has won a Michelin star for the restaurant in each of the last four years. A replacement has not been named.
PINO LUONGO, a partner at Morso, on East 59th Street, is now in the kitchen there. The original executive chef, Tim Ryan, has left.

HEADLINE: Putting Spain Back in Spanish Food

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
IT seems an impossible dream, if not the one that the Man of La Mancha crooned onstage. But here it goes: Over the next decade, dozens of American cooks schooled in the authentic cooking of Spain and trained in Spanish restaurants will begin to populate the United States. In due time, hundreds, then thousands, will serve up a cuisine that is not Mexican, or Caribbean, or Latin American, but one faithful to Spain. Not only will they staff a national roster of credibly Spanish restaurants, but they will go on to create new ones. Ultimately, that will ramp up American demand for the wine and products of Spain.
To that end, the dreamer himself -- not Don Quixote, but José Andrés, the best-known Spanish chef working in America -- was cooking an egg in a culinary-school kitchen. He tipped a heated pan of olive oil and swirled the white as it coalesced around a gleaming yellow yolk. It echoed a classic Diego Velázquez painting from the early 17th century, ''Old Woman Cooking Eggs.'' 
''It is Velázquez, it could not be more Spanish, and it is simple,'' said Mr. Andrés, who has become the dean of Spanish Studies at the International Culinary Center in Manhattan. ''Everyone thinks that Spanish technique is complicated, but it is really about simplicity, and that is exactly what we must teach.''
It was his passion for the cuisine of his homeland that led Mr. Andrés to suggest that the culinary center create a program that immerses future professionals in the cooking and language of Spain.
The course's subagenda, to bring Spanish products more into the American mainstream, has never been more necessary. For even though Spain's reputation for gastro chic continues to swell, thanks to the renown of Ferran Adrià and other chefs of the cocina de vanguardia, as the new Spanish cuisine is called, European austerity measures have brought on a culinary crisis in Spain. The unemployment rate there is 24 percent, the highest in Europe, and some 12,000 restaurants have gone out of business since 2008.
To Mr. Andrés, the new curriculum is nothing less than a show of faith in the future of Spanish cooking. ''It may be thought of as fashionable now,'' he said, ''but it's not some fad. It is here to stay.''
Mr. Andrés, who is 43 and owns 14 restaurants in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington (where he is based, and where he also owns a food truck named Pepe), has long wanted to foster a Spanish cooking school. He approached the culinary center's founder and chief executive, Dorothy Cann Hamilton, whom he has known since the 1990s, during the James Beard Awards in May last year. ''He told me, 'We have to do a Spanish school,' '' Ms. Hamilton recalled, adding that he said, '' 'I'm sorry Italy got to you first.' '' (Once known as the French Culinary Institute for its classical French kitchen instruction, the center added an Italian cooking program five years ago.)
To conceptualize with them, and to create the nuts and bolts of a Spanish curriculum, which was approved by the New York State Education Department in July after a two-month review, Mr. Andrés and Ms. Hamilton turned to Colman Andrews, a founder of Saveur magazine. Mr. Andrews was not only the biographer of Mr. Adrià, but also the author of the Spanish cooking canon ''Catalan Cuisine,'' published in 1988.
Much of the Spanish food in the United States has long been inauthentic, ''a mélange of many cultures -- Mexican, Dominican, Puerto Rican and Portuguese,'' said Mr. Andrews, who is the editorial director of the food Web site The Daily Meal. ''But this curriculum takes Spanish cuisine back to its roots.''
Mr. Andrews said that vast waves of French, Italian and Latin American immigrants over two centuries had given primary attention to their cuisines. Spanish food in the United States was so underrepresented, he said, that many Spanish people in the United States opened Italian restaurants, like Jean León, who in 1956 opened the famed hangout La Scala with the actor James Dean in Beverly Hills, Calif.
And so, in February, an initial class of 24 students will study for 10 weeks at the culinary center. The school expects the Spanish program to cost $5 million to open, including $1 million to develop the curriculum; tuition, as well as an intensive ''kitchen Spanish'' language program, will be $26,500. The first group will tour Spain for a week afterward with Mr. Andrés, sampling regional cuisine.
But Mr. Andrés envisions a six-month program for subsequent classes and is working to create it, so that students will spend a month in Spain experiencing the fare in different regions, then two months as interns in Spanish restaurants (planned tuition, as in the Italian program: some $43,000). As many as five groups could graduate each year, and the program could spread to Washington, Miami and Los Angeles if successful.
Mr. Andrés will swoop in as a guest lecturer, and so will Mr. Andrews, who may teach a separate course as well. The 28-year-old culinary center (whose graduates include Dan Barber, David Chang, Wylie Dufresne and Bobby Flay) has 1,000 annual professional students in its full-time six-month course and another 2,500 ''recreational'' course-takers.
For an afternoon recently, Mr. Andrés inhabited the fourth-floor school kitchen to hold forth on his aesthetic, and his technique, with Candy Argondizza, a culinary-center vice president who will oversee the course teachers. ''Trying to capture José's passion as a teacher -- that will make our program work,'' she said.
As an example of the radical simplicity of Spanish cooking, Mr. Andrés made the egg à la Velázquez, then mentioned that war horse, gazpacho, ''which, if done correctly, is like no other soup in the world,'' he said. ''Hard-core gazpacho is, conceptually, a liquid salad.''
He hopes students will share his urgency to ''nail down the basics of Spanish cooking before it gets too out of hand,'' he said, bemoaning the growing vogue for fusion. ''I love Mexican food and South American food, and I have those restaurants. But you don't want Spanish cuisine to be bastardized.''
Students will be immersed in everything from allioli (the paste made from garlic, olive oil and salt, without the eggs used in the Provençal aioli) to sofritto (long-cooked onions) and romesco (tomato-nut sauce). They will also be schooled in cooking with traditional hot coals and wood fires, as well as techniques like salt--curing, air-drying and sausage-making.
Mr. Andrés also hopes that students will be given a deep understanding of the Spanish products underpinning its cuisine, including pimentón, Ibérico ham, dried seafood, cured tuna belly and the delicacy mojama (tuna packed in sea salt and hung in the sun to dry).
''Students must learn our products from the inside out,'' he said. ''They must be able to read a tomato.'' To that end, Mr. Andrés showed Ms. Argondizza how he counted the rays emanating from the center point of the bottom of the tomato skin to learn where the chambered sections of seeds were underneath. He carefully cut open a large Roma and scooped out the seeds, deconstructing it to create a tomato-and-anchovy dish. ''Seeds are the caviar of the tomato,'' he said, ''the most important part, and yet so often, they go to waste.''
Those taking the course will become versed, too, in classic Spanish cooking tools, including the wide, thin-bottomed cast-iron paella pan, designed to spread heat evenly over a sparse layer of rice; terra cotta cazuelas, pots for making stews, tapas and casseroles; and the plancha, the ubiquitous large multipurpose griddle that is, Mr. Andrés said, ''a powerful tool for minimizing the loss of juices and flavor.''
His vision is multigenerational. ''If eventually we create a pool of thousands of people graduating from the program, this opens the possibility of thousands of new American restaurants putting out more authentic cooking,'' Mr. Andrés said. ''Now is the moment to push for the next level of quality in Spanish cuisine.''
Recipe: Putting Spain Back in Spanish Food; Cooked Egg With Ibérico Ham
4 garlic cloves
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, preferably Spanish
2 large eggs
2 thin slices, or approximately 1 ounce, jamon Ibérico de Bellota
Sea salt, to taste.
1. Split open and peel garlic cloves by pressing down on them with the flat side of a kitchen knife. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium sauté pan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer garlic to a plate and set aside.
2. Increase heat to medium-high and add 3 remaining tablespoons olive oil. Crack 1 egg into a glass. When oil just begins to smoke, tip pan to a steep angle so oil collects on one side, creating a small bath. Carefully slide egg into hot oil and spoon the hot oil over egg 2 or 3 times. The egg will be ready in about 30 seconds. Transfer egg to a serving plate with a slotted spoon and season to taste with salt. Keep warm. Repeat with remaining egg, reserving the cooking oil when done.
3. To serve, place a fried egg on each plate. Tear small pieces of jamon and lay over and around each egg. Garnish with garlic. Sprinkle with sea salt and drizzle reserved cooking oil over each plate.
Yield: 2 servings

Here's how he does it: 1. He begins with a sauté pan in which four tablespoons of olive oil have been brought to medium-high heat. He tips the pan, so that the oil collects in a small bath, and slides the egg into the oil. 2. Next, he spoons hot oil over the egg two or three times. 3. After only 30 seconds of cooking, the egg white forms a protective pillow around the yolk without becoming attached to it. 4. He removes the egg from the pan and gives it a sprinkling of sea salt.

HEADLINE: In Quest for River's Power, An Underwater Test Spin

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Could cars in New York City someday run on electricity generated at the bottom of the East River?
Trey Taylor thinks so, but first he and his associates have to build a better turbine -- specifically, one that can withstand the river's strong and shifting currents. On Tuesday afternoon they moved one step closer to their goal, as a crane hoisted what looked like a giant, hand-held electric fan from the riverbed east of Roosevelt Island.
The turbine -- its three white blades were still turning as they broke the surface -- had been bolted for 10 days to a piling drilled into the bedrock beneath the river. Mr. Taylor's company, Verdant Power, had positioned it there in the latest test of its long-running plan to turn the tides into a source of electricity. 
''This is the perfect testing ground,'' said Dean Corren, the company's director of technology, as he watched two divers descend from a barge on a ladder and attach a sling to the turbine. The current, which runs as fast as 2 meters per second, keeps the blades spinning slowly, except during the lulls when the tide reverses its flow from north to south, or back again.
The turbine, a commercial prototype with a diameter of more than 16 feet, did not generate any electricity during its brief period of submersion. A previous set of turbines in the river powered a Gristede's supermarket and an adjacent parking garage on the island, Mr. Taylor said.
The problem with those machines was that they kept breaking, he said. So, the company commissioned the manufacture of stronger blades, made of layered fiberglass and plastic, and tested them first in a lab in Golden, Colo.
After 10 days in the river, the blades gleamed in the September sunlight, showing no obvious signs of wear or damage. The turbine's pristine appearance brought smiles to the faces of Mr. Corren and his colleagues. Dean Whatmoor, a logistics manager, who had been monitoring the test from a converted cargo container filled with computer screens and gauges, admitted that he was a little sad to see the test end.
The next step will be to start building more turbines and installing them in the river in sets of three, Mr. Taylor said. The rotors are made in Holland, Mich., but the other parts will be made in New York State and assembled in Bayonne, N.J., he said.
In about five years, the company hopes to have 30 turbines arrayed in the river, each capable of producing 35 kilowatts of electricity. All told, the project would produce about as much power as one wind turbine, enough to power a few hundred homes.
Mr. Taylor said he has had discussions with the corporation that operates Roosevelt Island and officials from Cornell University, which plans to build a school of applied sciences on the island, about how the power from the turbines might be used. One idea he has broached, he said, is installing charging stations for electric cars on the island.
''New York City could be the first city with tidal-powered cars,'' he said.
But Verdant Power, which has raised about $33 million from investors, has a potentially more lucrative plan: to sell its technology for use in rivers and even oceans around the world. ''The holy grail is to harness the ocean tides,'' Mr. Corren said.
Simply turning the East River into a viable source of electricity would be a vindication for Mr. Corren, who began researching the idea as a student at New York University in the early 1980s, and wrote his thesis on global warming. The university later eliminated its applied sciences department and gave up on the tidal turbine technology developed there, Mr. Corren said.
On Tuesday, he grinned at the prospect that his work at N.Y.U. three decades ago might yield a renewable source of power for the campus that Cornell is building, which city officials hope will be an engine of New York's economic future. (In April, N.Y.U. announced plans to develop its own applied science campus, in Downtown Brooklyn.)

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: America's Direction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We often hear variations on a common lament: America has lost its way; the country is on the wrong track. These are valid opinions on an urgent topic, but one requiring scrutiny. 
Is the primary measurement economic, cultural, social or some combination? There may be consensus about misdirection, but stark disagreement over causes. Some, for example, praise environmental regulations for protecting people and the planet, while others condemn them for impeding economic growth.
If the country has veered off course, when did it begin? Some say 2008, pointing to the economic crisis or Barack Obama's election; others insist on 2000, with the advent of George W. Bush. We hear that the 1980s marked a dangerous turning point, with the widening gap between rich and poor, and the creeping influence of money in politics. But wait: The 1960s are alternately lauded or blamed for social and cultural innovations.
The 1950s deserve a closer look, a decade when Americans started imagining that economic prosperity was permanent, almost a birthright. Yet the stultifying pressures toward conformity ultimately prompted objections from many quarters.
Another narrative is possible, one accounting for fundamental progress. The great, and I hope continuing, expansion in civil and human rights for workers, women, and racial, sexual and ethnic minorities puts the promise of American life in reach for most of us at last. Returning to the ''good (bad) old days'' would be tragic.
It may not be that America is losing its way, but that other countries, in economic terms, are finding theirs. There is more competition, but also prosperous and thus beneficial trading partners.
Perhaps there are numerous right paths in our interconnected world. For America, perhaps finding the right course is an unending challenge, central to the national experience. We should have the audacity to hope that this is so.

JOHN GREENE worked for 30 years at an Oscar Mayer plant in Madison, Wis., deboning hams and loading boxes of hot dogs. His 401(k) plan grew to $60,000, and soon after retiring he began withdrawing $3,600 a year from it, money that allowed him and his wife to take what he called a wondrous two-week trip to Scotland, his ancestral homeland.
But when the financial markets plunged four years ago, his 401(k) dropped to less than $18,000.
''We lost more than 70 percent,'' he complained, even though a highly recommended investment firm was managing his 401(k). ''They're very risky.'' 
For Mr. Greene, 77, the money he withdrew each year provided him and his wife some breathing room -- and comforts -- on top of the $29,000 they receive annually in Social Security and pension payments.
But though it has rebounded a little, his nest egg has declined so much that he withdraws far less than he used to. The result: ''We can't do trips like Scotland anymore,'' he said.
Like millions of Americans, Mr. Greene has suffered losses from his 401(k) even as such plans have largely supplanted traditional pensions and become the central pillar of America's employer-sponsored retirement system, with 60 million workers participating in them.
Now, although Social Security and Medicare generate far more political heat, a quieter, more nuanced debate of large consequence engulfs 401(k)'s, the voluntary, privately financed plans that some see as a savior of American retirement and others see as an impediment: Should 401(k)'s be fine-tuned and expanded or should they be replaced entirely? And for many looking to retirement after the Great Recession, there is this pressing question: What to do about woefully underfunded 401(k)'s now.
David L. Wray, president of the Profit-Sharing/401(k) Council of America, an association of companies that sponsor retirement plans, said that 401(k)'s -- and the Individual Retirement Account system that many people roll their retirement money into -- worked well, despite some shortcomings. These 401(k) plans now hold $3.3 trillion in assets, seven times the level two decades ago. ''If the goal here is to accumulate money, this system has accumulated more money than any system ever,'' he said. ''It's been an incredibly effective accumulator of assets.''
But many investment experts and economists give the 401(k) system low marks. They note that fewer than half of the nation's private sector workers are in 401(k) plans and that nearly a quarter of businesses with more than 100 employees do not offer 401(k)'s. Moreover, many Americans put only 3 percent of their earnings into 401(k)'s when investment experts often recommend saving 10 or even 12 percent.
The typical worker age 55 to 64 had just $54,000 in a 401(k) in 2010, according to a new report by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, and households with workers in that age group had $120,000 in retirement savings on average, if the money rolled into I.R.A.'s was included. That $120,000 is less than one-fourth the savings recommended by many retirement experts. Moreover, the center calculated, that $120,000 would provide an annuity of a paltry $7,000 a year.
Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at the New School and a leading critic of 401(k)'s, said, ''Every good retirement system needs to have adequate accumulation for individuals, the money needs to be invested appropriately and the payout needs to meet the needs of retirees for life. Unfortunately, 401(k)'s fail in all three categories.''
She criticized giving $80 billion in tax breaks annually to 401(k) participants to nourish a system that does not provide secure retirement savings for all. Moreover, she said, 60 percent of those tax breaks go to the top 10 percent of earners -- people who would probably save even without the tax breaks.
John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group and an esteemed figure in the world of investing, also voiced sharp criticisms. ''We have a 401(k) system that is profoundly flawed even as it has moved to the position of pre-eminence in our retirement system,'' he said. ''There are elements of the 401(k) system that are just unacceptable if you're trying to build a system that accumulates for retirement.''
In his new book, ''The Clash of Cultures: Investment vs. Speculation,'' Mr. Bogle rattled off a list of 401(k) shortcomings, among them excessive Wall Street fees, misguided asset allocation and failure to deal with longevity risk; for instance, someone living to age 92, but emptying a 401(k) by age 82.
Mr. Bogle ridiculed how easy it was, despite withdrawal penalties, to take money out of 401(k)'s -- whether for a down payment on a house, to send children to college or to buy a new rug. Likening 401(k)'s to savings plans, he said making it so easy to withdraw money was the opposite of what retirement plans should do.
Even fierce critics like Mr. Bogle readily give advice on what investors should do to improve their chances for adequate retirement savings. An early champion of index funds, he recommends them for 401(k)'s; they typically have lower annual fees than, and perform as well as, many aggressively managed funds.
Mr. Bogle said many investment funds charged around 2 percent in annual fees, although he noted that some index funds charged one-twentieth of that -- just 0.1 percent a year. He calculated that if one obtained a 5.5 percent annual return when inflation was running at 2.5 percent, then the net return would be 3 percent. With considerable chagrin, he noted that a 2 percent investment fee ''would consume fully 67 percent of that annual return.''
A study by Demos, a liberal research center, found that a median-income couple that invested in 401(k)'s for 40 years with fees averaging 1.6 percent a year would achieve $354,850 in assets at average savings rates, but only after paying $154,794 in investment fees.
Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Boston College center, recommends that people jump at the opportunity to join 401(k) plans as soon as they can. ''The trick is to contribute from Day 1 if your employer has a plan, and leave the money there,'' she said. She voiced concern that 21 percent of workers whose employers offered plans declined to participate and that for those age 20 to 29, 40 percent declined.
Stephen P. Utkus, director of the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research, said most Americans saved far too little. ''Certainly by your 30s, you should be saving 10 percent,'' he said
He said many Americans emptied their 401(k)'s after they were laid off, leaving them with far too little savings for retirement. ''You can't invest your way out of a savings problem,'' Mr. Utkus warned. ''To catch up, you have to save more or maybe work longer. My general advice for people is, save 3 percent more of your income each year and plan to work three more years.''
He advised 401(k) participants to put money in balanced funds, like target-date funds, that decrease the ratio of investments in risky stocks as investors age. But Mr. Bogle warned that target-date funds often charged one percentage point a year more than other funds.
According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, 38 percent of 401(k) participants age 55 to 64 have 80 percent or more of their 401(k) assets in stocks -- even though many experts say it is unwise to invest heavily in stocks so close to retirement age because a large chunk of one's savings could quickly evaporate in a market downturn.
Jack VanDerhei, research director at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, recommends that all Americans, as they age, step back and do a thorough assessment of their retirement savings and retirement plans -- perhaps at age 50. He suggested visiting a financial planner or using a Web site on retirement planning.
''Figure out where you think you need to be at whatever age you think you want to retire,'' Mr. VanDerhei said. ''Then figure out what that's going to translate into in terms of what you're going to need in 401(k) accumulation at that time.''
Mr. VanDerhei stressed that all 401(k) participants should invest at least the amount needed to qualify for the maximum employer match to avoid leaving money on the table. In other words, if an employer is offering a dollar-for-dollar match up to 6 percent of pay, then an employee would be ill-advised to put just 3 percent in a 401(k).
As the debate continues over how well 401(k)'s function, some policy experts have called for scrapping the 401(k) system and replacing it with a more universal, less risky system. One system might, like Social Security, require that some percentage of an employee's paycheck be withheld to finance a new, government-managed retirement plan. But other critics, convinced that Congress would never enact such vast changes, call for enacting incremental steps to improve the system -- for instance, steps to encourage more small businesses to offer 401(k)'s, like allowing them to aggregate their plans to save on administrative costs.
Professor Ghilarducci has won the backing of many labor and liberal groups with her proposal for ''Guaranteed Retirement Accounts,'' which would require that 2.5 percent of each worker's pay be withheld to finance a new retirement plan on top of Social Security. (A $600 refundable tax credit would help soften the hit.)
She also calls for requiring employers to match that amount, a mandate that businesses would surely oppose. Such a system would be managed by the government and subsidized by it and would guarantee a 3 percent annual return. Ms. Ghilarducci said her plan would give Americans nearly 25 percent of their preretirement earnings. In other words, someone who retired after earning $75,000 a year might receive $19,000 a year in Social Security and another $18,000 annually from this new plan.
Ms. Munnell of the Boston College center also supports creating a new tier of retirement savings by requiring new deductions from employee paychecks. But unlike Professor Ghilarducci, she does not support a mandatory employer match and she would preserve the 401(k) system, creating a new system on top of Social Security and 401(k)'s.
''We need a new tier,'' Ms. Munnell said. ''Our retirement system isn't big enough. Not enough people are in it, and many people aren't saving enough. No matter how much you try to spruce up 401(k)'s, they're never going to provide enough retirement income.''
In July, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, proposed a plan that would be financed by pretax funds from workers' paychecks, although workers could opt out. Employers would have to contribute. Mr. Harkin noted that half of all Americans had less than $10,000 in retirement savings and that 75 million workers were without access to a workplace retirement plan. ''We face a retirement crisis,'' he said.
Mr. Wray of the 401(k) council said critics were too quick to condemn the 401(k) system and propose far-reaching changes. He said 401(k)'s had many underappreciated advantages. They generally allow people to pass on far more of their retirement money to their heirs than traditional pensions usually do. Another big advantage of 401(k)'s, Mr. Wray said, is that many corporations are embracing them over traditional pensions because pensions, unlike 401(k)'s, can cause companies to owe millions of dollars in unanticipated liabilities when the stock market falls.
''The great thing about 401(k)'s is the enormous flexibility,'' Mr. Wray said. ''They're voluntary. You can structure a plan that works for you,'' He acknowledged that many people nearing retirement age had not saved enough in their plans, but he said that was because many had saved for only 20 years, not for their entire career.
''If you consistently participate in these programs over 40 years, you're home free,'' he said.
When created in 1978, 401(k)'s were a way for highly paid executives to shield income from taxation. Later Congress adapted them so they could provide supplemental retirement income for millions of workers on top of Social Security and traditional pensions. It was not foreseen that 401(k)'s would evolve into the nation's main employer-sponsored retirement system.
''This system just hasn't produced the type of participation you'd like to see,'' Ms. Munnell said. ''I think this argument that these plans are new is getting old. They're not new.''
David John, a pension expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, dismisses the likelihood of enacting far-reaching changes like those supported by Senator Harkin and Ms. Ghilarducci. Partly because of industry opposition, he said, ''starting something wholly new would be virtually impossible.''
Mr. John argued that it would be wise to keep the 401(k) system, imperfect as it is, and improve it. With some reservations, he praised the automatic enrollment features of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which allows companies that offer plans to automatically enroll new employees,, typically at 3 percent of pay, although workers can opt out.
He also praised the law's automatic escalation provisions, which enable companies to ratchet up employees' contribution rate from 3 percent in an employee's first few years unless workers opted out. He criticized Congress for essentially setting 3 percent of pay as a default investment level. ''The 3 percent level is a huge mistake,'' he said.
He wants Congress to raise the automatic enrollment's default participation rate to 6 percent. That, he said, would hardly reduce enrollment and would create a larger nest egg for retirement.
The battle over whether the 401(k) system needs some fine-tuning or radical surgery is still gathering force. ''A czar would be able to fix this easily,'' Mr. Bogle said. ''Whether politicians can fix this is something else again.''

HEADLINE: A Silver Tinge to the Political Ring

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
HAVING made his fortune in advertising and the television talk show industry, Bob Turner was enjoying a wealth of retirement pursuits -- he played golf and tennis, had a home on the beach and a weekend ski house, five children, 13 grandchildren and a tight circle of longtime friends, and kept a toe in the business world with seats on a few boards.
In 2010, he started yelling at the television as he watched his congressman, Anthony Weiner, in a discussion about health care legislation. Mr. Turner's wife suggested he do something more practical, so he called a friend who happened to be the chairman of the New York State Conservative Party and asked how he could donate money to the Republican running against Mr. Weiner.
There wasn't one. What the party was looking for, said his friend, Michael Long, was a candidate who was current on the issues, ideally a businessman who could carry most of the costs himself. 
Thus ended Bob Turner's retirement. He announced his bid for Mr. Weiner's seat representing parts of Queens and Brooklyn, enlisting the circle of friends as his campaign committee. He lost, with 40 percent of the vote. But when Mr. Weiner resigned less than a year later after sending sexually suggestive pictures of himself over Twitter, Mr. Turner ran again and won, becoming the first Republican to represent the area in nearly 90 years.
If Paul Ryan and his Gen-X colleagues are the Young Guns, Mr. Turner, 71, could be thought of as one of the Old Guns -- retirees who are embracing politics as a second career. Not all are running for office; some are running campaigns and many more are working the precincts and phone banks.
It's hard to come by numbers to describe how many retirees are going into politics. But organizations on the left and the right say that this year's election may be an especially active one for people of retirement age. It is the first presidential contest since the advent of the Tea Party movement, which has been driven largely by voters age 65 and older.
And factors like President Obama's health care overhaul, which survived a Supreme Court challenge this summer, and the vice-presidential candidacy of Mr. Ryan, a leading advocate of changes to programs like Medicare and Social Security, have sharpened the debate on issues especially important to people of retirement age, the fastest-growing age group in the United States.
In interviews, retirees working on this year's campaign commonly say that they consider it the most important election of their lifetime. ''I know it's the old cliché, but it just seems like this one is,'' said Dave Friesner, 68, the president of the Ohio chapter of the Alliance for Retired Americans, largely made up of union voters.
The alliance is hoping it can swing older voters to the Democratic Party by raising concerns about Medicare and Social Security, even though they have been more likely to vote for the Republican presidential nominee since the 1970s. And the Obama campaign is counting on retiree volunteers, particularly in states like Florida, to make the president's case to their peers.
On the other side, groups like the Association of Mature American Citizens and the American Seniors Association have been founded in the last several years by conservatives upset with the leanings of AARP, the granddaddy of retiree organizations.
But many retirees said it was not the presidential race that got them involved -- and they were not always driven by ''retirement issues.'' For them, the driving impulse was a desire to give back, a wish to share expertise honed over a long career, or concern about the world they are passing to their grandchildren.
For many, the new vocation of politics is all-consuming.
Representative Turner, for instance, skied only half a day last winter. He has traded weekdays on the beach for an apartment within walking distance of the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington. ''I take this very seriously; I go to all my committee meetings. I do all my homework,'' he said.
He said he liked his new life so much that he raised his hand to challenge Senator Kirsten Gillibrand this year. He lost the primary and then his Congressional seat to redistricting. But he still sounds wistful about his campaign against Mr. Weiner -- ''a fun competitor,'' he calls him. (''We had Bill Clinton making robocalls against me and Chelsea handing out palm cards in Forest Hills!'') And even if he won't hold elected office come January, Mr. Turner has no intention of retiring from politics.
''I won't be able to help it,'' he said. He plans to campaign for Mitt Romney and wants to help rebuild the Republican Party organization in his native Queens. ''I can still be part of the fight, even if not quite as active as I thought.''
You might expect new retirees to be old hands at political activism; the wave of people hitting 65 now were college students during the political upheavals of the 1960s. But many older retirees say they were not involved in politics before.
Claire Tiernan, a 78-year-old retired nursing administrator, has always considered herself a political junkie; when the nuns at school asked her who should be canonized, she said Franklin D. Roosevelt: ''Because my mother and my aunt said he was a saint.''
But she was busy with her career and raising five children. When she retired, she became a member of the Democratic Town Committee in Essex, Conn., where she lives. Someone asked her to be the second-in-command to help a local selectman running for the General Assembly, and when he won, someone else asked her help for a Congressional candidate, who also won.
''I'm very willing to do whatever work I'm assigned -- that's the generation I grew up in -- and I began to realize that politicians love people who will go door to door and get on the phone for them,'' Ms. Tiernan said.
She knocked on doors for President Obama in New Hampshire in 2008. On Primary Day in Connecticut last month, she began working the polls at 5:30 a.m., then, when polls closed at 8 p.m., went upstairs at the town hall for a meeting of the Inland Wetlands Commission, where she is the representative from the town planning commission. Last year, the state Democratic committee awarded her an Ella Grasso Women's Leadership Award, named for the first woman elected governor of Connecticut.
''I feel that as a member of my generation, I'm responsible for a lot of the problems because of the decisions that were made,'' Ms. Tiernan said, citing Ronald Reagan's ''trickle down economics'' and environmental degradation. ''You just feel like if you have the time, the ability, you should do what you can. You should have the life career, as well.''
One of the candidates Ms. Tiernan is campaigning for this year is also a retiree. Jim Crawford, running for the State Senate, taught United States history for 37 years in Westbrook, Conn., where he grew up. After serving on some local commissions, he decided to run for selectman and then the Assembly after the incumbent, a former student of his, stepped down. (The Republican running against him now for State Senate is also a former student.)
''I felt I was putting into practice all those things that I've been teaching the kids over the years: service, commitment, giving back, being involved,'' Mr. Crawford said. As a former teacher, he was also concerned about what he felt was a lack of understanding about education.
Mr. Crawford is 62; his opponent in the Democratic primary was 77.
It is almost impossible not to run into retirees at Tea Party rallies or meetings. One common Tea Party strategy has been to challenge local Republican committee members in an attempt to steer the party in a more conservative direction; retirees say they have the time to devote to campaigning for these low-level offices and then the running of the party.
Wanda and Mike Shepherd, both 68, were among the first of the movement's activists.
They were at home in Carmel, Ind., watching CNBC in February 2009 when the commentator Rick Santelli began a rant against government bailouts that has been credited with inspiring the Tea Party movement. As Mr. Shepherd recalls the moment, his wife, a retired bank branch manager, jumped out of her chair and said, ''I can't stand it anymore! We've got to do something.''
''There's just way too much spending,'' she said in an interview. ''That bothers me more than anything. If Mike and I can't afford something, we don't buy it.'' They attended a rally at the Indiana Statehouse on tax day that year, which attracted, by their count, at least 800 people.
''We were never activists in college,'' said Mr. Shepherd, who retired from General Motors, where he worked in purchasing and material control. ''We've been sedate and on the sidelines all of our lives, so all of a sudden we got talking to people at the rally and found them like-minded.''
They now have a core group of about 40 people who march in parades and attend local Republican Party meetings, deliver signs to people who want to support Republican candidates, organize fund-raisers and go door to door. They campaigned in the United States Senate primary for Richard Mourdock, who successfully challenged the longtime Republican incumbent, Richard Lugar, and are presiding over Mr. Mourdock's campaign in Hamilton County.
Mr. Shepherd used to work on a 1951 Ford that he had restored, driving it in parades and taking it to cruise club events. Now, the car is idle; he and his wife say that they are out every night working on political activities. In August, they spent two days working a booth at the Indiana State Fair. A few nights later, they were at a meeting of the local Young Republicans club, where they were getting training in how to use hand-held devices to screen voters when they go door to door, so that those they approach are voters most open to a Republican pitch. (They go frequently to Young Republicans meetings to mine for young volunteers -- ''Their stamina is a little bit more,'' said Wanda.)
It is now common for critics to note what they see as a contradiction in the budget-cutting advocacy of Tea Party retirees: support for cuts to programs like Social Security and Medicare that are popular even among Tea Party supporters themselves.
The Shepherds, like others, argue that they have paid into the system and therefore deserve its benefits, but that the system has to change for future retirees.
This is the kind of thinking that keeps Scott Watts, 76, making phone calls and sending out candidate surveys as the head of the Nevada chapter of the union-oriented Alliance for Retired Americans.
''We have seniors voting against themselves,'' he said. ''It's ignorance, sheer ignorance.''
The contrast between Mr. Watts and the Shepherds is proof that in politics there is room for black and white amid shades of gray.

HEADLINE: Equity Firms Like Bain Are Depicted As Colluding

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and PETER LATTMAN; Peter Lattman reported from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In court documents that lawyers for Bain Capital sought to keep secret, the company and other leading private equity firms are depicted as unofficial partners in a bid-rigging conspiracy aimed at holding down the prices of businesses they were seeking to buy.
In Bain's biggest acquisition, the $32.1 billion purchase of the hospital giant HCA in 2006, competitors agreed privately to ''stand down'' and not bid on the company as part of an understanding with Bain to divvy up companies targeted for leveraged buyouts, according to internal e-mails.
The documents have become part of a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Boston brought against Bain and other firms by shareholders who say the firms' bid-rigging artificially deflated the sales price of more than two dozen companies and cost them billions of dollars.
Bain, founded by the Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, is a defendant in the lawsuit, which also names Goldman Sachs's private equity arm and the Blackstone Group, the firm run by the investor Stephen A. Schwarzman. 
The New York Times brought a motion last month to make public the most recent allegations in the case, which were filed under court seal. In response, lawyers for Bain and the other defendants filed a heavily blacked-out version of a 217-page complaint that details evidence compiled to date in the case.
The corporate takeovers at issue in the lawsuit include the acquisition of prominent companies like Neiman Marcus, Toys ''R'' Us, Michaels Stores, Univision and the Loews and AMC movie chains, and they date from 2003 to 2007. The class-action shareholders' lawsuit, which was first filed in 2007, has grown since then after a series of court rulings.
Mr. Romney is not mentioned in the publicly released portion of the documents, and lawyers for Bain said in opposing The Times's motion to unseal the entire filing that he ''could not have been involved in the deals at issue here'' because he had already left Bain by the time the first deal was finalized.
Lawyers for Bain and the other equity firms said in their court filing opposing The Times's motion that the documents include confidential company information that would inevitably become ''washed into the spin of the campaign news cycle'' because of Mr. Romney's presidential run.
''This case has nothing to do with Mitt Romney or the presidential election,'' the lawyers wrote in arguing to keep some of the records private. ''The election should not serve as an excuse to allow the press to get at confidential documents and upend competitive sensitivities.''
Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said on Tuesday that the accusations regarding the takeovers are ''not related'' to Mr. Romney. ''All of these things are long after he left Bain,'' she said.
Mr. Romney and his advisers say that he has played no ''active role'' in the company since 1999, when he took a leave from the firm to run the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
But he did not complete a retirement deal with Bain until 2001, and his name appeared on dozens of corporate documents in that time period. Moreover, he has continued to receive profits from the firm as a retired partner and has maintained holdings in some of its investment funds.
Bain Capital has become a central focus of the campaign for both Mr. Romney and President Obama. Mr. Romney has frequently cited his success at the firm in presenting himself as a proven businessman who can turn around the lagging economy. But Mr. Obama has attacked Bain for its takeovers of companies that then laid off workers, sent jobs overseas or declared bankruptcy after they were acquired.
Documents filed in the lawsuit this week show that many of Bain's takeovers last decade did exceedingly well for the company -- a result, the lawsuit charges, of buying the businesses at deflated prices because of collusion with other equity firms. Plaintiffs in the case are former shareholders of the acquired companies.
The case centers on the ''club deals'' that became popular during the leveraged buyout boom of 2003 to 2007, a period that the complaint calls the ''Conspiratorial Era.'' It claims there was a complex web of collusive arrangements involving 11 of the world's largest buyout firms on 19 deals.
In the buyout of HCA, for instance, Bain, K.K.R. and Merrill Lynch bought the company in 2006 for $32.1 billion, then a record. Documents produced by the defendants and filed this week showed e-mails and meetings indicating that other equity firms had agreed to ''stand down'' and avoid bidding with the understanding that they would be brought into future deals.
E-mails cited in the lawsuit indicate that another private equity firm, TPG, said it had discussed the HCA acquisition with executives for Bain and K.K.R. and had decided not to bid on the company because ''our relationship with them, K.K.R. and Bain, was more important.''
In another deal, according to the plaintiffs, K.K.R. and Silver Lake Partners brought Bain into its $9.4 billion acquisition of Philips's semiconductor unit, despite Philips's insistence that Bain bid separately for the business.
''Disregarding Phillips' demand that they remain competitors, Bain and K.K.R. and Silver Lake continued to collude and before final bids were to be submitted,'' said the lawsuit, ''cemented a secret deal whereby Bain would permit K.K.R. and Silver Lake to submit the winning bid and then invite Bain into its deal on equal terms.''
The plaintiffs also claim that the Blackstone Group, for instance, declined to compete against TPG and Apollo Global Management in the sale of Harrah's Entertainment and instead made a small co-investment in the deal, according to the suit.
''Blackstone's quid pro quo relationships with TPG and Apollo prevented it from submitting a competing bid,'' the complaint said.
''I think you can tell, even though there are substantial redactions, there is enough to show that there was very active collusion going on between the leading private equity firms, including Bain,'' said K. Craig Wildfang, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
Lawyers representing the private equity firms have rejected the allegations. In an earlier filing in the case, they said that the lawsuit merely described routine dealmaking tactics and labels them anticompetitive.
And while the firms' lawyers acknowledge there are some embarrassing e-mails still under seal, they say their clients want to keep the court filings private mostly to avoid disclosing confidential competitive information. Private equity executives also deny that they colluded to drive down the prices of their acquisitions, saying that companies were bought at record high premiums during the buyout boom.
''These shareholders should be grateful that we purchased their companies when we did, right before the financial crisis hit,'' said a senior buyout executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the litigation.

HEADLINE: Economic Stimulus as the Election Nears? It's Been Done Before

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In September 1992, the Federal Reserve culminated a long-running effort to stimulate the sluggish economy by cutting its benchmark interest rate to 3 percent, the lowest level it had reached in almost three decades.
The cut was avidly sought by the administration of President George H. W. Bush, but it was not enough to change the course of the presidential election. Years later, Mr. Bush told an interviewer that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, had cost him a second term by failing to act more quickly and more forcefully.
''I reappointed him and he disappointed me,'' Mr. Bush said.
On Thursday, the Federal Reserve is poised to announce that it will once again seek to stimulate the economy in the middle of a presidential election season. 
Fed officials insist that they do not consider politics in setting policy. But the imminence of the election makes it inevitable that the decisions reached by the Fed's policy-making committee will be judged through a political lens.
Republicans have warned the Fed against taking action, and are seeking to impose new limits on its management of monetary policy. Some Democrats now echo Mr. Bush's lament that new actions are too little, too late.
Experts say Fed officials are sensitive to the danger of a political reaction. But Randall S. Kroszner, a Fed governor from 2006 to 2009, said the Fed's current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has concluded that the best defense of the Fed's independence is to demonstrate its value by reaching decisions on the economic merits, then offering clear explanations to politicians and the public. ''Any decision the Fed will make will make someone unhappy, but what you want out of an independent agency is a careful deliberative process,'' said Mr. Kroszner, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
''Providing as much substantive economic explanation as possible for the actions that the Fed is taking, that's the best way to maintain the Fed's independence,'' he added.
Mr. Bernanke and other officials have argued in recent weeks that the economy needs help, and that the Fed still has the means to stimulate growth. Officials also are concerned about the combination of federal tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect next year.
In a reminder of the government's fiscal problems, Moody's Investors Service reiterated Tuesday that it could downgrade federal debt if Congress did not reach a debt reduction deal. Interest rates on federal debt remain near record lows despite a downgrade last year by Standard & Poor's, but a second downgrade could force some investors to reduce their holdings of Treasury securities.
Mr. Bernanke outlined the actions that the Fed was most likely to take in a speech last month at a conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo. The central bank could announce a new round of asset purchases, expanding its balance sheet for the third time since 2008. It also could announce its intent to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero beyond late 2014. Both are methods of reducing long-term interest rates, and encourage borrowing and riskier investments.
While some analysts have argued that the Fed is less likely to act in an election year, history offers evidence to the contrary.
The Fed has announced policy changes in September or October during 10 of the last 15 presidential election years, dating back to 1952. During the last presidential election, the Fed slashed interest rates repeatedly as it responded to the financial crisis. In 2004, the Fed raised rates in June, August and September.
''There is plenty of precedent for Fed action ahead of a presidential election,'' Credit Suisse said in a research note reviewing that history.
The decisions have always been subject to political pressure. The central bank's independence was never intended to be complete. The Fed's governors are appointed by the president. Its chairman has lunch regularly with the Treasury secretary and meets occasionally with the president. Congress dictates the Fed's mission and requires it to report regularly on its actions.
The Fed, then-chairman William McChesney Martin Jr. told Congress in 1957, ''should be independent -- not independent of government, but independent within the structure of government.'' That meant, he said, having the freedom necessary to decide how best to meet the goals of national economic policy.
It has won that much autonomy only gradually. When Arthur Burns became Fed chairman in January 1970, President Richard Nixon said at the swearing-in ceremony, ''I respect his independence. However, I hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.''
He was not joking. Two years later, Mr. Nixon pressured Mr. Burns to help the economy by printing vast amounts of money, contributing to an era of crippling inflation.
Beginning in the 1980s, Paul A. Volcker and his successor, Mr. Greenspan, successfully established the benefits of independent monetary policy in reducing the rate of inflation, giving the Fed more leverage to resist White House pressure.
During that same period, presidents and their advisers gradually stopped talking in public about monetary policy, concluding that it was counterproductive because the Fed was then forced to respond by demonstrating its independence.
The victory remained partial. When Leon Panetta, then White House chief of staff, said publicly in 1995 that the Fed should cooperate with efforts to revive the economy, his comments were quickly disavowed. But the Clinton administration privately pushed Mr. Greenspan to stimulate growth ahead of the 1996 election and rewarded those efforts by nominating Mr. Greenspan for a new term.
The current White House says that it does not comment on monetary policy. Mr. Bernanke met only three times with President Obama last year, and most recently met with the president at the end of May, although he continues to meet regularly with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Even Congressional Democrats have generally avoided public calls for the central bank to take new action.
Republicans have been openly critical. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party's presidential nominee, has pledged to replace Mr. Bernanke. But in recent weeks Mr. Romney also has seemed to take a more measured tone in his remarks. He told Fox News last week that he doubted the benefits of any new Fed policies.
''I don't think there's any action that they are going to take that will have an immediate impact on the economy,'' Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Bernanke has simply repeated the Fed's long-standing mantra that it does not listen to politicians nor think about politics.
''Our job is to do the right thing for the economy irrespective of politics,'' Mr. Bernanke said earlier this year. ''We're not paying any attention to election calendars or political debates. We're looking at the economy.''

HEADLINE: Israeli Leader Stiffens Call For U.S. to Set Iran Trigger

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ISABEL KERSHNER; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem. Elisabeth Bumiller and Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel inserted himself into the most contentious foreign policy issue of the American presidential campaign on Tuesday, criticizing the Obama administration for refusing to set clear ''red lines'' on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. As a result, he said, the administration has no ''moral right'' to restrain Israel from taking military action of its own.
Mr. Netanyahu's unusually harsh public comments about Israel's most important ally, which closely track what he has reportedly said in vivid terms to American officials visiting Jerusalem, laid bare the tension between him and President Obama over how to handle Iran. They also suggested that he is willing to use the pressure of the presidential election to try to force Mr. Obama to commit to attack Iran under certain conditions.
He appeared to be responding to a weekend statement by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that the United States was ''not setting deadlines'' beyond which it would turn to a military solution. 
Mr. Netanyahu, speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem, said, ''Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before Israel.''
In another sign of tensions, the Israeli Embassy in Washington said late Tuesday that the Obama administration had declined a request from Mr. Netanyahu's office for a meeting with Mr. Obama when the Israeli leader attends the United Nations General Assembly this month. The Obama administration said the decision was due to a scheduling problem and had been conveyed to Israel long ago.
On Tuesday night, Mr. Obama called Mr. Netanyahu to try to calm the situation. The two talked for a full hour, hashing through the Iran confrontation and their misunderstandings.
''President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed that they are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and agreed to continue their close consultations going forward,'' the White House said in a statement after the phone call.
The White House also tried to tamp down controversy over the request for a meeting, saying that after a possible New York encounter was ruled out, Mr. Netanyahu did not request a meeting in Washington. ''Contrary to reports in the press, there was never a request for Prime Minister Netanyahu to meet with President Obama in Washington, nor was a request for a meeting ever denied,'' the statement said.
The United States says it has no evidence that Iranian leaders have made a final decision to build a bomb. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency's latest report says the country has amassed a stockpile of low- and medium-enriched uranium that, with further enrichment, could fuel as many as six nuclear weapons.
The United States concluded several years ago that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons development program at the end of 2003, though there has been evidence of sporadic work since. The Israelis say Iran is quietly reconstituting a much larger effort.
In demanding that Mr. Obama effectively issue an ultimatum to Iran, Mr. Netanyahu appeared to be making maximum use of his political leverage at a time when Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has sought to make an issue of what Mr. Romney says is the administration's lack of support for Israel.
It is not clear what level of development in Iran's nuclear program would constitute a ''red line'' in Israeli eyes. Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a research institute, and a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview last week, ''It is very important to draw a line about the quantities of enriched uranium and the levels of enrichment.''
One option that has been widely discussed among experts advising the United States government is capping Iran's uranium enrichment at a reactor-grade level. Also, Iran would be permitted to stockpile no more than 1,764 pounds of that uranium, less than is required, if further enriched, to make a single bomb.
Mr. Netanyahu, who is highly attuned to American politics, seemed to be using his comments to pressure Mr. Obama to specify at which point the United States would be prepared to take military action against Iran, perhaps at the United Nations General Assembly opening this month.
The Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael B. Oren, echoed Mr. Netanyahu in an interview in Washington on Monday night and said the Israeli leadership wanted Mr. Obama and the leaders of other nations to agree on clear limits for Iran.
''We know that the Iranians see red,'' Mr. Oren said. ''We know they can discern the color red. We know that the redder the line, the lesser the chance that they will pass it.''
Mrs. Clinton publicly rejected that approach over the weekend. In an interview with Bloomberg Radio, she avoided discussion of Iran's stockpile and said, ''We're not setting deadlines'' for military action. It was that statement that appeared to have set off Mr. Netanyahu.
Mr. Obama has repeatedly argued -- with the support of some leading Israeli officials -- that the United States and Israel have closer security cooperation now than at any other point in history. The United States provided much of the Iron Dome missile defense system for Israel, and for the past five years the two countries worked closely on a major covert operation against Iran called ''Olympic Games,'' an effort to sabotage Iran's enrichment capability with cyberattacks.
But Mr. Obama has stopped well short of saying he would prevent Iran from developing the capability to produce a bomb. He has said only that he would not allow Iran to obtain a weapon; Mr. Netanyahu has said that is not enough.
Depending on how one defines the term, Mr. Obama's aides and former aides acknowledge that Iran may already have that capability. It possesses the fuel and the knowledge to make a weapon, but that would take months or years, and Mr. Obama has argued that allows ''time and space'' for a negotiated solution.
Mr. Romney had no immediate comment about Mr. Netanyahu's challenge to Mr. Obama, and one of his informal advisers on the Middle East said, ''It's probably better at this point to let Netanyahu make the point because it's more powerful that way.'' The adviser said he was not authorized to speak on the record.
But the Netanyahu comments play right to the Republican nominee's critique of Mr. Obama. On ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday, Mr. Romney declared that the progress of Iran's nuclear program was Mr. Obama's ''greatest failure'' in foreign policy.
''The president hasn't drawn us any further away from a nuclear Iran,'' he said.
There is little doubt that the Iranian effort has progressed. When Mr. Obama took office, Iran had produced enough fuel to make, if enriched further, about one bomb, compared with five or six in the International Atomic Energy Agency's current calculation.
But Mr. Romney's proposals have also steered clear of describing with any precision how far Iran could go before he would use force to stop its program. Like Mr. Obama, he has not said how much progress he would allow Iran to make toward a weapons capability before he authorized a strike.
Instead, he has insisted that Mr. Obama was late to the task of placing ''crippling sanctions'' on Iran. Yet those sanctions have begun to strike at the heart of Iran's greatest source of national revenue -- oil sales -- something that the Bush administration shied away from.
Mr. Netanyahu has been dismissive of sanctions. They are an indirect form of pressure, he has argued, and have not forced Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to scale back the country's nuclear program.
In recent days, the Israelis had appeared to be dialing down the pressure on Washington, with the Israeli news media reporting that Ehud Barak, the defense minister, was rethinking the wisdom of an attack in the coming months. There was speculation that Israeli officials feared that the long-term jeopardy to Israel's relationship with Washington was not worth the short-term gain of setting back, but probably not destroying, Iran's capability.
A number of American officials, in trips to Israel, have argued that an Israeli attack would only drive the nuclear program underground and most likely result in the expulsion of international inspectors, who are the best gauge of the program's progress.
But Mr. Netanyahu revived the tough talk of the past few months and the message that time is running out for Israel.
''So far, we can say with certainty that diplomacy and sanctions haven't worked. The sanctions have hurt the Iranian economy, but they haven't stopped the Iranian nuclear program,'' Mr. Netanyahu said, adding, ''The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear bombs.''

HEADLINE: Putin Impedes European Inquiry of State Fuel Supplier

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia issued a decree on Tuesday that had the effect of prohibiting Gazprom, the state natural gas giant, from cooperating with European Union investigators trying to build an antitrust case against it.
The decree prevents strategically important companies that do business overseas -- a category that includes Gazprom -- from providing information to foreign regulators without approval from the Kremlin. The decree says it applies to regulators from ''unions of foreign states.'' 
The decree did not refer to Gazprom by name or the announcement last week that the European Union had opened a formal investigation into the company's pricing and sales policies.
But it raises the stakes in what could become one of Europe's highest-profile antitrust cases in years, on a level with the actions that forced American technology companies like Microsoft to change their ways.
Gazprom is in many ways more than just an important company to Russia. It is the country's largest taxpayer and its largest business concern, whose earnings, though down during the recession, constitute about 10 percent of Russia's yearly economic activity.
Its natural gas pipeline network extends from fields in the Arctic off Siberia deep into Europe, providing fuel to heat homes and power factories as far away as Italy and France.
These pipe tentacles are also pivotally important to the Russian government's foreign policy in other former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe, where selective pricing of natural gas is used to tilt politics in Russia's favor.
The biggest threat to Russia is that if Gazprom is found to have violated Europe's antimonopoly laws, it will have to open its pipelines to competitors and alter its oil-linked pricing formula in European Union countries. Sergei Kupriyanov, a spokesman for Gazprom, said on Tuesday that the European Union was using regulations to interfere with the energy market.
It ''can be viewed as pressure from the European Union on Gazprom, with the goal of influencing prices and the results of commercial contracts, which clearly contradict the principles of a market,'' Mr. Kupriyanov said at a news conference in Moscow.
Mr. Putin's decree was Russia's first response to the European Union's announcement that it had formally opened an antitrust case, showing that positions were hardening on both sides.
In 2006 and 2009, Russia shut off fuel to Ukraine during disputes over pricing. In theory, Russia holds the power to cut off the heat in European homes and idle factories this winter if a deal is not reached, though Russia would suffer greatly from lost revenue. Russia provides about a quarter of the European Union's natural gas.
Gazprom is a legal monopoly inside Russia, a fact not disputed by the company. By law, it is the only entity authorized to export gas. It has argued that the utilities in Europe that are its major customers can choose from suppliers in Norway or North Africa, or can use liquefied natural gas transported by ship.
Mr. Putin is known to prefer to take part in energy talks personally. In the disputes with Ukraine, he haggled directly and traded lower gas prices for access to a naval base.
The decree on Tuesday makes Mr. Putin's involvement inevitable. It prohibits strategic companies from selling foreign assets or renegotiating contracts without Kremlin approval. No approval will be granted if the changes ''damage the economic interests of the Russian Federation.''
That will end Gazprom's policy of quietly offering discounts to favored customers in Europe. With many economies on the Continent fragile, any moratorium on negotiating price discounts from Russia will be unwelcome.
Just this past weekend, Mr. Putin had seemed to take a more conciliatory stance. He suggested during a summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that Europe's dispute with Gazprom should not be allowed to devolve into a trade war. A solution will be found, he said.
But at the news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Kupriyanov, the Gazprom spokesman, took a harder line. The European Union's investigation is encouraging Gazprom to look to Asia for new markets, he said, and the company's board could decide to speed up a decision to develop gas fields in eastern Siberia.

HEADLINE: Study of U.S. Health Care System Finds Both Waste and Opportunity to Improve

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The American medical system squanders 30 cents of every dollar spent on health care, according to new calculations by the respected Institute of Medicine. But in all that waste and misuse, policy experts and economists see a significant opportunity -- a way to curb runaway health spending, to improve medical outcomes and even to put the economy on sounder footing.
''Everybody from Paul Krugman to Paul Ryan agrees it is essential to restrain costs,'' said Dr. Mark D. Smith, the president of the California HealthCare Foundation and the chairman of the committee that wrote the report, referring to the liberal economist and Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, and the conservative Wisconsin congressman who is Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate. ''The health care industry agrees, too.'' 
The Institute of Medicine report -- its research led by 18 best-of-class clinicians, policy experts and business leaders -- details how the American medical system wastes an estimated $750 billion a year while failing to deliver reliable, top-notch care. That is roughly equivalent to the annual cost of health coverage for 150 million workers, or the budget of the Defense Department, or the 2008 bank bailout.
The institute's analysis of 2009 data shows $210 billion spent on unnecessary services, like repeated tests, and $130 billion spent on inefficiently delivered services, like a scan performed in a hospital rather than an outpatient center.
It also shows the health care system wasting $75 billion a year on fraud, $55 billion on missed prevention opportunities and a whopping $190 billion on paperwork and unnecessary administrative costs. The Institute of Medicine is an independent adviser to the government and the public, and part of the National Academy of Sciences.
The report depicts a system that saves lives in miraculous fashion, but is also expensive and outmoded and in some cases downright Kafkaesque.
''If banking were like health care, automated teller machine transactions would take not seconds but perhaps days or longer as a result of unavailable or misplaced records,'' the report said. ''If home building were like health care, carpenters, electricians and plumbers each would work with different blueprints, with very little coordination.''
Along with the squandered money there is a human toll, the report said, as medical errors and inefficiencies mean that doctors fail to deliver the best and most timely care to patients.
''If the care in every state were of the quality delivered by the highest-performing state, an estimated 75,000 fewer deaths would have occurred across the country in 2005,'' the report said.
But the report -- and independent health care experts and economists analyzing it -- identified an opportunity in that $750 billion of wasted health spending. If hospitals, doctors and insurers could wring even a fraction of that money out, it would help to bend the so-called cost curve of runaway health inflation while improving patient outcomes.
The point of the report is that ''Americans should expect to get and should demand to get better value for their health care dollar,'' Dr. Smith said.
''That money is not only not buying anything,'' said David Cutler, the Harvard health economist. ''It is actually a sign of poor care. A lot of cost reductions, if we do them the right way, would mean improved health, not worse health.''
Professor Cutler gave as an example rules to make sure that doctors do not perform inductions for otherwise healthy pregnant women before 39 weeks of gestation. It would both save money and improve health outcomes by reducing the rate of Caesarean sections, he said.
The report gives recommendations intended to reduce spending and improve care: ensuring doctors work in teams and share information; making prices and costs transparent to consumers; rewarding doctors for outcomes, not procedures; ensuring all doctors use the best-tested practices, and identifying and correcting errors among them.
The report also detailed instances of health care providers offering such smarter care: hospitals preventing re-hospitalizations, upgrading their records systems and cutting out ineffective therapies, for example.
Some health economists and policy experts believe that political changes and financial pressure have already spurred insurers and health care providers to start squeezing out costs, contributing to the slowdown in health spending growth seen in the past few years.
''We're starting to see some very early results,'' said Wendy Everett, the president of NEHI, a health care research group based in Cambridge, Mass.
She said she expected to see more and more adoption of best practices in the next few years, spurred by President Obama's Affordable Care Act, other changes to Medicare and Medicaid and a recognition among doctors and insurers that the current trajectory of health care spending is unsustainable.
''This train's coming much faster than we thought,'' Ms. Everett said. She guessed that within a decade providers being paid for the quality, not quantity, of care would be ''the norm.''

While the majority of references to Mr. Bush were related to the war in Iraq and the economic collapse during his final months in office, Mr. Bush's work on AIDS relief in Africa and on disaster relief were praised by former President Bill Clinton. The war in Iraq and the economy were not the ''only allusions'' to Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Taxes Show One Way To Save Fuel

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Just the other day, President Obama unveiled another example of how our hostility to anything that even remotely looks like a tax is leading us down the wrong path, ultimately making us worse off.
The president proudly announced energy-efficiency standards negotiated with the nation's carmakers, which will have to nearly double the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks sold, hitting 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025.
''It'll strengthen our nation's energy security, it's good for middle class families and it will help create an economy built to last,'' he said in an official statement.
The rules are a significant step in the battle against global warming. The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which developed the standards, said they will reduce our energy use by 12 billion barrels of oil and cut carbon emissions spewed by our cars, pickups and sport utility vehicles in half by 2025. They should also cut down on other forms of pollution, helping with problems like asthma and acid rain. 
What the government didn't mention is that these improvements come at a high cost for drivers, automakers and society in general. They could be achieved much more cheaply by raising taxes on gasoline to a level comparable to that of pretty much every other industrialized nation.
The new mileage rules are so expensive, in fact, that even if one factors in all the expected gains from the policy -- like less damage from climate change and fewer deaths from respiratory disease -- many economists think that the costs actually outweigh the benefits.
The reason is fairly straightforward. Fuel-efficiency standards do not really change drivers' behavior in a helpful way. Gas taxes do.
Consider how a gas tax would work. Because it would make gas more expensive at the pump, we would drive less. When time came to replace the old family S.U.V., we would be more likely to consider a more fuel-efficient option. As more Americans sought gas-sipping hybrids, carmakers would develop more efficient vehicles.
This is not theory. We've seen it happen. In 2008, when the price of gas shot abruptly past $4 a gallon, Americans cut back sharply on their driving. Total miles driven on American highways declined for the first time since 1980 and gas use fell more than 4 percent. General Motors ditched the Hummer, and gas-guzzling pickups were briefly dislodged from the perch they had occupied since 1992 as the nation's most popular light vehicle.
Driving levels started creeping back up as soon as gas prices started receding, but a gas tax would be permanent and would lead to even bigger changes in habits. And the cost is lower than it seems. Economists point out that the energy savings would not change if the government returned all the revenue raised by a gas tax to Americans -- perhaps through rebates for low-income people who spend a bigger share of their money on gas.
The weakness with the fuel-economy rules is that they don't affect people's behavior the way higher gas prices do. They apply only to new vehicles -- not the ones on the road now -- so it takes quite a long time to alter our overall gas use. And they carry perverse incentives: because new vehicles go farther on a gallon of gas, they give us a reason to drive more, leading to more congestion, accidents, pollution and gas consumption.
The incentives to carmakers can also be weird. The original standards for fuel economy in the 1970s exempted light trucks, which were a small share of the market. That decision was critical to the explosive growth of the S.U.V. In 1973, light trucks amounted to 3 percent of new vehicle sales. Today they account for half.
Who knows what distortions the new rules will bring? The standards vary according to the footprint of the car -- the length between the axles multiplied by the width. So maybe cars will be boxier in the future.
Automakers will make the most efficient cars they can that customers will buy. A gas tax that goads drivers to choose gas-sippers takes advantage of this fact. A mileage standard does not.
Christopher Knittel, an energy economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, estimated that if carmakers had devoted all their technological progress since 1980 to improving fuel efficiency, gas mileage would have improved 60 percent by 2006. Instead, they put most of their effort into more power and weight, and fuel economy gained less than 12 percent.
All this makes mileage standards an expensive way to restrain our energy use.
According to the government's analysis, the additional production and maintenance costs made necessary by the mileage rules will rise gradually to about $31.7 billion in 2025 -- which will add about $1,900 to the average price of cars and light trucks. There are other costs, too. Some Americans will not be able to afford a new car. Profits of some automakers and dealers are likely to decline. Greater congestion will impose an added burden on health.
According to economists crunching the numbers, this makes mileage standards somewhere between 2.4 and 13 times more expensive than a gasoline tax as a tool to reduce our use of fuel. Indeed, by some calculations, raising fuel-economy standards is more costly than climate change itself.
The government has to predict how much climate change will cost us in the future -- through lost agricultural productivity, poorer health, bigger hurricanes and the like -- to figure out how much we should spend today. It does so through a measure called the ''social cost of carbon,'' which captures the added damage that will be caused by adding one more ton of CO2 into the air.
The government's estimate of the cost to our society covers a wide range of $5 to $68 a ton and increases over time. Several economists have concluded that cutting carbon emissions via fuel-efficiency standards may be even more expensive. Adding in benefits not related to global warming -- like less pollution, less reliance on foreign oil, and less time spent filling up -- the mileage standards may still cost more than their benefits.
The Obama administration will say that mileage standards are the best we can do to limit our gas usage. The president's proposal to create carbon allowances, which would act like a tax to limit companies' carbon emissions, withered in Congress two years ago despite the plan to use the money to provide tax credits to low-income families. A tax on gasoline doesn't stand a chance.
And doing nothing about global warming might seem crazy considering how little we really know about the potentially devastating consequences of climate change.
Still, we could do much better if taxes were on the table.
The United States has the lowest gas taxes by far among the industrialized nations. This includes countries with mandatory fuel-efficiency standards and countries without them. It includes big countries and little ones. Among them, guess who uses the most transportation fuel of all?
Hint: in Britain, where gas and diesel are taxed at $3.95 a gallon, the American automaker Ford sells a compact Fiesta model that will go nearly 72 miles on a gallon. In the United States, where gas taxes average 49 cents, Ford's Fiestas will carry you only 33 miles on a gallon of gas.

HEADLINE: Embracing Role as Surrogate, Clinton Hits Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Bill Clinton, fresh from an appearance at the Democratic convention that confirmed his status as President Obama's No. 1 surrogate and all-around B.F.F., took to the campaign trail in this battleground state on Tuesday, declaring that ''we've got a lot of reasons to vote, and we've got a good candidate to vote for.''
Speaking to a sellout crowd of 2,300 at Florida International University, Mr. Clinton reprised much of the detail-laden defense of Mr. Obama's first term that he delivered in Charlotte, N.C. He lavished special attention on two particularly resonant issues in a state with many students and older voters: education loans and health care. 
Repealing Mr. Obama's health care law, as Mitt Romney has pledged to do, would ''weaken Medicare; it's going to run out of money quicker,'' Mr. Clinton said. The Republicans, he said, would cut off the access of students to low-interest federal loans, which could put college out of reach for many middle-income people.
Mr. Clinton, speaking with a little less brio than he did in Charlotte but no less detail, offered a forceful defense of Mr. Obama's presidency, saying that nobody could have been expected to heal the damage from the recession in a single term.
''The test is not whether you think everything's hunky-dory; if that were the test, the president would vote against himself,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The test is whether he's taking us in the right direction, and the answer to that is yes.''
Mr. Clinton's rally was the only one on a subdued day in the campaign, when the candidates and their running mates marked the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by eschewing partisan criticism. Mr. Clinton observed a moment of silence for the victims and avoided the gleeful skewering that flavored his remarks at the convention.
But he stoutly defended the idea of holding a political rally on the anniversary, saying it was ''about citizenship.'' Mentioning the federal workers who died in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, during his presidency, Mr. Clinton delivered a not-so-subtle rebuke to the antigovernment thinking of many Republicans.
''On this day, of all days, we should know there are good and noble people who work for the government,'' he said.
Mr. Clinton's speech was the first of what Obama campaign officials said would be several appearances in battleground states on Mr. Obama's behalf. Aides to Mr. Clinton say he is ready to do whatever Mr. Obama asks him -- a role that has already involved appearing at fund-raisers and in a widely shown campaign commercial.
While it was Mr. Clinton's show, it used the Obama campaign's soundtrack, from the mix tape of Bruce Springsteen and Brooks & Dunn that plays at Mr. Obama's rallies to the introductory speeches, which kept the focus squarely on Mr. Obama and used familiar campaign riffs, like rebuilding America from the middle out, not the top down. Mr. Clinton, backed by American flags, spoke at a podium with an Obama-Biden logo.
This was above all a businesslike speech. Mr. Clinton did not dwell on Mr. Obama's character. He did not refer to the appointment of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as secretary of state. Nor did he offer any testimonials to the courage that Mr. Obama showed in ordering the raid on Osama bin Laden.
Instead, Mr. Clinton offered a sometimes highly detailed discussion of the economics of Medicare, and how it would be affected by the proposals of Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. He repeated his incredulous reaction that Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, had accused Mr. Obama of taking $716 billion out of Medicare when the Republican budget that Mr. Ryan drafted would seek the same amount in savings from the program.
Mr. Clinton pitched many of his comments at the young people in the audience, saying that a vote for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would be a risky bet that the Republican proposals would make the country more prosperous than four more years of Mr. Obama would.
''In two and a half years, President Obama's plans produced more jobs than in the previous seven years,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''You have to decide whether you think that's an accident, and if you're willing to bet your future on it.''
Mr. Clinton drew a mixed crowd, both in age and ethnic composition, with young Latinos carrying placards that said ''Hispanics for Obama,'' while older people wore Obama ''Hope'' T-shirts that looked as if they had been through a few wash cycles. The crowd, which braved torrential rain and wind in the hours before the speech to fill the arena here, responded with frequent cries of ''Four More Years!'' and ''Fired up, ready to go.''
Lia Bustamante, 41, a Venezuelan-American and a Republican, said a relative had urged her to come to hear what Mr. Clinton had to say. Despite her party affiliation, she said she was likely to vote for Mr. Obama because, she said, ''I feel like he's more for women's rights.''
As for Mr. Clinton's value, Lisa Cornelius, 58, a teacher, said: ''The convention speech said it all. He's an iconic leader of the Democratic Party. I can't think of anybody better to promote the president's programs.''
Her daughter, Stephanie, a community college student born in 1993, the year after Mr. Clinton was elected, said: ''He had the highest approval ratings of any president. Everybody basically loved him because he played the saxophone.''

HEADLINE: Investing in Good Governance

BYLINE: LUCIAN A. BEBCHUK


HIGHLIGHT: Research shows that market prices already reflect the value of good-governance provisions to investors. 

 BODY:
Can investors generally beat the market by concentrating their portfolios on companies that practice good corporate governance? There is evidence that good-governance features included in standard governance indexes do improve the performance of companies - but that their significance is already reflected in market prices. 
In a well-known study issued a decade ago, Paul Gompers, Joy Ishii and Andrew Metrick identified a trading strategy that would have produced abnormally high returns in the 1990s. The strategy was based on an index, the G-Index, consisting of 24 governance provisions that weaken shareholder rights. 
In a subsequent study, Alma Cohen, Allen Ferrell and I showed that, among the 24 provisions, only six - including staggered boards, poison pills and supermajority requirements - really mattered. As a result, we constructed an E-Index based on these six "entrenching" provisions. 
Those studies showed that buying shares in the 1990s of companies that scored well on the governance indexes and shorting companies that scored poorly would have beaten the market. The correlation between governance and stock returns has attracted interest from researchers, and the G-Index and E-Index have subsequently been used in hundreds of studies by financial economists. 
In a recent study that will be published by The Journal of Financial Economics, Alma Cohen, Charles Wang and I document that the correlation between governance and stock returns in the 1990s did not persist in later years. This correlation disappeared because markets learned to distinguish between good-governance and poor-governance firms (as defined by the governance indexes) and to price the difference into stock values.
We show that many relevant players - institutional investors, researchers and the media - started paying more attention to corporate governance in the 1990s - and that this trend accelerated in the early 2000s. From 2000 to 2002, the number of articles related to governance that appeared in major newspapers in the United States tripled, and the number of governance-related proposals submitted by institutional investors more than doubled. These and other barometers of interest in governance have remained high since then. 
The increase in attention to governance had an impact. By 2001, the stock market seems to have learned to price how good-governance and poor-governance companies differ in their expected profitability. 
The reaction of stock prices to earnings announcements indicated whether the release surprised the market. We found that, from 1990 to 2001 but not in later years , the earnings announcement of good-governance companies were more likely than those of poor-governance companies to surprise the market positively. 
Over all, our study concluded that, during the 1990s, investors gradually learned to appreciate the difference between the good-governance and poor-governance companies. As a result, investors pushed up the stock prices of companies with good governance relative to those with poor governance. Once stock prices came to reflect this difference, it was no longer possible to use the governance indexes to outperform the market. 
Does that mean that governance provisions in these indexes became irrelevant for investor interests? Not at all. We found that, as was the case in the 1990s, companies scoring well on these indexes continued to have a higher return on assets, net profit margin and sales growth in the 2000s than poorly scoring companies in their industry. 
Good-governance companies also continued to have a higher Tobin's Q - a standard measure based on the ratio of market capitalization to book value that financial economists use. Thus, the provisions in the governance indexes remain important for the value and performance of companies even if they are already factored into market prices. 
Are there any ways left for investors to make money from governance? Yes. Some governance arrangements outside the governance indexes might not be priced yet, and investors could look for them. Our findings indicate that markets might require significant time to recognize fully, and incorporate into prices, the significance of certain governance arrangements. 
As to the arrangements in the standard indexes whose significance is already recognized, investors would do well to encourage companies to make changes expected to improve value and performance. For example, shareholders could seek removal of entrenching provisions, like staggered boards and supermajority requirements, at the many companies that still have them. 
Such changes may not enable some shareholders to outperform others, but they could benefit all the shareholders of these companies, as well as the economy. Governance is and will remain consequential for the wealth of shareholders and the value of companies.

HEADLINE: What's Bubbling Up From Newtown Creek?

BYLINE: EMMA BRYCE


HIGHLIGHT: Researchers warn that the city's aeration process could pose risks for air quality. 

 BODY:
Reached aboard a boat in the other day, John Lipscomb of the advocacy group Riverkeeper described the water by phone. "It's this green-blue chalky color," he said. "You're floating around and there are dead rats, condoms, and there's this stench of sewage - this sulphuric smell." 
Which goes a long way toward explaining why the city's Department of Environmental Protection has been pumping air into the four-mile-long waterway between Brooklyn and Queens for years in an effort to oxygenate its fetid waters.
Oxygen levels are a crucial component of a water body's health. Yet the value of the aeration process has been called into question by a new study suggesting that stirring up polluted waters this way adds higher levels of harmful bacteria to the air. The researchers warn that this airborne bacterial plume could be damaging to the environment and to human health.
Aeration increases circulation and improve the water's health. Along the creek's bottom, close to the Metropolitan Avenue Bridge, the Department of Environmental Protection has installed pipes that push columns of compressed air into the water for this purpose, said M. Elias Dueker, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University and the lead author on the study, for which Riverkeeper is a collaborator. "They're bubbling the creek from the bottom -- the technique is borrowed directly from waste treatment plants," he said.

It's just one more element in the city's multibillion-dollar investment in infrastructure intended to reduce the impact of combined sewer overflows, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. (The aeration is unrelated to the 2010 decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to designate Newtown Creek as a toxic Superfund site that will undergo an arduous cleanup. Preparatory field sampling for the cleanup began last year.)
The researchers set out to compare the relative levels of invisible fallout - the settling of matter that circulates in the air -- by taking air samples when the creek's aerators were on and when they were off, The team placed petri dishes on a patrol boat in the creek so they could capture the matter driven upward by bubbles that burst at the water's surface.
They found that while the amount of general fallout was the same whether the aerators were on or off, the content was different when they were on. Not only were there were much higher levels of particulate matter, but higher levels of bacteria associated with the sewage and oil in the water, they said. 
"When the bubbles are released and travel to the surface, they are actually gathering bacteria as they go," Dr. Dueker said. "And when they burst at the surface, they eject the material that was around the bubble into the air." 
While the finding, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, is not altogether surprising, the researchers are urging the city's environmental regulators to consider the possibility that the air pollution is a tangible threat to public health. Gregory O'Mullan, an assistant professor and microbiologist at Queens College who is one of the report's authors, said that if the bacteria existed in high concentrations in the air, it could potentially cause respiratory or gastrointestinal illness.
"This raises the potential that water quality may not just be something that people who swim or wade or fish should be concerned about," Dr. O'Mullan said. "It may be something that people who live along water bodies should be concerned about, too."
The Department of Environmental Protection said this week that studies by the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration indicate that there are no adverse health risks for workers at wastewater treatment plants, where sewage levels are far higher than in Newtown Creek. "We're always welcoming new scientific evidence, and we'll review this study and determine if any further steps are warranted," a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Delay Plans to Increase Oversight of Regulators

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Lawmakers postponed plans to advance a bill that could curb the influence of Wall Street regulators, a move that came as some federal officials mounted opposition to the effort. 

 BODY:
Lawmakers postponed plans to advance a bill that could curb the influence of Wall Street regulators, a move that came as some federal officials mounted opposition to the effort.
The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs decided Wednesday to punt the vote until after the November election, according to people briefed on the matter. One person explained that the committee needed additional time to set the agenda for the meeting.
The committee had preliminarily planned to meet on Sept. 20, although it did not officially announce the timing. 
On Monday, DealBook reported that the bill was gaining momentum on Capitol Hill even as regulators were resisting the effort. Regulators, whose cause is backed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen, say the legislation would constrain their ability to police Wall Street. 
The bill, which comes as regulators carry out an overhaul of the financial industry, would allow the White House to influence the rule-writing process at independent agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It would exempt the Federal Reserve.
Under the legislation, the president could use an executive order to empower the White House to second-guess major rules and mandate that agencies carefully study the economic effects of new regulation. The change could, in effect, delay a number of rules for Wall Street by several months.
The authors of the Senate bill - Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio; Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia- say they are not trying to halt regulation or provide the president unchecked power of independent agencies. Some legal experts also argue that the president already has authority to impose demands on the agencies, which operate independently of the presidential cabinet.
But regulators and government watchdog groups are skeptical. 
"Those who support preserving the status quo where Wall Street regulates itself will find much to like in this legislation," said Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit government watchdog group.

HEADLINE: Dealers Peer Into Chrysler Product Pipeline

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: At a meeting in Las Vegas, the automaker discussed details of its second major product push since emerging from its bankruptcy in 2009. 

 BODY:
Although Chrysler Group has made significant strides toward rehabilitating its finances since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, the company has avoided the complacency that plagued it in previous times of growth. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and Fiat, introduced 66 car and truck models to the company's dealers at a meeting in Las Vegas on Monday.
According to a report by Reuters, among the new models shown was a Chrysler 100 subcompact that would give the brand an entry in that growing segment; a redesigned Chrysler 200 said to resemble the well-received Dodge Dart; various Jeep models that mimic the styling of the brand's successful Grand Cherokee; and a couple of Alfa Romeos that would be sold by Fiat dealers in the United States.
"We are less than two years away from having an almost completely rejuvenated product lineup compared to what we could offer customers when we began this journey in June 2009," Mr. Marchionne said to dealers.
Bill Golling, president of Golling Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and Golling Fiat, both in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., was in attendance. "We went out to the meeting with great interest and weren't disappointed," Mr. Golling said in a telephone interview. "I'm almost overwhelmed on how exciting it is for the future. What they're showing us now is very rewarding."
Asked if he thought a market existed for a subcompact Chrysler sedan, Mr. Golling said he could not comment on specific products, but added that in light of coming Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards requiring average fleetwide fuel economy of 54 miles per gallon by 2025, Chrysler dealers "would have a different portfolio of products going forward."
"I take a look at the things they're doing, and they're right on track," he said.
To illustrate his optimism, Mr. Golling cited a 9-speed automatic transmission under development for Chrysler's front-drive vehicles.
The automaker's market share in the United States has been increasing steadily since Mr. Marchionne took the helm in 2009. At the end of 2009, the automaker held 8.9 percent of the market. Its share currently stands at 11.1 percent.
"We cannot stop now," Mr. Marchionne said in his address. "We cannot afford to rest."

HEADLINE: Private Equity Group Aims to Relate to Average Americans

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A public relations campaign from the Private Equity Growth Capital Council seeks to counteract the image problems the industry has faced during the election year cycle. The latest installment points to the industry's ties to pension funds, university endowments and charities. 

 BODY:
The private equity industry would like you to know that buyouts are not just about making Wall Street rich.
Such deals also benefit regular Americans, the industry's lobbying group says in an informational video posted online on Tuesday evening. The animated cartoon, from the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, is the latest installment in a continuing , which happens to be timed to the election year cycle.
"Average Americans in all 50 states benefit the most from the investments that private equity makes," the narrator says, over an upbeat soundtrack.
 The video says pension funds, university endowments and charities (and therefore, "average Americans") are often invested in private equity, and that successful buyout deals can create jobs and promote local economic growth.
At one point in the video, private equity is depicted as extending a life preserver to a company that has erected an "S.O.S." sign on its roof.
The industry has taken a public beating in the presidential race, as Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital is scrutinized. Some pundits have taken aim at the Republican candidate's wealth, portraying him as a ruthless financier who took over companies at the expense of Main Street.
The lobbying group's campaign, known as "Private Equity at Work," has previously highlighted deals by K.K.R., the Blackstone Group and Thoma Bravo.
While the latest video is not explicitly political, it does mention some potential swing states.
"When private equity investment helps companies grow or rebuild," the narrator says, "the factory worker in Iowa, the I.T. specialist in Florida and the store manager in Virginia benefit."

HEADLINE: Europe Presses Israel to Put Faith in Iran Sanctions

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: European governments are increasingly nervous about the possibility of an Israel strike on Iran and have been trying to persuade the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to give tougher sanctions on Tehran time to work. 

 BODY:
LONDON - European governments are displaying increasing nervousness about the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran and are trying to persuade the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that tougher sanctions are still the best weapon to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
The message has been carried to Israel in recent days by, among others, the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy and, according to one report, by the head of Britain's spy agency, MI6.
The nuclear issue put further strains on the relationship between Israel and Washington this week after Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday criticized the Obama administration for refusing to set clear "red lines" on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. 
As my colleagues David E. Sanger and Isabel Kershner report, President Obama called the Israeli leader on Tuesday night to try to calm the situation. "The two talked for a full hour, hashing through the Iran confrontation and their misunderstandings," they write.
Although Washington's European allies are bystanders in the diplomatic dance between the United States and Israel, they have a vital interest in how the confrontation with Iran is resolved.
European commentators have been skeptical about what some regard as an attempt to pressure the Obama administration ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. And European governments have been hard at work trying to persuade Israel to give sanctions more time.
Eli Bardenstein, writing in the Israeli daily Ma'ariv last week, said a series of visits by senior European officials amounted to a diplomatic blitz on Mr. Netanyahu's office. They included visits by the foreign ministers of Italy, Germany, Bulgaria and Norway. 
Giulio Terzi, the Italian foreign minister and a former ambassador to Israel, insisted in his meetings with Israeli officials that sanctions were working. "The sanctions on Iranian oil is a turning point,'' he said during his visit. ''Together with sanctions on the banking system, they have a dramatic influence on the Iranian economy and have led to an opening of the regime to conduct a dialogue.''
Guido Westerwelle, his German counterpart, used his visit to urge Tehran to return to the negotiating table over its nuclear program. But he also told his Israeli hosts, "Our goal remains a political and diplomatic solution." 
The Israeli daily Haaretz quoted a high-ranking German official as saying Mr. Westerwelle told Mr. Netanyahu that an Israeli military operation at this time could dissolve the international coalition against Iran. 
In what would amount to another explicit intervention by Europe to try to talk Israel out of the military option, the head of Britain's secret intelligence service was reported to have made a secret visit to Israel two weeks ago.
The British authorities, who routinely refuse to confirm or deny any reports on the activities of the intelligence agencies, had no comment on a report of the trip in The Daily Mail on Wednesday.
The British daily, in an unsourced article, said Sir John Sawers, head of MI6, had urged Mr. Netanyahu not to go ahead with an attack on Iran and emphasized Britain's belief that there was still time for diplomatic and economic sanctions to succeed.
Sir John moved to MI6 from his previous post as Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, where he was involved in negotiating the international sanctions on Iran.
The Daily Mail said David Cameron, the British prime minister, "is understood to have become increasingly concerned at the rhetoric from the authorities in Israel, who have been threatening unilateral military action to halt Iran's nuclear drive."
The diplomatic push from Europe appears to have done little to cool the Israeli rhetoric, but European leaders are still hoping actions will speak louder than words.
European Union foreign ministers, who met in Cyprus on Friday, were urged by Britain, France and Germany to adopt additional measures against Tehran soon. William Hague, the British foreign minister, said this week that the meeting had shown "a very strong level of support for further sanctions."
Speaking during a visit to Cairo, he said, "We are working on those sanctions...quite urgently and I hope we will be able to discuss them further when we meet again in the middle of October." 
Given Mr. Netanyahu's view that diplomacy and sanctions have so far failed to work, will that be soon enough?

Private Equity Firms Depicted as Colluding | Bain Capital and other prominent private equity firms are depicted in court documents as unofficial partners in a bid-rigging conspiracy to hold down the prices of companies they were looking to buy, Eric Lichtblau and Peter Lattman report in The New York Times.
In Bain's $32.1 billion purchase of the hospital giant HCA in 2006, its biggest acquisition, competitors privately agreed to "stand down" and not bid as part of an understanding to divvy up companies targeted for buyouts, The Times reports, citing internal e-mails.
The documents, which lawyers for Bain Capital had sought to keep secret, are part of a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Boston brought against Bain and other firms by shareholders who claim that this scheme lowered the prices of more than two dozen companies and cost them billions of dollars, according to The Times. In addition to Bain, the lawsuit names Goldman Sachs's private equity arm and the Blackstone Group, the firm run by Stephen A. Schwarzman.

Seeking Critical Mass of Gender Equality in the Boardroom | There's a remarkable lack of women in corporate boardrooms around the world, the Deal Professor writes. The European Union is considering a remedy that would require that 40 percent of a company's directors be women. This may be a milestone for gender equality, but the question is, will it make any difference in how companies are run?
The number of women directors remains stubbornly low. According to Catalyst, a nonprofit organization devoted to furthering women in business, American companies have the fourth-highest average of women directors in the world. The average board of a Fortune 500 company in the United States is 16 percent women.

HEADLINE: Europe Presses Israel to Put Faith in Iran Sanctions

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: European governments are increasingly nervous about the possibility of an Israel strike on Iran and have been trying to persuade the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to give tougher sanctions on Tehran time to work. 

 BODY:
LONDON - European governments are displaying increasing nervousness about the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran and are trying to persuade the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that tougher sanctions are still the best weapon to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
The message has been carried to Israel in recent days by, among others, the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy and, according to one report, by the head of Britain's spy agency, MI6.
The nuclear issue this week put further strains on the relationship between Israel and Washington after Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday criticized the Obama administration for refusing to set clear "red lines" on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. 
As my colleagues David E. Sanger and Isabel Kershner report, President Obama called the Israeli leader on Tuesday night to try to calm the situation. "The two talked for a full hour, hashing through the Iran confrontation and their misunderstandings," they write.
Although Washington's European allies are bystanders in the diplomatic dance between the United States and Israel, they have a vital interest in how the confrontation with Iran is resolved.
European commentators have been skeptical about what some regard as an attempt to pressure the Obama administration ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. However, European governments have been hard at work trying to persuade Israel to give sanctions more time.
Eli Bardenstein, writing in the Israeli daily Ma'ariv last week, said a series of visits by senior European officials amounted to a diplomatic blitz on Mr. Netanyahu's office. They included visits by the foreign ministers of Italy, Germany, Bulgaria and Norway. 
Giulio Terzi, the Italian foreign minister and a former ambassador to Israel, insisted in his meetings with Israeli officials that sanctions were working. "The sanctions on Iranian oil is a turning point,'' he said during his visit. ''Together with sanctions on the banking system, they have a dramatic influence on the Iranian economy and have led to an opening of the regime to conduct a dialogue.''
Guido Westerwelle, his German counterpart, used his visit to urge Tehran to return to the negotiating table over its nuclear program. But he also told his Israeli hosts, "Our goal remains a political and diplomatic solution." 
Israel's Haaretz quoted a high-ranking German official as saying Mr. Westerwelle told Mr. Netanyahu that an Israeli military operation at this time could dissolve the international coalition against Iran. 
In what would amount to another explicit intervention by Europe to try to talk Israel out of the military option, the head of Britain's secret intelligence service was reported to have made a secret visit to Israel two weeks ago.
British authorities, who routinely refuse to confirm or deny any reports on the activities of the intelligence agencies, had no comment on a Wednesday report of the trip in the Daily Mail.
The British daily, in an unsourced article, said Sir John Sawers, head of MI6, had urged Mr. Netanyahu not to go ahead with an attack on Iran and stressed Britain's belief that there was still time for diplomatic and economic sanctions to succeed.
Sir John moved to MI6 from his previous post as Britain's ambassador to the United Nations where he was involved in negotiating international sanctions on Iran.
The Daily Mail said David Cameron, the British prime minister, "is understood to have become increasingly concerned at the rhetoric from the authorities in Israel, who have been threatening unilateral military action to halt Iran's nuclear drive."
The diplomatic push from Europe appears to have done little to cool the Israeli rhetoric, but European leaders are still hoping actions will speak louder than words.
European Union foreign ministers, who met in Cyprus on Friday, were urged by Britain, France and Germany to adopt additional measures against Tehran soon. William Hague, the British foreign minister, said this week that the meeting had shown "a very strong level of support for further sanctions."
Speaking on a visit to Cairo, he said, "We are working on those sanctions...quite urgently and I hope we will be able to discuss them further when we meet again in the middle of October." 
Given Mr. Netanyahu's view that diplomacy and sanctions have so far failed to work, will that be soon enough?

HEADLINE: Economic Fundamentals and the Election

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Consider Ohio. 

 BODY:
One thing you keep hearing from political pundits is that the state of the economy should lead to a crushing defeat for Obama -- no president has ever been reelected with unemployment this high, etc.. But as quite a few better-informed people have pointed out, the political science literature is unambiguous on this point: what matters isn't the state of the economy, it's the perception of trend. If the economy appears to be improving, the incumbent tends to do well even if in absolute terms it's still pretty bad.
By that standard, Obama is in a much better position than the conventional wisdom would suggest; the economy isn't booming, but it's growing, and the labor market is moving sideways rather than down. It's not Reagan's morning in America (which reflects the different and much more intractable nature of the 2008 crisis and aftermath), but it's not the political disaster you might imagine.
But wait, there's more: elections aren't decided by national popular vote, they're decided state by state. And it seems likely that this election will be decided in the industrial midwest, Ohio in particular -- a region that has bounced back strongly.
Here's a comparison I haven't seen made: the unemployment rate in Ohio under two administrations:
Unemployment was still very high in Ohio at this time in the Reagan years. But it was coming down, and most people blamed the previous administration for the surge in unemployment that had occurred before.
And you could say exactly the same thing this time around, with the added twist that much of the good news can be attributed to the auto bailout that Obama carried out in the face of frantic GOP opposition.
Now, national sentiment matters too, and Obama obviously can't run a campaign on boosterism. But the key point is that the economic background isn't that bad for him politically; it's good enough, in particular, for him to try to turn this into a "choice" election that his opponent clearly wasn't ready for.
Here's a comparison

Private Equity Firms Depicted as Colluding | Bain Capital and other prominent private equity firms are depicted in court documents as unofficial partners in a bid-rigging conspiracy to hold down the prices of companies they were looking to buy, Eric Lichtblau and Peter Lattman report in The New York Times.
In Bain's $32.1 billion purchase of the hospital giant HCA in 2006, its biggest acquisition, competitors privately agreed to "stand down" and not bid as part of an understanding to divvy up companies targeted for buyouts, The Times reports, citing internal e-mails.
The documents, which lawyers for Bain Capital had sought to keep secret, are part of a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Boston brought against Bain and other firms by shareholders who claim that this scheme lowered the prices of more than two dozen companies and cost them billions of dollars, according to The Times. In addition to Bain, the lawsuit names Goldman Sachs's private equity arm and the Blackstone Group, the firm run by Stephen A. Schwarzman. NEW YORK TIMES
Seeking Critical Mass of Gender Equality in the Boardroom | There is a remarkable lack of women in corporate boardrooms around the world, the Deal Professor writes. The European Union is considering a remedy that would require that 40 percent of a company's directors be women. This may be a milestone for gender equality, but the question is, will it make any difference in how companies are run?
The number of women directors remains stubbornly low. According to Catalyst, a nonprofit organization devoted to furthering women in business, American companies have the fourth-highest average of women directors in the world. Women make up 16 percent of the average board of a Fortune 500 company in the United States. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Why Men Drop Out of the Labor Force

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The most frequent reason given by men 25 to 54 for leaving the labor force over the last 15 years was illness or disability. For women, a majority left to become household caregivers. 

 BODY:
As I mentioned on Friday, the share of men who are actively in the labor force is at an all-time low (a trend David Brooks also explored in his column Tuesday). Now Steve Hipple, an economist at the Labor Department, points me to a related paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which helps explain why.
It finds that men typically leave the labor force for reasons systematically different from the reasons that women do. The trends basically boil down to disability versus homemaking.
A plurality of men age 25 to 54 who left the labor force over the last 15 years said they did so because they were ill or disabled:
As you can see from the top dashed line, the percentage of men dropping out because of disability rose during the recession and has been falling since then, although illness or disability is still the most commonly cited reason for leaving the labor force. The shares of men leaving to go back to school or to engage in household care have also been rising.
Meanwhile, a vast majority of prime-working-age women dropping out of the labor force have been going into household care, which of course includes becoming a full-time parent.
Take a look at the right-hand vertical axis to track this share, which as of March was a touch below 60 percent:
While the share of men dropping out in order to engage in household care has been rising, the comparable share for women has been falling, a trend that predates the recession. Of women 25 to 54 dropping out of the labor force, the share dropping out to go to school has risen steeply.
The share of women dropping out to go on disability has also been rising. Economists like David Autor have suggested that idle workers, particularly older idle workers, have been turning to disability as a last resort when their unemployment benefits run out.

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Is Mitt Romney the Tim Tebow of politics? 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, here we are, conversing online again. During the conventions, we got to talk face to face on video, and I really did enjoy that. So much so that it actually felt worthwhile to walk through endless police barricades in the sultry heat.
That was in Tampa. In Charlotte, the security did not seem all that concerned about whether terrorists would bother to attack the working press, so they pretty much ignored our part of the convention center. It was more convenient, but a little unsettling.
David Brooks: Can I just say that the security measures at the conventions have practically turned me into a libertarian? There were thousands of cops, soldiers and various sleeve-talkers (the guys with microphones in their sleeves and listening thingies in their ears). They shut down streets and blocks for miles around. In Charlotte, I parked about a half mile from the convention center but had to walk about three miles to my car because the security types had erected metal fences and shut down every block in between. It was 1:30 in the morning and hundreds of cops were riding around pointlessly on bicycles.
Gail: I thought those squads of cops-on-bikes were kind of cute. Although you're right, also pointless.
David: This was useless security theater on such a high order that even the useless loiterers at the T.S.A. must be standing and applauding. Why can't we be honest and say that at least 90 percent of the visible post-9/11 security measures in this country serves no useful purpose? They just provide jobs and overtime for some and allow others to get their kicks as petty despots, bossing people around.
Now that that is off my chest, let me add, it was a real pleasure to see you and do these things face to face.
Gail: I'm dying to ask you about all the polls that show the Democratic convention worked for Obama while the Republican one did zip for Romney.
At least that's what the early polls said. The Obama people are running around yelling "Temporary! Temporary!" because they're terrified their people will get overconfident and jinx things.
David: I don't know what to make of how long-lasting the bounce will be. Most polls have Obama up significantly, but the last Washington Post/ABC poll had him back down to a 1-point margin, which is far more typical. Most of the polling has Obama up by at least 5 in Ohio, which is significant.
Gail: See? Temporary! Temporary!
David: I do know that the last two weeks have underlined the ineptness of the Romney campaign, and the elemental fact is that in close elections the quality of the campaign matters.
How is it that the Romney people didn't establish his character with profile ads all summer? How is it that they buried the testimonials from other Mormon families who know him well at a point in the convention when no undecided voters were watching? How is it that they have driven no positive message about their candidate or his agenda? If they want this to be a change election, which change are they talking about?
I seem to be really into rhetorical questions today.
Gail: Up until the convention, there seemed to be two Mitt Romney scenarios. One, that he was strong but almost pathologically pragmatic. You couldn't trust anything he said, but you had faith he was working on a secret game plan of his own.
The other was that he was just totally spineless. To me, the convention and everything since the convention has demonstrated that scenario two is the right one.
David: Pragmatists have to have something to be pragmatic about. They have to say: I may not be the most exciting guy on the earth, but if you elect me, I will deliver these four things: A, B, C and D. Romney never got specific on what policy products he was selling, so there was a void at the core of his convention.
Gail: I think picking Ryan was the turning point of the Romney campaign. It was originally billed as bold and daring. But after all we've seen since, I'm beginning to wonder if Romney was just strong-armed into taking him. No matter how much they like hanging out together on the campaign train, Romney can't possibly really believe in Ryan's budget plan, which does Not. Add. Up.
And by the conventions, the grand planners had Ryan muffling his own convictions and attacking the president for failing to support a budget-cutting commission that Ryan had torpedoed himself. So it was Spineless Wimp Squared.
David: I agree Ryan was the turning point, but I'd put it differently. In picking Ryan, Romney was assigning himself a bold challenge. He was embracing entitlement reform and therefore he was going to have to go to the American people with a specific argument on why entitlement reform is necessary and why the Romney-Ryan approach is best. But he has not actually made that argument. He wimped out.
Gail: See? We are in accord on the wimp factor.
David: If you are going to pick a fight, you have to be willing to fight. Romney now has all the downsides of the Republican budget and none of the upsides. At the Democratic convention, Clinton exploited that void.
Gail: The two of them are now both stuck trying to defend their plan for across-the-board tax cuts, balanced by closing unnamed loopholes. Once again, Romney can't possibly believe in it. All I could think about was the time George W. Bush asked his advisers whether rich people hadn't already gotten enough tax cuts and Karl Rove told him: "Stick to principle. Stick to principle." While the spirit of Dick Cheney hovered over the room, intoning: "This is our due."
People like Paul Ryan believe in the plan because they think if you get rid of all that revenue it'd force dramatic cuts in the size of government. They called that "starving the beast" back when it didn't work under Reagan.
I have faith that Romney has the memory, and the intellect, to know this is all crazy. But he's afraid to stand up to the Republican right wing, even now that he's got the nomination.
David: I don't think that's fair. I don't think either Romney or Ryan believe it's their due. I certainly don't think they believe in the starve-the-beast theory. The Romney-Ryan plan is based on a coherent theory of how to boost long-term economic growth. The fact that you're reacting to Dick Cheney and Grover Norquist here is a sign that they haven't communicated that theory very well.
Gail: It's sweet of you to blame the Romney messaging when we disagree.
David: Well, at least Romney-Ryan has a theory about how to boost growth. I don't even know what President Obama's theory is. He did mention the virtues of long-life batteries in his convention speech. Maybe he's outsourcing economic policy to the Energizer Bunny.
You might not like the Ryan-Romney approach, but you have to admit that President Obama is basically offering four more years of the status quo.
Gail: Passing the ideas from the first four would be a pretty large agenda.
But, about Romney - here's one last howl of protest. Last weekend, I know you watched him on "Meet the Press," claiming that he really didn't plan to get rid of the popular parts of Obamacare, like protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And then he said that we should trust him on this, because that was in his health-care plan in Massachusetts! Honest to gosh, if he's going to repudiate the major product of his career as governor, the least he can do is let it stay repudiated.
And then, of course, once the interview was over, the clarifiers jumped in to say he was only in favor of forcing insurance companies to cover pre-exiting conditions for people who already had insurance.
David: It's funny how campaigns run. Romney was being more or less policy consistent on this. It's always been obvious that Republicans will keep parts of Obamacare. These parts always had bipartisan support - although implementing these parts without more money is problematic.
But I had dinner with a bunch of people last night who were only aware of the clarifications. They didn't know the substance of Romney's health-care plan. All they got was the perception that Romney is waffling. If a candidate doesn't lay down a layer of philosophical consistency, then any small campaign clarification gets turned into a character issue. Does the guy believe in anything?
Gail: Well, here comes the fall. There'll be new movies. Popular television shows will reappear. The World Series will occur, and sooner or later the Jets will actually let Tim Tebow have some real playing time. Preparations for the holiday season will get under way.
You and I, however, will not be diverted. We'll be thinking about nothing but Romney, Ryan, Obama, Biden and the occasional embattled senator.
At least Herman Cain's not in it anymore.
David: Maybe Romney is the Tim Tebow of politics. You spend all year thinking he's sort of a mediocre performer but then at the end he goes on a miracle run and you realize that the Lord does indeed work in strange and mysterious ways.

HEADLINE: Former Banker Promises Inside Peek at Goldman

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and JULIE BOSMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Coming less than a year after an explosive opinion article, Greg Smith's memoir, "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," promises to be a tell-all of his 12-year career at the Wall Street bank. 

 BODY:
Wall Street has plenty of worries heading into autumn: the stability of the euro zone, persistent United States unemployment and the historically volatile October stock market.
Goldman Sachs has an additional concern: Greg Smith's book.
Mr. Smith's memoir, "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," is set for publication on Oct. 22. The release date comes just seven months after Mr. Smith publicly resigned from the bank with an Op-Ed page articlein The New York Times that detailed his disappointment with Goldman's business practices that reflected, more broadly, a corrosive culture at the nation's largest banks.
 The article struck a nerve. Within 24 hours, it had more than three million views online. Publishers clamored for the rights to a book. Grand Central Publishing, a division of the Hachette Book Group, secured a deal, offering Mr. Smith an advance of close to $1.5 million, according to people with direct knowledge of the negotiations.
His book comes at an inopportune moment for Goldman, which has largely disappeared from the spotlight after a wave of negative publicity damaged the bank's reputation.
In addition, it paid $550 million to settle a civil case brought by the government over a subprime mortgage product that it sold to clients. An insider trading scandal ensnared the firm, with a member of its board facing prison time and at least two other executives under investigation.
And its depiction as a blood sucking "vampire squid" in a Rolling Stone articlecaptured the public's imagination, helping to make Goldman a symbol of Wall Street's dark side.
But in recent months, Goldman has steered clear of the negative finance coverage dominating the headlines, most notably the huge trading losses at JPMorgan Chase and the growing scandal involving certain banks' manipulation of interest rates.
"Why I Left Goldman Sachs" promises to be a tell-all of Mr. Smith's 12-year career at the bank. His opinion article in The Times described Goldman as a once-vaunted institution that had lost its way. He wrote that when he first joined the bank as an intern in the summer of 2000, it obsessively put its clients' interests first.
But over time, Mr. Smith said, Goldman devolved into a "toxic and destructive" culture that put profit before principle. His former colleagues mocked their clients, he said, derisively referring to them as "muppets."
"I truly believe that this decline in the firm's moral fiber represents the single most serious threat to its long-run survival," Mr. Smith wrote. "It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their clients off."
Not everyone embraced Mr. Smith's article. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York dismissed the piece as "ridiculous," calling it nothing more than a nasty letter from a disgruntled employee. It also spawned numerous parodies on the Internet, including "Why I Am Leaving the Empire," by Darth Vader.
David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, minimized the significance of the book. "Every day, some young professional, after a decade in a postcollegiate job, reassesses his or her career and decides to move on and do something else," he said in an e-mailed statement. "Others can better judge whether Mr. Smith's particular career transition is of unique interest."
Grand Central has planned a robust print run of 150,000 copies in hardcover and expects to sell a sizable number of copies in e-book format.
"Many people on Main Street distrust Wall Street right now, yet few can put their finger on why," Jamie Raab, publisher of Grand Central, said in a statement. "Greg Smith's candid account of his years at Goldman Sachs does just that."
A big selling point of Mr. Smith's book is that it is about Goldman, which has long been a subject of fascination because of its immense profits and political connections. Also, within the hushed confines of the bank, a code of silence has always prevailed, so an insider's account is especially tantalizing.
Several nonfiction releases about Goldman have had some success, most recently the best seller "Money and Power" by William D. Cohan, but the bank has never been the focus of a tell-all.
Yet many in the publishing industry, including several people who met with Mr. Smith in March, have their doubts, and question whether the book has the makings of a best seller.
Was Mr. Smith, a midlevel derivatives salesman who failed to become a managing director and had no one reporting to him, privy to Goldman's inner workings? Does he have access to the firm's previously untold secrets?
While Mr. Smith's opinion article became rich fodder for critics of Wall Street banks and the reckless lending and business practices that led to the global financial crisis, it was largely devoid of specific details. Whether the 288-page book fills in the blanks remains an open question.
Grand Central will distribute the book with the secrecy of a Bob Woodward publication, with bookstores told not to display any copies until its release. Adding to the suspense around the book's publication date, Mr. Smith has not done any interviews or media appearances since the article was published.
People familiar with the contents of Mr. Smith's book say that while it shines an unsavory spotlight on the ways of Wall Street, it is not just a finger-wagging polemic.
Instead, much of the memoir details the whole of Mr. Smith's career at Goldman Sachs, from when he joined the firm during the frothy dot-com boom to the grim days of the financial crisis.
A summary of the book on Amazon hints at some of the book's details: "From the shenanigans of his summer internship during the technology bubble to Las Vegas hot tubs and the excesses of the real estate boom; from the career lifeline he received from an N.F.L. Hall of Famer during the bear market to the day Warren Buffett came to save Goldman Sachs from extinction, Smith will take the reader on his personal journey through the firm, and bring us inside the world's most powerful bank."
Grand Central considers the book a potential successor to "Liar's Poker," Michael Lewis's firsthand account of the freewheeling antics of Salomon Brothers' bond-trading desk during the 1980s.
Other Wall Street memoirs - including "F.I.A.S.C.O." by Frank Partnoy, a former Morgan Stanley salesman, and Lawrence G. McDonald's "A Colossal Failure of Common Sense," a tale about Lehman Brothers - have not sold nearly as well as "Liar's Poker," which has sold more than two million copies.
Mr. Smith turned his book around quickly, eschewing a ghostwriter and writing his own first draft.
He did get some assistance from a professional writer, who provided advice and helped him polish the manuscript, said Jimmy Franco, a spokesman for Grand Central. The book's editor is John Brodie, a former journalist and editor at Fortune magazine.
Once the book is released, the 33-year-old Mr. Smith, a South African native who lives in New York, is expected to do television and radio interviews, though no specific appearances have been announced. He has no plans for a traditional book tour with signings and readings.
One possible television spot would be on "The Colbert Report." In March, Stephen Colbert, the show's host, mocked Mr. Smith for including in his article that he had won a bronze medal in table tennis at the Maccabiah Games in Israel.
Joked Mr. Colbert: "Way to reinforce the stereotype that Ping-Pong players control the banking industry."

HEADLINE: In Arkansas, the Lost Art of Splitting Tickets

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Democratic losses in the state have mostly been limited to presidential elections, but that is likely to change. 

 BODY:
The high point of last week's Democratic National Convention was, by most accounts, the energetic address given by Bill Clinton, the former two-term president and governor of Arkansas. Mr. Clinton can still deliver a rousing speech, but the electoral landscape has changed considerably since he was last on the ballot, perhaps nowhere more so than in his home state. 
In the 12 years since Mr. Clinton's run for re-election in 1996 to President Obama's run for office in 2008, Arkansas has experienced the largest drop in Democratic support -- a whopping 37 percentage points. Part of that is explained by Arkansas being Mr. Clinton's home state. Race may have also played a role, and perhaps some of the decline stems from hometown unhappiness that Mr. Obama had ousted the former first lady of Arkansas, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the Democratic primaries.
But much of Arkansas's change of heart is explained by the same trend evident in other Southern states: the exodus of Southern whites from the Democratic Party, particularly working-class whites in rural areas.
This exodus has been extensive in Arkansas, one of the most rural, most religious, least-educated and poorest states in the nation.
But there is a catch: Democratic losses have so far mostly been limited to presidential elections. While other Southern states have gone from Democratic to Republican control, Arkansas remains one of the few states -- West Virginia is another -- where voters still split tickets. And Democrats still control the governor's mansion, the State Senate and the state House of Representatives. 
For years, analysts have predicted that the state's Republican-preferences at the presidential level would trickle into state-level races. But Arkansas is a small state where years of one-party rule trained people to focus on personality, Mr. Barth said. And personality has helped the Democrats keep the Republican tide from rolling in.
A series of immensely popular Democratic politicians -- Mr. Clinton, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor -- helped to delay a Republican takeover of the state, both Ms. Parry and Mr. Barth said.
But it may finally be getting less palatable to many Arkansas voters. The Republicans made significant gains in 2010, cutting the Democratic advantage in the Senate from 19 seats to 5, and in the House, from 44 seats to 11.
Arkansas's political geography is hard to sort out because voter preferences are so dependent on the particular contest. For example, Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, won 66 of Arkansas's 75 counties in the presidential election. But the same year, the Senator Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, won all 75 counties in his re-election bid. In 2010, Republicans made gains nationally and in Arkansas where Senator Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat, was beaten handily in her bid for re-election, but Mike Beebe, Arkansas's Democratic governor, swept every county in the state.
In presidential elections, most Democratic voters in Arkansas are found in Little Rock. The state capital is more than 40 percent African-American and is home to well-off, well-educated white voters, Ms. Parry said. The other consistent source of Democratic presidential votes is the Arkansas Delta, a string of rural, predominately African-American counties in the east running along the Mississippi River. These counties, however, have been losing population.
Northwest Arkansas (excluding the liberal university town of Fayetteville) is the most heavily Republican region in the state. The northwest -- particularly Benton and Washington counties -- has emerged to rival the Little Rock area as the economic engine of the state. Giant companies like Walmart, Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt are headquartered in the area and have helped fuel the northwest's booming economy.
Those jobs have attracted business-oriented, anti-tax conservatives, Mr. Barth said. Those newcomers, along with an influx of retirees, have joined social conservatives already in the area. 
In addition to the northwest, the ring of suburbs around Little Rock -- in Faulkner, White, Saline and Lonoke counties -- is also overwhelmingly conservative. And both the suburbs in Central Arkansas along with Washington and Benton counties in the northwest have been fast-growing regions, pushing the state toward the Republican Party.
The rest of Arkansas is rural, overwhelmingly white and culturally conservative. But these counties are also relatively poor and "are more progressive on economic issues," Mr. Barth said. Given the right candidate, they will still vote Democratic in state-level races.
The Bellwether: Garland County
Hot Springs in Garland County, where Mr. Clinton grew up, has been a close barometer of the statewide vote in the last three presidential elections. Many of the state's characteristics are evident in Garland County. It has a substantial African-American population, although not as high as Little Rock and the delta. And Hot Springs has attracted retirees, just like the northwest. Garland County is not a perfect microcosm of the state, Mr. Barth said, but it is close.
The Bottom Line
Mr. Romney is a 100 percent favorite in Arkansas, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. And for the foreseeable future, Republican presidential candidates will likely be able to count on carrying the state.
The bigger question is how long Arkansas's split personality -- Republican for president, largely Democratic at the state-level -- can hold. Mr. Beebe, a Democrat, is still popular in the state, but "the conventional wisdom in Arkansas is that there aren't that many Beebe's left," Ms. Parry said. 
"The tide is clearly in one direction," Mr. Barth added.
There may still be enough residual affinity for the Democratic Party in Arkansas that if the right presidential candidate came along at the right time, the state could be in play (in 2008, Mrs. Clinton was polling ahead of Mr. McCain in Arkansas).
But in the near future, Mr. Barth said, Arkansas may have moved beyond the reach of any Democrat -- even a Clinton.

HEADLINE: Fuel for Debate: Examining the Natural Gas Fracking Controversy

BYLINE: ALISON FROMME, JENNIFER CUTRARO and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students will define hydrofracking, identify how demand for natural gas is changing and why this method is controversial, then map how natural gas development may impact a community. 

 BODY:
Overview | What is hydraulic fracturing? Why is it so controversial? In this lesson, students will define hydrofracking, identify how the demand for natural gas is changing, then research and map how natural gas development may impact a community.
Materials | Projection equipment, computers with Internet access, and a large map. (If gas drilling is a reality or possibility in your region, use a map of your county; if not, you might want to create a fictional map.) 
Warm-Up | Before students arrive, write the words "natural gas" and "hydrofracking" in the center of the classroom board, circling both terms. When students enter, have them work in small groups to brainstorm everything they know, think they know, or may have heard about both, taking notes. They may supply one-word reactions, facts, personal experience,or anything else that is relevant. Next, invite groups to report what they discussed, and write their contributions on the board.
Explain -- if students have not -- that natural gas is a fossil fuel burned for energy. Ask students if they know what fuel is used to heat their homes, their bathwater and the food on their stoves. If needed, you might briefly discuss how natural gas was formed, where it is found, or how it gets from under the ground and into homes.
If students have not defined hydrofracking, you might offer the Times Topics page definition: "A drilling method called hydraulic fracturing, better known as hydrofracking or fracking, in which large amounts of sand, water and chemicals are injected deep underground at high pressures." Ask: Why do you think this method is controversial? 
Next, show students this Associated Press video, "Communities Divided Over Natural Gas Drilling." As they watch, assign half the class to take notes on what those who are pro-fracking say in the video, while the other half of the class takes notes on what those who are against it say. Share these notes when the video is over.
Finally, tell students that they will read a Times overview about growing demand for and controversy surrounding natural gas and look at a graphic that explores the process. 
Related | The overview on the Times Topics page Natural Gas (Fracking) explains the demand for natural gas and criticisms of the hydrofracturing process sometimes used to extract it, while the Times interactive, Extracting Natural Gas From Rock, shows the hydraulic fracturing process in action.
From the overview:
 Natural gas, the first cousin to crude oil, is a combustible fossil fuel often found in underground reservoirs and comprised of methane and other hydrocarbon compounds.
A century ago, natural gas was considered a waste product in oil fields and flared or vented off. But after a giant gas field was found in the Panhandle in 1918, it was used to manufacture carbon black, which is used to make car tires. Eventually, Americans began using gas to heat their homes and, later, to fire power plants. But it never became as important a fuel as coal, oil or even nuclear power.
A combination of circumstances have drawn new attention to natural gas.
Background Vocabulary: You may wish to introduce students to the following words or concepts before reading: , , , .
Read the entire article with your class, then look at the graphic and answer the questions below. 
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
What is natural gas? What is it used for?
        
What is the process of hydraulic fracturing? Try explaining it to the person sitting next to you.
        
What are some criticisms of hydraulic fracturing? What hazards does the graphic show?
        
What benefits are cited by proponents of the process?
        
How is global demand for natural gas changing?
Activity | Natural gas extraction has far-reaching effects on rural communities. In this activity, students will annotate a community map to illustrate those effects. 
Before students arrive, obtain or create a large map of a rural county. If hydraulic fracturing is a reality or possibility in your region, you might use a map, or section of a map, of your own county. Alternatively, you could create a schematic of a fictional town. Highlight major features on the map, like roads, neighborhoods, forests, lakes, rivers, farms, stores, schools, firehouses, the police department, wastewater treatment plant and other features. You might want to use a large whiteboard or a classroom wall to display the map.
Show students the map and ask for their first ideas about how hydraulic fracturing might change different aspects of the community. Then divide the class into groups and assign each to research one of the following features in greater depth. Each group should prepare a brief presentation about how that feature might change with gas development. Following each presentation, the class can collaborate to make changes to the original map to reflect what the community can expect to see when hydraulic fracturing arrives.
Please note: We have linked below to resources, both within and outside The Times, that can help students go deeper into each of these categories. Any of them can, of course, be swapped out for alternatives. The Times Topics page on natural gas collects everything published in The Times about this topic, including opinion pieces, graphics and video.
Economy: Students in this group should identify the economic opportunities, including job creation, and challenges that arise with hydrofracking, including housing concerns. Students should also consider broad impacts on local businesses and town services.
Land: Students in this group should explain the amount of land required for natural gas development, including pipelines. They should be able to illustrate how gas extraction might change the use of land and roads in the community. They should also explore whether or not local governments can regulate hydrofracking, in their towns.
Water: Students in this group should describe the amount of water required for hydraulic fracturing, where the water comes from, and how the volume compares to other uses. This group should also be able to explain protections against drinking water contamination, and examples of possible contamination in Wyoming and Pennsylvania.
Waste: Students in this group should explain the types of waste produced by hydrofracking, including radioactive material, what processes produce the waste, what happens to it, and how it can be recycled. Additionally, students should explain the requirements for disclosing the chemicals used in fracking.
Air: Students in this group should address how natural gas development influences air quality (PDF), including greenhouse gas emissions and health problems. Students should also explain federal emissions regulations.
When students have finished their presentations, have the class annotate the map with effects of natural gas development. Then lead a wrap-up discussion that turns back to the original questions: What is hydraulic fracturing and why is it so controversial? 
Going Further
Debate: Students host a debate about whether hydrofracking should be allowed in their community. Students might form four groups and follow the debate of the masses format, where each student in the class either presents or rebuts an argument.
Compare Emissions: Have students create a model, perhaps using cotton balls, to compare the greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas and coal. Then, ask students to evaluate the claim that natural gas leakage adds even more powerful greenhouse gases into the environment. 
Examine Messages: Now that students understand more about fracking, have them look critically at the various messages produced by different groups for and against the method. For instance, they might view videos like this advertisement supporting natural gas hydrofracking and this music video opposing it. Who might have made these videos? What viewpoints are they illustrating? What techniques are they using to get their position across? How accurate is the information?

HEADLINE: Despite Libyan Crisis, Obama Campaign Plans to Stay on Schedule

BYLINE: JIM RUTENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's aides indicated he would have reconsidered his trip had the violence in Libya and Egypt spilled into a second day in a major way, but follow-up protests were relatively modest. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS - President Obama may be consumed with an international crisis, but the campaign goes on as planned, at least at this point. The president is still scheduled to start a Western campaign swing Wednesday night, with a rally here in Las Vegas and another in Colorado on Thursday.
Mr. Obama's aides indicated that he would have reconsidered his trip had the violence in Libya and Egypt spilled into a second day in a major way. But with any follow-up protests remaining relatively modest, the president will monitor events from Air Force One as he makes his way here, aides said.
Mr. Obama and his team have learned from experience that the political costs of campaigning amid crises can be minimal. It was almost exactly four years ago when Senator John McCainsuspended his campaign at the height of the financial crisis to help shape the bank bailout, and called upon then-Senator Obama to join him by postponing their first debate. 
Mr. Obama declined, saying he could have input from the road, but "it is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once.'' And Congressional Democrats accused Mr. McCain of engaging in a political stunt that threatened to disrupt their negotiations. The debate went on as planned.
Leaving the White House in the aftermath of a crisis may be still less politically risky in this case, given that Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, injected the crisis into campaign terms by immediately criticizing the administration's handling of it. Mr. Obama has yet to directly respond to him.
His next opportunity to do so will come when he speaks here at around 8:30 p.m. Eastern.
Even as Mr. Obama's campaign was processing the developments in Benghazi, Libya, it was also moving ahead early Wednesday with the release of a new advertisementattacking Mr. Romney on taxes. Running here in Nevada, in Iowa, in Virginia and in Ohio, the ad accuses Mr. Romney of having a secret plan that would slash taxes for millionaires and raise them for the middle class. 
The Romney campaign says that he has no such plans to do so and that studies that have come to similar conclusions have been based on flawed assumptions on specifics Mr. Romney has yet to give, as Annie Lowrey and David Kocieniewski of the The Times reported this week.

HEADLINE: Elizabeth Warren Softens Her Image in New Ad

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats in Massachusetts have expressed concern that her ads have been too generic and not grounded enough in the lives of Massachusetts voters. 

 BODY:
Elizabeth Warren's campaign released a new television commercial on Wednesday, just as some of her supporters have expressed unhappiness with her ad campaign.
The new ad partially addresses concerns that top Massachusetts Democrats, including former Gov. Michael Dukakis, have raised. The Boston Globe reported Wednesday that her campaign is under pressure to change the ads to soften her image and focus more on Senator Scott P. Brown, her Republican opponent.
The concerns are that her ads have been too generic and not grounded enough in Massachusetts, and that the issues she raises in them, like the gross domestic product of China, have not been relevant to voters' lives. There have also been worries that Ms. Warren comes across as a scold when she speaks directly into the camera, while Mr. Brown's ads show him driving around in his truck, appearing folksy and down-to-earth.
Ms. Warren has been critical of Mr. Brown for what she views as his tendency to avoid the issues.
But in this newest ad, she is shown in a decidedly softer light. She does not speak into the camera and she does not discuss issues. Instead, ordinary people testify on her behalf that she is fighting for those who find "the system rigged against them." As they speak, soft music rises and the screen fills with images of a smiling Ms. Warren greeting voters, hugging them, listening to them and holding their hands.
The ad could have been shot anywhere, until you hear the distinct Boston accents of the people speaking on her behalf.
"Elizabeth Warren is on the people's side," says one woman.
"I think she's someone who will actually stick up for the middle class," says a man.
The ad does not mention Mr. Brown. So far, both candidates have kept their ads positive and upbeat, and in that sense, this one is no different.

HEADLINE: Clinton Sticks to Domestic Issues While Campaigning for Obama

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: On a day when foreign news dominated the headlines, Bill Clinton talked to Florida voters about the U.S. economy and the health care law. 

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- On a rare day when both parties were focused on foreign affairs after the explosion of anti-American tumult in North Africa, former President Bill Clinton stuck to domestic issues of the economy and middle-class struggles on Wednesday as he continued his roadshow to re-elect President Obama.
 "I plead with you," Mr. Clinton told an estimated 2,000 people who packed a hotel ballroom in this presidential battleground state, "get out there and talk to people - for shared prosperity over trickle down, for 'we're all in this together' over 'you're on your own,' for cooperation over conflict and for arithmetic over illusion." 
 As applause and cheers built, Mr. Clinton added, "You need to re-elect President Barack Obama to do the job."
 Hundreds of people were in line more than four hours before Mr. Clinton took the stage in the early evening, and ultimately Obama campaign aides got the hotel to open the room's wall dividers to create more space.
 While several attendees said they had come to see a repeat of Mr. Clinton's entertaining performance last week at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., he gave a more meandering pep talk that was heavier with talk of his own philosophy and record as president and now as head of his own global foundation than it was with testimonials for Mr. Obama
 And to the surprise of some reporters following Mr. Clinton's postconvention stumping, he said nothing about the violence in Egypt and Libya, on the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, that killed the American ambassador and three other diplomats in Libya. The violence provoked a crisis for the Obama administration, including Mr. Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and roiled the presidential contest as Mitt Romney quickly attacked the administration for its reaction and was criticized in turn for recklessly playing politics, including by some Republicans. 
 Instead, much as he had on Tuesday in Miami before 2,300 people, Mr. Clinton defended and promoted Mr. Obama's health care law, his initiatives to make college more affordable and his response to the economic crisis that Mr. Obama inherited in 2009 despite what Mr. Clinton characterized as constant obstructions from Republicans.
 "Richard Nixon's too liberal for these people," Mr. Clinton said to laughter and applause.
For those who had not heard his Charlotte address, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to repeat one message about the recession and continuing economic problems "because the whole election could come down to this."
"It is my opinion," he said, "that no president, not Barack Obama, not Bill Clinton, not anybody who served before us, nobody who ever had this job could have repaired that much damage to this economy in just three years."
 And citing the importance of Medicare to the many retirees in Florida, Mr. Clinton also took issue with Republicans' claims that Mr. Obama had cut benefits to people in the private Medicare Advantage program to pay for the health care law. 
A record number of insurance companies and beneficiaries are now participating in the program and the cost of premiums is down, Mr. Clinton said. "So if the president was trying to wreck Medicare Advantage, he did a poor job of it because it's in the best shape it's ever been in."
He assailed Mr. Romney's proposal for $5 trillion in additional income-tax cuts over the coming decade, saying, "I was always taught that when you're in a hole, the first rule is to quit digging."
To offset the cost of their tax cuts, Mr. Clinton said Republicans would cut tax breaks benefiting the middle class and spending for education and Medicaid. "Or they can do what they used to do," he said, which is to cut taxes "and then forget about cutting spending and let the debt balloon."
 The Obama campaign is still working with Mr. Clinton to schedule additional campaign appearances and at least one more fund-raiser. One campaign official said the former president could be sent anywhere and appeal to both Democrats and independents. The campaign has also spent heavily to run an advertisement featuring Mr. Clinton in a number of battleground states.

Mitt Romney delivered a speech to members of the National Guard in Nevada on Tuesday, trying to move the discussion of his military and foreign policy credentials beyond the critiques of his convention speech and toward the threat of automatic cuts to the Pentagon budget, Ashley Parker reports.

        
For the first time since the inception of public campaign financing, the presidential candidates of both the Republican and Democratic Parties are declining the funds and betting that they can raise far more money on their own, Nicholas Confessore and Ashley Parker found. The result: wooing fund-raisers cuts into the time for wooing voters.

        
Former President Bill Clinton continued his Obama surrogacy tour in Miami on Tuesday, lavishing special attention on two issues with appeal in a state with many students and older voters: education loans and health care, Mark Landler writes.

        
Though Moody's Investor Service warned that it would downgrade the federal government's debt if there was no solution to the "fiscal cliff," Congressional leaders are refusing to make any quick deals toward resolving the looming disaster, Jonathan Weisman reports.

HEADLINE: New Data Suggests Slightly Stronger Growth in 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Wholesale inventories in July rose by the most in five months, exceeding forecasts and suggesting economic growth started the third quarter on slightly better footing than expected. 
A separate report on Wednesday showed import prices rose in August as the cost of imported oil jumped, a factor that could weigh on American consumers and temporarily increase inflation.
Wholesale inventories climbed 0.7 percent in July to $485.2 billion, the Commerce Department said. Sales unexpectedly fell, dropping 0.1 percent.
Inventories are a crucial element in the government's measure of changes in gross domestic product. Weaker growth in inventories dragged on the economy during the second quarter, when the economy expanded at a 1.7 percent annual rate.
July's gain in inventories was enough for some economists to raise forecasts slightly for third- quarter G.D.P., although others said the drop in sales negated the boost.
''It just shifts the balance of growth from sales to inventories,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.
Economic growth has been slow since the 2007-9 recession and too weak to push the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The sluggish economy has fed expectations that the Federal Reserve could try to lower borrowing costs by announcing a bond buying program as soon as Thursday.
In July, automobile inventories rose 0.4 percent and computer equipment stocks jumped 3.8 percent, while metals fell 0.7 percent.
Before the inventory data was published, economists were expecting G.D.P. growth in the third quarter to match the second quarter's lackluster pace, according to a Reuters poll.
With the data in hand, Barclays raised its estimate for third quarter growth by two tenths of a point to a 2.2 percent rate. Macroeconomic Advisers lifted its forecast by a tenth to 1.4 percent.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said American import prices rose in August for the first time in five months, climbing 0.7 percent.
The cost of petroleum imports increased 4.1 percent. Higher prices at the pump threaten to hurt consumers' pocket books. Analysts had expected overall import prices would rise 1.4 percent in August.
Many economists expect higher fuel costs will contribute to a short-term rise in inflation that could be seen in a report expected to be Friday on consumer prices.
''Significant energy price gains are likely to be a feature,'' said the Barclays economist Peter Newland.
There was little sign of broader inflation pressures in the import data. Nonpetroleum import prices declined 0.2 percent, a sign that the cooling global economy is reducing companies' ability to raise prices.
Prices for imported consumer goods outside automobiles fell 0.3 percent, while prices were flat for cars and auto parts brought into the country.
Import prices were flat from Japan and China, both major trading partners. Import prices from the European Union fell 0.4 percent.
The report also showed that export prices rose 0.9 percent last month. Analysts had expected export prices to rise 0.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Book by Former Banker Promises Peek Inside Goldman Sachs

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Wall Street has plenty of worries heading into autumn: the stability of the euro zone, persistent United States unemployment and the historically volatile October stock market.
Goldman Sachs has an additional concern: Greg Smith's book.
Mr. Smith's memoir, "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," is set for publication on Oct. 22. The release date comes just seven months after Mr. Smith publicly resigned from the bank with an Op-Ed page article in The New York Times that detailed his disappointment with Goldman's business practices that reflected, more broadly, a corrosive culture at the nation's largest banks.
The article struck a nerve. Within 24 hours, it had more than three million views online. Publishers clamored for the rights to a book. Grand Central Publishing, a division of the Hachette Book Group, secured a deal, offering Mr. Smith an advance of close to $1.5 million, according to people with direct knowledge of the negotiations.
His book comes at an inopportune moment for Goldman, which has largely disappeared from the spotlight after a wave of negative publicity damaged the bank's reputation. 
In addition, it paid $550 million to settle a civil case brought by the government over a subprime mortgage product that it sold to clients. An insider trading scandal ensnared the firm, with a member of its board facing prison time and at least two other executives under investigation.
And its depiction as a blood sucking "vampire squid" in a Rolling Stone article captured the public's imagination, helping to make Goldman a symbol of Wall Street's dark side.
But in recent months, Goldman has steered clear of the negative finance coverage dominating the headlines, most notably the huge trading losses at JPMorgan Chase and the growing scandal involving certain banks' manipulation of interest rates.
"Why I Left Goldman Sachs" promises to be a tell-all of Mr. Smith's 12-year career at the bank. His opinion article in The Times described Goldman as a once-vaunted institution that had lost its way. He wrote that when he first joined the bank as an intern in the summer of 2000, it obsessively put its clients' interests first.
But over time, Mr. Smith said, Goldman devolved into a "toxic and destructive" culture that put profit before principle. His former colleagues mocked their clients, he said, derisively referring to them as "muppets."
"I truly believe that this decline in the firm's moral fiber represents the single most serious threat to its long-run survival," Mr. Smith wrote. "It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their clients off."
Not everyone embraced Mr. Smith's article. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York dismissed the piece as "ridiculous," calling it nothing more than a nasty letter from a disgruntled employee. It also spawned numerous parodies on the Internet, including "Why I Am Leaving the Empire," by Darth Vader.
David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, minimized the significance of the book. "Every day, some young professional, after a decade in a postcollegiate job, reassesses his or her career and decides to move on and do something else," he said in an e-mailed statement. "Others can better judge whether Mr. Smith's particular career transition is of unique interest."
Grand Central has planned a robust print run of 150,000 copies in hardcover and expects to sell a sizable number of copies in e-book format.
"Many people on Main Street distrust Wall Street right now, yet few can put their finger on why," Jamie Raab, publisher of Grand Central, said in a statement. "Greg Smith's candid account of his years at Goldman Sachs does just that."
A big selling point of Mr. Smith's book is that it is about Goldman, which has long been a subject of fascination because of its immense profits and political connections. Also, within the hushed confines of the bank, a code of silence has always prevailed, so an insider's account is especially tantalizing.
Several nonfiction releases about Goldman have had some success, most recently the best seller "Money and Power" by William D. Cohan, but the bank has never been the focus of a tell-all.
Yet many in the publishing industry, including several people who met with Mr. Smith in March, have their doubts, and question whether the book has the makings of a best seller.
Was Mr. Smith, a midlevel derivatives salesman who failed to become a managing director and had no one reporting to him, privy to Goldman's inner workings? Does he have access to the firm's previously untold secrets?
While Mr. Smith's opinion article became rich fodder for critics of Wall Street banks and the reckless lending and business practices that led to the global financial crisis, it was largely devoid of specific details. Whether the 288-page book fills in the blanks remains an open question.
Grand Central will distribute the book with the secrecy of a Bob Woodward publication, with bookstores told not to display any copies until its release. Adding to the suspense around the book's publication date, Mr. Smith has not done any interviews or media appearances since the article was published.
People familiar with the contents of Mr. Smith's book say that while it shines an unsavory spotlight on the ways of Wall Street, it is not just a finger-wagging polemic.
Instead, much of the memoir details the whole of Mr. Smith's career at Goldman Sachs, from when he joined the firm during the frothy dot-com boom to the grim days of the financial crisis.
A summary of the book on Amazon hints at some of the book's details: "From the shenanigans of his summer internship during the technology bubble to Las Vegas hot tubs and the excesses of the real estate boom; from the career lifeline he received from an N.F.L. Hall of Famer during the bear market to the day Warren Buffett came to save Goldman Sachs from extinction, Smith will take the reader on his personal journey through the firm, and bring us inside the world's most powerful bank."
Grand Central considers the book a potential successor to "Liar's Poker," Michael Lewis's firsthand account of the freewheeling antics of Salomon Brothers' bond-trading desk during the 1980s.
Other Wall Street memoirs - including "F.I.A.S.C.O." by Frank Partnoy, a former Morgan Stanley salesman, and Lawrence G. McDonald's "A Colossal Failure of Common Sense," a tale about Lehman Brothers - have not sold nearly as well as "Liar's Poker," which has sold more than two million copies.
Mr. Smith turned his book around quickly, eschewing a ghostwriter and writing his own first draft.
He did get some assistance from a professional writer, who provided advice and helped him polish the manuscript, said Jimmy Franco, a spokesman for Grand Central. The book's editor is John Brodie, a former journalist and editor at Fortune magazine.
Once the book is released, the 33-year-old Mr. Smith, a South African native who lives in New York, is expected to do television and radio interviews, though no specific appearances have been announced. He has no plans for a traditional book tour with signings and readings.
One possible television spot would be on "The Colbert Report." In March, Stephen Colbert, the show's host, mocked Mr. Smith for including in his article that he had won a bronze medal in table tennis at the Maccabiah Games in Israel.
Joked Mr. Colbert: "Way to reinforce the stereotype that Ping-Pong players control the banking industry."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Harvesting A Climate Disaster

BYLINE: By MARK HERTSGAARD. 
Mark Hertsgaard, a fellow of the New America Foundation, is the author, most recently, of ''Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth.''

 BODY:
San Francisco
FARMERS went to Washington yesterday. Members of a coalition representing more than 80 agricultural organizations rallied on Capitol Hill to demand passage of a new farm bill that has been stalled in Congress.
The Democratic-led Senate has already passed its version of the bill; the Republican-controlled House is squabbling over a competing approach (one that sharply cuts food aid to the poor). Irate farmers want both sides to shut up and pass something that can replace the current farm bill, which expires on Sept. 30.
All of the parties, though, are focused on the wrong thing. 
The farm bill is not only the centerpiece of United States food and agriculture policy, it is also a de facto climate bill. And in this respect, both the Senate and House versions of the legislation are a disaster waiting to happen.
Consider, for a moment, the summer of 2012. For an agricultural superpower like the United States, it should have set off alarm bells. The hottest July on record and the worst drought in 50 years -- both driven partly by global warming, scientists say -- have parched soil and withered crops across the Farm Belt. Yet America's lawmakers aren't even remotely addressing the issue in a piece of legislation that will affect the climate profoundly for years to come.
The proposed farm bill -- Senate- or House-style, take your pick -- would make American agriculture's climate problem worse, in two ways. Not only would the bill accelerate global warming by encouraging more greenhouse gas emissions, it would make the nation's farms more vulnerable to the impacts of those emissions.
Indeed, instead of helping farmers take common-sense measures to limit their land's vulnerability to extreme weather, the legislation would simply spend billions more on crop insurance -- sticking taxpayers with the bill. ''It's like giving a homeowner cut-rate fire insurance but not requiring fire extinguishers,'' Jim Kleinschmit of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy told me in an interview.
Except in a technical aside, neither the bill passed by the Senate or by the House Committee on Agriculture even mentions climate change.
Coal and cars are blamed, but agriculture is also a major contributor to global warming: by some estimates, it accounts for roughly a third of emissions globally. The industrialized, meat-heavy food system of the United States takes a heavy toll on the atmosphere; it takes an enormous amount of fossil fuel to run farm equipment and harvest the mountains of corn that fatten livestock. And most fertilizers contain nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 298 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a century.
Both of the farm bill proposals would maintain agriculture's large climate footprint, mainly by continuing to skew subsidies toward a mere handful of commodity crops. The ''big five'' -- wheat, rice, soybeans, cotton and above all corn -- have received 84 percent of subsidies since 2004, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group critical of the practice. Subsidies increase with output, encouraging farmers to run highly mechanized operations that plant ''fence row to fence row'' and apply oceans of fertilizer and pesticide, all of which boost emissions.
But industrial agriculture's ability to produce gargantuan amounts of food also makes it exceptionally susceptible to climate change. Relying on vast monocultures -- the miles and miles of cornfields one passes when driving in Iowa -- captures economies of scale. But that lack of diversity invites trouble. A monoculture's uniformity means that if temperatures spike or a new pest arrives, the damage is likely to spread throughout the entire planted area. By contrast, the diversified landscapes of organic agriculture -- corn planted between, say, other vegetables and chicken pens -- tend to limit damage.
Farmers can best boost resilience to climate change, scientists say, by improving their soil's fertility and capacity to retain moisture. That means cutting back on chemical fertilizers, which kill many of the microorganisms that ventilate soil, and shifting to compost and manure fertilizers and crop rotations.
Instead, leading lobbyists for agribusiness want to retain the current production system but shift the mounting climate risks to the taxpayer. Both versions of the farm bill would expand the $11 billion crop insurance program, a move championed by the National Corn Growers Association. The Senate bill, for instance, would authorize $3.8 billion a year for additional insurance.
But neither version would require farmers to take other measures to reduce their climate vulnerability, like investing in healthier soil. In fact, the draft bills would actually make it harder for farmers to do that because the expanded crop insurance would be paid for by cutting the Conservation Stewardship Program, which helps farmers improve their land's ecological health.
Shifting federal policy from a longstanding emphasis on industrial agriculture to more organic approaches is too large a task to complete by Sept. 30. But Congress could pass a one-year extension of the old bill and direct the Department of Agriculture to use the extra time to develop, with farmers and other stakeholders, a plan to segue to climate-smart agriculture as soon as possible. As the summer of 2012 has reminded us, this agricultural superpower has already waited too long to take climate change seriously.

HEADLINE: Wealthy Afghans Snapping Up Properties in Dubai

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
DUBAI -- Not long ago, Mohammed Daoud was making good money hiring out halls for wedding parties thrown by a new class of Afghan war entrepreneurs. Now he is using some of the profits to buy a $160,000 apartment nestled amid the skyscrapers and shopping malls of Dubai.
Mr. Daoud sees his 27th floor apartment as both a good investment and an insurance policy against the darkest scenarios he can envision for his homeland when the bulk of foreign forces leave.
''Nobody knows what's going to happen after 2014,'' he said in an interview in Kabul. ''If something happens with the security situation here, I can take my family. We feel safe in Dubai.'' 
Wealthy Afghans have sharply increased the pace of investment in property in the Gulf emirate, motivated by a mix of commercial calculations and security fears brought on by the withdrawal of international troops.
Afghan buyers spent 220 million dirhams, or $60 million, on property in Dubai in the first six months of this year, a 27 percent increase compared with the same period in 2011, according to Dubai government data. Some Afghans are spending up to 20 million dirhams on shopping sprees for multiple villas while many are buying million-dollar homes with cash, brokers say.
The rate of the Afghan blitz outpaced a 21 percent increase in total purchases of Dubai property by both local and foreign investors in the same period. A steep decline in prices in the emirate's once white-hot property market has increased their interest.
The trend presents a fresh challenge to Western allies struggling to convince an uneasy Afghan population that the transition will not be a prelude to international abandonment or an escalation of fighting with the Taliban.
Haji Obaidullah Sader Khail, chairman of the Afghan Business Council-Dubai, said the true scale of Afghan investment could be four times higher than the data suggest because many transactions may not have been registered. ''I know people who have bought 15 to 20 villas,'' he said.
According to the official figures, the number of properties Afghans bought in Dubai jumped to 114 in the first half compared with 76 in the same period in 2011.
Reports from real estate agents that Afghans routinely buy luxury homes with cash will do little to ease concerns that some of the billions of dollars the United States and its allies spend to bankroll the government and security forces is seeping abroad.
''Purchases by Afghans have gone up for sure. With the U.S. pulling out of Afghanistan a feeling of insecurity is setting in,'' said Parvees A. Gafur, chief executive of Propsquare Real Estate in Dubai. ''They want to invest before it's too late.''
The flood of cash exports from Kabul has stoked fears that entrenched graft and persistent capital flight from Afghanistan will make it harder to put a booming but fragile war economy on a more sustainable path.
Afghanistan's power elite has long cherished second, third or fourth homes in Dubai as footholds in a land of designer boutiques and safe districts only a three-hour flight from Kabul. Since the United States ousted the Taliban in 2001, lucrative and often badly supervised contracting opportunities offered by NATO forces or civilian agencies have nurtured a new breed of oligarchs who boast ever more ostentatious addresses.
With international forces scaling back, the rapid growth of the past decade is likely to slow. ''Spending from the U.S. and international community is going to decrease,'' said Ajmal Saifi, managing director of Prestige Real Estate in Dubai. Prestige is part of an Afghan family-run conglomerate that includes construction and retail interests in Afghanistan.
Uncertainty about who will replace President Hamid Karzai, who is expected to step down in 2014, has compounded investor anxieties in a patronage-driven economy where fortunes are won or lost as the political landscape shifts.
Under pressure from aid donors, Mr. Karzai has ordered ministries to take steps to fight corruption and told the Supreme Court to accelerate investigations into longstanding graft cases. Although few believe his call will have much impact, the announcements have caused jitters among Afghan plutocrats.
''The traders are like birds, always looking for greener and more suitable places. But now they are flying from Afghanistan,'' said Khan Jan Alokozai, one of Afghanistan's most prominent traders and deputy chairman of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Industries. ''They all fear that if the government starts to crack down on corruption, they will lose all they have earned. So it's a good time to take out as much as they can.''
The more uncertainty at home, the greater the incentive for Afghans to park their money abroad. Buyers jetting in from Kabul are mainly purchasing residential apartments worth between 3 million and 4 million dirhams, according to Mr. Gafur, the property dealer.
Some have found their dream home in the Palm Jumeirah, a frond-shaped development of luxury seafront villas whose vista of passing yachts is in stark contrast with the panorama of tawny hills that encircles Kabul.
Others have sought refuges in up-market developments with names like Emirates Living and Business Bay and in the needle-shaped Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building.
The central bank says it recorded $4.6 billion in declared dollar exports from Kabul airport last year, double the figure from the previous year. The authorities have taken steps to limit the amount of cash people take onto Dubai-bound aircraft, but it is difficult to measure their success.
While much of the money may represent the proceeds of currency trading or licit commerce in a cash-based economy, Afghan and Western officials believe a share is derived from government corruption, the theft of aid or heroin trafficking.
Security concerns have motivated many Afghan house-hunters to buy in Dubai, but some are primarily looking for bargains. Dubai real estate prices slumped by more than 60 percent from their peak in 2008 after the global economic crisis triggered a collapse in the emirate's property market. Prices have started to recover. The total value of real estate transactions in Dubai topped 63 billion dirhams in the first half of 2012. That was a 21 percent increase over the same period in the previous year. Of that, foreign investors paid 22 billion dirhams for 12,875 properties.
Back in Afghanistan, a sharp slowdown in the property market driven in part by doubts over the near term has encouraged investment in Dubai.
Haji Shir Shah Ahmadzai, managing director of a real estate company in Kabul, said property prices in Afghanistan fell 35 percent to 50 percent in the past year. ''The only people who are selling properties are people who need money fast,'' he said.
The propensity of rich Afghans to acquire assets in Dubai fell under the spotlight after a run at Kabul Bank, the country's biggest private lender, in 2010. Dubai villas account for about $160 million of $900 million in assets auditors are trying to recover from the collapsed bank, which extended unsecured loans to a roster of well-connected individuals, according to a former senior Afghan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In June, the Afghan government told the International Monetary Fund that it had managed to retrieve properties in Dubai worth an estimated $44 million.
Matthew Green reported from Kabul.

HEADLINE: Midlevel U.S. Chains Move Into Fast-Food Hungry Gulf

BYLINE: By SARA HAMDAN

 BODY:
DUBAI -- After twelve years of running two small, organic tea shops in the New York borough of Brooklyn, Jonathan Spiel had to close one down when his landlord increased the rent in 2009. Facing that setback, Mr. Spiel decided to look into selling Tea Lounge franchises to expand into new markets and keep his business going.
The Tea Lounge's first franchise opened this year, in Kuwait.
''When I and my family and friends first heard 'Kuwait,' it seemed a little out of the blue,'' Mr. Spiel, the Tea Lounge's founder, said. 
''There are limitations and we'll have to adapt our concept, but the key is that the ritual of socializing over tea and coffee for hours already exists there in people's homes,'' he said. ''We want to bring it into the cafe.''
Big name American brands have not been able to open franchises in the Middle East fast enough to satisfy demand in recent years. Fast-food concepts like KFC and Subway have been popular for years, but recent additions include IHOP, The Cheesecake Factory and Papa John's Pizza. These franchises have the backing of major family-run businesses, like the Al Shaya Group in Saudi Arabia.
The success of these well-known American names has encouraged midlevel brands, like Tea Lounge, to venture into the region in search of financing and some market share. And often, it is Arab businessmen that reach out to them.
When an Arizona-based employee of the Al Arbash Group, a private firm based in Kuwait, approached Mr. Spiel about the idea of expanding the Tea Lounge, the founder had not yet entertained the thought. But the interest from the Arbash group could not have come at a better time: With just one cafe on his hands, Mr. Spiel was eagerly looking for new avenues of growth.
''It's been difficult for small businesses to get loans for a while now in the U.S., and even when banks do give money, it's just not enough,'' he said. In the Gulf, he said, people ''will always have money, which is appealing.''
In December, Tea Lounge will open a new store in a mall in Kuwait. There will be the same 65 kinds of loose-leaf teas, 55 kinds of coffee and a variety of snacks on offer -- all organic.
Unlike the cafe in Brooklyn, the Tea Lounge in Kuwait will not serve alcohol or allow live bands to perform, out of respect for cultural traditions.
''We don't have nightclubs in Kuwait; when young people want to have fun they go to a coffee shop in the mall, so what we're doing is staying true to that and adding Tea Lounge's community touch,'' said Mohamed Al Arbash, the franchise owner of the Tea Lounge in Kuwait and an executive at the Arbash Group. ''Since we can't serve alcohol, for example, we target families more by offering children's story time or movies -- things like that.''
Still, these franchises will face challenges, like maintaining a brand identity while adapting to new cultures. With its following of local artists and a strong attachment to the local community, the Brooklyn version of the Tea Lounge will be very different from the Kuwait branch, despite keeping the same cafe layout and menu items.
It is even trickier for an inherently American concept, like Famous Dave's, a barbecue restaurant founded 15 years ago by Dave W. Anderson, an American Indian. Famous Dave's has grown into a public company with 133 branches across the United States and one in Canada.
The company's logo is a pig roasting ribs over a fire, highlighting one of its most popular dishes -- an item that is hardly acceptable in the Middle East, where eating pork is often taboo.
Yet Famous Dave's plans to open up to 30 stores in the Middle East and North Africa in the next few years as part of a global expansion, said Brett Larrabee, the company's director for franchise development.
The chain will start with two stores in Dubai before expanding further in the Middle East.
Mr. Larrabee has based his regional forecasts on an analysis of other U.S. casual dining companies that have successfully entered the market, as well as population and demographic figures. The chain's only franchise outside the United States currently is in Winnipeg, Canada. Famous Dave's is also looking at expanding into South America, China and Asia.
''When we go into these new areas, we want to meet local needs, so we're obviously not going to sell things to people that don't want them,'' Mr. Larrabee said. ''But the essence of our brand is in our barbecue flavor, which we can serve everywhere.''
Famous Dave's plans to tweak its menu to cater to local needs and find suppliers capable of providing Halal meat, which meets certain preparation guidelines and is acceptable under Islam's dietary requirements.
The halal concept is not foreign to Famous Dave's, Mr. Larrabee said. The restaurant receives similar food requests in the United States, namely in Detroit and New York.
Mr. Larrabee said that the chain was currently in talks with Mideast companies interested in opening a franchise, particularly in Dubai, as well as in other parts of the world.
''When one part of the world is challenged, another is prospering, and there's great opportunity for us in Dubai'' and the Gulf region, he said.
One mistake restaurant chains often make is to think of the Middle East as a homogeneous place, when, in fact, each country has its own legal framework and cultural norms.
This is what Wing Zone has learned after successfully entering Saudi Arabia last November. The company, an Atlanta-based restaurant chain that specializes in chicken wings, hopes to duplicate its U.S. success by opening branches in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The chain says it will need to treat each market uniquely.
Wing Zone was one of the first midlevel brands to enter the Middle East, according to Nick Powills, the chief executive of No Limit Media Consulting, which focuses on the franchising market.
''Lots of the big boys like McDonald's had mastered international franchising when the economy was good, but midlevel brands started doing this after the financial crisis, when they were looking for ways out of the burdened U.S. market,'' Mr. Powills said.
''Breaking into the Mideast is not the easiest thing,'' he continued, ''it's not like Wing Zone has brand awareness in Saudi.''
Wing Zone had not specifically targeted Saudi Arabia; the company was approached by Saudi businessmen when it was looking into expand globally.
The partners decided to expand in Jidda in November 2011 after seeing the potential of a growing market in the Middle East, a region in which chicken consumption is high.
Encouraged by the success of the Jidda outlet -- which made a profit after just one year in operation -- the company is embarking on an aggressive expansion program, planning to open an additional 50 franchises in the region in the next five years.
''From a financial standpoint, it doesn't make sense for us to have one store; we're aiming for 25 in Saudi alone,'' Matt Friedman, the chief executive of Wing Zone, said from Atlanta. ''Other markets on the radar are Kuwait, Jordan and Lebanon, but each country has its own rules so we start from the beginning again.''
It costs an average of $250,000 to open a franchise, while legal documents can cost up to $100,000, Mr. Powills said.
The Pita Pit, an American brand with 400 outlets globally, is now gearing up for its first foray into the Middle East, with two restaurants planned for Riyadh in 2013.
''International franchising is still a fairly new concept around the world, starting 20 years ago, and more so in the Mideast,'' said Peter Panopoulos, the president of Pita Pit. ''Even with established regional players, it's still more of an experiment and the process is slower and unpredictable.''

HEADLINE: Students Over Unions

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
The most important civil rights battleground today is education, and, likewise, the most crucial struggle against poverty is the one fought in schools.
Inner-city urban schools today echo the ''separate but equal'' system of the early 1950s. In the Chicago Public Schools where teachers are now on strike, 86 percent of children are black or Hispanic, and 87 percent come from low-income families.
Those students often don't get a solid education, any more than blacks received in their separate schools before Brown v. Board of Education. Chicago's high school graduation rates have been improving but are still about 60 percent. Just 3 percent of black boys in the ninth grade end up earning a degree from a four-year college, according to the Consortium on Chicago School Research. 
America's education system has become less a ladder of opportunity than a structure to transmit inequity from one generation to the next.
That's why school reform is so critical. This is an issue of equality, opportunity and national conscience. It's not just about education, but about poverty and justice -- and while the Chicago teachers' union claims to be striking on behalf of students, I don't see it.
In fairness, it's true that the main reason inner-city schools do poorly isn't teachers' unions, but poverty. Southern states without strong teachers' unions have schools at least as lousy as those in union states. The single most important step we could take has nothing to do with unions and everything to do with providing early-childhood education to at-risk kids.
Still, some Chicago teachers seem to think that they shouldn't be held accountable until poverty is solved. There are steps we can take that would make some difference, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel is trying some of them -- yet the union is resisting.
It's unconscionable that, until recently, many Chicago elementary students had a school day almost an hour shorter than the national average and a school year two weeks shorter than the national average. Bravo to the mayor for trying to close the gaps.
I'd be sympathetic if the union focused solely on higher compensation. Teachers need to be much better paid to attract the best college graduates to the nation's worst schools. But, instead, the Chicago union seems to be using its political capital primarily to protect weak performers.
There's now solid evidence that there are huge differences in the effectiveness of teachers, even within high-poverty schools. The gold standard study, by Harvard and Columbia University scholars and released in December by the National Bureau of Economic Research, took data from a major urban school district and found that even in the context of poverty, teachers consistently had a huge positive or negative impact.
Get a bottom 1 percent teacher, and the effect is the same as if a child misses 40 percent of the school year. Get a teacher from the top 20 percent, and it's as if a child has gone to school for an extra month or two.
The study found that strong teachers in the fourth through eighth grades raised the game of their students in ways that would last for decades. Just having a strong teacher for one elementary year left pupils a bit less likely to become mothers as teenagers, a bit more likely to go to college and earning more money at age 28.
Removing the bottom 5 percent of teachers would have a huge impact. Students in a single classroom with an average teacher, rather than one from the bottom 5 percent, collectively will earn an additional $1.4 million over their careers, the study found.
Another study, one from Los Angeles that has been contested, suggested that four years in a row of having a teacher from the top quarter of teachers, instead of from the bottom quarter, might be enough to erase the black-white testing gap.
How does one figure out who is a weak teacher? Yes, that's a challenge. But researchers are improving systems to measure ''value added'' from beginning to end of the year, and, with three years of data, it's usually possible to tell which teachers are failing.
Unfortunately, the union in Chicago is insisting that teachers who are laid off -- often for being ineffective -- should get priority in new hiring. That's an insult to students.
Teaching is so important that it should be like other professions, with high pay and good working conditions but few job protections for bottom performers.
This isn't a battle between garment workers and greedy corporate barons. The central figures in the Chicago schools strike are neither strikers nor managers but 350,000 children. Protecting elements of a broken and unaccountable school system -- the union demand -- sacrifices those students, in effect turning a blind eye to a ''separate but equal'' education system.

HEADLINE: MetroCards May Lose 7% Bonuses By Next Year

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
The volume discount has long been a staple of New York City commerce, permeating bakeries, electronics stores and, for more than a decade, even the city's transit system with a simple pledge: You buy something, you get something free.
But that era may be coming to an end, at least in subways and buses. 
On Wednesday, Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said the agency had discussed the merits of eliminating or reducing the 7 percent bonus offered to riders who buy pay-per-ride MetroCards of at least $10. Any change could be an important piece of a looming fare increase, which is expected to take place by March 1.
''Do we really need to give that level of a discount?'' Mr. Lhota said at the Plaza Hotel on Wednesday during a discussion hosted by Crain's New York Business.
The bonus, he said at a news conference after the forum, was a relic from the age of tokens, when the authority considered adding a free ride for those who bought a 10-pack. A volume discount like this was never put into effect until the MetroCard era, in 1998, when riders received a 10 percent bonus on purchases of at least $15 -- buy 10 rides at $1.50 each and get the next one free.
But after various fare increases, the metrics of a bargain have become unsatisfyingly uneven: With the 7 percent bonus, a $20 MetroCard buys nine rides, with $1.15 left over.
While raising questions about the viability of the MetroCard discount, Mr. Lhota did not explicitly endorse a plan to eliminate it. He noted that even removing the discount entirely would not raise all of the $450 million a year in revenue that the authority is expecting to generate from the fare increase.
But it would go a long way, Mr. Lhota said, probably lowering the amount by which the base fare of $2.25 or the rate for an unlimited card will rise.
Mr. Lhota said proposals for carrying out an increase would be released in October, with public hearings in November and a decision by the authority's board in December.
Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group, said any change to the discount still amounted to a fare increase -- one aimed particularly at low-income riders.
''There's a fairness issue,'' he said, noting that some riders who received the discount with $10 purchases might not be able to afford a 30-day card, which currently costs $104.
Hunt Allcott, a behavioral economist and assistant professor at New York University, said a volume discount could leave customers ''feeling like they're getting a good deal'' because it is framed as a bonus, not simply a lower per-ride fare. ''What they could have been doing all the time in the past is just keeping prices lower,'' he said.
A change could influence riders' decisions on which card to purchase. If $10 does not go as far as it used to, perhaps some riders will move toward 30-day cards. Some authority officials have suggested that eliminating the bonus would drive riders to buy rides individually, Mr. Lhota said.
''I don't buy that,'' he added.
But at least one New Yorker warned against ending a volume discount: Florence Wilpon, the president of Ess-a-Bagel, which has offered a ''baker's dozen'' deal since Ms. Wilpon, with her husband and brother, opened the first of their two stores on the East Side in 1976.
In a world with few freebies, the bonus is a singular thrill, she said. Sometimes out-of-town customers order a dozen bagels, pointing to them one by one, and stop after choosing 12, unaware that, at least in this city, their task is not yet complete.
''How can you not give someone a baker's dozen?'' she said in her store on Third Avenue, near East 51st Street. ''I would feel I'm depriving someone.''
The MetroCard bonus is similarly cherished, if less edible, she said. ''Like the free bagel,'' she said, ''it's like a gift.''

HEADLINE: In South Africa, Labor Unrest in Mining Deepens

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- The labor strife gripping South Africa's mines spread Wednesday, with riots prompting the world's largest platinum producer to halt production at a number of its mines in the country and guards firing tear gas on protesting workers at a major gold mine.
Unrest has rippled across the gold- and platinum-producing regions that surround Johannesburg since the police killed 34 miners at a platinum mine last month in Marikana, 80 miles northwest of here, in an effort to halt a violent, illegal strike by workers demanding that their wages be raised. The spreading turmoil is destabilizing one of the most important industries in Africa's biggest economy. 
In a speech to striking workers at a gold mine on Monday, Julius Malema, the firebrand former leader of the African National Congress Youth League, called for a national mining strike until wages for all miners were increased to about $1,500 a month, roughly double or triple what they take home now.
''Where are our leaders?'' thundered Mr. Malema, dressed in a white shirt embroidered with the logo of the A.N.C., from which he has been expelled, and a black beret. ''Our leaders have sold out South Africa! Our leaders are sleeping with capital!''
Amid the turmoil, Anglo American Platinum, which says it produces about 40 percent of the world's newly mined platinum, announced Wednesday that it was shutting down its mining operations near Marikana because of threats against its workers.
''In light of the current volatile situation in the Rustenburg area, where our employees, who want to go to work, are being prevented from doing so and are being intimidated by the threat of violence, Anglo American Platinum has decided to suspend its operations,'' the company said in a statement.
Security guards on Wednesday fired tear gas at workers engaged in a wildcat strike at a gold mine in Carletonville, 50 miles southwest of Johannesburg. On Sunday, about 15,000 workers walked off the job at the mine, which is operated by Gold Fields.
The mine in Marikana where the killings took place, which is owned by Lonmin, a company based in London, has been closed for more than a month since the company's rock drill operators, who perform some of the hardest, most dangerous work, went on strike to demand higher wages.
Many of the strikers were members of a radical, breakaway union and had expressed dissatisfaction with the country's largest union, the National Union of Mineworkers, which is part of the trade union federation allied with the governing A.N.C.
So far, the unrest has done little to dent South Africa's economy. Neither its stock market nor its currency has suffered as a result of the strikes. Labor unrest is common in South Africa, though it is not usually this violent, said Frans Cronje, an analyst at the South African Institute of Race Relations, a research institution that counsels investors.
''South Africa has a background of conflict and instability and violence,'' Mr. Cronje said.
But the strikes underscore the problems the country faces: the highest level of inequality of any large economy, according to some estimates; jobless rates that reach 50 percent among young blacks; and an education system churning out graduates ill prepared for what jobs are available. The A.N.C., which bills itself as the protector of the poor, is now seen by many here as too cozy with the owners of capital.
''The corporate world does not yet realize the seriousness of the social and economic inequalities that confront the country,'' Mr. Cronje said. ''They have felt very often that their political connections are insurance that can bail them out of the problem. But the biggest constituency is the people who do not vote. It does not help therefore to have an A.N.C. insider on your board.''
Mr. Malema, who was ejected from the A.N.C. this year for sowing discord within the party, has been visiting striking miners in what is widely seen as a bid to shore up his popularity and help push President Jacob Zuma out as president of the party. Known for his radical pronouncements advocating the nationalization of the country's mines and the seizure of white farms without compensation, Mr. Malema is the subject of multiple corruption investigations into his vast and mysteriously acquired fortune.
Mr. Malema received a warm reception from striking gold miners, who waved ceremonial cudgels, marched and sang songs in his praise. One held up a sign reading ''Juju for President,'' using Mr. Malema's nickname. But other workers were skeptical.
''He says that the mine bosses are using us, the politicians are using us,'' said Vusi Tshomela, 28, a gold miner. ''I think he is also using us.''

HEADLINE: Fewer Uninsured People

 BODY:
The number of Americans who lack health insurance declined last year, the first drop since 2007. This is, in large part, the result of the health care reform law and better coverage under public programs like Medicaid. This also shows why repealing the health care law or revamping and shrinking Medicaid, as many Republicans want to do, would be disastrous moves. 
The Census Bureau reported on Wednesday that the number of people without health coverage fell to 48.6 million in 2011, or 15.7 percent of the population, down from 49.9 million, or 16.3 percent of the population, in 2010. Health experts attributed a big chunk of the drop to a provision in the health care reform law that allows children to remain on their parents' policies until age 26. Some three million young adults took advantage of that provision, other surveys show.
The bureau also reported that the percentage of people covered by private insurance stayed flat at 63.9 percent, the first time in a decade it has not fallen. The percentage of Americans covered by government programs, like Medicare, Medicaid, a related children's health program, and military plans, increased for the fifth consecutive year to reach 32.2 percent in 2011. That is a testament to the importance of government programs in troubled economic times.
In other good news, a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust showed that average premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance for family coverage rose 4 percent from last year and individual coverage rose 3 percent -- well below the double-digit increases in the past decade. The recession accounts for some of this moderation in costs. The spread of high deductible health plans may also have reduced spending, and some experts think the health care reforms, which don't fully kick in until 2014, are already pushing health care providers and insurers to lower their costs.
The Census Bureau also reported that median household income, adjusted for inflation, declined last year to $50,054, a level not seen since the mid-1990s, and that income inequality grew significantly worse, as incomes rose for the top earners. Still, the percentage of Americans living in poverty declined slightly after rising in the previous three years, largely because more people shifted from part-time to full-time work. The census data underscore the importance of retaining the health care reforms, which will increasingly make insurance more affordable for middle-class families.

HEADLINE: From Prussia With Love

BYLINE: By JACOB HEILBRUNN. 
Jacob Heilbrunn is a senior editor at The National Interest.

 BODY:
Washington
WITH its decision yesterday to allow Germany to contribute to European bailout efforts, the country's Federal Constitutional Court not only handed Chancellor Angela Merkel a big political victory -- it also provided further confirmation that this economic powerhouse, a cautious and self-effacing country during the cold war, is assuming a dominant role in a new Europe. And it is doing so in the 300th anniversary year of the birth of Frederick the Great, the Prussian ruler who almost single-handedly forged a powerful new European kingdom.
Indeed, Ms. Merkel is presiding over a transformation every bit as dramatic as that of her royal predecessor, a cultural and political shift in Germany that exemplifies a rebirth of the Prussian values of thrift, independence and incorruptibility that she hopes to export to her neighbors. 
The idea of a Prussian revival, with its implications of German militarism, may strike some as a cause for worry. Even in Germany, it conjures up embarrassing images from the past: monocle-wearing officers barking orders that are slavishly followed by their subordinates.
This past summer Heiner Geissler, the former secretary general of the conservative Christian Democratic Party, said on TV that the golden victory column in Berlin that celebrates Prussia's 1871 defeat of France is Germany's ''dumbest memorial'' and should be demolished. Not surprisingly, in denouncing Ms. Merkel for demanding fiscal austerity and rectitude, demonstrators in Greece and politicians in France have often depicted her as a Prussian dictator.
But such overheated charges may no longer carry the sting they once did. Germans are taking a second look at Prussia, particularly its transformation into the most enlightened European state in the late 18th century under Frederick the Great, a friend of Voltaire and a musician.
The German Historical Museum -- housed in the former Prussian armory -- recently marked Frederick's birthday with an exhibition devoted to his shifting image over the centuries. Subtitled ''Respected, Revered, Reviled ...'' it shows, among other things, how the Nazis misused his memory for their own genocidal ends.
Frederick is undergoing more than just a historical revision, though. Some fiscal conservatives hail him as a contemporary model for prudence in the face of demands for bailouts.
And it isn't only Prussia's greatest ruler getting a new gloss, but Prussia itself. Berlin's Baroque Hohenzollern palace, demolished by the East Germans, is being rebuilt, with a few design changes, as an academic and cultural center. In a sensible compromise between the past and present, its courtyard and three facades of the new building will emulate the original palace, while the interior will be modern.
Perhaps the most controversial episode associated with Prussia, however, is its destruction by the Soviet Red Army in 1945 and the expulsion of millions of Germans from Eastern Europe, including Czechoslovakia, where ethnic Germans, the so-called Sudetendeutschen, had lived for generations. After decades of ignoring that history, in 2008 the German Parliament passed a law calling for the establishment of a documentation center focusing on such ethnic cleansing.
Poland and the Czech Republic, which include former Prussian and German territories, tend to see the demands of the expellees as an attempt to claim victimhood status for Germans who were, of course, the aggressors during World War II. But a dispassionate exhibition chronicling the brutal exodus from the East -- and addressing forced displacements of populations throughout history -- is not something to recoil from. Doing so can offer a more honest and full depiction of the horrors precipitated by Nazism. Germans aren't trying to valorize Prussia and the German past but, after years of willful silence, to understand them.
There is no reason to fear what such re-examination of the past implies for the future. Quite the contrary. Before World War II, what was good for Germany was bad for its neighbors. During the cold war a divided Germany -- and the carving up of the Prussian state by the wartime allies -- reassured them of Germany's peaceful intentions. Now Germany is drawing on its past to create a stronger, more unified Europe. If its neighbors can profit from a revitalized and pacific Germany, they may someday find themselves celebrating Frederick the Great's birthday as well.

HEADLINE: U.S. Income Gap Rose, Sign of Uneven Recovery

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Annie M. Lowrey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The income gap between the wealthiest 20 percent of American households and the rest of the country grew sharply in 2011, the Census Bureau reported, as an overwhelming majority of Americans saw no gains from a weak economic recovery in its second full year.
Income for the top fifth of American households rose by 1.6 percent last year, driven by even larger increases for the top 5 percent of households, said David Johnson, the Census Bureau official who presented the findings. All households in the middle of the scale saw declines, while those at the very bottom stagnated. 
''You're really struck by the unevenness of the recovery,'' said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard. ''The top end took a whack in the recession, but they've gotten back on their feet. Everyone else is still down for the count.''
The numbers helped drive an overall decline in income for the typical American family. Median household income after inflation fell to $50,054, a level that was 8 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the recession took hold.
That drop poses a political challenge for President Obama as he presents himself as a champion of the middle class and defends his economic stewardship in a tightly fought presidential race. The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, is likely to seize on the decline as evidence of the president's failure to fix an ailing economy. Mr. Obama, for his part, has emphasized the potentially damaging effects of Republican policies on the middle class.
Obama administration officials said Wednesday that more recent data on job growth, unemployment and wages indicated that median income, adjusted for inflation, was growing this year. They pointed to the rise in income inequality as proof that their policy priorities are even more urgent. Rebecca M. Blank, the acting United States commerce secretary, said in a statement that the rise ''underscores the fact we must enact policies that help rebuild our economy not from the top down, but from the middle out.''
It is an argument that conservatives, who contend that income inequality is not inherently harmful, largely reject.
''Over the long run, the disappearing middle class has moved up, not down,'' said Douglas J. Besharov, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland. ''Too much redistribution will kill the goose that laid the golden egg.''
The Census Bureau reported that a standard measure of income inequality, the Gini index, registered the first year-on-year increase since 1993, a surprise for economists who say the measure, which has been rising for some time, usually changes so slowly that a statistically significant rise over the course of one calendar year is rare.
Two other of the report's findings were promoted by the administration as achievements. The share of Americans without health insurance declined, driven by a 2.2 percent drop in the portion of uninsured 19- to 25-year-olds, strong evidence of an impact from a provision in Mr. Obama's Affordable Care Act that allowed children to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26. The uninsured rate for the nation fell to 15.7 percent from 16.3 percent. And the percentage of Americans in poverty remained unchanged for the first time in four years, though economists had expected the rate to rise for a fifth straight year.
''If you have to guess what's going on, 2011 was the year that we started making real gains in employment,'' said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan.
Mr. Johnson, the census official, said the movement of people from part-time work to full-time work was most likely a major reason the poverty rate did not worsen. The number of people in poverty declined in the South and the suburbs, and among people who were not United States citizens.
''Looks like there's a big shift from part time to full time, and the largest percent increase in full-time work was in the lowest quintile,'' he said, referring to the bottom fifth of the income spectrum.
There were 46.2 million people in poverty in the United States last year, little changed from 2010. That figure represents 15 percent of the population, compared with 15.1 percent in 2010, census officials said, a change that was not statistically significant.
But the data still reflects the bleak state of the American labor market. Inflation-adjusted median household income fell by 1.5 percent in 2011. During the recovery, about 3 in 5 of the new jobs created have been low-skill and low-wage -- taking people off the unemployment rolls and pulling some families out of poverty, but not providing a clear route to the middle class.
That trend helps explain how the poverty rate could stay flat while the median income went down. Middle-income earners, for instance manufacturing workers and middle managers, have fared worse in this economy than both lower-income workers and higher-income workers, a phenomenon economists refer to as the polarization of the labor market, Professor Katz said. As a result, income at the middle point of the spectrum went down, while remaining flat at the bottom, something that happened from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, he said.

HEADLINE: Labor Fight Poses Risks To Coalition for Obama

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Democrats left their convention in Charlotte, N.C., with an unusual amount of unity and enthusiasm, but the three-day-old strike by 26,000 teachers in Chicago has quickly deflated some of that enthusiasm -- and could, some political analysts say, ultimately put some sizable cracks in the coalition that President Obama hopes to ride to re-election.
The strike pits several core components of the Democratic coalition against one another: The teachers' union and much of organized labor are on a war footing against Rahm Emanuel, Chicago's Democratic mayor and Mr. Obama's former chief of staff. What is more, the strike pits organized labor against myriad wealthy liberals -- vital donors to Democratic coffers -- many of whom contribute heavily to efforts to finance charter schools and weaken teachers' unions. 
''Any time we're fighting among ourselves, it's never helpful,'' said Michael Fraioli, a Democratic strategist. ''Any time you waste money and time fighting each other, it's money we're not spending fighting our real opponents.''
Ever since he was inaugurated, Mr. Obama has walked a fine line with the nation's teachers' unions, angering many teachers by promoting ideas they dislike, including nonunion charter schools and aggressive efforts to shut underperforming public schools and lay off many of their teachers. At the same time, Mr. Obama has heartened many teachers by defending the collective bargaining process and by battling to give billions of federal dollars to deficit-stricken cities and states to minimize the layoffs of teachers and other public employees.
Thanks to his labor-friendly efforts, Mr. Obama has won enthusiastic endorsements from the nation's two main teachers' unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, which together have 4.5 million members. Those unions can normally be counted on to provide tens of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of campaign foot soldiers to help the Democrats in national elections
And now with a strike pitting two of Mr. Obama's most prominent allies against each other -- the teachers' union and Mr. Emanuel -- the president could face many land mines if he steps into this battle.
''It only gets more complicated for him if the strike drags on for a long time,'' said Joe Williams, executive director of Democrats for Education Reform, a national advocacy group that has often battled teachers' unions. ''President Obama really has to thread the needle here.''
On Monday, the day the Chicago walkout began, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, moved quickly to seek to brand Mr. Obama as a close ally of teachers' unions. ''Teachers' unions have too often made plain that their interests conflict with those of our children,'' he said in a statement. ''President Obama has chosen his side in this fight.''
Mr. Obama's aides took pains to say that he was not taking sides in the Chicago showdown. His education secretary, Arne Duncan, issued a careful, anodyne statement: ''I hope that the parties will come together to settle this quickly and get our kids back in the classroom.''
Michael J. Petrilli, a former official in President George W. Bush's administration and executive vice president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education policy group, sees only a downside for Mr. Obama in the Chicago fight. ''There's no doubt that this hurts President Obama,'' Mr. Petrilli said. ''He needs teachers to be energized and to go out and knock on doors and man phone banks for him. Right now they're watching his former chief of staff go toe to toe with the teachers' union in Chicago. This is not a position that the president wants to find himself in.''
Some conservatives have suggested that Mr. Obama can emerge a winner, with more support from independents, if Mr. Emanuel gets the teachers' union to accede to some of the changes he is seeking, like relying heavily on student test performance to determine whether teachers should be dismissed or receive raises.
But Mr. Petrilli said that if Mr. Emanuel wins the battle, his victory might at the same time enrage and alienate many rank-and-file teachers across the nation, making them less enthusiastic about knocking on doors and making phone calls on behalf of Mr. Obama and other Democrats.
''It's hard to see how this can translate into any kind of advantage for Obama,'' Mr. Petrilli said.
Teachers in nearby Wisconsin, an increasingly important swing state, are keeping a close eye on the Chicago battle. Mary Bell, president of the main teachers' union there, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, insisted that the Chicago confrontation would not detract from her union's efforts on behalf of Mr. Obama this fall.
''We're going to have differences of opinions with some big-city mayors,'' Ms. Bell said. ''But every presidential race is a choice, and the choice is pretty clear here because there's such a contrast between what President Obama believes about education and what Romney is proposing in terms of eliminating unions and privatizing a significant segment of the public schools.''
G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., said the strike was not of great concern or consequence to many of the people in swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. Instead, people are much more worried about issues like the economy and being able to pay for college for their children.
Mr. Madonna said the president would not be hurt much by the Chicago fight, partly because he was deliberately keeping his distance from it. ''There won't be much of a carry-over that will hurt the president,'' he said. ''If the president was to be actively involved on one side or the other, then it might have an effect. But he's dealing with it with benign neglect.''

HEADLINE: Global Stocks Rise on German Court Approval of Euro Bailout Fund

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
PARIS -- Global stocks and the euro rose on Wednesday after a German court gave its approval to an expanded euro zone rescue plan.
The Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe found that the new European Stability Mechanism, the permanent bailout fund the euro zone has concocted, did not conflict with German law. It did find that Germany's liabilities must be limited, and said both houses of the German Parliament had responsibility for monitoring the fund.
The court rejected a case brought by a group of German lawmakers and citizens that called for a temporary injunction against their country's participation in the mechanism. 
Germany's participation is essential for the bailout fund's operation, and the court's rejection of the plan would have destroyed the underpinnings of the European Union's hopes for overcoming the crisis of confidence in government finances that has rocked the bloc beginning late 2009.
In late afternoon trading, the euro rose to $1.2893 from $1.2855 late Tuesday in New York. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, gained 0.53 percent. Trading in Standard & Poor's 500 index futures suggested Wall Street stocks would get a lift at the opening bell. Asian stocks were higher across the board.
In the debt market, the battlefield on which the euro crisis has played out, the reaction was also positive. Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds rose in price, and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. And in an auction in Rome, the Italian Treasury on Wednesday sold one-year and three-month debt at sharply lower rates than it had obtained in the last such auctions.
On a fraught day for the future of the euro, Michel Barnier, the E.U. commissioner in charge of trade, was to present a plan for banking supervision in the euro zone to come under the responsibility of the European Central Bank. European leaders agreed in June to implement so-called ''banking union'' to bring new scrutiny and discipline to the lenders.
José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, on Wednesday called for more political integration within the Union, and for another change to the bloc's governing treaty to make a success of its single currency.
''A deep and genuine economic and monetary union can be started under the current treaty, but can only be completed with changes in the E.U. treaties,'' Mr. Barroso said to the European Parliament in his annual ''state of the union'' address in Strasbourg, France.
Changes to the E.U. treaties require unanimous agreement among the 27 national governments in the bloc and, sometimes, referendums in some countries, making them extremely difficult to secure.
Mr. Barroso said that his successor should have more democratic legitimacy, and that political groupings in Europe should each propose one nominee for the job before the next elections to the European Parliament. Currently the European Commission president is selected by national governments then approved by the European Parliament.
''I call for a federation of nation states, not a superstate,'' said Mr. Barroso, adding ''we must not allow the populists and nationalist to set the agenda''
Mr. Barroso also warned of the dangers of populism in Europe and said the euro crisis was contributing to the rise in extremism.
And in the Netherlands, voters were going to the polls Wednesday for an election in which the euro zone bailouts have figured heavily, with many Dutch opposed to further aid to Europe's ailing southern tier. No single party is expected to take a majority, with a likelihood that political horse-trading to form a coalition government could go on for some time.
The growing confidence that the bailout fund will see the light of day, along with the European Central Bank's strong support for ailing governments in Spain and Italy, has helped to restore some normality to a European market that has at times appeared
The E.C.B. made its support clear on Sept. 6, when the central bank's president, Mario Draghi, said the institution would give unlimited financial backing to Spain and Italy, signaling his readiness to buy their government bonds to drive down yields in return for their commitment to budgetary discipline.
One of the questions hanging over the new bailout fund is whether and when Spain, the most urgent candidate for support, will ask for a rescue. Newspapers in Finland on Wednesday reported that the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, might ask for the central bank's bond-buying support without requesting a full bailout, Reuters reported.
Even as European officials focus their attention on Spain, however, other euro members are showing signs of strain. The tiny Balkan country of Slovenia is fighting to keep its banks healthy, the Bank of Slovenia governor, Marko Kranjec, said Wednesday, Reuters reported. Mr. Kranjec said Slovenia's banks remain solvent for now, but the situation is worsening, Reuters cited him as saying.
Stephen Castle reported from London.

HEADLINE: Ahead of Fed Decision on Possible Stimulus, Investors Hold Their Ground

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market showed little change on Wednesday, as investors turned cautious before a Federal Reserve decision on another round of monetary stimulus to bolster the economy.
Stocks received an early lift after Germany's Constitutional Court approved the new euro zone rescue fund, which would allow the European Central Bank to buy sovereign bonds to try to reduce crippling borrowing costs faced by Spain and Italy.
But the gains faded as investors shifted their attention to the Fed, which was to conclude a two-day meeting on Thursday. Equities have rallied on expectations of more Fed action to keep interest rates low, which led some analysts to warn of disappointment. 
Economists put the odds of a third round of bond-buying from the Fed at 65 percent, up from 60 percent in August, according to a Reuters poll.
''The market is somewhat nervous ahead of tomorrow's Fed decision, and rightfully so,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York, who said he believed that the Fed would not begin another round of stimulus until after November's presidential election.
''We could be setting ourselves up here for a quick 2 to 4 percent correction,'' he said.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 9.99 points, at 13,333.35. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended up 3 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,436.56. The Nasdaq composite index gained 9.79 points, or 0.32 percent, to 3,114.31.
Apple gained $9.20, or 1.4 percent, to $669.79 after it unveiled its iPhone 5.
Facebook jumped $1.50, or 7.7 percent, to $20.93 after its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, hinted at new growth areas from mobile to search in his first major public appearance since the social network's rocky initial public offering in May.
The S.& P. 500 index has advanced more than 9 percent since the start of June on hopes for global central bank stimulus. The index has been unable to break through the 1,440 level, seen as a significant resistance point.
Uncertainties about the economic outlook, highlighted by recent profit warnings from FedEx and Intel, could also limit the market's upward momentum.
''It's a little scary for me when you think about what we are going to be faced with next year,'' said Catherine Avery, president of Catherine Avery Investment Management in New Canaan, Conn. ''In addition to the fiscal cliff, we do have a very slow rate of G.D.P. growth. It's very possible that the S.& P. earnings that analysts are predicting for next year are just way too high.''
Among the notable movers, shares of Mediware Information Systems surged $6.11, or 38.8 percent, to $21.86 after the clinical software solutions provider agreed to be acquired by the private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $22 a share in cash.
In the bond market, interest rates rose as the German court's decision reduced demand for Treasury securities as a safe haven from Europe's sovereign debt crisis. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 16/32, to 98 26/32, while its yield rose to 1.76 percent, from 1.70 percent.

HEADLINE: Spotlight Is on Libya, but Bigger Challenge for White House May Lie in Egypt

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For all the harrowing images of the deadly attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya, the Obama administration is grappling with the possibility that its far bigger long-term problem lies in Egypt, not Libya.
Hours before the attacks in Benghazi on Tuesday, the American Embassy in Cairo came under siege from protesters. While the violence there did not result in any American deaths, the tepid response from the Egyptian government to the assault gave officials in Washington -- already troubled by the direction of President Mohamed Morsi's new Islamist government -- further cause for concern.
President Obama telephoned Mr. Morsi and the president of Libya's National Assembly, the White House said early on Thursday, in calls that seemed different in tone, suggesting dissatisfaction with Cairo's response as opposed to Tripoli's.
To Mohammed Magarief, the leader of Libya's National Assembly, Mr. Obama ''expressed appreciation for the cooperation we have received from the Libyan government and people in responding to this outrageous attack,'' the White House said in a statement. 
To Mr. Morsi, there was no mention of of appreciation. Instead, the White House said in a separate but parallel statement that Mr. Obama ''underscored the importance of Egypt following through on its commitment to cooperate with the United States in securing U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel.''
President Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, pointedly noted that Libyan authorities had tried to help the American effort to protect diplomats in Benghazi. ''This attack will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya,'' Mr. Obama said. The Libyans ''helped some of our diplomats find safety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens's body to the hospital, where we tragically learned he had died,'' he added, referring to Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
The president found less reason to be pleased with Egypt, the second-largest recipient of American foreign aid after Israel, at $2 billion a year. Mr. Morsi issued only a mild rebuke of the rioters -- and on Facebook -- while his movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, has called for a second day of protests against the lurid anti-Muslim video that set off the riots. And though the Egyptian police coordinated with American officials, Mr. Morsi waited 24 hours before issuing his statement against the militants who stormed the embassy; Libyan authorities issued immediate, unequivocal statements of regret for the bloodshed in Benghazi.
Mr. Obama seemed to indicate that the American relationship with Egypt was evolving. ''I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy,'' he said in an interview with Telemundo that was broadcast Wednesday night on ''The Rachel Maddow Show'' on MSNBC. ''I think it's still a work in progress, but certainly in this situation, what we're going to expect is that they are responsive to our insistence that our embassy is protected, our personnel is protected.''
For the United States, ''politically the bigger issue is Egypt,'' said Martin S. Indyk, a former United States ambassador to Israel. ''On the one hand, you didn't have Americans getting killed, but this was the fourth time an embassy was assaulted in Cairo with the Egyptian police doing precious little,'' Mr. Indyk said. ''And where was President Morsi's condemnation of this?''
Several foreign policy experts said they worried that Mr. Morsi was putting appeasement of his country's Islamist population ahead of national security. That comes on top of other moves by his government, including restrictions on press freedom and squabbling with Israel over how to crack down on terrorists taking root in the Sinai Peninsula.
While the killing of Mr. Stevens is a ''tragedy,'' said Robert Malley, Middle East and North Africa program director at the International Crisis Group, ''in the longer term, Libya mainly is a problem for Libyans.'' What happens in Egypt, by contrast, from ''popular attitudes toward the U.S., to its domestic economy, to relations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the army, to relations between Cairo and Jerusalem, to the situation in Sinai, will profoundly affect the region, and so will profoundly affect America's posture in the region,'' he said.
What makes Egypt's uncertain course so vexing for the White House is that Mr. Obama, more than any other foreign leader, has sided again and again with the Arab street in Cairo, even when it meant going expressly against the wishes of traditional allies, including the Egyptian military, the Persian Gulf states and Israel.
As recently as June, Mr. Obama was calling on the Egyptian military to quickly hand over power to the democratically elected civilian government -- a move that helped Mr. Morsi, whose movement has called for greater use of Islamic law, assume power. At the same time, the administration was chastising the military, which has for 30 years served as the bulwark of a crucial American strategic interest in the Middle East: the 1979 Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
For anti-American unrest to erupt in Egypt after all that could reflect a deeper divergence of a once-staunch ally from the United States. Mr. Morsi's belated reaction came after other actions that have troubled American officials, from his decision to attend a meeting of nonaligned countries in Tehran to his choice of China for one of his first foreign trips. Mr. Obama has pledged to forgive $1 billion in Egyptian debt.
''How does the president go to the Hill and say, 'We need to forgive $1 billion in Egyptian debt?' '' said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''The complication is that this is happening six weeks before the election. The things that the administration wants to do in Egypt have become a heavier lift.''
David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said: ''There are some real serious questions about the direction of the Egyptian government. Some of this will be submerged because of the election, but it is likely to come back later.''
The violence in Libya and Egypt reinforces what has been true from the start of the Arab uprisings last year: These are homegrown popular movements over which the United States has at best limited influence.
The odds of success may be greater in Libya, some analysts said, since that country's problems are rooted in a lack of effective governance and security problems with a heavily armed populace, rather than in a newly empowered movement with a long history of suspicion of the United States.
The killing of Mr. Stevens sets back American efforts to help Libya with its transition, officials said, but only because he was such a tireless figure in this work.
''Libya's public is quite pro-American, so it might produce a backlash against those responsible,'' said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser on the Middle East in the White House.
In Egypt, by contrast, Mr. Ross said: ''Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood continue to live according to their own reality. If they want to attract any amount of economic support and investment from the outside, they're going to have to create an environment of security.''

''The complication is th at this is happening six weeks before the election. The things that the administ ration wants to do in Egypt have become a heavier lift.''
David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said: ''There a re some real serious questions about the direction of the Egyptian government. S ome of this will be submerged because of the election, but it is likely to come back later.''
The violence in Libya and Egypt reinforces what has been true from the start of the Arab uprisings last year: These are homegrown popular mov ements over which the United States has at best limited influence.
The odds of success may be greater in Libya, some analysts said, since that country's pr oblems are rooted in a lack of effective governance and security problems with a heavily armed populace, rather than in a newly empowered movement with a long h istory of suspicion of the United States.
The killing of Mr. Stevens sets b ack American efforts to help Libya with its transition, officials said, but only because he was such a tireless figure in this work.
''Libya's public is qu ite pro-American, so it might produce a backlash against those responsible,'' sa id Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser on the Middle East in the White House .
In Egypt, by contrast, Mr. Ross said: ''Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood continue to live according to their own reality. If they want to attract any amo unt of economic support and investment from the outside, they're going to have t o create an environment of security.''

HEADLINE: Spotlight Is on Libya, but Bigger Challenge f or White House May Lie in Egypt

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WAS HINGTON -- For all the harrowing images of the deadly attack on the American mis sion in Benghazi, Libya, the Obama administration is grappling with the possibil ity that its far bigger long-term problem lies in Egypt, not Libya.
Hours bef ore the attacks in Benghazi on Tuesday, the American Embassy in Cairo came under siege from protesters. While the violence there did not result in any American deaths, the tepid response from the Egyptian government to the assault gave offi cials in Washington -- already troubled by the direction of President Mohamed Mo rsi's new Islamist government -- further cause for concern.
Pres ident Obama telephoned Mr. Morsi and the president of Libya's National Assembly, the White House said early on Thursday, in calls that seemed different in tone, suggesting dissatisfaction with Cairo's response as opposed to Tripoli's.
To Mohammed Magarief, the leader of Libya's National Assembly, Mr. Obama ''expre ssed appreciation for the cooperation we have received from the Libyan governmen t and people in responding to this outrageous attack,'' the White House said in a statement. 
To Mr. Morsi, there was no mention of of appreciation. Instead , the White House said in a separate but parallel statement that Mr. Obama ''und erscored the importance of Egypt following through on its commitment to cooperat e with the United States in securing U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel.''
President Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, pointedly noted that Libyan authorities had tried to help the American effort to protect diplom ats in Benghazi. ''This attack will not break the bonds between the United State s and Libya,'' Mr. Obama said. The Libyans ''helped some of our diplomats find s afety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens's body to the hospital, where we trag ically learned he had died,'' he added, referring to Ambassador J. Christopher S tevens.
The president found less reason to be pleased with Egypt, the secon d-largest recipient of American foreign aid after Israel, at $2 billion a year. Mr. Morsi issued only a mild rebuke of the rioters -- and on Facebook -- while h is movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, has called for a second day of protests aga inst the lurid anti-Muslim video that set off the riots. And though the Egyptian police coordinated with American officials, Mr. Morsi waited 24 hours before is suing his statement against the militants who stormed the embassy; Libyan author ities issued immediate, unequivocal statements of regret for the bloodshed in Be nghazi.
Mr. Obama seemed to indicate that the American relationship with Eg ypt was evolving. ''I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we do n't consider them an enemy,'' he said in an interview with Telemundo that was br oadcast Wednesday night on ''The Rachel Maddow Show'' on MSNBC. ''I think it's s till a work in progress, but certainly in this situation, what we're going to ex pect is that they are responsive to our insistence that our embassy is protected , our personnel is protected.''
For the United States, ''politically the bi gger issue is Egypt,'' said Martin S. Indyk, a former United States ambassador t o Israel. ''On the one hand, you didn't have Americans getting killed, but this was the fourth time an embassy was assaulted in Cairo with the Egyptian police d oing precious little,'' Mr. Indyk said. ''And where was President Morsi's condem nation of this?''
Several foreign policy experts said they worried that Mr. Morsi was putting appeasement of his country's Islamist population ahead of nat ional security. That comes on top of other moves by his government, including re strictions on press freedom and squabbling with Israel over how to crack down on terrorists taking root in the Sinai Peninsula.
While the killing of Mr. St evens is a ''tragedy,'' said Robert Malley, Middle East and North Africa program director at the International Crisis Group, ''in the longer term, Libya mainly is a problem for Libyans.'' What happens in Egypt, by contrast, from ''popular a ttitudes toward the U.S., to its domestic economy, to relations between the Musl im Brotherhood and the army, to relations between Cairo and Jerusalem, to the si tuation in Sinai, will profoundly affect the region, and so will profoundly affe ct America's posture in the region,'' he said.
What makes Egypt's uncertain course so vexing for the White House is that Mr. Obama, more than any other for eign leader, has sided again and again with the Arab street in Cairo, even when it meant going expressly against the wishes of traditional allies, including the Egyptian military, the Persian Gulf states and Israel.
As recently as June , Mr. Obama was calling on the Egyptian military to quickly hand over power to t he democratically elected civilian government -- a move that helped Mr. Morsi, w hose movement has called for greater use of Islamic law, assume power. At the sa me time, the administration was chastising the military, which has for 30 years served as the bulwark of a crucial American strategic interest in the Middle Eas t: the 1979 Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
For anti-Amer ican unrest to erupt in Egypt after all that could reflect a deeper divergence o f a once-staunch ally from the United States. Mr. Morsi's belated reaction came after other actions that have troubled American officials, from his decision to attend a meeting of nonaligned countries in Tehran to his choice of China for on e of his first foreign trips. Mr. Obama has pledged to forgive $1 billion in Egy ptian debt.
''How does the president go to the Hill and say, 'We need to fo rgive $1 billion in Egyptian debt?' '' said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at t he Council on Foreign Relations. ''The complication is that this is happening si x weeks before the election. The things that the administration wants to do in E gypt have become a heavier lift.''
David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the W ashington Institute for Near East Policy, said: ''There are some real serious qu estions about the direction of the Egyptian government. Some of this will be sub merged because of the election, but it is likely to come back later.''
The violence in Libya and Egypt reinforces what has been true from the start of the Arab uprisings last year: These are homegrown popular movements over which the U nited States has at best limited influence.
The odds of success may be grea ter in Libya, some analysts said, since that country's problems are rooted in a lack of effective governance and security problems with a heavily armed populace , rather than in a newly empowered movement with a long history of suspicion of the United States.
The killing of Mr. Stevens sets back American efforts to help Libya with its transition, officials said, but only because he was such a tireless figure in this work.
''Libya's public is quite pro-American, so it might produce a backlash against those responsible,'' said Dennis B. Ross, a fo rmer senior adviser on the Middle East in the White House.
In Egypt, by con trast, Mr. Ross said: ''Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood continue to live accord ing to their own reality. If they want to attract any amount of economic support and investment from the outside, they're going to have to create an environment of security.''

HEADLINE: Must All U.S. Embassies Now Be Fortresses?

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Even as it actively promotes its democratic values around the world, the United States has also been building massive, expensive, fortress-like embassies that are often seen as anything but open and welcoming. In these troubled times, can a safe embassy also be an accessible one? Can tight security and elegant design co-exist? 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - There is certain to be a demand - any minute now, wait for it - for more rigorous security at American embassies and consulates around the world. The attacks this week on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and the embassy in Cairo almost require a review of how U.S. diplomatic facilities are sited, designed, built and guarded.
Tough security and elegant architectural design are not easily joined, and the United States has been erecting some foreboding embassies in recent years. The new $750 million embassy in Baghdad, the largest in the world at 104 acres, or 42 hectares, is anything but welcoming. Likewise the embassy in Kabul. 
"We are building some of the ugliest embassies I've ever seen," Senator John F. Kerry said in 2009. "We're building fortresses around the world. We're separating ourselves from people in these countries. I cringe when I see what we're doing."
Demands for tighter security at diplomatic missions followed the assaults on U.S. embassies in 1979 (Tehran), 1983 (Beirut) and 1998 (Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania), and after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
The Economist, in a look at the challenges facing the architects of new U.S. embassies, headlined its article "First, dig your moat."
While smart and energetic American diplomats try to do their work abroad - like Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and the Foreign Service officer Sean Smith, who were killed on Tuesday - the gray concrete tonnage of their embassies can often work against them. 
Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, said the United States had to build "embassies that resemble fortresses, and that convey an image of America that is at odds with our interests and our own self-image, and especially with the image that we would like to convey to foreign peoples."
An excerpt from his 2010 piece in Foreign Policy:
We like to think of our country as friendly and welcoming, as open to new ideas, and as a strong, diverse and confident society built on a heritage of pluck and grit. You know, we're supposed to be a society built by generations of immigrants, pioneers, and other determined folk who faced adversity and risk with a smile and a bit of a swagger. Yet the "Fortress America" approach to embassy design presents a public face that is an odd combination of power and paranoia. 
Don't get me wrong: states in the modern world do have to worry about security for their representatives, and we ought to take all reasonable measures to ensure that our diplomats are adequately protected. But as with dangers (such as extremists with explosives in their underwear), it's possible to go too far in the quest for perfect security. 
Trying to blast-proof everything may even be counterproductive, if the damage done to our global image is greater than the damage that violent radicals would do to a slightly less-fortified global presence.
It's not just the design. For the lack of a better word, it's the ambience.
Like most foreign correspondents, I have been in dozens of American embassies, consulates, diplomatic offices and official residences around the world. Even as an American, even with approved credentials, even with a security clearance and an appointment to see a senior officer or the ambassador, the entry process at most embassies is wholly unpleasant - and usually smacks more of hard power than soft.
There are a series of X-rays, bag checks, and a triple-checking and the handing-over of your passport. Recorders, mobile phones and cameras are rarely allowed inside. Rings of security. Doors like bank vaults. Marine guards in blast-proof booths with no inclination for chit-chat. The procedures can vary, depending on the facility and the current state of alert, but it has invariably felt unwelcoming, even to an American with all his boxes ticked. 
Among my favorite embassies: Hanoi, Jakarta, Phnom Penh, Yangon and Moscow. 
Amman, Islamabad, Bangkok, Seoul and New Delhi - not so much.
"Embassy" now tends to mean "compound," with offices, living quarters and recreational facilities all grouped behind high walls. 
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has come in for particular scorn, with its 27 buildings, housing units for 600 people, indoor pool and basketball courts. Some in Congress have said it will cost $2 billion a year just to secure and operate the place. A slide show of the compound as it was being completed is here. 
The new U.S. Embassy in London also has had its detractors, and The Times's architecture critic, Nicolai Ouroussoff, has called it"a bland glass cube in an overly elaborate, quiltlike scrim." He compared it, not favorably, to "a corporate office block." 
The old embassy was forced to leave its tony but vulnerable location in Mayfair; the new billion-dollar embassy is in Nine Elms, in what had been a light-manufacturing area south of the Thames. 
Nicolai did note that some landscape elements, like two small meadows and a reflecting pool, also serve as discreet security measures, and he called them "an eye-opening expression of the irresolvable tensions involved in trying to design an emblem of American values when you know it may become the next terrorist target."
"It's hard to think of a project, in fact, that more perfectly reflects the country's current struggle to maintain a welcoming, democratic image while under the constant threat of attack."
 We'd love to hear embassy and consulate stories from our well-traveled Rendezvous readers - of any nationality, wherever you're located. Did a diplomat ever get you out of a jam or smooth over a dispute overseas? Have you found any embassies particularly welcoming - or markedly unfriendly? Do you expect more of these embassy-fortresses in the future? Does "safe" have to mean "ugly"? And is a "secure" and "open" embassy now an oxymoron?

HEADLINE: Children of Aging Parents Are Often Nearby, Study Finds

BYLINE: PAULA SPAN


HIGHLIGHT: Many adult children struggle to provide care from afar, but recent research suggests that distance may be less a problem than once thought. 

 BODY:
Who moves?
For decades, demographers and gerontologists have investigated the senior migration. Researchers talked about "amenity moves" when healthy retirees head for places with gentler climates and lower costs of living, and "assistance moves" when those same people return, less healthy and more needy, to live near family. They published articles about the so-called J-shaped curve.
"It wasn't until later that people began to ask, 'What about the kids?'" said Michal Engelman, a University of Chicago gerontologist and an author of a new study that helps answer that question. "We had a hunch there was more to this story."
Isn't there always? Much of what we think we know about who lives where as people age - a key factor in this country, which plunks elder care responsibility so squarely on family shoulders - is simplistic or plain wrong.
How often, for instance, have you heard about our increasingly mobile society, often part of a lament about self-centered children abandoning the old folks at home? But mobility rates in the United States have declined among all age groups, in a nearly unbroken pattern, for 60 years.
"Although there may be good reasons to worry about the future of family care provided to elderly individuals, increased geographic mobility does not appear to be one of them," the demographers Douglas Wolf and Charles Longino Jr. wrote in a much-noticed 2005 article in The Gerontologist.
Dr. Wolf examined more recent census data for me and pointed out that, post-recession, the decline has continued: The percentage of Americans who moved in the past year reached an all-time low (11.6 percent) in 2010. Ours is a decreasingly mobile society, geographically and otherwise.
In fact, a great majority of older Americans don't relocate, and most live quite near family. In Dr. Engelman's sample of about 8,000 people over age 69, drawn from three waves of the national Health and Retirement Study, 73 percent of those who lived more than 10 miles from their nearest child stayed at that distance over the four years the team investigated. Only 14 percent wound up living closer to a child.
And in most of these "proximity-enhancing moves," it wasn't frail snowbirds returning to chillier but more supportive locations. 
"It's way more likely to be children who move closer," said Dr. Engelman, whose study appears in the journal Research on Aging. Among families who experienced "enhanced intergenerational proximity" -- don't you love the way academics write? -- adult children were 1.6 times as likely to relocate closer to their parents as the parents were to move nearby.
A long list of factors influence these decisions, on both sides of the generational divide. For parents, their predictions about how likely they were to live another 10 years played a significant role, regardless of their actual health. Moving can involve financial and psychological costs, and "the probability of survival is part of a calculation people make," Dr. Engelman said. "They'd have more time to offset those costs and enjoy the benefits" of closeness to children and grandchildren. But parents' "anticipated longevity" played no significant role in children's relocations.
Among seniors, women are more likely than men to move closer to children; divorced people and widows move closer more frequently than those with spouses. Black, Asian and Hispanic older adults are more likely to make proximity moves than white ones.
Having long-term care insurance - agents, sharpen your pencils - made parents less likely to move closer, apparently because "it shows potentially less need for family care," Dr. Engelman hypothesized. "If they need more help, they'll be able to get it." Homeownership and long residence in a neighborhood also reduce proximity moving.
On the children's side, unsurprisingly, proximity moves happen significantly more often when their parents report poor health. But providing help may not be their only reason, Dr. Engelman pointed out. "Having a relatively low income" -- less than $35,000 a year -- "makes them much more likely to move closer to parents."
Perhaps it's easier to pull up stakes when you aren't earning much. Or perhaps the parents aren't always the dependent parties. "In many ways, older people are also a resource, able to provide support and an anchor for the family," said Dr. Engelman, who has a long interest in intergenerational relationships.
So, who moves? "These things are complicated," she concluded. "Decisions arise from a whole lifetime of family relationships. But this does tell us that people think about this as a collective family decision. It's not unilateral."

HEADLINE: Carlyle Buys Controlling Stake in Brazilian Furniture Retailer

BYLINE: VINOD SREEHARSHA


HIGHLIGHT: The Carlyle Group said Thursday that it had acquired a 60 percent stake in Tok &#038; Stok, a Brazilian furniture company, in a move that positions it to take advantage of the country's consumer retail market. 

 BODY:
SAO PAULO, Brazil - The Carlyle Group said Thursday that it had acquired a 60 percent stake in Tok & Stok, a Brazilian furniture company, in a move that positions it to take advantage of the country's consumer retail market. 
It is the second such deal Carlyle announced in this sector in the last two weeks. Earlier this month, Carlyle said it had acquired a 25 percent stake in the Brazilian equipment rental company Grupo Orguel.
The amount Carlyle paid for Tok & Stok was not disclosed, but a source with knowledge of the deal told DealBook that it was approximately 700 million reais, or $347 million. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms were private. The news of the deal was earlier reported by the Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico. 
Regis and Ghislaine Dubrule, the French couple who founded Tok & Stok, will retain 40 percent control. Ms. Dubrule will become chief executive, taking over for her husband. 
The deal is subject to approval by Brazilian regulatory authorities but is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
Tok & Stok, founded in 1979 and based in Barueri, in Sao Paulo State, said it generated about 1 billion reais, or $495 million, in sales last year.
It has 35 stores in Brazil and 3,300 employees. Most stores are in the country's southeast region, so the company needs to increase its presence in Brazil's north, a major source of the country's emerging middle class. 
Various Brazilian investment firms had approached Tok & Stok about equity investments over the last 12 years, according to a second source, a Brazilian investor with direct knowledge of the talks. But the owners had held out until now. 
The investor added that, "I like this deal and the space and think the company will either I.P.O. or get sold to Ikea." 
Carlyle will finance the acquisition through its South America Buyout fund and the Fundo Brasil de Internacionalizacao de Empresas, a local fund advised by Carlyle and Banco do Brasil.
The two deals this month show that Carlyle is keen on a growing sector, said Cate Ambrose, head of the New York-based Latin American Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. "Carlyle is focused on domestic consumption and bidding aggressively to get these opportunities," she said. "It's a direct reflection that retailing is a really big opportunity in Brazil." 
In a recent Latin American Private Equity Survey, conducted by Ms. Ambrose's group and Coller Capital, about 70 percent of local and foreign funds interviewed said the most attractive sector for private equity investment in Latin America over the next three years would be consumer retail.
An earlier version of this post misspelled the city in Brazil in which the furniture company Tok & Stok is based. It is Barueri, not Baruari.

HEADLINE: 4 Years After Lehman's Demise, Regulators Debate Overhaul

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Mark Wetjen, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told an industry group that the agency was debating how to crack down on foreign derivatives trading. 

 BODY:
Four years after Wall Street teetered on the brink of collapse, regulators are struggling to rein in foreign risk-taking that imperils American banks. 
On Thursday, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the $700 trillion derivatives business, outlined the risks that remain. In a speech to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a financial industry trade group, the commissioner, Mark Wetjen, highlighted "the very real danger that risks undertaken abroad can seriously impact the health of financial institutions, and the broader economy, here at home."
Although the agency has imposed checks on derivatives trading in the United States, just how to crack down on foreign trading is still being debated. 
 In June, the agency took a first step, introducing a plan to oversee Wall Street banks that ship derivatives trading overseas. The agency's draft proposal, stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, would apply new derivatives rules to American banks that have foreign units and foreign banks that conduct significant trading in the United States.
Mr. Wetjen, a Democratic commissioner at the C.F.T.C., highlighted the agency's plan to rein in overseas derivatives trading. But in the speech, delivered on the eve of the four-year anniversary of Lehman Brothers' demise, he also sounded a note of skepticism on certain details. 
"I continue to have concerns, however, about the clarity, scope, and workability of the proposals in certain areas," he said. 
Gary Gensler, the agency's Democratic chairman and the architect of the plan, has cited the recent multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase as a "stark reminder" of how overseas trading can reverberate in the United States. 
But the plan is far from a done deal. The agency has spent weeks hashing out internal disputes, and a final decision is not expected until later this year. 
Mr. Wetjen is playing a crucial role in the negotiations. A former aide to Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, he is the newest member of the five-person commission leadership. Mr. Wetjen has sided with his fellow Democrats on every Dodd-Frank rule while positioning himself as a more independent voice from Mr. Gensler. 
When the agency was readying the cross-border proposal in June, Mr. Wetjen pushed for more flexibility. He also suggested that the financial industry have additional time to comply.
He reiterated some concerns on Thursday, saying the agency may not have provided sufficient "clarity" about the timing and scope of the plan. "The commission must do better," he said. 
Mr. Wetjen, who has called for the agency to complete the plan as "interpretive guidance" rather than a formal rule-making, also advocated so-called substituted compliance. Under such a plan, banks based overseas can seek an exemption if they face similar rules from foreign regulators.
"In light of the commission's limited resources, efficient regulation through deference to comparable regulation just makes sense," he said. 
Despite his concerns, Mr. Wetjen underscored his support for the the broader regulatory overhaul, noting that his speech came nearly four years to the day that firms like the American International Group nearly collapsed. Foreign derivatives contracts written by A.I.G., the giant insurance company, which received a $182 billion federal lifeline, brought American firms to their knees.
"Regulation will not prevent every risk from materializing at a financial firm in any given jurisdiction," he said, while adding that "we must do what we can to prevent such risks from damaging our economy."

HEADLINE: How Much Would Free College Cost for All New Yorkers?

BYLINE: TED C. FISHMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Less than you might think. 

 BODY:
In the magazine's Education Issue, I write about the Kalamazoo Promise, a scholarship program that gives a full ride to all students who graduate from Kalamazoo public schools and go to college in Michigan. To replicate the program in New York City, to cover the college tuition of all 52,000 students who graduate from the nation's largest school system every year, an endowment of something like $20 billion would be needed, according to Keith Luke, at the Connecticut-based Commonfund, which manages $25 billion in assets for nonprofit institutions. "Such an endowment," he says, "would provide for annual tuition payments of $5,000 for each student for four years, growing annually at the rate of inflation for higher education." Forbes magazine estimates that 57 billionaires live in the city. Mayor Bloomberg himself has donated more than $2.4 billion to favorite causes, and in 2013 Columbia University will finish a $5 billion fund-raising campaign, bringing in $1 billion more than its initial goal. So the money for a New York Promise is probably out there, but it would require one of the world's biggest philanthropic efforts.

HEADLINE: Trial to Begin for Former UBS Trader Accused of Hiding Huge Loss

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Opening arguments begin Friday in the trial of Kweku M. Adoboli, who faces charges of false accounting and fraud in connection with a $2.3 billion loss at the UBS investment bank. 

 BODY:
LONDON - UBS will face the harsh glare of the spotlight again on Friday, as opening arguments begin in the trial of a former trader accused of hiding a multibillion-dollar loss at the investment bank.
Kweku M. Adoboli, 32, the former trader, faces charges of false accounting and fraud in connection with a $2.3 billion loss at the bank. He has pleaded not guilty.
"As uncomfortable as the entire trial will be for UBS, it will show us what the consequences are when misconduct occurs or when individuals do not take their responsibilities seriously," the bank's chief executive, Sergio P. Ermotti, said in an internal memo made public by the firm.
 UBS, which has struggled to regain its footing since the financial crisis, has been plagued by a number of scandals in recent years.
In 2009, the investment bank, based in Switzerland, agreed to pay $780 million to settle a tax fraud case with American authorities. Three former UBS executives were convicted earlier this year for rigging bids in the municipal bond market.
The bank has also been ensnared by a global investigation into rate manipulation. UBS, which is one of more than a dozen institutions under investigation, struck an immunity deal with authorities.
The case against Mr. Adoboli has only added to the questions about the bank's oversight and risk management.
After the financial crisis, UBS, which had been hobbled by bad real estate bets, vowed to overhaul its internal controls. But the bank disclosed two years later that it had "discovered unauthorized speculative trading," and Mr. Adoboli was arrested. According to the charges, his activities spanned more than three years, starting in 2008.
UBS subsequently conducted an internal investigation into the loss. The review showed that the firm's risk controls had raised red flags about unusual trading activity, but that managers had failed to adequately follow up. "We have to be straight with ourselves," Mr. Ermotti, the chief executive, said in 2011. "In no circumstances should something like this ever occur."
The UBS trading scandal echoes past cases.
In 2010, Jérôme Kerviel, a trader at the Paris-based bank Société Générale, was convicted of generating more than $6 billion in losses. He is appealing the matter. Another trader, Nicholas W. Leeson of Barings Bank, racked up $1 billion in losses, prompting the failure of the British institution in 1995. Mr. Leeson pleaded guilty and served four years in prison.
Mr. Adoboli started his finance career at UBS. He joined the bank as an investment adviser trainee in London shortly after graduating from Nottingham University in 2003, and eventually worked his way up to the Delta One desk, a plain-vanilla version of derivatives trading. Traders in this group create investments that track specific financial assets like a basket of company stocks.
Mr. Adoboli fired his lawyers at Kingsley Napley, the firm that had previously represented Mr. Leeson. Mr. Adoboli is now represented by Bark & Company, another law firm in London.
If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. The trial is expected to last up to eight weeks. Both current and former UBS employees could be called as witnesses, though the firm has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Legal restrictions in Britain limit the information that can be reported about the case to avoid biasing the proceedings. UBS and a lawyer for Mr. Adoboli declined to comment.
When the trading scandal erupted last year, it reverberated through the upper ranks of UBS. The chief executive, Oswald J. Grübel, whom UBS had recruited to oversee its turnaround, promptly resigned. The co-chiefs of global equities, the division where the loss occurred, also left the firm.
The firm's profit also suffered. After disclosing the trading losses, UBS reported that quarterly earnings dropped 39 percent to $1.2 billion.
The blowup has worsened the bank's financial woes. Like other European banks, UBS is dealing with the sluggish economy and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
With investment banking operations slumping, institutions have moved swiftly to lay off staff and revamp their strategies. UBS has announced 3,500 job cuts, with about half expected in the investment banking division. It has also shifted its focus toward wealth management.
"The banks are slowly realizing there are parts of their businesses that just don't make money," said Pete Hahn, a fellow at Cass Business School in London. "A fundamental rethink is under way."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Fallout

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The deadly attack on an American consulate in Libya on Tuesday pushed foreign policy to the front of the presidential campaign, with Mitt Romney quickly attacking President Obama for his response to the situation, Peter Baker and Ashley Parker write. But Mr. Romney's attempt to use the event to draw a contrast with Mr. Obama on foreign policy started a confrontation that landed him on the defensive and drew attention away from questions about Mr. Obama's handling of uprisings in the Arab world.
 In contrast to the helpful and forceful response of Libyan officials to the attack on the American consulate, Egyptian officials' tepid response to attacks the same day on the American Embassy in Cairo has illuminated concerns in the Obama administration that "bigger, longer-term problems" lie in Egypt, Helene Cooper and Mark Landler write.
 Mr. Obama is increasingly leaning on his biggest donorsand fund-raisers for his re-election campaign, and Mr. Romney has fielded a similarly powerful group, Nicholas Confessore writes. Watchdog groups say that the campaigns' willingness to reward those individuals with perks like access and entertainment confirm a give-more, get-more state of play in the game of presidential fund-raising.
The fight between Chicago and its teachers' union threatens to expose rifts within the Democratic coalition that could undermine Mr. Obama's re-election effort, Steven Greenhouse writes. To conservatives' delight, the strike pits Mayor Rahm Emanuel and wealthy liberals against the teachers' union and other labor groups, all allies of Mr. Obama, who has tried to stay on the sidelines.
 Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, is playing up his native appeal in Wisconsin, as both campaign see the state as up for grabs in November, Jeff Zeleny and Trip Gabriel write. Republicans are hopeful after Democrats' unsuccessful efforts in 2010 to recall Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican. But Democrats aren't giving up easily on a state Mr. Obama won in 2008, running ads in the state starting Wednesday and sending in Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. today.
Congressional negotiators appear unlikely to reach a deal on a five-year farm bill after the previous authorization expired last month, Jennifer Steinhauer writes. The House refuses to act on the Senate's legislation or its own version of the bill, and the political polarization on Capitol Hill makes coming up with new legislation impossible.
 A federal judge in Washington has blocked the government from enforcing a provision of law that allows the authorities to hold certain terror suspects indefinitely without trial, a ruling handed down as the House voted to extend a law that expands the government's surveillance powers. Charlie Savage writes that the ruling against the Obama administration and the House action signal that "the debate over the balance between national security and civil liberties is still unfolding 11 years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11."
Happening in Washington:
Economic data expected today include the August producer price index and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed by weekly mortgage rates at 10.
Mr. Romney is scheduled to make a campaign stop at 11 in Fairfax, Va.
At 2:15 p.m., Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will hold a news conference as the central bank's policy committee concludes two days of meetings on interest rates. The panel will issue a statement at 12:30 p.m., followed by an updated economic forecast at 2.
At 7, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will deliver remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's annual awards ceremony.

HEADLINE: Investors Wary Over Giant Aerospace Deal

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Shares of the European aerospace giants EADS and BAE Systems tumbled on Thursday as investors reacted negatively to the announced merger talks between the two companies. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Shares of the European aerospace giants EADS and BAE Systems tumbled on Thursday as investors reacted negatively to the announced merger talks between the two companies.
A leading shareholder in EADS, which is the parent of Airbus, also said it would have to review the consequences of the potential merger before making a decision about the deal. 
If completed, the deal would create an industry giant with a combined market value of almost $50 billion, annual revenue of more than $90 billion; it would employ around 220,000 people worldwide.
 Shares in EADS fell nearly 8 percent in midday trading in Paris on Thursday, while stock in BAE Systems, which is listed in London, dropped 6.6 percent.
At a difficult time for the industry, the companies, Europe's two largest aerospace firms, announced on Wednesday that they were in talks about a potential merger. 
In the wake of the global economic slowdown, many countries are pulling back on military spending. Sales of passenger airlines have improved recently, but have remained sluggish during the recent financial market volatility.
Any merger would also have to navigate a minefield of regulatory approvals, including in the United States and Europe, before a deal could be completed.
Despite the potential cost savings from combining operations, some of EADS' investors, which include the French and Spanish governments, reacted coolly to the discussions. 
The French conglomerate Lagardère, which owns a 7.5 percent stake in EADS, said on Thursday that it had not decided whether to support the deal. 
"The Lagardère group intends to ensure that all consequences associated with the proposed EADS-BAE Systems merger are taken into consideration in determining the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction before it consents to the deal," it said in a statement.
Under British law, EADS and BAE Systems have until Oct. 10 to decide whether to pursue a merger.

2 Aerospace Giants Consider Joining Forces | EADS, which is the parent of Airbus, and BAE Systems are looking to join forces as their respective industries become increasingly competitive. While government contracts provide steady revenue, large European countries and the United States are pulling back on their military spending, weighing on the prospects of BAE Systems. Passenger airlines, the main customers of Airbus, have perked up lately, after some difficult periods.
"They are complementary businesses," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group. "This is a way of achieving balance from the defense side." DealBook »
Treasury Backs Preliminary Standard Chartered Settlement | Treasury Department lawyers have recommended a preliminary settlement with Standard Chartered that would allow the British bank to pay a penalty to state and federal prosecutors and move beyond accusations that it disobeyed laws governing money transfers, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in The New York Times.
A potential prepayment amount that the lawyers approved this week would be smaller than the $340 million the bank had to pay to New York State's banking regulator in a related case, three officials with direct knowledge of the settlement talks told The Times.
The Times reports that the smaller penalty is a result of determinations by federal authorities and Manhattan prosecutors that the bank's suspected wrongdoing was far less extensive than what the state regulator claimed. It is also smaller because the bank came forward voluntarily with information, law enforcement officials said. NEW YORK TIMES

HEADLINE: Right Begins to Rally Around Romney's Response to Attacks

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: A day after many Republicans seemed reluctant to endorse Mitt Romney's critique of the Obama administration in Libya and Egypt, The Wall Street Journal and other prominent conservatives came to his defense. 

 BODY:
Republicans were not exactly rushing to defend Mitt Romney's brisk critique of the Obama administration's response to a controversial Web video and the protests it seemed to help spawn. However, by Thursday, the right establishment was starting to circle the wagons around Mr. Romney, the Republican presidential candidate.
Though some have said Mr. Romney might have spoken too soon when he called the Obama administration "disgraceful" after the American Embassy in Cairo issued a statement, that came out before the protests began, condemning the anti-Islam video. Mr. Romney said, "It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks." But, The Wall Street Journal dismissed the relevance of chronology.
"Whatever the timing of the Cairo Embassy's statements, Mr. Romney is right that a U.S. Embassy ought to ignore YouTube videos produced by obscure cranks," wrote The Journal's editorial board, which is a key bellwether of conservative sentiment. The editorial concluded: "His political faux pax was to offend a pundit class that wants to cede the foreign policy debate to Mr. Obama without thinking seriously about the trouble for America that is building in the world."
However, one of the pundits who might have been offended was a conservative Journal columnist, Peggy Noonan. The embassy attacks that left four Americans dead were a "water's edge moment," she said in a video posted Wednesday afternoon. "And everybody should cool it, absorb, think and then say only serious and meaningful things, and never allow themselves to look like they are using it as a political opportunity. Romney looked weak today."
Still, the Republican nominee had other high-profile defenders on the right. Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush's spokesman, tried to cast an earlier controversial remark by Mr. Romney as a prescient insight. Referring to Mr. Romney's July suggestion that cultural differences explain economic disparities between Israel and the Palestinian territories, Mr. Fleischer issued a series of Twitter messages on Thursday morning:
(1/3)Remember Romney's remark in Israel about culture and why some nations prosper?
- Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer)13 Sep 12
(2/3) What does it say about a culture where some (not all) "write" movie reviews with rocket propelled grenades and murder?
- Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer)13 Sep 12
(3/3) And that assumes the movie actually had anything to do with the 9/11/12 attacks.
- Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer)13 Sep 12
The conservative blogger Erick Erickson's argument that the media has "beclowned themselves" is also bouncing around the right side of the blogosphere. Rather than reporting on the facts on the ground in North Africa and how the White House was responding, he writes, "the media wanted to focus on Mitt Romney."
And when Mr. Erickson concludes by focusing on Mr. Romney himself, he writes that the candidate's statement was no gaffe, but a simple statement of his views: "He, I, and many others really do think Barack Obama is an apologist."

HEADLINE: Reaction to Libya Attack Could Color Poll Analysis, and Vice Versa

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: In the next week or so, it may be hard to discern what polling effects reflect momentum from the conventions and what are a response to the fallout from Libya. 

 BODY:
Earlier on Thursday, I suggested that we have now gotten some pretty good guidance on the size of President Obama's convention bounce. For the next week or two, most of our attention will be focused on how much of that bounce he maintains -- and how it translates into swing states -- and not on trying to gauge its magnitude.
However, there has been a significant news event since the conventions, with the killing of four Americans in Libya.
Personally, I find the murky back story about the film that ostensibly prompted the attacks more interesting than its implications for the election, but the attacks do have the potential to complicate polling analysis.
In general, the historical experience is that unexpected foreign policy crises are more likely to move the polls in favor of the incumbent in the immediate term -- the rally-around-the-flag effect. However, the effects are much less predictable as the crises play out, with their various diplomatic, military and economic implications. 
Even acknowledging that Mitt Romney offered a poorly reviewed initial response to the attacks, I think we'll need to be a bit careful if there are signs of a shift toward Mr. Obama in the polls because of them.
I don't mean to suggest that the attacks won't have any implications for the elections in November, or that we'll make no effort to analyze what they might be. But it will be important to keep the causality straight. In the event that Mr. Obama appears to gain any further ground in the polls over the next week or so, it may well be improper to describe them as reflecting continued "momentum" from his convention, when the public's reaction to the Libya attacks may be responsible instead.
Of course, this cuts both ways. Both Mr. Romney's reaction to the attacks and the news media's generally negative depiction of it may have been colored by the recent trend in the polls. And as much as an incumbent might seek to cloak himself in the prestige of the presidency, Mr. Obama's reaction will not necessarily be untainted by political considerations.
The issue is an inconvenient one for Mr. Romney both in its timing -- coming just after a difficult convention period for him -- and in its substance, since foreign policy is one area in which the polls show a clear advantage for Mr. Obama (as is often the case for an incumbent president).
I'm not going to offer any opinion about Mr. Romney's reaction to the attacks - which is not to say that I don't have one. But I think it can be acknowledged that he is potentially operating on an unlevel playing field. His reactions are liable to be judged in a harsher light, both by the news media and probably also by voters, almost no matter what they might be.
And yet, an exceptionally skilled campaign ought to recognize that it is never operating in a vacuum, and that the evaluation of its reaction to news events is likely to be affected by these contingencies. It may have to employ some delicacy in choosing its battles.

HEADLINE: On the Trail in Colorado, Obama Tries Balancing Campaigning With Mideast Events

BYLINE: JIM RUTENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama spent the second day of what was to be an upbeat swing through the politically vital Mountain West on Thursday balancing the somber tone that a foreign policy crisis demands and the hyper-partisan rhetoric that eight thousand Coloradoans came to hear. 

 BODY:
GOLDEN, Colo. - President Obama spent the second day of what was to be an upbeat swing through the politically vital Mountain West on Thursday balancing the somber tone that a foreign policy crisis demands and the hyper-partisan rhetoric that eight thousand Coloradoans came to hear.
At an outdoor rally under a clear blue sky here, where the crowd was so excited that it cheered a flock of squawking geese overhead before the president spoke, Mr. Obama began with a somber reminder that four Americans had been killed in Benghazi, Libya, more than 6,000 miles away.
"Obviously, our hearts are heavy this week,'' Mr. Obama said, as a hush fell over the crowd. But to a wider television audience he vowed: "I want people around the world to hear me: to all those who would do us harm, no act of terror will go unpunished." He added, "no act of violence shakes the resolve of the United States of America."
But he went from there into the new, convention-tested stump speech he would have given had anti-American protests not broken out in Libya and Egypt on Tuesday, and in Yemen on Thursday.
The president drew cheers for mentioning Bill Clinton and his convention speech line about the Republicans' budget arithmetic and laughs when he riffed that Republicans are seeking to solve all the nation's problems with tax cuts: "You need to make a restaurant reservation, you don't need a new iPhone: there's a tax cut for that," he said.
One word that went unspoken here on Thursday: Romney. Instead, Mr. Obama made reference to his "opponent,'' which aides said was prompted by the president's desire to remain mindful of the tone of his political rhetoric amid the events in the Middle East.
Aides also said they wanted to stay out of the way as Mr. Romney continues to take questions about his initial tone on the crisis and the administration's response to it.
White House officials said they were planning to avoid getting drawn into a political argument over the killings in Libya, and telegraphed comfort with the campaign debate moving onto foreign policy turf, which they consider better for them than Mr. Romney, whose campaign has rested mostly on his economic arguments.
But it was not all smooth sailing. On the way to the event here Mr. Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, was forced to address questions about Mr. Obama's comments to the Spanish language network Telemundo that he does not consider the new government of Egypt either an ally or a foe.
Mr. Carney said: "The president, in diplomatic and legal terms, was speaking correctly. We do not have an alliance treaty with Egypt. Ally is a legal term of art. As I said, we do not have a mutual defense treaty with Egypt, like we do, for example, with our NATO allies. But as the president has said, Egypt is a longstanding and close partner of the United States and we have built on that foundation in supporting Egypt's transition to democracy and working with the new government."

HEADLINE: Facts, Arguments and Politics

BYLINE: GARY GUTTING


HIGHLIGHT: In political debates, getting the facts right doesn't guarantee a valid argument. 

 BODY:
Emotions drive politics. So why all the concern about facts and fact-checking? Because, among the whirl of our feelings, there is a desire for our beliefs to be rational, to have support from the facts. We're uneasy if we can't make a plausible case that what we say is true. Notice that political campaigns do all they can to undermine the analyses of the fact-checkers who award them "Pinocchios." At a minimum, citing the facts is one important rhetorical ploy. I recall hearing of a university administrator who allegedly admitted, "Sometimes telling the truth is the best way to get people to do what you want."
But, strictly speaking, facts by themselves provide only the premises of a rational argument. To draw a conclusion, we also need a logical process of reasoning. Sometimes, the process is obvious and insisting on it a mere technicality: if the train is in fact bearing down on you, the conclusion is that you should get off the tracks. But in political debates, there's often a questionable move from facts to a conclusion.
Two pieces in a recent issue of Newsweek illustrate my point: Niall Ferguson's case for voting against President Obama, andBernard-Henri Lévy's case for intervening in Syria. Ferguson was widely criticized for ignoring or distorting important facts. But even assuming that his facts are impeccable, his argument from them is ineffective. By contrast, Lévy's argument is logically impressive, regardless of whether its factual premises are false.

Ferguson gets off to a very slow logical start. He first cites four promises Obama made in his inaugural address: to increase employment and economic growth, to rebuild infrastructure, to make health care better and less expensive and to reform education. He says Obama shouldn't be re-elected because his "scorecard on every one of these bold pledges is pitiful." But Ferguson says nothing further about infrastructure and education, and discusses only the economic aspects of health care.
He then begins to build a case for Obama's economic failure, citing negative data on unemployment, government debt and future increases in health care costs. But he eventually admits that "there's some truth" to the rejoinder that Obama's problems were due to factors beyond his control (mistakes by the Bush administration, Wall Street abuses, the European collapse). This leads him to shift focus to what he calls Obama's major "political mistakes": letting Congress pass inadequate measures on stimulus and financial reform, supporting a health care plan that didn't reform the system and will increase the deficit, and failing to achieve a "grand bargain" on the deficit. It turns out that these are the heart of Ferguson's case against re-electing Obama.
Even if the mistakes amount to an egregious failure, the argument still needs to give reasons to think that Romney will do a better job. Ferguson admits that "Romney is not the best candidate for the presidency I can imagine." But he cites the following facts in his favor: Romney has made a very good choice of a running mate (Ferguson met Ryan at a dinner party and "Ryan blew me away"); and Romney has business and executive experience.
Overall, then, once we get past his false starts, Ferguson's argument is quite simple:
1. Obama has made some serious mistakes in managing the economy.
2. Romney is not the best candidate, but:
 a. His choice for vice president was very good.
 b. He has experience as a businessman and as an executive.
Therefore, Romney should be elected.
There are likely to be millions of Americans who accept the premises of this argument (1, 2a, 2b) but quite rightly see no reason to vote for Romney. They may think that Obama's mistakes have been offset by important achievements (foreign policy, education, the auto bailout, environmental policy), and that Romney, despite his experience and running mate, supports wrong-headed policies across the board and lacks, say, the honesty and empathy needed to be a good president.
The fundamental flaw of Ferguson's argument - even assuming the truth of his premises - is that it is not based on a comprehensive analysis of the issues relevant to the decision it tries to support. To see what I mean, let us look at Lévy's argument about Syria.
Lévy is a flamboyant figure, often criticizedas a narcissistic self-publicizer, who appeals more to rhetoric than to logic. But in this article, at any rate, he displays the virtues of his philosophical training and presents a rigorous argument.
Since his article lacks the false starts and digressions of Ferguson's piece, I can lay out his argument much more easily:
1. There is a moral need to intervene in Syria.
2. There is a basis in international law for intervention.
3. There are a number of realistic ways to intervene effectively.
4. There are not likely to be any major bad consequences of an intervention.
Therefore, intervening in Syria would be good policy.
I am not claiming that these premises are true. But if they are, then they make a good case for their conclusion. This is because the premises cover at least a large set of the issues that are relevant to intervening in Syria. They provide a plausible overall framework in which the facts (premises1-4), if Lévy is right about them, make a strong logical case for his conclusion.
The argument is, of course, not deductive but only inductive(probabilistic). If you accept Lévy's premises, then you can refute his argument only by presenting a more adequate general framework for thinking about the question of intervening in Syria. You might, for example, put forward a pacifist view, on which any sort of war is immoral. But it would not be easy to show that such a framework is superior to Lévy's. By contrast, the logical framework of Ferguson's argument is obviously inadequate: it simply doesn't give a plausible analysis of the issues at stake.
What is the moral? That facts alone are necessary but not sufficient for a good argument. As important as getting the facts right is putting the facts into a comprehensive logical structure that supports your conclusion. This structure must present a plausible account of the various factors relevant to the conclusion. Without it, even an impeccable set of facts does not give us a good argument. The recent journalistic trend toward serious fact-checking holds considerable promise for improving our political debates. But we also need a serious effort at argument-checking.

HEADLINE: Do Romney's Budget Pledges Threaten S.B.A. Loans?

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The Romney campaign declined to comment either on whether S.B.A. appropriations would be squeezed or, more generally, on the agency's place in Mr. Romney's small-business agenda. 

 BODY:
Should Mitt Romney become president next year, he will face a difficult question pitting his eagerness to help small businesses against his eagerness to shrink the government: What to do with the Small Business Administration
Since taking office in 2009, President Obama is on track to nearly double the S.B.A.'s budget. But apart from a burst of stimulus spending in 2009 and 2010 to increase lending temporarily, the infusion has not expanded the S.B.A.'s reach - it has merely allowed the agency to maintain its existing loan volume. Much of the S.B.A.'s mission is to guarantee loans to small companies that banks would otherwise not make, and steep cuts would likely force the agency to turn away borrowers.
While Mr. Romney's campaign has been short on specifics about how it plans to achieve a "smaller, simpler, smarter" federal government, it does make two promises on its Web site that could affect the S.B.A.:
 Send Congress a bill on Day One that cuts nonsecurity discretionary spending by 5 percent across the board
 Pass the House Republican Budget proposal, rolling back President Obama's government expansion by capping nonsecurity discretionary spending below 2008 levels
Either proposal could make it harder for small-business borrowers to receive government-backed loans, because federal law requires the government to set aside money to cover the cost of loans that it estimates will go bad, and the recession has driven those costs up by making small-business loans much riskier. Before the recession, fees on borrowers and lenders paid for the cost of loan defaults, but those fees have reached a cap set by law and can't be increased unless Congress changes the law. Instead, since 2010, Congress has appropriated a subsidy to make up for the difference between the fees received and the allocation for defaults.
Largely because of the subsidy, the S.B.A.'s appropriation for small-business programs (that is, excluding funds for disaster loans, which the S.B.A. also administers) in 2013 will likely approach $1 billion, nearly double the appropriation in 2008. Loan subsidies for the agency's two main loan programs, which cost taxpayers nothing in 2008, will grow to somewhere around $340 million, enough to support $22 billion in financing.
There is a fairly direct correlation between the size of the subsidy and the amount of lending - if the subsidy shrinks by 5 percent, lending will fall by roughly the same amount. That said, estimating the effects of Mr. Romney's proposed 5 percent cut is a little complicated, if only because it is unclear what the starting point for the cut would be. Is it the president's proposed budget for 2013? Is it the actual appropriation for 2012? Is it something else? (The Romney campaign declined to clarify.)
Taking 5 percent off what the Obama administration has proposed - and the House and Senate have largely accepted - for the S.B.A. in fiscal year 2013 would probably amount to a modest cut, but could still shut out some borrowers unless the agency is able to move some money around. If, on the other hand, Mr. Romney chooses to cut 5 percent from the 2012 budget, S.B.A. lending could be decimated. According to an Obama administration budget analyst who ran the numbers -- but insisted on anonymity -- the agency would be reduced to guaranteeing just $13.3 billion in loans in 2013. That is a third less than the $19.4 billion it has approved so far this year.
And slashing spending to below the level in 2008, when there were no subsidies, could effectively end S.B.A. lending. In the current economic environment, the loan programs cannot legally operate without a subsidy appropriated by Congress. (The S.B.A. will likely have some subsidy funds leftover at the end of 2012 that it can use next year, but once that money is spent, it will need a new appropriation to continue making loans.)
There appears to be little enthusiasm in Congress for raising those fees to substitute for the subsidy. In a budget letter this year, Republicans on the House Small Business Committee opposed both raising loan fees and cutting subsidies. The House, in its appropriation bill for 2013, actually passed a subsidy that was even larger than the president requested to support more loans.
But in an e-mail statement, Representative Sam Graves, the committee chairman, supported a 5 percent budget cut for the S.B.A. - even from the agency's actual 2012 appropriation. "Our massive debt is acting as an ominous cloud over our economy, therefore, cutting the federal budget is necessary to help provide a better economic environment for small-business growth," he said. "We can cut a lot of fat in every agency, including the S.B.A. There are some core programs that are useful, but there's no question that there's 5 percent of waste in agencies and numerous duplicative programs with little to show for the taxpayers' generous investment."
The Agenda sought the Romney campaign's comment on the squeeze the S.B.A. might face and more generally on the agency's place in Mr. Romney's small-business agenda. The response from a campaign spokeswoman, Amanda Henneberg, didn't mention the S.B.A. "Governor Romney has proposed bold policies that champion small business and support the economic growth needed to help create 12 million jobs in his first term," Ms. Henneberg said in an e-mailed statement. "Chief among these policy proposals is reducing taxes on job creation through individual and corporate tax reform, stopping the increase in regulation that tangles job creators in red tape, and replacing Obamacare with real health care reform that controls cost and improves care."
The S.B.A. also went unmentioned at the Republican convention two weeks ago, which dedicated an entire night to the theme of "We Built It" - a dig at President Obama's "you didn't build that" moment in July. But even so, the choice of speakers that evening illustrated the agency's importance, perhaps unintentionally. Three of the four small-business owners who proclaimed on the dais that night that they built their businesses themselves have borrowed money with guarantees from the S.B.A. And the fourth sought business counseling from a small-business development center and a women's business center -- both organizations that are supported by grants from the S.B.A. and that might see less funding if Mr. Romney wins and follows through on his campaign pledges.

HEADLINE: Freed From the Constraints Of Plaids and Stripes

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
Far from the madding crowd, far from even Kanye and Kim -- now the organically blended Kimye -- a small band of design explorers is getting closer to entering a new dimension.
It's an exciting time in fashion, with an ambitious group in Paris, led by Phoebe Philo at Céline, Raf Simons at Dior, Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent and Nicolas Ghesquière at Balenciaga. Here in New York, focused in similar ways, are Marc Jacobs and the Proenza Schouler designers, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, who had a stellar show on Wednesday night.
Let's get the mundane business out of the way: the Proenza designers stepped things up. They set off some new technical fireworks with woven leather (in a wonky geometric pattern) and silk-jacquard tweeds based on Gerhard Richter's abstract paintings. They sharpened their low-riding silhouette. A sleek top in jet-black crochet with a slightly flared, above-the-knee leather patchwork skirt was an unbeatable look. 
Now for the fun stuff. Following contemporary artists who use the process of picture language, a few designers have embedded found images into clothing. But none have done it as effectively as Mr. Hernandez and Mr. McCollough, or with the understanding of what these blocks of image and color should ultimately represent. One obstacle has been the technical constraints of apparel. What materials will yield the most arresting results? Presumably, the garment should also be wearable.
The Proenza designers found images of a crowded swimming pool, a beach and protesters. These images were then reproduced on both double satin and leather. In their research, the designers looked at a lot of vernacular fashion: biker denim, hippie crochet and patchwork. These textures figured into their other designs, like vivid leather jackets and skirts with crochet, but they also had an indirect influence on the photo-print dresses.
Obviously these dresses evoke Tumblr, but they do more than that. The pixelated scattering of pink nailheads on the top of the protesters' dress creates a three-dimensional effect, one that works because it is quite modest. At the same time, the nailheads suggest a perennial fashion favorite, the polka dot. The Proenza designers take the archival process, at least in fashion, to a whole new level.
Francisco Costa was on a similar bend at Calvin Klein. His 3-D effects were kept under a tighter, elegant rein, but it was a delight to see how he applied the idea to tailoring, by subtly pinching a jacket's shape or using the seams or a chalk-etched black lapel to suggest extra dimension. Most of the collection came in variations of black and white. Even a silvery-white evening satin had an unusual depth.
But the clinchers in Mr. Costa's fine show were white dresses with a sheer top layer embroidered with wavy lines, like moiré silk.
Was Ralph Lauren off to tango in Argentina? Run with the bulls in Spain? A Spanish theme arrived in Lauren country on Thursday, complete with serapes and matador jackets. Plainly the King of Seventh Avenue chose to overlook Spain's economic troubles. All in all, it was a heady, smile-inducing romance, with smart-looking trousers (some of the best this season), a fringed black silk jersey cocktail dress, shirts and pants in faded teal or tomato-red suede, and plenty of kick in black embroidered evening looks.
Reed Krakoff said he wanted to inject subtle curves and roundness into his spring collection, in makeup shades, and he described the desired effect as clean and architectural. All that came across, sort of, in a show that consisted of sports-striped trousers, stocking jersey dresses, and zippered track coats in that same filmy jersey.
But with the makeup beige and the runny-looking fabrics, the collection seemed less architectural than in need of a transfusion. Some of the shapes were just plain unflattering. Remember Mr. Krakoff's first collection, with all its handsome coats, cool pants and quirky pieces? The main -- really, only -- complaint was the heaviness of some woolens. While there are some things in the new line that someone might love, like the leather, if Mr. Krakoff keeps dissecting his vision with nuanced seams, he could be left fingering a swatch.
On the subject of modern India, filmmakers like Wes Anderson and writers like Katherine Boo have been tour guides, taking us well beyond raj dreams and sari nightmares. Provided a designer uses a strong contemporary filter, the contrasts could produce interesting fashion. Unfortunately, Georgina Chapman just popped on rose-colored glasses for a Marchesa collection slanted weakly toward the Beatles' trip to India.
In a well-traveled commuter hall at Grand Central, Ms. Chapman presented many jeweled necklines, Capri pants and cascading hemlines, some in tones of coral and peacock blue that approached in gaudiness a 37th Street wholesaler. When the clothes were simplified, Ms. Chapman did fine, but many had a costume flavor.

HEADLINE: America's Health Worker Mismatch

BYLINE: By KATE TULENKO. 
Kate Tulenko, the senior director of health system innovation at IntraHealth International, is the author of ''Insourced: How Importing Jobs Impacts the Healthcare Crisis Here and Abroad.''

 BODY:
Washington
DESPITE high unemployment, there is one bright spot in the economy: while nearly all other sectors shrank during the recession, jobs in health care increased by more than 1.2 million, with most paying salaries of over $60,000. And demand for those workers will keep improving: the Affordable Care Act will add 32 million people to insurance rolls over the next several years, while the aging of America will drive the need for health care for decades to come.
But for American health workers, this is hardly good news. Despite a labor shortage, our crowded medical professional schools are turning away hundreds of thousands of qualified applicants; to fill the gap, we are importing tens of thousands of foreign workers. Today about 12 percent of the health work force is foreign-born and trained, including a quarter of all physicians. 
That's bad for American workers, but even worse for the foreign workers' home countries, including some of the world's poorest and sickest, which could use these professionals at home.
The blame lies primarily with the woeful state of schools in the health professions. Despite increased demand for their graduates, they have done little to expand their output.
Even worse, although the cost of higher education increased faster than inflation for the past two decades, the per graduate cost of health professional education has increased even faster: over the past 20 years, public medical school tuitions have increased 312 percent.
State regulators also artificially limit the number of health professionals we can train by effectively requiring that students be trained almost exclusively in teaching hospitals, even though most go on to work in clinics or community hospitals. Not only does this limit the number of people who can be educated, but the resulting increases in tuition and length of training reduce the number of students from poor and underserved communities who apply to health professional schools in the first place.
Then there's the phenomenon of credential creep: in fields like audiology, physical therapy and optometry, a therapist who once needed a master's degree must now have a doctorate to get a license, which means more years of school, higher attrition rates, higher debt, higher wage demands and fewer workers from underserved and low-income areas. The same licensing system actually favors foreign-trained health workers, who, for various reasons, do not have to meet these degree requirements.
It's no surprise, then, that the response to this self-made labor shortage has been to recruit inexpensive workers from abroad, including the 57 poor countries defined by the World Health Organization as having significant shortages of their own. Among them is India, America's largest source of foreign-trained doctors. A special visa program has made hiring these workers even easier.
A Gates Foundation study recently showed that immigration, with the United States as the most common destination, was siphoning off the largest number of African medical professionals.
The Global Health Workforce Alliance estimates that a billion people alive today will die without ever seeing a health care worker. Meanwhile, the W.H.O. estimates that below a threshold of 2.3 doctors, nurses and midwives per 1,000 people, countries are unable to provide even the most basic health services.
Multiple studies, even when controlled for poverty, show that access to health workers is directly related to mortality and health outcomes. A meta-analysis of 13 studies of developing countries showed that newborns who live more than three miles from a staffed health facility are almost twice as likely to die than infants who live closer to one. Health workers in developing countries don't just provide clinical care -- they also manage their countries' health and disaster response systems, as well as nutrition and sanitation programs, all of which crumble in their absence.
There are other casualties, closer to home. Every study that has examined how to incentivize health workers to move to underserved areas has shown that training people from these communities is the most cost-effective approach. But because we've essentially given up on recruiting from underserved places in the United States, we've made their chronic lack of health workers much worse. Some 54 million people live in the 5,700 parts of the country defined as ''health professional shortage areas,'' the communities with the worst health statistics and the worst unemployment.
In response, schools should be required to pay attention to cost effectiveness and train more workers with their existing budgets. Federal money could go toward helping these schools expand.
Meanwhile, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, which essentially let the health professions regulate their schools, could mandate that all new licensing requirements be justified with cost-effectiveness data; they could also require schools to communicate with employers to gauge the numbers and skills of workers needed.
It is irrational and immoral to recruit health workers from countries where one in five children die before their fifth birthday when we could be recruiting and training workers domestically. Doing so would help our economy, global public health and the 314 million Americans who rely on our medical system to provide high-quality, affordable care.

HEADLINE: Après Rahm, Le Déluge

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Modern nations have two economies, which exist side by side. Economy I is the tradable sector. This includes companies that make goods like planes, steel and pharmaceuticals. These companies face intense global competition and are compelled to constantly innovate and streamline. They've spent the last few decades figuring out ways to make more products with fewer workers.
Economy II is made up of organizations that do not face such intense global competition. They often fall into government-dominated sectors like health care, education, prisons and homeland security. People in this economy believe in innovation, but they don't have the sword of Damocles hanging over them so they don't pursue unpleasant streamlining as rigorously. As a result, Economy II institutions tend to get bloated and inefficient as time goes by. 
For example, between 1960 and 2006, health care spending increased twice as fast as G.D.P., but there were no comparable gains in health outcomes. A study by the Institute of Medicine estimates that 30 cents of every $1 spent on health care is wasted -- about $750 billion a year.
Over the past 50 years, spending on K-12 education has also skyrocketed. In 1960, Americans spent roughly $2,800 per student, in today's dollars. Now we spend roughly $11,000 per student. This spending binge has not produced comparable gains in student outcomes. Education productivity is down, too.
If Economy I is great at generating output without generating employment, Economy II is great at generating employment without generating output.
The problem is that the bloated Economy II is becoming a burden that Economy I can no longer carry. Unless we reform Economy II and control its spending, the bloat will crush us. National productivity will slide. The economy will stagnate.
Republicans have a direct answer for this problem. Reform Economy II so it looks more like Economy I. Introduce vouchers and other consumer driven market mechanisms to health care and education.
Democrats reject that approach. Their counterargument is that Economy II can control costs using its own internal means. Strong mayors, governors and presidents can make these systems work.
The Democratic argument is nice in theory, but can it work in practice? Can Democrats confront their own special interests and deliver results?
The Chicago teachers' strike is a test of this proposition. The Chicago school system is a classic case of a bloated, inefficient Economy II organization. The average Chicago teacher makes $76,000 a year in a city where the average worker makes $47,000 a year. Rising school costs have helped push the system deep into the red. Meanwhile, the outcomes are not good. Forty percent of students drop out and 8 percent of 11th graders meet college readiness standards.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel campaigned on real education reform, and, in office, he's tried to push it through. The response? A strike.
By Thursday night, this strike seemed to be heading toward a resolution. Both sides are giving ground, but, as best as I can tell, Emanuel has successfully preserved the core of his reform agenda. There will be longer school days and a longer school year. A child who begins in the Chicago school system in kindergarten and goes all the way through high school will have an extra two-and-a-half years of learning time. That's huge. There will also be no caps on parental choice. As more charters and different types of public schools are created, parents will have an array of options for their children.
Though the final details are still uncertain, there will also be a serious teacher evaluation process. The various elements of those evaluations will change for each teacher year by year, but, as teachers progress in their careers, student performance will become more and more important. That's vital because various studies have shown that evaluations that rely in part on test scores really do identify the best teachers. Teachers who score well on these evaluations really do produce measurable improvements in their students' performance for years to come. Rigorous teacher evaluations will give reformers a profound measuring tool.
Finally, principals will apparently be given discretion to hire who they want, and they will be held accountable for the performance of their schools. This, too, is a big win for Chicago's children.
Emanuel's willingness to hang tough and accept a strike was itself a hopeful sign that some Democrats are hardy enough to take on interests aligned with their own party. Emanuel certainly didn't get everything he wanted. The unions won concessions, too. But if the final results resemble what I've been hearing in any way, then Chicago will move toward the forefront of the reform movement. That result would also be a national credibility booster for Emanuel's party. It would be a sign that Democrats may be able to successfully reform ailing public institutions, so that the nation as a whole can prosper.

HEADLINE: Prices Surged For Producers In August

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Producer prices rose the most in three years in August as energy costs surged, but fairly benign underlying inflation pressures should help the Federal Reserve maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.
Other data released on Thursday underscored the weakness in the labor market, a major concern for the Fed. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits touched a two-month high, although some of the increase was attributed to Tropical Storm Isaac.
The Fed began another aggressive economic stimulus program, saying it would buy mortgage-backed debt each month until the outlook for jobs improved substantially as long as inflation remained under control. In addition, policy makers said they were not likely to raise short-term interest rates from current rock-bottom lows until at least mid-2015. 
Economists said the strong rise in wholesale prices last month was unlikely to translate into a sustained increase in prices at the supermarket and shopping mall.
''There is little indication that it's going to pass through to higher consumer inflation,'' said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. ''We continue to have economic growth that is modest.''
The Labor Department said its seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index increased 1.7 percent last month, the largest gain since June 2009, after rising 0.3 percent in July.
The increase in prices received by farms, factories and refineries overshot economists' expectations for a 1.1 percent advance. Energy prices, which had their strongest surge in three years, accounted for more than 80 percent of the rise in wholesale inflation.
A second report from the department showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000 last week, exceeding expectations for an increase to 370,000.
The department said Tropical Storm Isaac accounted for about 9,000 of the first-time claims filed last week.
Even accounting for the storm, the report on joblessness suggested little improvement in the labor market after job growth slowed sharply in August. The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, climbed 3,250, to 375,000, the highest point since the middle of July.
Employers added just 96,000 jobs last month, a step down from July's 141,000 count. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 percent in August from 8.3 percent because many Americans gave up the search for work.
The sluggish labor market, which is damping domestic demand, suggests that any rise in consumer prices stemming from the spike in producer inflation last month could be temporary, although it will put a squeeze on households.
The department will release its Consumer Price Index on Friday. Consumer prices are forecast to have increased 0.5 percent last month after being flat in July, according to a Reuters survey. On a year-on-year basis, they are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, below the Fed's 2 percent target but an acceleration from 1.4 percent in July.
At the wholesale level, energy prices rose 6.4 percent last month, with gasoline costs surging 13.6 percent.
Food prices rose 0.9 percent, the largest gain since November, as a result of a drought in the Midwest. Prices for dairy products, which rose by the most since June of last year, accounted for a third of the increase in food prices last month.

HEADLINE: Snowman's Land

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
With his ill-fitting puffy coat and curtain of greasy hair, Walter (Jürgen Rissmann), a two-bit German hit man, seems as burned out as any wage slave in a depressed economy. So when a botched assignment in a public restroom necessitates some off-the-grid R&R, he accepts his temporary banishment with customary resignation. 
Until he arrives at his new post, a former sanitarium deep in the Carpathian Mountains, where Berger (Reiner Schöne), a twisted crime boss, needs help protecting his business interests from rivals who may or may not be imagined. Complicating matters are a house full of drugs, Berger's hot-to-trot wife (Eva-Katrin Hermann) and an unstable young gangster (Thomas Wodianka) with designs on both. There's only one thing for Walter to do: go sledding.
Relentlessly chilly and methodically violent, ''Snowman's Land'' is an escalating tragicomedy of errors that uses deadpan humor to emphasize its characters' narcissism and lack of finesse. Observed by an anonymous, aloof narrator, the house's inhabitants tease and torture, bungle and cover up, while the woods around them rustle with unseen dangers.
Throughout, Ralf Mendle's digital cinematography delivers cold, crisp images that capture sickly complexions and pristine landscapes with equal clarity. But despite on-point performances (especially from the hilarious Mr. Wodianka), the story (by Tomasz Thomson, who also directs) is too pitted with holes and loose ends to permit the film a bump from meh to marvelous.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Tomasz Thomson In German, with English subtitles 1 hour 38 minutes; not rated

HEADLINE: U.S. Declares A Disaster For Fishery In Northeast

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD and KIRK JOHNSON; Jess Bidgood reported from Boston, and Kirk Johnson from Seattle.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- The Commerce Department on Thursday issued a formal disaster declaration for the Northeastern commercial groundfish fishery, paving the way for financial relief for the battered industry and the communities that depend on it. 
To many here, the declaration underscored the urgency of a groundfish depletion that has become apparent to many scientists and some fishermen who work in New England's waters.
''Fishermen in the Northeast are facing financial hardships because of the unexpectedly slow rebuilding of fish stocks,'' Rebecca Blank, the acting secretary of commerce, said in a statement.
The declaration, which allows Congress to appropriate financial relief for the industry but does not guarantee any funds, comes after an assessment last year by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that found that the population of Gulf of Maine cod -- a critical commercial species here -- was about 20 percent of its rebuilding target.
Those findings increased the likelihood that federal catch-limits will be cut significantly in 2013 (regulators say cuts for some species could be higher than 70 percent), which some fishermen feel could further cripple an industry already suffering from withering stocks.
''This year has been the worst I've ever seen it,'' said John Our, who has caught only 500 of the 180,000 pounds of cod he was allotted this year and has shifted his focus to dogfish instead. ''It is a disaster, I'll give them that. I just don't see any fish being landed.''
Fishery disaster declarations are not novel for the agency -- it often makes at least several per year -- but are unusual for a fishery that has been actively managed for decades, according to Peter Shelley, senior counsel at the Conservation Law Foundation, which supported this declaration despite opposing previous calls for such an action.
''The problem wasn't that fishermen were overfishing,'' Mr. Shelley said, ''but that their limits were set too high -- because of a failure to understand how the system has been changing.''
The declaration comes as fishery management takes a prominent role in some of the region's political campaigns. Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, recently released an advertisement featuring fishermen in Gloucester, Mass.; Representative John F. Tierney, a Democrat fighting a tough re-election battle in the state's coastal Sixth Congressional District, and Representative William Keating, a Democrat who is running in the Ninth Congressional District, which includes Cape Cod, have both pushed federal regulators for the declaration.
The Commerce Department also declared commercial fishery disaster relief for three regions in Alaska where Chinook salmon catches have plummeted -- on the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, both of which flow into the Bering Sea off Alaska's west coast, and in the Cook Inlet southwest of Anchorage.
In asking for federal help this summer, Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, described a ripple effect through an outdoor economy, and the simultaneous challenges for the deeply rural communities where subsistence fishing is an element of culture and survival.
The numbers indicate a sudden, stunning decline in recent years, about which scientists have not settled on an explanation. On the Yukon, for example, 1,488 pounds of salmon were harvested in 2011, down from more than 859,000 pounds in 2006, a state study found.

HEADLINE: Belated Response From Egypt

 BODY:
The response from President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt to the murder of the American ambassador in Libya and the attacks on the United States Embassy in Cairo should have been swift and unequivocal. Condemn the violence, express condolences for the killings and pledge to strengthen security at foreign missions. 
That's what Libyan leaders did.
Instead, Mr. Morsi initially issued only a mild rebuke of the rioters -- on Facebook. His primary concern was railing against a hatemongering anti-Muslim video that provided an excuse for the protests. It took until Thursday -- after a telephone call from President Obama -- before Mr. Morsi personally condemned the killing of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Libya and vowed to protect foreign embassies in Cairo. As the new president of an aspiring democracy, Mr. Morsi is still trying to balance competing forces, including his own party, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the harder line Salafis, both of which have a history of antipathy toward the United States. The Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafis suggested on Thursday that they would work to calm tensions. They will have a chance to prove that on Friday when more protests are planned. Mr. Morsi should leave no doubt that violence will not be tolerated.
Otherwise, there is little chance of rescuing Egypt from its deep economic hole. The United States has provided Cairo as much as $2 billion a year, though some members of Congress are calling for an end to such aid. If Americans and other Westerners cannot trust that Egypt is reasonably safe, there is little reason to back a $4.8 billion International Monetary Fund loan or follow through on promised debt relief and investment.
Khairat el-Shater, a top Muslim Brotherhood leader, in a letter to the editor of The Times, expressed the hope that the relationship the Americans and Egyptians have worked to build in the last few months can survive the week's events. We hope so, too. Both countries will pay a price if they let extremists push them apart.

HEADLINE: Europe's Governments and Investors Are Wary of a Giant Aerospace Merger

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK; Mark Scott contributed reporting from London and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.

 BODY:
PARIS -- European governments and shareholders reacted with caution on Thursday to news that the region's two largest aerospace and military companies were in advanced discussions to create a $49 billion behemoth to rival the likes of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
After the surprise announcement late Wednesday of the merger talks between the French-German company European Aeronautic Defense and Space and BAE Systems of Britain, many analysts acknowledged the significant competitive advantages a combination of the two companies could create. It would pair a complementary set of assets in the civil and military aeronautics sectors.
But many worried that the proposed ownership structure would be too complex, with control split among strategic shareholders, including governments, in no fewer than five countries.
''There is an immense amount of uncertainty about the precise mechanics of this,'' said Sash Tusa, an aerospace analyst at Echelon Research and Advisory in London. ''There are lot of players with an effective veto'' of a deal. 
Shares in EADS closed 10.2 percent lower in Paris on Thursday. BAE Systems slid 7.3 percent in London.
The companies on Wednesday outlined the terms of a deal that would create a dual-listed concern that would be 60 percent owned by EADS shareholders and 40 percent by BAE investors. The two operating divisions would be managed by a single team in a structure similar to that of other cross-border European giants like Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell.
Certain parts of each company's national security operations would be ''ring-fenced'' to limit the access of executives at one company to sensitive technologies owned by the other, a common practice for foreign contractors operating in the United States.
The company would have a market value of almost $50 billion and annual revenue of more than $90 billion.
By joining forces, EADS and BAE hope to create a corporation whose activities are evenly split between the passenger jet market and the military market. The passenger jet market is growing rapidly, but is volatile. The military market is more stable in terms of revenue, but has more limited growth potential as European countries and the United States reduce military spending.
Geographically, the combined company's sales would be well diversified. Europe would account for 40 percent; North America, 21 percent; Asia, 22 percent; and the Middle East, 11 percent.
Still, analysts said the combination could face significant hurdles, many of them political.
Chief among those would be persuading EADS's strategic French, German and Spanish shareholders, which hold just more than 50 percent of the stock, to accept a dilution of their influence.
Since the creation of EADS in 2000 from a combination of French, German and Spanish aerospace assets, its management has chafed at the frequent attempts by government stakeholders to influence decisions.
France and Germany each control 22.5 percent of EADS and have the right to appoint an equal number of their citizens to the company's 11-member board. German interests in EADS are represented by the automaker Daimler and a consortium of private and public sector banks. A French government holding company owns a 15 percent stake and Lagardère, a French media conglomerate, holds 7.5 percent. The Spanish government controls a 5.45 percent stake. The remaining shares are held by the public.
A merger would effectively put an end to the decade-old division of control between the French and Germans and replace it with a system of ''golden shares.'' Those shares would give the governments of France, Germany and Britain a veto in the new company only in the case of a hostile takeover attempt or in transactions involving sensitive national security assets.
French, German and British officials were first informed about the proposed merger and changes to the ownership structure by top EADS executives in July, said a person who was briefed about the meetings, but who spoke on condition of anonymity.
''The French would suddenly be seeing their influence being weakened and diluted significantly,'' said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, a military and aerospace consultant in London. ''That's going to be a big pill for them to swallow.''
France's official reaction to the news was guarded. Pierre Moscovici, the finance minister, declined to express an opinion on the merits of a deal. Lagardère said in a statement that it would study the plan ''to ensure that all consequences associated with the proposed EADS-BAE Systems merger are taken into consideration.''
Daimler has been in talks for several months with the German government to arrange the sale of its 7.5 percent stake in EADS to KfW, a state-owned development bank. A sale had been expected to be concluded by the end of the year, but a merger with BAE would probably make such a transaction moot.
In that case, ''all options would be open to us in principle -- including the possibility of selling our stake on the open market,'' said Florian Martens, a Daimler spokesman.
A spokesman for the German economy ministry declined to comment Thursday on media reports that Berlin had significant reservations about the deal.
''We have been asked to support this merger,'' said the spokesman, who declined to be identified by name in keeping with government policy. ''The German government is reviewing all relevant questions.''
Analysts predicted that regulators in Europe and the United States would be unlikely to challenge an EADS-BAE merger on antitrust grounds. There is little overlap in the two companies' businesses, with the exception of missiles and combat jets, where the two already cooperate in ventures like the Eurofighter Typhoon.
The two companies have been ''in advanced discussions'' with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for several months, said a banker involved in those talks, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss them. Neither Washington nor Brussels has raised any objections so far, this person said.
Still, that would not rule out an effort by the companies' American rivals to block the deal -- or to capitalize on the politically charged atmosphere of the United States presidential campaign to stoke nationalist objections, some analysts warned.
''I think the U.S. would want to look at this very carefully,'' especially with regard to the ownership of sensitive technology produced by BAE, whose American subsidiary is a major Pentagon contractor, said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners in London. ''It may be that there isn't an issue, but it's not certain the U.S. will see it that way,'' he added. ''In the run-up to the elections, it could become a political football.''

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Finds New Signs of Weakness in World Economy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- More evidence of a weakening global economy emerged Thursday ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision to take aggressive new steps to stimulate growth in the United States.
A report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development pointed to a slowdown in the coming months in Italy, China, India and Russia, with weak growth in France and Germany -- the two biggest economies of the struggling euro zone.
The study focused on indicators that aim to anticipate turning points in economic activity. They show signs of slightly slower growth in Japan and the United States, while for Britain and Brazil, they point tentatively to a pickup in activity, albeit at a slow rate, the organization said. 
A separate report from the O.E.C.D. said business spending on research and development -- one measure of economic strength -- fell 4.5 percent in 2009 in the 34 countries that are members of the organization. Only France and South Korea went against expectations, increasing their spending.
Spending in Asian economies, including some like China and India, which are not members of the O.E.C.D., continued to increase. Year-on-year growth in research and development spending by Chinese businesses increased by 29.5 percent in 2010 and by 20.5 percent in South Korea and India.
That means that the crisis has accelerated China's share in global research and development spending, which climbed from 7 percent in 2004 to 10.5 percent in 2008 and jumped to 13 percent in 2009, the report said.
European stocks closed mostly lower ahead of the Fed's announcement of a third round of bond buying to bolster the American economy. The Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, lost 0.84 percent. The German DAX stock index dropped 0.45 percent, while the CAC 40 in France lost 1.18 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain, however, ended up 0.65 percent.
The euro climbed against the dollar after the Fed's announcement, rising to $1.2989 in late New York trading, compared with $1.2891 late Wednesday.
There was some better news in the euro zone on Thursday, as Italy's borrowing costs continued to drop. An auction of three-year debt sold out at its lowest rate in almost two years.
Last week, the European Central Bank announced that it was ready to make unlimited bond purchases to help struggling euro zone nations if necessary, providing countries meet conditions. On Wednesday, Germany's constitutional court approved the creation of a permanent bailout fund for the euro, and elections in the Netherlands did not increase the representation of political parties critical of the euro to the extent many had predicted.
Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London said there had been a ''dramatic improvement in sentiment'' toward the so-called peripheral euro zone countries, which include Italy, but added a note of caution.
''While there are grounds for more optimism since the E.C.B. announced the details of its bond-buying program, it is far too premature to claim that the euro zone crisis has been stemmed once and for all,'' he said. ''There are many pieces, in particular very contentious political ones, which need to fall into place over the next few weeks.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Agency Rebukes Iran For Failing To Cooperate

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
VIENNA (Reuters) -- The United Nations nuclear watchdog agency passed a resolution on Thursday rebuking Iran for defying demands to curb its uranium enrichment and failing to quell mounting concerns about its suspected research into atomic bombs.
Two days after Israel stepped up threats against Iran, the 35-nation board of the regulator, the International Atomic Energy Agency, overwhelmingly adopted the measure, which expressed ''serious concern'' about Tehran's nuclear advances but also made clear its desire for a peaceful resolution. 
Russia and China joined four Western powers, led by the United States, in sponsoring the resolution. Only Cuba voted against it. Three countries, including Egypt, abstained, according to diplomats who took part in the closed-door meeting at agency headquarters in Vienna.
''The diplomatic pressure on Iran is increasing,'' said Robert Wood, the United States envoy to the agency. ''The isolation is increasing.''
Iran's envoy to the agency, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said such resolutions were counterproductive. Iran has moved forward with its nuclear program despite a series of similar resolutions since 2006 as well as harsh economic sanctions. The resolution ''will only complicate the situation and jeopardize the cooperative environment which we desperately need,'' Mr. Soltanieh told reporters after the vote.
The need for a diplomatic breakthrough is becoming urgent given Israel's increasingly strident demand that Iran be given a deadline to cooperate or risk airstrikes that many fear could ignite a Middle East war. On Tuesday, Israel signaled that it was almost out of patience with diplomacy and economic sanctions.
The resolution faults Iran for disregarding United Nations resolutions calling on it to suspend uranium enrichment -- a conduit to producing fuel for nuclear power stations or bombs -- and allow investigators to inspect evidence that Iran is pursuing weapons technology.
Earlier on Thursday, South Africa put forward an amendment that some Western diplomats said may have weakened the language of the resolution. But a compromise was hammered out during a three-hour adjournment, the diplomats said, satisfying the United States, Russia, France, China, Britain and Germany.
South Africa's proposal was a nod to some members of the Nonaligned Movement, a bloc of mainly developing nations that does not necessarily regard Iran's nuclear program as moving toward producing a bomb. The amendment concerned a section of the text demanding that Iran put in effect a yet-to-be-agreed-upon framework accord with the atomic energy agency on how it should conduct its investigation into suspected nuclear weapons research.
In a series of meetings with Iran that began in January, the agency has tried to come up with an approach to carrying out its inquiry that would also satisfy Iran. Yukiya Amano, the agency's director general, said this week that no concrete results had been achieved, calling the lack of progress ''frustrating.''
In a statement to the board, the European Union said, ''Iran has not engaged seriously and without preconditions in talks aimed at restoring international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.''
''Iran's procrastination is unacceptable,'' the union said.
Mr. Wood, the United States envoy, accused Iran of ''systematically demolishing'' a facility at the Parchin military site that agency inspectors want to visit as part of their investigation.
''Iran has been taking measures that appear consistent with an effort to remove evidence of its past activities at Parchin,'' he said.
Mr. Soltanieh dismissed what he called the ''distorted information'' about Parchin.
Iran says it wants to produce electricity from enriched uranium, not bombs. Refined uranium can be used to fuel nuclear power plants. But if enriched to a high degree, it can provide the explosive core for a nuclear warhead.

HEADLINE: The iPhone Stimulus

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Are you, or is someone you know, a gadget freak? If so, you doubtless know that Wednesday was iPhone 5 day, the day Apple unveiled its latest way for people to avoid actually speaking to or even looking at whoever they're with.
So is the new phone as insanely great as Apple says? Hey, I'll leave stuff like that to David Pogue. What I'm interested in, instead, are suggestions that the unveiling of the iPhone 5 might provide a significant boost to the U.S. economy, adding measurably to economic growth over the next quarter or two. 
Do you find this plausible? If so, I have news for you: you are, whether you know it or not, a Keynesian -- and you have implicitly accepted the case that the government should spend more, not less, in a depressed economy.
Before I get there, let's talk about where the buzz is coming from.
A recent research note from JPMorgan argued that the new iPhone might add between a quarter- and a half-percentage point to G.D.P. growth in the last quarter of 2012. How so? First, the report argued that Apple was likely to sell a lot of phones in a short period of time. Second, it noted that although iPhones are manufactured overseas, most of the price you pay when you buy one is domestic value-added -- retailing and wholesaling, advertising and profits -- all of which counts as part of G.D.P. Finally, it took some plausible guesses about the price of each phone and the number of phones sold, and used those guesses to make an estimate of the impact on G.D.P.
It's all pretty straightforward. But the implications are wider than most people realize.
The crucial thing to understand here is that these likely short-run benefits from the new phone have almost nothing to do with how good it is -- with how much it improves the quality of buyers' lives or their productivity. Such effects will kick in only over the longer run. Instead, the reason JPMorgan believes that the iPhone 5 will boost the economy right away is simply that it will induce people to spend more.
And to believe that more spending will provide an economic boost, you have to believe -- as you should -- that demand, not supply, is what's holding the economy back. We don't have high unemployment because Americans don't want to work, and we don't have high unemployment because workers lack the right skills. Instead, willing and able workers can't find jobs because employers can't sell enough to justify hiring them. And the solution is to find some way to increase overall spending so that the nation can get back to work.
So where can more spending come from? Businesses are sitting on lots of cash but, for the most part, have seen little reason to do a lot of investment. Why expand your capacity when you don't have enough sales to make full use of the capacity you already have? And because businesses aren't spending a lot, incomes are low, so consumer demand is low, which perpetuates those low sales.
Yet depressions do end, eventually, even without government policies to get the economy out of this trap. Why? Long ago, John Maynard Keynes suggested that the answer was ''use, decay, and obsolescence'': even in a depressed economy, at some point businesses will start replacing equipment, either because the stuff they have has worn out, or because much better stuff has come along; and, once they start doing that, the economy perks up. Sure enough, that's what Apple is doing. It's bringing on the obsolescence. Good.
But why suffer through years of depressed output and high unemployment while waiting for enough obsolescence to accumulate? Why not have the government step in and spend more, say on education and infrastructure, to help the economy through its rough patch? Don't say that the government can't add to total spending, or that government spending can't create jobs. If you believe that the iPhone 5 can give the economy a lift, you've already conceded both that the total amount of spending in the economy isn't a fixed number and that more spending is what we need. And there's no reason this spending has to be private.
Yet far from using public spending to support the economy in its time of trouble, our political system -- driven by a combination of ideology, exaggerated deficit fears and Republican obstructionism -- has moved to make the depression worse. Yes, unemployment benefits and food stamps are up, because so many more people are in need; but government employment has plunged, as has public investment.
Now, despite all this, we will eventually recover. Over time there will be more equipment that needs replacing, more iPhone-like innovations that boost spending, and, in the long run, we will exit this economic trap. But, as Keynes famously pointed out in another context, in the long run we are all dead. To borrow a phrase from myself, why not end this depression now?

HEADLINE: Fed Action Spurs Broad Rally; S.&P. Rises 1.6%

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's new effort to bolster the economy and support the housing market was greeted enthusiastically on Wall Street on Thursday, but mortgage experts were already doubting whether the benefits would be passed along to American homeowners.
For many investors, the most important element of the stimulus plan announced on Thursday was its sweeping nature. The Fed pushed out its window for lower interest rates and set out a new program to buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed bonds each month until the economy improved. The open-ended move was more than many investors had anticipated and helped spur a broad rally that strengthened as the day went on. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 23.43 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 1,459.99, its highest level since the last day of 2007. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 206.51 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 13,539.86. The Nasdaq composite index gained 41.51 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 3,155.83.
The Fed's emphasis on mortgage-backed bonds was a shift from recent stimulus efforts that focused primarily on buying Treasury bonds. The announcement pushed the interest rates on these bonds down on Thursday. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, indicated in his news conference that the lower rates on mortgage bonds could allow banks to offer lower home loan rates. That could, in turn, encourage more construction and economic activity. Banks that offered mortgages were among the biggest gainers on Thursday, with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase leading blue-chip stocks up.
But with interest rates already hovering near record lows, there is skepticism about whether the Fed's plan will push rates down further or make it any more likely that Americans will return to the housing market.
''The program today is more likely to affect investors than the real economy,'' said Dan Greenhaus, the chief global strategist at BTIG, an institutional brokerage. ''Another easing program is only one part of what might be necessary to get the U.S. economy out of the rut in which it finds itself.''
The market's gains added to three months of steadily rising share prices in the United States, which have brought the benchmark index up over 16 percent from early June. ''Despite the fact that the Fed telegraphed that it would do something, they managed to pull a rabbit out of the hat and surprise a little bit,'' said Leslie Barbi, the head of the fixed-income portfolio at RS Investments.
The path forward is not a complete departure from the Fed's previous efforts. Until the end of the year, the central bank will continue buying longer-dated Treasury bonds and swapping them for short-term Treasury notes in what has been called Operation Twist. Mr. Bernanke also left the door open to more Treasury bond purchases. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from bond prices, fell to 1.72 percent from 1.76 percent late on Wednesday.
But the emphasis is now shifting to mortgage bonds. Banks and government-sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac package new mortgages into bonds, which they sell to investors. When demand for the bonds rises, which translates into lower interest rates on them, banks can offer homeowners lower interest rates on their underlying mortgages.
The Fed's first stimulus program, back in 2009, also focused largely on purchases of mortgage-backed bonds. Back then, the housing market was still lifeless and investors were unwilling to touch the bonds. The Fed's effort is credited with getting the market off the ground at its lowest point. But after that program ended, the Fed moved its attention away from mortgage bonds.
Mr. Bernanke said on Thursday that the housing market had showed signs of turning around in recent months but continued to be ''one of the missing pistons in the engine here.''
''To the extent that we can support housing, I think that would be a very useful outcome,'' he said.
Another potential benefit of lower mortgage rates would be increased refinancing, which would free money to be spent in other parts of the economy.
Scott Simon, a mortgage bond expert at Pimco, said the focus on mortgages was likely to do more for ordinary Americans than the purchases of Treasury bonds in previous stimulus programs.
But Mr. Simon and other mortgage investors said several obstacles stood between the Fed and helping homeowners. One problem is that in recent months, investors have been eager to buy mortgage bonds, driving down rates on the bonds, but banks have not passed along the lower rates to their customers.
More broadly, housing analysts say the already record low interest rates have been only moderately successful at tempting potential home buyers back into the market.
Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average rate on the 30-year fixed rate mortgage stood at 3.55 percent, unchanged from the week before and up slightly from the record lows hit in July.
Guy Cecala, the chief executive of Inside Mortgage Finance, said that many potential home buyers have been scared away from the housing market or are unable to pass the stringent credit tests required by banks.
''We've had sub 4 percent rates for the last two years, and it's done relatively little to stimulate home buying,'' Mr. Cecala said.
But Mr. Cecala said that the Fed's move could provide a ''psychological boost'' to the housing market. What's more, he said, it was one of the central bank's few remaining options.
''What other buttons do they have to push?'' he said. ''They've pushed just about everything they can.''

HEADLINE: Panetta Set To Discuss U.S. Shift In Asia Trip

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta travels across Asia next week, on an arc from Japan and China to New Zealand, he will face two almost contradictory challenges.
He will be working to dispel skepticism that the administration's new Asia-Pacific strategy is an emperor with no clothes, and so is certain to offer rebuttals to those who say the regional ''rebalancing'' remains more rhetoric than reality.
At the same time, he will have to convince a specific audience -- in Beijing -- that relocating resources to the region after a decade of combat in the Middle East and Southwest Asia is not meant to confront China. 
At each stop, Mr. Panetta will describe an American vision ''that we continue to be what we have been now for seven decades: the pivotal military power in the Asia-Pacific region, which has provided peace and stability,'' said Ashton B. Carter, the deputy defense secretary, who in late summer spent 10 days in Asia pushing the administration's strategy.
Part of that strategy, Mr. Carter said, is to ensure that not just longtime allies like Japan and South Korea thrive, but that American policy helps other economic and political powers -- he cited China and India -- ''to rise and prosper.''
But official studies have criticized the Pentagon's efforts. A review conducted for Congress by the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that the Pentagon had not yet explained in sufficient detail how it would shift military forces to the region, or where the money would be found in an era of tightening budgets.
Mr. Carter, in an interview, spoke of deployments, planned deployments and anticipated spending to put the meat on the bones of the Asia-Pacific pivot.
The United States' new way of war is defined by high-technology airborne systems for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and a fleet of advanced Global Hawk drones is being transferred to Asia from the Middle East, he said. A significant number of older Navy surveillance systems -- the P-3 aircraft, designed for antisubmarine warfare but converted for counterinsurgency -- are also are being shifted.
''We are releasing so much capacity as a consequence of not having to have that capacity tied up in Iraq and Afghanistan,'' Mr. Carter said.
A number of the Air Force's long-range B-1 and B-52 bombers will be withdrawn from the Middle East and Southwest Asia and moved to the Pacific. At the same time, the United States is discussing the placement of missile defense radar installations on the territory of Pacific Rim allies.
''People in the region want to see us walk the walk,'' Mr. Carter said. ''These are the steps that we will take to do that.''
In a speech to an international security conference in Singapore this year, Mr. Panetta announced that deployment of Navy ships, which have been spread evenly between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, would be divided 60-40 favoring the Pacific.
Likewise, the Pentagon said that ground combat units that were sent from the Pacific region to Iraq or Afghanistan for the wars there would return to their bases in Asia. Some Marine Corps units would begin conducting training exercises in Australia. And the Army is drawing up plans to place combat equipment in storage in the region, to be used in multinational training exercises and be available on short notice in crises.
Budgets, however, have a way of restricting strategic goals. Still, Mr. Carter said, the Pentagon's spending plans will safeguard money for personnel and hardware destined for the Asia-Pacific region.
''We have protected the newest stuff,'' Mr. Carter said, noting that money to buy aerial refueling tankers and a new bomber has not been cut. ''And in terms of posture, we are sending all of the newest stuff to that part of the world,'' he added, citing the deployment order for F-22's, the Air Force's stealthy warplane.
In announcing Mr. Panetta's trip to Asia on Thursday, George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, underscored opportunities for increasing military cooperation with China -- part of the effort to show that the rebalancing is not about containment.
''The visit provides an opportunity to deepen the military-to-military engagements between China and the United States,'' Mr. Little said.

HEADLINE: Let's Put On a Circus, and Let's Put It On Outdoors

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
There was once a time when most everyone agreed about what a circus was: big top, red-nosed clowns, a few unhappy-looking animals. But like seemingly every other part of our culture, the circus has fragmented into myriad niches, some inevitably in opposition to Cirque du Soleil, the French-Canadian juggernaut whose oversize shoes currently make the loudest stomp in the field. 
Presented by Circus Amok, a New York-based company founded in 1989, ''Moo'' operates at the other end of the spectrum. It's free, outdoors, intimate and has a scrappy, let's-put-on-a-show sense of enthusiasm. There's a touch of the old time sideshow in this production, but its most distinguishing feature may be its gender-bending and political heart. Jennifer Miller, a charismatic bearded lady, is the ringleader. A female acrobat serves as a base for a man standing on her shoulders. It's surely the only circus in the city where beforehand kids can play a penal-system-theme game in which you try to throw darts at balloons that represent prisons. (Avoid the ones signifying farms.)
The company of leapers, jugglers, shy clowns and stilt walkers is endearing, not awe inspiring. One performer walks a low rope. And unlike so many Cirque du Soleil shows there is a narrative, a story about economic strife and the police stop-and-frisk policy that I had trouble following because it was hard to hear the performers. But on a lovely day at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, it was nice that the show, which also features a band, didn't lean heavily on microphones. Its spirit is low-fi.
''Moo'' plays Saturday, Sunday and Sept. 22 and 23 at parks around New York City.

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'The Amazing Spider-Man' (PG-13, 2:16) Five years after Sam Rami directed his third ''Spider-Man'' installment, Marc Webb returns this lucrative franchise to its origins with Andrew Garfield as the spider-teenager and Emma Stone as the girl. Painless but unnecessary. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Bachelorette' (R. 1:31) Drugs, booze and sex lead the list of things voraciously and carelessly consumed by three bridesmaids-to-be (Kirsten Dunst, Lizzy Caplan and Isla Fisher) on the eve of a high school friend's wedding. Leslye Headland's viciously funny satire of overgrown mean girls is a more truthful female answer to the ''Hangover'' movies. (Stephen Holden) 
&#x2605; 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' (PG-13, 1:33) A blast of joyful, chaotic emotion from the bayou, Benh Zeitlin's dazzling film is a homegrown magic-realist fable of defiance in the face of hardship. A community in a stretch of coastal Louisiana called the Bathtub is menaced by storms and government benevolence. Their ordeal is narrated by a young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis), who lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), and who belongs in the tradition of Huck Finn, Scout Finch, Eloise and other indomitable American child heroes. (A. O. Scott)
&#x2605; 'Beauty Is Embarrassing' (No rating, 1:28) ''Pee-wee's Playhouse'' fans will rejoice at Neil Berkeley's documentary profile of the Los Angeles artist Wayne White. Mr. White, a charming, Southern-born puppeteer and voice actor on that groundbreaking 1980s show, was a valuable member of its Emmy-winning brain trust. (''Beauty'' offers his priceless backstage footage from the hallucinatory ''Playhouse'' idea factory.) Mr. White later struggled in children's TV for years before his resurrection as a successful painter of droll, sometimes hilarious canvases. ''Beauty'' rightly pays him his due. (Andy Webster)
'Beloved' (No rating, 2:15, in French) Christophe Honoré's musical melodrama follows, over four decades, the complicated love lives of Madeleine (Ludivine Sagnier in the 1960s and '70s, Catherine Deneuve later) and her daughter, Vera (Chiara Mastroianni). Alex Beaupain's clever pop songs offer more commentary than emotion, but the long, meandering story is full of pathos, comedy and surprise. (Scott)
'The Bourne Legacy' (PG-13, 2:05) Less a thrilling franchise reboot than a solid salvage mission, the fourth installment of the ''Bourne'' spy series replaces Matt Damon with a sympathetic Jeremy Renner, who handles the action persuasively even if the fight sequences lack a sense of regret or even sorrow. As viewers are whisked from location to location, it feels as if the director, Tony Gilroy, is trying too hard to match the accelerated tempo of the previous films. (Manohla Dargis)
'Branded' (R, 1:46) This English-language fable from Russia takes ubiquitous logos and marketing propaganda and gives them a supernatural face (presenting corporate wraiths that do battle above the Moscow skyline). Its fantastical third act is reminiscent of the conclusion of ''Fight Club,'' but with cheesier effects and a happier ending. Not for everyone, certainly, but a most intriguing premise, fancifully executed. (Webster)
'The Campaign' (R, 1:25) Two nincompoops run against each other for a seat in Congress. It's not a documentary, but a silly, not very outrageous comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. (Scott)
'Celeste and Jesse Forever' (R, 1:31) This wistful romantic comedy about love, marriage and never wanting to say you're sorry stars the appealing Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg as a couple who've split up without moving on or out. Written by Ms. Jones and Will McCormack, it was directed by Lee Toland Krieger. (Dargis)
'The Cold Light of Day' (PG-13, 1:33) Murky, incoherent and crudely edited, this third-rate ''Bourne'' movie is a catastrophe worth noting only for the presence of its name cast (Henry Cavill, Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver). (Holden)
&#x2605; 'Compliance' (R, 1:30) Raising troubling questions about the influence of class and education on our response to authority, Craig Zobel's squirmy psychological horror movie, based on a series of hoaxes at fast-food restaurants nationwide, is a slow-motion punch to the groin. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Cosmopolis' (R, 1:48) David Cronenberg directs this cold, funny adaptation of the 2003 Don DeLillo novel starring Robert Pattinson as a zomboid billionaire, one of the limo riding masters of the universe who, over the course of a long day and night, loses a great deal and, by doing so, becomes human. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
'Detropia' (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Catsoulis)
'The Expendables 2' (R, 1:43) Sylvester Stallone returns with his band of aging action stars and a ridiculous amount of ammunition and explosives, bent on avenging a comrade's death and keeping some plutonium out of evil hands. A brief appearance by Chuck Norris provides the best moment of self-parody in a movie that could have used a few more of them. (Neil Genzlinger)
'The EYE OF THE STORM' (No rating, 1:59) Charlotte Rampling is a forceful Australian matriarch, fighting the world, her seemingly ungrateful children (Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis) and maybe herself as she clings to life in Fred Schepisi's dramatically unsteady, blustery if likable film, adapted from by Judy Morris from the Patrick White novel. (Dargis)
'For a Good Time, Call ... ' (R, 1:26) This potty-mouthed comedy about two Manhattan women who establish a successful phone-sex business to pay the rent doesn't aspire to be more than a broad, sloppy, old-fashioned sitcom with a sexy gimmick, but the bogus dirty talk is often very funny. (Holden)
'Hello, I Must Be Going' (R, 1:35) Melanie Lynskey plays Amy, a recently divorced woman in her 30s, living with her parents and falling headlong into a secret, intense affair with Jeremy (Christopher Abbott), who is still in his teens. The film, directed by Todd Louiso from a script by Sarah Koskoff, is far from perfect, relying on a few too many on-the-nose scenes and creaky plot twists. Ms. Lynskey's performance, however, is a marvel -- sensitive, self-deprecating and quietly heroic. (Scott)
'Hit & Run' (R, 1:40) In this weightless, silly car chase movie, Dax Shepard brings some charm to his role of a sweet-natured, shady goofball in the witness protection program. (Holden)
'Hope Springs' (PG-13, 1:32) While this film about a longtime marriage that's gone dry has modest charms to go with its well-matched and practiced pair of wily scene stealers -- Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones working on screen together for the first time -- the industry will have to do better if it wants to persuade boomers that there's something for them at the local multiplex other than cartoons and clichés. (Dargis)
'The Inbetweeners' (R, 1:36) This nearly laugh-free British comedy, based on the popular British sitcom, follows four teenage boys to Crete, where they drink and have sex and then drink some more when they don't have sex. The movie is apparently the most popular British comedy in history. I guarantee that its success has nothing to do with the quality of the actual movie, directed by Ben Palmer. (Dargis)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Keep the Lights On' (No rating, 1:41) Ira Sachs's new film chronicles more than a decade in the life of a New York couple, two men (Thure Lindhardt and Zachary Booth) who meet through a casual hookup and pursue a relationship that is by turns blissful, banal, painful and tender. Mr. Sachs captures the ebb and flow of their intimacy and the crises that disrupt it with skill and sensitivity, and the performances have the oddness and particularity of real life. (Scott)
'Killer Joe' (NC-17, 1:43) Matthew McConaughey plays a psycho hired by the idiot son of an idiot family in this unfunny, self-indulgent violent bore. The director William Friedkin, working from the Tracy Letts play, is consistently controlled by the story's excesses rather than in control of them. (Manohla Dargis)
'Lawless' (R, 1:55) A blizzard of gunfire and a riot of Southern accents animate this meandering tale of violent bootleggers in Depression-era Virginia. Tom Hardy croaks like a bullfrog, Shia LaBeouf chatters like a chipmunk and Jessica Chastain pours coffee. (Scott)
'Little White Lies' (No rating, 2:34, in French) Guillaume Canet's disappointing follow-up to his hit noir thriller, ''Tell No One,'' is a two-and-a-half-hour Gallic homage to ''The Big Chill'' and a protracted scolding to a group of self-absorbed overgrown yuppies. The strong ensemble cast includes François Cluzet, Jean Dujardin and Marion Cotillard. (Holden)
'Marvel's The Avengers' (PG-13, 2:22) Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and a few other mighty Marvel superheroes team up under the supervision of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in this franchise juggernaut, directed by Joss Whedon. The bantering and riffing among the characters provides some fun, but there is not much heart or imagination in the story or the action sequences. Which seems to satisfy the fans just fine. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
'The Odd Life of Timothy Green' (PG, 1:45) In this baffling exercise in maudlin, whimsical surrealism, directed by Peter Hedges, a childless couple (Jennifer Garner and a miserable-looking Joel Edgerton) are visited by a magic plant in the shape of a 10-year-old boy (CJ Adams). Tears are shed and lessons are learned, the main one being that this would have worked better as a horror movie. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'ParaNorman' (PG, 1:33) This beautiful-looking, charmingly heartfelt 3-D stop-motion animation -- from the studio that produced ''Coraline'' -- centers on an 11-year-old boy who can see ghosts and, with frights and laughter, battles a spirit. Directed by Sam Fell and the movie's screenwriter, Chris Butler. (Dargis)
'The Possession' (PG-13, 1:32) Perched somewhere between ''The Exorcist'' and ''The Unborn,'' this eerily enjoyable tale from the Danish director Ole Bornedal gives a malevolent box to a troubled young girl, throws in the Hasidic rap artist Matisyahu, and stands back. (Catsoulis)
&#x2605; 'Premium Rush' (PG-13, 1:31) The director David Koepp provides about all the late summer air-conditioned relief you could hope for in this buoyant dumb-fun, ticking-clock thriller about a bicycle messenger (the dependably appealing Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has to get from here to there without being taken out by cars or a bad cop (a terrific Michael Shannon). (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Queen of Versailles' (PG, 1:40) Lauren Greenfield's documentary follows the shifting fortunes of David and Jackie Siegel, a wealthy Florida couple who dreamed of building the biggest house in America. The movie, which starts out like smirky reality television, turns into something darker and more complex as economic troubles take a toll on the Siegels and the audience becomes better acquainted with them. It's like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our new gilded age. (A.O. Scott)
'Raaz 3' (R, 2:30, in Hindi) A Bollywood horror movie in 3-D, set in ..._ Bollywood! The story is predictably predictable, but Vikram Bhatt's movie delivers some scary thrills, some good vs. evil thrills and an unusual amount of steamy bits for a Hindi film. With Bipasha Basu as a bad girl gone even badder. (Rachel Saltz)
'Robot & Frank' (PG-13, 1:30) Jake Schreier directed, from a script by Christopher D. Ford, this eager-to-please story set in the near future about an elderly gent (Frank Langella), his robot (voiced by Peter Sarsgaard) and some awkwardly managed truths about old age. Susan Sarandon also stars. (Dargis)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
'Sparkle' (PG-13, 1:56) It is impossible to watch this ramshackle remake of a 1976 movie and not relate its story to the life of Whitney Houston, who portrays the strict church-lady mother of an aspiring singer in late-1960s Detroit. (Holden)
'Step Up Revolution' (PG-13, 1:39) How to stop a greedy developer from gutting a Miami neighborhood? The power of dance, of course. The fourth film in the ''Step Up'' franchise has some dandy flash-mob-style dance numbers, though like its predecessors it is burdened by a predictable plot and unintentionally laughable dialogue. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voiceover skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg), and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'To Rome With Love' (R, 1:52) Woody Allen's latest is a mild, silly collection of tales set in the Italian capital, where love is complicated and characters -- both Italian and American -- are baffled, neurotic and always articulate. Mr. Allen plays a semi-retired opera promoter, while Jesse Eisenberg plays the younger Woody Allen type, torn between loyalty to his sensible girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) and her wayward, needy friend (Ellen Page). Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz and Roberto Benigni also contribute to this frothy, airy romp through some of Mr. Allen's favorite themes. (Scott)
'Total Recall' (PG-13, 1:58) Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel star in this chaotic and thoroughly unmemorable science-fiction action movie, loosely remade from a 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle and even more loosely based on a story by Philip K. Dick. (Scott)
'ToYs in the attic' (PG, 1:20) The strange, often beautiful beings in this animated feature -- a simple story intricately told -- exist in a faraway land located somewhere between Czech surrealism and Pixar communitarianism. It should be manna for anyone who likes animated fantasias without wisecracks, commercials and overwrought warbling about self-actualization, a suitable film for those who will grow up either to be the next Tim Burton or simply to enjoy his movies. (Dargis)
'2016: Obama's America' (PG, 1:33) Dinesh D'Souza -- the author of the best seller ''The Roots of Obama's Rage'' and a former American Enterprise Institute fellow -- is the host and narrator of this strident documentary, in which Mr. D'Souza enlists a host of interviewees who are almost entirely critical of the president. The film is unlikely to convert supporters of President Obama to an opposite view. (Webster)
'2 Days in New York' (R, 1:36) In this sequel to ''2 Days in Paris,'' Julie Delpy, who wrote and directed, reprises the role of Marion, a French photographer now living with Mingus (Chris Rock), a journalist and radio host. Their hectic, happy bohemian household is thrown into chaos by the arrival of Marion's father (Ms. Delpy's father, Albert), her sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) and Rose's boyfriend, Manu (Alexandre Nahon). The movie is spirited and sometimes hilarious, but turns sloppy and strained when it reaches for deeper emotional insights into its nutty characters. (Scott)
'The Words' (PG-13, 1:37) Despite a compelling performance from Jeremy Irons, this story within a story about literary plagiarism doesn't bear close scrutiny and has little moral weight. (Holden)
Film Series
'In Praise of Love' (Saturday) Jean-Luc Godard's 2001 film spins an elegant web of mutating images and interrupted conversations around a vague plot that involves the attempts of a French filmmaker (Bruno Putzulu) to mount a love story set during the German occupation. The critic J. Hoberman will introduce the 4 p.m. screening and stick around to sign copies of his new book, ''Film After Film.'' Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $12. (Dave Kehr)
La Di Da Film Festival (Friday through Saturday) The film critic Miriam Bale organizes a weekend's worth of new shorts and features from emerging (Dustin Guy Defa, Maiko Endo, Sam Fleischner, Stephen Gurewitz) and established (the Safdie Brothers, Sean Price Williams) independent filmmakers. Things kick off with the ''Savage Innocents Shorts Program'' on Friday at 6:45 p.m. and conclude on Saturday at 9 p.m. with Amy Seimetz's ''Sun Don't Shine,'' featuring Kate Lyn Sheil and Kentucker Audley as a couple on the run. 92YTriBeCa, 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org; $12. (Kehr)
Mind Over Matter: The Films of Christopher Nolan (Friday through Tuesday) A newly restored 35-millimeter print, screening daily, of Mr. Nolan's first, British-made feature, ''Following'' (1998), is the centerpiece of this brief retrospective devoted to the career of the director of ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' The first two films of his ''Batman'' trilogy -- ''Batman Begins'' (2005) and ''The Dark Knight'' (2008) -- will be shown on Saturday and Sunday; more rarely screened items include Mr. Nolan's first Hollywood feature, ''Insomnia,'' with Al Pacino (Saturday at 3:15 p.m.), and his 2006 fantasy-drama about dueling Victorian stage magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman), ''The Prestige'' (Sunday at 6:45 p.m. and Tuesday at 9 p.m.). Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.org; $13. (Kehr)
'Port of Shadows' (Friday through Thursday) The gloomy, introspective qualities of Marcel Carné's direction -- backed with a screenplay by Jacques Prévert, cinematography by Eugen Schüfftan, costumes by Coco Chanel, sets by Alexandre Trauner and music by Maurice Jaubert -- made an international hit out of this French crime thriller, which remains a textbook example of the seductively depressive style that came to be known as poetic realism. Shown in a new digital restoration. With Jean Gabin, Michèle Morgan and Michel Simon. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.com; $12.50. (Kehr)

'Cyrano de Bergerac' (previews start on Friday; opens on Oct. 11) The last time Douglas Hodge played Broadway, as the flamboyant drag queen Albin in ''La Cage aux Folles,'' he was rarely if ever at a loss for words. Here, in Jamie Lloyd's revival of this timeless 1897 romance, Mr. Hodge will swap the wig for a prosthetic nose -- but Edmond Rostand's verse should flow from his lips as deftly as ever. And Patrick Page, who until recently was menacing a certain web-slinging superhero as the Green Goblin, will take the stage without makeup at long last. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Grode)
'Detroit' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Lisa D'Amour's savage comedy (a Pulitzer Prize finalist) about the uneasy friendship between two couples just barely on opposite sides of the have-and-have-not divide had been rumored for Broadway following acclaimed runs in Chicago and London. (After seeing the play in Chicago, Charles Isherwood hailed Ms. D'Amour as ''a potentially important new voice.'') Instead it opens Playwright Horizons' new season in a new production featuring Amy Ryan and David Schwimmer as the suburban couple slipping down the socioeconomic ladder. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'An Enemy of the People' (in previews; opens on Sept. 27) For the last 60 years, Henrik Ibsen's one-man-against-the-world social drama has had a perfectly good English-language adaptation by someone who knew a thing or two about standing on principle: Arthur Miller. Now Doug Hughes directs a new adaptation of the 1882 classic by the rising British playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz; Mr. Hughes's cast is led by Richard Thomas and, as the medical officer in possession of some inconvenient truth, Boyd Gaines. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, mtc-nyc.org, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'The Exonerated' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Wednesday) One of the longest-running pieces of socially minded theater in recent years was the Culture Project's 2002 production of Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen's chronicle of unjustly imprisoned Americans, told in their own words. A certain degree of star wattage certainly helped, and the Culture Project's 10th-anniversary production offers more of the same, with Brian Dennehy, Brooke Shields and Stockard Channing. They (and additional actors to be named later) will play men and women who were sentenced to death and lived to tell about it. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Grode)
'Grace' (in previews; opens on Oct. 4) Craig Wright has written Michael Shannon everything from comic tours de force (''Mistakes Were Made'') to downbeat ensemble dramas (''Lady''). Where will Mr. Wright's latest play, about a young couple's benighted plan to open a chain of Bible-themed motels, fall on that continuum? Depending on their ages, audiences may be too busy basking in the presence of either Paul Rudd or Ed Asner to notice. Directed by Dexter Bullard (''Bug,'' ''Killer Joe''). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Harper Regan' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Oct. 10) The Atlantic Theater scored a hit in 2011 with the Simon Stephens play ''Bluebird,'' which was directed by Gaye Taylor Upchurch and featured the Atlantic mainstay Mary McCann in the cast. All three are back for Mr. Stephens's 2008 work (a hit at the National Theater in London), about a woman who walks out on her family, possibly for good. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, ticketcentral.com, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' (in previews; opens on Thursday) For many, the main draw for this new comedy will be the American stage debut of Jake Gyllenhaal. But Nick Payne's plays have been generating a wave of buzz in London -- his ''Constellations'' received rapturous notices earlier this year -- and among Mr. Gyllenhaal's co-stars in this one is the always welcome Brian F. O'Byrne (''Doubt,'' ''The Coast of Utopia''). It's about an overweight teenager whose troubles at school come to a head when her drifter uncle shows up for a visit. Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Grode)
'Job' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Thomas Bradshaw's unsparing, envelope-pushing dramas (''Burning,'' ''Southern Promises'') rely on some pretty game actors, and this time Mr. Bradshaw has found a semi-captive talent pool in the Bats, the resident acting company of the Flea Theater. There's also his new antagonist: God. That's right, this is a new adaptation of the biblical book of Job. Brace yourselves, Bats. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Grode)
'Marry Me a Little' (in previews; opens on Oct. 2) In 1980 this two-character revue served as an introduction to a batch of lesser-known Stephen Sondheim songs. Now that several of them have entered the mainstream (the title song is a permanent addition to ''Company''), the time is right for the Keen Company to revive it. True to form, two Sondheim compositions will be heard for the first time: a discard from ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and a song written for the unproduced film version of ''Into the Woods.'' Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Red Dog Howls' (in previews; opens on Sept. 24) What an odd career Alexander Dinelaris has cobbled for himself: spiky romantic dramas (''Still Life''), campy musicals (''Zanna Don't!'') and now a generation-hopping exploration of the Armenian genocide. Joining him this time are the inventive director Ken Rus Schmoll and Kathleen Chalfant, whose own career choices have made her the go-to actress for socially conscious drama (''Wit,'' ''Guantánamo''). What's next for Mr. Dinelaris? He's off to London to work on the stage adaptation of the Kevin Costner-Whitney Houston opus ''The Bodyguard.'' New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Red-Handed Otter' (in previews; opens on Thursday) For many theatergoers, Ethan Lipton burst onto the scene in March with his Obie Award-winning cycle of economic woes, ''No Place to Go.'' But he has been plugging away as a gimlet-eyed playwright for years, and he follows last spring's ''Luther'' with this offbeat comedy for Playwrights Realm about a dead house cat and the upheaval it causes among a group of overnight security guards. Quincy Tyler Bernstine (''Ruined'') and Matthew Maher (Soho Rep's ''Uncle Vanya'') are part of the five-member cast. Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 532-3101, redhandedotter.com. (Grode)
'Song of a Convalescent Ayn Rand Giving Thanks to the Godhead (in the Lydian Mode)' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Sunday) What would it take to lure Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, to Off Broadway? Perhaps Michael Yates Crowley and Michael Rau's trippy amalgamation of skits, poetry, songs and PowerPoint demonstrations will do the trick. Beethoven (who used the Lydian mode now and then) makes an appearance, as do Alan Greenspan and a stripper from Peoria, Ill. IRT, 154 Christopher Street, at Washington Street, West Village, irttheater.org, brownpapertickets.com. (Grode)
'Sounding Beckett' (previews start on Friday; opens on Sunday) Everyone from Peter Brook to Atom Egoyan has had a go at Samuel Beckett's one-acts in recent years, and now it's Joy Zinoman's turn. Ms. Zinoman, a longtime director based in Washington, D.C., takes on three late works (''Footfalls,'' ''Catastrophe'' and ''Ohio Impromptu''), and she has added a risky but potentially fruitful new component: new musical compositions that will be performed live by the Cygnus Ensemble. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, soundingbeckett.com. (Grode)
'Through the Yellow Hour' (in previews; opens on Sept. 27) In his attempt to make Joyce Carol Oates look like a slacker and a cockeyed optimist, the ever-present Adam Rapp has written and directed another dystopian drama. Last seen at the Rattlestick inflicting the bubonic plague and cholera on a single character (in ''The Hallway Trilogy''), Mr. Rapp this time focuses on a woman struggling to stay alive after a cataclysmic attack on the United States. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, rattlestick.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichés very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' As the fatally conflicted Bess, the extraordinary Audra McDonald is a gale force of emotion in Diane Paulus's slimmed-down, Tony-winning adaptation of the landmark 1935 opera. Otherwise, despite a likable performance from Norm Lewis as Porgy, this production feels cloudy and mild, only rarely acquiring the majesty of the opera that inspired it (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
'Auditions, Zoe's Auditions, Part 2' Some people work out their biceps. Suzanna Geraghty works out her face, nearly churning her milk-white mug into butter by the end of her one-woman show about a daffy stagehand looking for her big break. The facial calisthenics are impressive, and help support the case -- per her press materials -- for calling her an ''Irish Lucille Ball.'' The material she has written for herself to flaunt her gifts for physical comedy, however, is underwhelming (1:10). Drilling Company Theater, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, 1stIrish.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'Brontë: A Portrait of Charlotte' This one-woman show written by William Luce and starring Maxine Linehan is intelligent and well acted, but it rarely sparks the imagination. The show is missing the one thing it needs: a sense of the genius of Charlotte Brontë (1:55). Actors' Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Manhattan; (212) 489-9800, alloytheater.org. (Rachel Saltz)
'Bullet for Adolf' Woody Harrelson and Frankie Hyman's muddled play about one hot, hedonistic Houston summer in the 1980s has the feeling of a series of oft-recited anecdotes swapped, excitedly and incoherently, over the din of a jukebox in a crowded bar. These guys hit Memory Lane packing megaphones. Bring ear plugs (2:20). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Closer Than Ever' Can it be? Intelligent, tuneful material written by and for men and women whose ingénue years were in the 20th century? Four rock-solid singers give Richard Maltby Jr. and David Shire's winning 1989 revue a polished revival (1:30). York Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Grode)
&#x2605; 'Cockfight Play' Though that's not the real (unprintable) title of Mike Bartlett's tense, terrific new comedy, it captures the spirit of this feisty, hypnotic and oddly energizing exercise in emotional carnage, directed by James Macdonald. The four-member cast -- Jason Butler Harner, Amanda Quaid, Cotter Smith and Cory Michael Smith -- superbly embodies degrees of sexual ambivalence (1:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Brantley)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'Heartless' In his murky new play, Sam Shepard revisits themes of identity and rootlessness that he has addressed with more urgency -- and clarity -- elsewhere. The splendid Lois Smith, as a Gorgon-like matriarch, gives this production what life force it has. And Jenny Bacon is hilarious as her aggrieved daughter. Daniel Aukin directs, with lots of air-devouring pauses (2:00). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Independents' This musical -- with a book by Marina Keegan, a promising Yale graduate killed in a car wreck in May -- has a winning script, score and cast. The story concerns young historical re-enactors on a boat who party their days and nights away until they are faced with adulthood's harsh realities. Their path to that point is a winning, exhilarating voyage (2:00). SoHo Playhouse and Huron Club, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Webster)
'Normalcy' While this story of a white couple trying to adopt a black child admirably tackles a whole host of issues, those same ideas bog down the tale (2:35). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Lincoln Center, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, normalcytheplay.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Probation' This work by the Cuban-born playwright-director Yoshvani Medina, about recent Cuban immigrants under the sway of a crooked mentor in Miami, offers a kind of dialectic between pro-American and pro-Cuban sentiments. Though it verges on the didactic at times, the production benefits from the appeal of its cast and the searching integrity of its script (1:40). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9999, repertorio.org. (Webster)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). Elektra Theater, 674 Eighth Avenue at 42nd Street; (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Zinoman)
'Silent' In Pat Kinevane's passionate one-man show, directed by Jim Culleton, a homeless Dubliner takes on the persona of Rudolph Valentino, the silent movie star, to often stunning effect. Though the ''how-I-got-this-way'' back story can tax credibility, Mr. Kinevane's nomadic madman doesn't just demand our attention; he commands it (1:20). Donaghy Theater, Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, irishartscenter.org. (Brantley)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'The Train Driver' Athol Fugard's latest play is a modest two-hander about a man (the fine Ritchie Coster) haunted by the death of a woman who stepped in front of the train he was driving, killing herself and her baby. Leon Addison Brown plays the caretaker of the cemetery where he seeks a reckoning with her spirit (1:30). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
Off Off Broadway
'Dreamgirls' The Harlem Repertory Theater's chamber production of this vintage musical about a Supremes-like 1960s singing group is intimate, inviting and strongly staged. The mostly black and Latino cast's abilities range from powerhouse to shaky, but the story comes through clearly and Dion Millington's rendition of ''I Am Telling You I'm Not Going'' is a knockout (2:30). 133rd Street Arts Center, 308 West 133rd Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444, harlemrepertorytheatre.com.

Last Chance
'Color Between the Lines' (closes on Thursday) Rock-musical vignettes introduce audiences to many of Brooklyn's abolitionist heroes, including James Pennington, Henry Ward Beecher and a rescued slave named Pinky. Individually, each of these figures is courageous and compelling. But paraded one after another, the stories become repetitive and almost interchangeable, dissolving into a cacophonous set of musicalized book reports. That said, the cast is energetic and impassioned about sharing their reports with the audience (1:30). At various sites as part of the Brooklyn Beat Festival. A full schedule is at beatbrooklyn.com; (347) 762-3281. (Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Harrison, TX: Three Plays by Horton Foote' (closes on Saturday) Three short, piquant plays by Horton Foote that enjoyably consider the gracious art and limitations of Southern conversation. For these characters, conversation is sacred, something to put your faith in along with God and country, which doesn't mean that words don't fail them. Pam MacKinnon directs a cast that includes the extraordinary Hallie Foote (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Brantley)
'New Girl in Town' (closes on Friday) This 1957 musical adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie'' assembled an illustrious team of showmen in the producer Harold Prince, the book writer and original director George Abbott, the composer and lyricist Bob Merrill, and the choreographer Bob Fosse. While Gwen Verdon and Thelma Ritter shared a lead actress Tony Award for their roles in that original production, the show has since remained virtually unseen in New York. Charlotte Moore's staging for the Irish Rep makes a viable case for Merrill's tuneful score, without ever fully convincing that the perky musical treatment has any connection to the roiling emotions of O'Neill's play. It's less a forgotten jewel than an intermittently charming curio from the golden-age vaults (1:50). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org.

HEADLINE: Trial to Begin for Former UBS Trader Accused of Hiding Huge Loss

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - UBS will face the harsh glare of the spotlight again on Friday, as opening arguments begin in the trial of a former trader accused of hiding a multibillion-dollar loss at the investment bank.
Kweku M. Adoboli, 32, the former trader, faces charges of false accounting and fraud in connection with a $2.3 billion loss at the bank. He has pleaded not guilty.
"As uncomfortable as the entire trial will be for UBS, it will show us what the consequences are when misconduct occurs or when individuals do not take their responsibilities seriously," the bank's chief executive, Sergio P. Ermotti, said in an internal memo made public by the firm. 
UBS, which has struggled to regain its footing since the financial crisis, has been plagued by a number of scandals in recent years.
In 2009, the investment bank, based in Switzerland, agreed to pay $780 million to settle a tax fraud case with American authorities. Three former UBS executives were convicted earlier this year for rigging bids in the municipal bond market.
The bank has also been ensnared by a global investigation into rate manipulation. UBS, which is one of more than a dozen institutions under investigation, struck an immunity deal with authorities.
The case against Mr. Adoboli has only added to the questions about the bank's oversight and risk management.
After the financial crisis, UBS, which had been hobbled by bad real estate bets, vowed to overhaul its internal controls. But the bank disclosed two years later that it had "discovered unauthorized speculative trading," and Mr. Adoboli was arrested. According to the charges, his activities spanned more than three years, starting in 2008.
UBS subsequently conducted an internal investigation into the loss. The review showed that the firm's risk controls had raised red flags about unusual trading activity, but that managers had failed to adequately follow up. "We have to be straight with ourselves," Mr. Ermotti, the chief executive, said in 2011. "In no circumstances should something like this ever occur."
The UBS trading scandal echoes past cases.
In 2010, Jérôme Kerviel, a trader at the Paris-based bank Société Générale, was convicted of generating more than $6 billion in losses. He is appealing the matter. Another trader, Nicholas W. Leeson of Barings Bank, racked up $1 billion in losses, prompting the failure of the British institution in 1995. Mr. Leeson pleaded guilty and served four years in prison.
Mr. Adoboli started his finance career at UBS. He joined the bank as an investment adviser trainee in London shortly after graduating from Nottingham University in 2003, and eventually worked his way up to the Delta One desk, a plain-vanilla version of derivatives trading. Traders in this group create investments that track specific financial assets like a basket of company stocks.
Mr. Adoboli fired his lawyers at Kingsley Napley, the firm that had previously represented Mr. Leeson. Mr. Adoboli is now represented by Bark & Company, another law firm in London.
If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. The trial is expected to last up to eight weeks. Both current and former UBS employees could be called as witnesses, though the firm has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Legal restrictions in Britain limit the information that can be reported about the case to avoid biasing the proceedings. UBS and a lawyer for Mr. Adoboli declined to comment.
When the trading scandal erupted last year, it reverberated through the upper ranks of UBS. The chief executive, Oswald J. Grübel, whom UBS had recruited to oversee its turnaround, promptly resigned. The co-chiefs of global equities, the division where the loss occurred, also left the firm.
The firm's profit also suffered. After disclosing the trading losses, UBS reported that quarterly earnings dropped 39 percent to $1.2 billion.
The blowup has worsened the bank's financial woes. Like other European banks, UBS is dealing with the sluggish economy and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
With investment banking operations slumping, institutions have moved swiftly to lay off staff and revamp their strategies. UBS has announced 3,500 job cuts, with about half expected in the investment banking division. It has also shifted its focus toward wealth management.
"The banks are slowly realizing there are parts of their businesses that just don't make money," said Pete Hahn, a fellow at Cass Business School in London. "A fundamental rethink is under way."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Born to Be Wild, Aging Bikers Settle for Comfy

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Bob Mercer contributed reporting from Sturgis, S.D.

 BODY:
MOUNT AIRY, N.C. -- In his nearly 50 years as an avid motorcyclist, Grady Howard has roared down the tobacco roads of North Carolina and through the mountains of old Kentucky, all with his wife, Barbara, tucked behind him. But with a balky left leg and myriad other maladies, he knew the only way to stay wild was to add a wheel.
''I told my wife it was either trike it or park it,'' said Mr. Howard, 74, wearing a cowboy hat and a bright yellow safety shirt. ''And she said, 'Trike it.' ''
Mr. Howard is one of a legion of aging bikers -- suffering from aching joints and slowing reflexes -- who have abandoned their traditional two-wheel motorcycles in favor of three-wheelers, the super-steady and seemingly safer machines commonly known as trikes. Equal parts ''Easy Rider'' and easy chair, the trikes have grown in popularity in recent years, expanding from a do-it-yourself niche to a potentially lucrative market for major manufacturers. 
Industry experts say the sale of tens of thousands of trikes, whose sticker prices can rival an upscale sedan's -- a new three-wheeled Harley starts at $30,999 -- has helped buoy a slumping industry and kept a generation of born-to-run riders on the roads.
''The baby boomers are getting older, man,'' said Steve Stirewalt, a lifelong rider and motorcycle dealer known as Fat Daddy by his friends. ''People riding all their lives don't want to stop just because of bad knees, or bad eyes, or diabetes or something. They want to keep rocking.''
Mr. Stirewalt, who is 63 and helped along by a hearing aid, was polishing his three-wheeler -- a chrome-on-chrome chopper with a fake alligator skin seat -- at the National East Coast Trike-In, which drew hundreds of trike owners and enthusiasts to Mount Airy, N.C., over Labor Day weekend.
Alex Ross, a k a Iceman, chief executive of the nonprofit trike group Brothers of the Third Wheel, said three-wheelers offered all sorts of advantages, including the comfort and padding to allow drivers to go longer distances without stiffening up.
''My wife goes to sleep as soon as we start traveling,'' he said.
With two bad knees, Mr. Ross, 71, switched to trikes about a decade ago but says he has seen the Brothers grow quickly in recent years, with about 250 new members, worldwide, every month. The group now counts chapters in 45 states, and not a feud among them. ''We have a pact with all the gangs,'' he said. ''We don't interfere with them, and they don't interfere with us.''
That said, trikes have started to invade more traditional two-wheeled events, purring down highways from Laconia, N.H. -- home to the longest-running bike rally in the country -- to Ruidoso, N.M., site of this week's Golden Aspen Motorcycle Rally, where organizers expect about a third of the bikes to be three-wheelers.
''Our predominant crowd is 60 and over, and without a doubt, the trikes are taking over,'' said Patric Pearson, owner of the Golden Aspen rally.
Three-wheelers are even a common sight at Harley-happy events like the giant motorcycle rally in Sturgis, S.D., that draws hundreds of thousands of people to the Black Hills every August, including Monte Hochhalter, a 68-year-old truck driver from Longmont, Colo., who decided to switch to three wheels after some pressure at home.
''My equilibrium isn't so good anymore,'' Mr. Hochhalter said. ''My wife wouldn't ride with me.''
Mr. Hochhalter was riding a converted 2006 Harley, which cost him $18,000. But the company's 2013 trike can go for almost twice that, complete with cruise control and a good set of high beams (perfect for older eyes, of course). It also comes with an ample trunk, something Tim Buche, the president of the Motorcycle Industry Council, a trade group, said was important to baby boomers -- who make up a third of motorcycle owners.
''Boomers travel,'' he said. ''And they like to take all their stuff.''
A collection of independent companies has long offered kits to convert two-wheel bikes made by major manufacturers. But in 2008, Harley-Davidson -- the industry leader in large touring bikes -- announced that it would enter the market with the Tri Glide, working with a smaller company called Lehman Trikes. (In 2010, Harley moved production in-house.) The Tri Glide is now a consistent top-10 seller in several demographic groups, said Scott Habegger, the company's director of product planning, including the company's core customers: white men over 35.
But the three-wheelers are tapping into another market: women, including those who may not have been comfortable handling a touring bike, which can weigh nearly 1,000 pounds, or were just tired of being relegated to the role of passenger.
''I don't like riding behind him when I drive just as well,'' said Melinda Metheney, 52, gesturing to her husband, Paul. She bought her new three-wheeler -- a Canadian-built Can-Am Spyder, with two wheels in the front and one in the rear -- in February.
''I've never not beat a car or a motorcycle at a light,'' she said.
Chaz Rice, a spokesman for Bombardier Recreational Products, which makes the Can-Am brands, said it posted a 45 percent increase in North American sales in 2011, in part because Spyders were attracting first-time bikers who had never owned a motorcycle but always thought they would look good on one. ''They are people who say, 'I've always wanted to experience that motorcycle lifestyle but I never wanted to own a motorcycle,' '' Mr. Rice said.
Mr. Buche concurred, saying the trikes had made motorcycling more accessible, something the industry badly needed as sales fell more than 40 percent in 2009 as the recession took hold, and an additional 14 percent a year later.
''It's a product that has broader appeal,'' he said. ''And that's the very thing that can help us.''
Part of that appeal has to do with the stability of three-wheelers, which don't require riders to lean into curves or hold them steady at toplights, both of which can challenge weak knees and muscles. That said, having three wheels can bring certain social challenges. Advertisements for the Spyder, for example, feature the same kind of handsome graying men common to Viagra ads, and show a grizzled rider of a traditional two-wheeler nodding in approval of the three-wheeler. The reality at rallies, however, can be a little different.
''I get ribbed once in a while, people saying I'm an old man,'' said David Jenkins, 56, of Dobson, N.C., who bought his first trike -- a sleek silver Suzuki -- two months ago. ''I always tell them, when they grow up they should get a real motorcycle, a three-wheeler.''
For his part, Mr. Howard said he loved his ride -- a 2010 Honda Goldwing converted by a company called Motor Trike. Barbara, his wife of 50 years, says she likes it, too, though she sounds a touch wistful about the couple's old two-wheel days.
''You feel safer,'' said Ms. Howard, 73, a retired schoolteacher. ''But I liked the lean on the two-wheeler.''
A retired veterans service officer, Mr. Howard -- who wore loafers with Velcro fasteners -- said he had already put 35,000 miles on his trike. And he plans to put on many, many more.
''As long as I can throw a leg over it,'' Mr. Howard said, ''I'm going to keep going.''

HEADLINE: In Chinatown, Martial Arts Alfresco

BYLINE: By REBECCA ROSE RUIZ

 BODY:
ON a recent Saturday morning, I joined eight kung fu students and their master, David Kaplan, in Chinatown for a lesson in martial arts. It was 8 a.m. and raining, but Mr. Kaplan's outdoor classes run six days a week, year-round and without regard for weather.
Mr. Kaplan, an American who has studied both the Chinese discipline of kung fu and its Japanese cousin, karate, for more than two decades, began leading classes in Columbus Park in 1994. Over the years, his class has hosted loyal martial arts practitioners and inexperienced aspirants alike, most either happening upon his sessions or learning of them through friends or neighborhood fliers. 
Until about a year ago, Mr. Kaplan charged students $100 a month for up to eight classes. But in response to the economic downturn and in the interest of encouraging regular participation, he instituted a pay-as-you-can policy. He also barters with students and has accepted artwork, an antique sword and a chicken dinner in exchange for long-term instruction.
The classes run 60 to 90 minutes and typically take place on blacktop in the center of the park. But the rain on this recent morning displaced us and other regular exercise groups to the park's covered pavilion. Nine of us gathered in a circle and stretched, near dozens of older women who were engaged in traditional Chinese dance.
Soon we began drills: front slap-kicks with arm rotations and punches, outside and inside kicks, and a series of warrior poses. Among these were bow-and-arrow and wide-leg horse stances -- a sort of deep squat -- with forward jabs.
Mr. Kaplan, who works full time as a corporate fitness instructor and has performed martial arts in independent films, first demonstrated each pose in a crisp style that recalled Bruce Lee. Then he watched as we mimicked him (or tried to) in two single-file kick lines.
Midway through the drills, he held up a red cushion as high as our heads and had each of us aim kicks at it. Mercifully, he lowered the height of my target after I'd struggled to reach it. He offered personal suggestions to each student, emphasizing technique and comfort over speed and extension.
All the while, a Chinese man played a wooden flute above the traditional recording to which our neighbors were dancing with red and yellow paper fans. Onlookers came and went, several breaking from nearby chess games to study the moves of our mostly Western group.
We concluded the class with leg-strengthening exercises -- frog leaps and crouching duck walks -- and another series of full-body stretches.
Afterward, all but one student went for a traditional Chinese breakfast, a postclass routine.
At Big Wong King on Mott Street, Tadashi Moriyama, a Japanese artist living in Brooklyn, ate his egg congee with gusto and related how he had created a drawing of Mr. Kaplan -- one the instructor now uses in his marketing materials -- in exchange for regular workouts. In addition to honing his martial arts skill, Mr. Moriyama said he had particularly enjoyed interacting with the local Chinese population.
''It's a great cultural exchange,'' he said. ''Before I came to Chinatown just to eat. Now I come to exercise too.''
David Kaplan's classes are held in Columbus Park, Mulberry and Bayard Streets, Chinatown, at 7 a.m., Monday through Friday, and 8 a.m. on Saturday. Additional classes are held elsewhere. He takes donations. Details from brooklynshaolin@gmail.com

HEADLINE: Bloodstains With a Story: The Allure of Artifacts Linked to Famous Crimes

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
A bloodstained tan stocking was unrolled across a Manhattan cafe table the other day. It had belonged to Bonnie Parker, the murderous robber, and was found in her getaway car in 1934 after she and her partner, Clyde Barrow, died in a hail of police bullets.
A waitress at the cafe was told about the clothing's notorious past. ''That is awesome,'' she replied. Then she asked, ''How much is it worth?'' 
The stocking had arrived in New York in the company of Bobby Livingston, a vice president at R R Auction in Amherst, N.H. The company has organized a ''Gangsters, Outlaws, and Lawmen'' memorabilia sale for Sept. 30 in Nashua, N.H.
Souvenir hunters descending on crime scenes had saved many of the objects now in the auction, with estimates into the six figures. The stocking is expected to bring $1,000 to $2,000, in a group lot with Parker's empty aspirin tin, an engraved metal eyeglass earpiece and a screwdriver useful for repairing guns.
Law officers and vigilantes who had gunned down outlaws would routinely hand out bloody relics as crowds gathered. ''There was a mania or whatever about collecting that stuff,'' Mr. Livingston said.
The R R sale is part of a torrent this fall of exhibitions and sales of artifacts connected to felonies.
The public clearly has a taste for the material, given the longstanding popularity of prison museums, including Alcatraz on an island in the San Francisco Bay and Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia. New high-profile displays in Las Vegas, the Mob Museum and Mob Attraction Las Vegas, opened in the last year, and the normally unflashy Library Company of Philadelphia filled galleries this year with theft and prostitution documents for a show, ''Capitalism by Gaslight: The Shadow Economies of 19th-Century America.''
''Moonshine,'' a show opening on Friday at the Gaston County Museum in Dallas, N.C., contains about 75 pieces covering three centuries of illegal distilleries and police crackdowns. Lenders offering their families' bootlegging equipment did not mind having their names mentioned on the wall labels.
On Staten Island new facsimiles of a Prohibition-era diner and a gas station frequented by fictional criminals have been on view for months amid colonial and Victorian buildings at Historic Richmond Town. Film crews constructed the buildings for HBO's ''Boardwalk Empire,'' and the historic site hopes to make them a permanent attraction.
Entire properties where real outlaws holed up have come on the market.
Woodside, a 707-acre ghost town in eastern Utah along Butch Cassidy's thieving trail, is on the market for $3.9 million. Bridge Realty's online ad for Woodside notes that some form of local government could be reinstated, with the new owner in charge: ''Your chance to be the mayor the sheriff the judge and the executioner!!!''
Through Oct. 5 offers are being sought for Ma Barker's lakefront hide-out in Ocklawaha, in central Florida, with a suggested $1 million minimum. The nine-acre property features traces of the F.B.I.'s 1935 machine-gun onslaught that killed Barker and one of her sons, Fred, who had been posing as her husband. Along interior walls ''bullet holes were plastered over but remain clearly visible,'' a news release from Stirling Sotheby's International Realty notes.
The promotional material suggests that new owners could transform the place into a historical society headquarters or bed-and-breakfast. Furniture has been arranged as it looked in F.B.I. photos of the shootout's aftermath.
Evidence of violent death does seem to increase appeal and prices. Last Saturday a pearl-handled Colt revolver taken off the corpse of a Dalton gang member after a botched 1892 bank robbery in Coffeyville, Kan., brought $322,000 at Rock Island Auction Company in Illinois.
In the R R sale a framed array of John Dillinger memorabilia ($6,000 to $8,000) includes a mustache hair pulled off his corpse. A Colt revolver found strapped to Bonnie Parker's thigh is estimated at $150,000 to $200,000. ''Bonnie was 'squatting' on it,'' Frank A. Hamer, the Texas Ranger who led the team ambushing the robbers, wrote in a note authenticating the gun's provenance.
The active roles of female outlaws, including Parker, are receiving more scholarly attention, said Ellen Poulsen, a crime historian and the author of several books, including ''Don't Call Us Molls: Women of the John Dillinger Gang.'' ''These auctions, in a lot of ways, do act as conduits to history and updating what we already know about these people,'' she added.
Criminals' sweeter and more pathetic sides can emerge in objects for sale. R R is offering numerous gangsters' affectionate letters to family members, as well as Al Capone's white plastic rosary ($3,000 to $5,000) and his handwritten sheet music for a love song to his wife ($45,000 to $50,000). Parker's reddish-brown leatherette cosmetic case ($5,000 to $10,000) is described as ''one of the only creature comforts in the otherwise rough and violent life of a young fugitive.''
Gruesome crime artifacts have been pulled from the market in recent weeks. Vintage Memorabilia, a manuscripts and autographs dealer in Seattle, has offered a 1960s archive from the Kansas criminal investigator Harold Nye, who tracked down the Clutter family murderers and was the hero of Truman Capote's ''In Cold Blood.'' Vintage Memorabilia's online request for bids, which closes on Sept. 30, was originally to have included unpublished crime-scene photos.
But the gory images have been deemed unsalable and returned to Kansas authorities to prevent new owners from disseminating them. Bids are being sought instead for Nye's letters from Capote and signed copies of Capote's books (with minimum offers between $2,500 and $5,000 each). In one letter Capote wrote that he longed for the murder trials to end and the executions to take place, ''so that I can finish the book before I'm too old and feeble to hold a pen.''

HEADLINE: Fossil Fuel Ads Dominate TV In Campaign

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Barack Obama first ran for president, being green was so popular that oil companies like Chevron were boasting about their commitment to renewable energy, and his Republican opponent, John McCain, supported action on global warming.
As Mr. Obama seeks re-election, that world is a distant memory. Some of the mightiest players in the oil, gas and coal industries are financing an aggressive effort to defeat him, or at least press him to adopt policies that are friendlier to fossil fuels. And the president's former allies in promoting wind and solar power and caps on greenhouse gases? They are disenchanted and sitting on their wallets.
This year's campaign on behalf of fossil fuels includes a surge in political contributions to Mitt Romney, attack ads questioning Mr. Obama's clean-energy agenda, and television spots that are not overtly partisan but criticize administration actions like new air pollution rules and the delay of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada.
''Since Obama became president, gas prices have nearly doubled,'' said one advertisement by the American Energy Alliance, a group financed in part by oil executives. ''Tell Obama we can't afford his failing energy policies.'' 
With nearly two months before Election Day on Nov. 6, estimated spending on television ads promoting coal and more oil and gas drilling or criticizing clean energy has exceeded $153 million this year, according to an analysis by The New York Times of 138 ads on energy issues broadcast this year by the presidential campaigns, political parties, energy companies, trade associations and third-party spenders.
That tally is nearly four times the $41 million spent by clean-energy advocates, the Obama campaign and Democratic groups to defend the president's energy record or raise concerns about global warming and air pollution. The Times rated presidential campaign and national policy ads by whether they promoted fossil fuels or pushed clean energy and conservation, regardless of their sponsors, using ad and spending data compiled by Kantar Media, a company that tracks television advertising.
The lopsided nature of the energy messages this year contrasts sharply with 2008. Back then, global warming was a top public concern, and green ads greatly outnumbered those for fossil fuels, $152 million to $109 million, according to the analysis by The Times, which looked at 184 energy-related ads. In 2008, Chevron, one of the nation's leading oil companies, trumpeted its investments in geothermal power, and Mr. McCain spent millions of dollars on ads featuring solar panels and wind farms as part of a solution to global warming.
But climate change legislation died in Congress, Republicans gained a majority in the House, and pocketbook issues like the price of gasoline began dominating public discussion. After imposing a yearlong oil and gas drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico in response to the disastrous BP spill in 2010, President Obama recast himself as favoring an ''all of the above'' energy strategy, allowing the industry to drill offshore as deep as ever and moving to open up new regions like Alaska's Arctic waters.
The shift left many fossil fuel critics disillusioned and unwilling to do much to support the president. ''It's hard to think of any environmental activist who is enthused about anything Obama does these days,'' said Brendan Cummings, senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity, which challenges the industry on drilling plans. ''Obama's explicit embrace of fossil fuels and implicit embrace of all the environmental degradation that entails are almost indistinguishable from the policies of the Bush administration.''
Mr. Obama's policy decisions on the Keystone pipeline and clean air rules did not win him friends in the fossil fuel world, either. Many of the industry's titans are going all out to elect Mr. Romney, who has promised to open up more land and coastline to oil and gas drilling, end wind and solar power subsidies and curb regulations that discourage burning coal for electricity.
''The stakes are high,'' said Steve Miller, the recently retired president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which has spent about $12 million on pro-coal television ads, according to the Kantar data. ''Our goal is to assure that whoever is elected will have seen a groundswell for coal in swing states.''
The Times analysis shows that ads with energy themes have played an outsized role in the 2012 campaign season, with energy earning more frequent mentions than every other issue except jobs and the economy.
Energy first emerged as a major advertising topic during the last presidential election. Back then, one of the biggest spenders was the Alliance for Climate Protection, an environmental group backed by former Vice President Al Gore that spent an estimated $32 million on ads urging legislation to combat global warming.
This year, the alliance, now called the Climate Reality Project, is not buying television ads at all, focusing instead on social media, training and organizing. ''Whatever we would spend, it would just be washed away in this sea of fossil fuel money,'' said Maggie L. Fox, the group's chief executive.
Other clean-energy players, particularly from the solar industry, are also keeping a low profile after Solyndra, a California solar module manufacturer that received half a billion dollars in federal loans, declared bankruptcy and became a favorite Republican target.
Certain environmental groups, like the Sierra Club, are still running their own television commercials this year in support of Mr. Obama's policies. And the wind industry is on a campaign to win renewal of a major tax credit. But ''we are being outgunned by orders of magnitude,'' said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. ''There is just no way we can compete with some of the richest companies in the history of the world.''
The American Petroleum Institute, backed by the nation's largest oil and gas companies, is the top energy spender this year with its ''I'm an energy voter'' campaign. Although the ads avoid explicitly endorsing any candidate, they clearly echo policy stands taken by Mr. Romney and the Republicans: opposing regulations that might slow down drilling and denouncing Mr. Obama's proposal to eliminate oil industry subsidies.
''New energy taxes could hurt drivers and families,'' one ad says. ''Better to produce more energy here, like oil and natural gas. That will help the economy. That's good for everyone.''
The petroleum institute has spent an estimated $37 million so far on television ads, according to the Kantar data, more than it spent in all of 2008. And it is just one of nearly two dozen groups -- including Americans for Prosperity, backed by the oil billionaire David H. Koch, and Crossroads GPS -- that are running advertisements this year advocating more fossil-fuel production or condemning spending by the Obama administration on solar and wind projects.
''These are companies and industries that clearly feel threatened,'' said Ken Goldstein, president of Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. ''And when companies and industries with resources feel threatened, they air advertisements.''
The fossil fuel industries have also used more subtle tactics, like mobilizing miners to wear pro-coal hats and shirts at candidate events and placing a coal industry logo on the cars for Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s Nascar team.
Their trade associations have targeted swing states like Ohio, Colorado, Virginia and Pennsylvania, where there are established operations like coal mines or fast-growing new efforts, like fields where natural gas is extracted through hydraulic fracturing, a technique that could face new restrictions from regulators.
''President Obama has placed a de facto embargo on energy production on American lands and shores,'' said Benjamin Cole, a spokesman for the American Energy Alliance, which expects to spend $7 million on television ads and other media to defeat Mr. Obama. ''It's irresponsible and overzealous.''
The imbalance in spending shows up on the campaign finance side as well.
Mr. Romney, the Republican National Committee and Mr. Romney's political action committee have taken in at least $13 million in campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal industry executives or their related groups.
By comparison, Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee have received less than $950,000 from the fossil fuel industry over the past two years, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. The clean-energy industry has hardly made up the difference, with Mr. Obama directly collecting only about $78,000 from it so far, according to the center's data.
The surge in energy-related political spending partly reflects the rise in overall election spending after the Supreme Court lifted limits on corporate contributions in 2010. Mr. Romney, for example, has accepted $3 million in contributions from Oxbow, a coal company controlled by William Koch, a brother of David Koch.
At a $50,000-a-plate shrimp-and-steak lunch in Houston last month, Mr. Romney solicited advice on energy policy from scores of oil and gas executives.
The group -- which included Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, and Harold G. Hamm of Continental Resources, a top adviser to the Romney campaign -- told Mr. Romney that the best thing he could do would be to reduce the regulatory burdens on the industry and permit more drilling on federal lands.
''There is a lot more at stake now,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, associate director of the Rice University energy program. ''The producers can drill a lot in the United States or they could lose the right to drill in the United States. It's a campaign about the E.P.A., how the president responds to a major accident, and it's about do we or don't we lease on federal lands.''

HEADLINE: Fed Links New Aid To Jobs Recovery In Forceful Move

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve opened a new chapter Thursday in its efforts to stimulate the economy, saying that it intends to buy large quantities of mortgage bonds, and potentially other assets, until the job market improves substantially.
This is the first time that the Fed has tied the duration of an aid program to its economic objectives. And, in announcing the change, the central bank made clear that its primary reason was not a deterioration in its economic outlook, but a determination to respond more forcefully -- in effect, an acknowledgment that its incremental approach until now had been flawed.
The concern about unemployment also reflects a significant shift in the priorities of the nation's central bank, which has long focused on inflation. Inflation is now running below the Fed's 2 percent annual target. But with the unemployment rate above 8 percent, the Fed's policy-making committee suggested Thursday that it might tolerate a period of somewhat higher inflation, promising to maintain stimulus efforts ''for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.'' 
''The weak job market should concern every American,'' the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference. The goal of the new policies, he added, ''is to quicken the recovery, to help the economy begin to grow quickly enough to generate new jobs.''
The need for new stimulus reflects the disappointing condition of the American economy, which continues to struggle between crisis and prosperity three years after the official end of the recession. More than 20 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs. Median household income has declined. The housing market remains depressed.
The Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, issued a statement describing the Fed's announcement as ''further confirmation that President Obama's policies have not worked.''
Mr. Romney added that he did not think the Fed's efforts would work, either.
Democrats, in turn, laid the blame on Republicans in Congress. ''The Fed is fulfilling its obligation to take action to address unemployment. Now Congressional Republicans need to fulfill theirs,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a statement.
Delighted investors responded by piling into the stock market, instantly gratifying one of the Fed's primary objectives for its program -- to push money into riskier investments. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 1.63 percent; shares in home builders rose on the news.
''There weren't many more accommodative options the Fed could have gone with,'' said Dan Greenhaus, the chief global strategist at BTIG, an institutional brokerage firm.
The Fed said it would add $23 billion of mortgage bonds to its portfolio by the end of September, a pace of $40 billion in purchases a month. It will then announce a new target at the end of this month, and every subsequent month, until the labor market outlook improves ''substantially,'' as long as inflation remains in check. It did not further explain either standard.
Mr. Bernanke said the committee had decided to announce a ''qualitative'' standard because no single number sufficiently represented the health of the labor market.
''We will be looking for the sort of broad-based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment,'' he said.
Some analysts cautioned, however, that the lack of a specific standard could limit the impact.
''These moves indicate the accommodation switch has been turned on,'' Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note to clients after the announcement on Thursday.
''On the other hand, boldness has been traded for more uncertainty, as the overall amount and duration of Fed purchases will be dependent on evolving economic conditions.''
The committee's statement provided a measure of guidance, in the form of an outer limit on the Fed's intentions. It said that the Fed now intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least through the middle of 2015, roughly half-a-year longer than its previous statement. And the projections of senior Fed officials showed that all but one committee member expected to start raising rates by the end of 2015.
Perhaps more important than that timeline was the committee's insistence, echoed by Mr. Bernanke, that the 2015 horizon was not an estimate of when the recovery would begin, but rather an indication of the Fed's determination to keep its foot on the gas well past that point.
''We're not going to rush to begin to tighten policy,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''We're going to give it some time to make sure that the recovery is well established.''
Eleven members of the committee voted in favor of the statement. The only dissent came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va.
The scale of the new effort is smaller than the Fed's previous asset purchases. The first round, starting in 2008, averaged more than $100 billion a month. The second, beginning in 2010, averaged $75 billion a month. The current round will begin at a pace of $40 billion a month, although the volume remains subject to adjustment.
The Fed said it would also continue to purchase Treasury securities under an existing program that runs through the end of the year, taking the total volume to roughly $85 billion a month through the rest of the year.
There is broad disagreement among economists about the effects of the Fed's actions. The Fed's own research shows it may have raised economic output by 3 percent and created more than two million jobs. Most independent analyses have reached more modest conclusions, and some experts argue that there is little evidence of any meaningful economic impact.
The first round of purchases, known as QE1, aimed to arrest the financial crisis, in part by clearing room on bank balance sheets. The second round, called QE2, was started amid concerns that prices were increasing too slowly, raising the specter of deflation. This round, by contrast, is aimed squarely at the huge and persistent unemployment crisis.
The decision to focus on mortgage bonds reflects the Fed's conviction that the housing market still needs help, and that lower rates on mortgage loans will produce broad economic benefits. Buying bonds drives down rates by increasing competition for the remaining bonds, forcing investors to accept a lower rate of return or move their money into other, riskier assets.
Joel Naroff, principal of Naroff Economic Advisors, described the decision as ''housing or nothing.''
''The Fed is admitting that its best bet to improve growth is by continuing to help this sector,'' he wrote. ''By keeping mortgage rates down, the members are betting that housing starts will accelerate, creating more jobs and income. Otherwise, there is little reason to ease further.''
Fed officials expressed confidence that the effort would help.
The Fed's senior officials -- the 17 members of its policy-making committee -- expect the economy to expand from 1.7 to 2 percent this year, down from their June estimate of growth of 1.9 to 2.4 percent, according to projections also released Thursday. They continued to predict the unemployment rate would not fall below 8 percent.
However, they predicted growth would be somewhat faster in coming years, and unemployment would decline somewhat more quickly, presumably reflecting the steps announced Thursday.
And some outside economists agreed. ''The Fed's actions may not on their own result in a sudden change in the economy,'' wrote Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''However, more accommodative financial conditions can only add to growth over time.''
Other economists, however, said the benefits would be small at best. They argue that interest rates already are near record lows, and that the primary constraints to new borrowing are that many borrowers cannot qualify for new loans and many homeowners cannot sell or refinance because they owe more than the current value of their homes.
No one predicted that the Fed's new program would return unemployment to normal levels in the foreseeable future, or increase growth enough to eliminate the huge and growing shortfall in economic output since the onset of the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: The Fed Makes Its Move

 BODY:
If the economy falters from here on out, it will be difficult to blame the Federal Reserve. Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and all but one of the other members of the Fed policy committee, took decisive steps on Thursday to spur the economy, pledging to buy $85 billion worth of assets each month until the end of the year and to continue pumping money into the economy until the job market improves ''substantially.'' 
Left unsaid was what would constitute substantial improvement, though it is generally assumed that the Fed is looking for an unemployment rate of 7 percent along with a clear downward trend, versus the current level of 8.1 percent.
The open-ended nature of the plan and its linkage to jobs are welcome changes from previous interventions. Those efforts came with preset limits and expiration dates and thus had a sporadic quality that made them seem disconnected from the actual state of the economy.
Will the latest approach work? No one knows for sure because each new round of strong monetary easing is to some degree experimental. What is known is that fiscal policy makers -- that is, Congress -- have failed to step forward with stimulative policies, largely because Republicans have refused to even consider measures to hire teachers, rebuild schools and otherwise create jobs.
The burden of addressing persistently high unemployment has therefore fallen on the Fed. The Fed is also obliged to act under its dual mandate, which calls for price stability and full employment. Its new actions are well within that mandate.
At best, however, they will boost job growth indirectly. The asset purchases are aimed at encouraging lending by lowering interest rates, particularly for mortgages; more refinancings and home sales would be a powerful boost to the economy. Lower interest rates could also persuade investors to move their money into stocks, lifting the stock market, and from there, consumer spending.
The near-term stimulus the Fed is seeking would also buy insurance against potential economic shocks down the road, including failure in Washington to draw back from the looming fiscal cliff as well as continuing strains in the euro zone.
The economy needs more help than the Fed can provide. But the Fed is to be applauded for doing what it can.

HEADLINE: Pressing Germany to Lead the Euro Zone or Leave It

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
VIENNA -- George Soros made headlines this week with a striking proposal that to save Europe, Germany must ''lead or leave.'' The leadership part was familiar: Outside Germany, at least, it is becoming conventional wisdom that Europe will survive only if the Union's behemoth provides more decisive leadership -- and writes bigger checks.
The catch is that the rest of Europe, particularly its beleaguered so-called Club Med countries, doesn't seem to be in much of a position to coerce Berlin to do anything. That is where Mr. Soros's second alternative -- leaving -- comes in. In an interview in Vienna last weekend and in a speech in Berlin on Monday, Mr. Soros added his influential voice to a cluster of iconoclasts who have asserted that Southern Europe's fate need not be decided in Germany. 
If Germany is unwilling to lead, Mr. Soros argues, the Southern Europeans should ask Germany to leave. His prediction is that these currently sickly nations would do perfectly well.
''If Germany left, the common market could hold together and actually it would be a remarkable relief,'' Mr. Soros told me. ''The euro would fall in value, so the debt which is denominated in euro would also fall in value and the competitiveness of the debtor countries compared to Germany and the other creditor countries would greatly improve.''
In this scenario, the Club Med countries would benefit partly from the inflation and currency devaluation that their existing monetary marriage to Germany precludes. Their renaissance would also be based on their economic fundamentals, which Mr. Soros argues are strong but are being discounted by the markets because of the existing fiscal and monetary straitjacket.
''It's remarkable, remarkable, when you look at the Latin euro, that is to say the euro excluding Germany, it actually compares very favorably, not only with Britain, but with the United States and Japan,'' Mr. Soros said.
''A Latin euro, where the members formed a fiscal union and would therefore go to introducing euro bonds, would be able to borrow at rates comparable to Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom. They would rank equally on the macroeconomic basis, if you compare them in terms of total indebtedness and deficit.''
Mr. Soros argues that Europe couldn't survive the exit of one of its weaker, southern members but that it could weather the ''amicable'' departure of Germany.
''If Italy or Spain left, not only the euro but also the common market and the European Union would fall apart,'' he told me. ''Whereas if Germany left, the common market could hold together.''
Mr. Soros acknowledges that a German departure would be ''a big dislocation'' and a ''shock,'' but he thinks that the euro and the financial arrangements it supports would endure. This is, mildly put, not the consensus view.
Yet Mr. Soros knows a thing or two about currencies and bonds, which is why his economic policy prescriptions carry such weight.
He is also one of the millions of Europeans with experience of death and destruction. As a teenager, Mr. Soros hid from the Nazis in occupied Budapest; a couple of years later, still in his teens, he fled the Communists to make his way, penniless and alone, in Western Europe.
That personal history helped to inspire the second part of Mr. Soros's message: of the promise and the peril of Europe. When it comes to peril, Mr. Soros warned that existing policy is sorting the Continent into two tiers. This Europe, he said, ''is divided into debtors and creditors, with the creditors led by Germany being in charge and calling the shots and the debtors relegated to an inferior status which is threatening to become permanent.''
The historical precedent, he noted, was grim: ''After the First World War, when the French imposed reparation payments on Germany, then they were sort of the tough taskmasters, they occupied the Saar, and the result was the rise of Hitler. It really would be a tragedy if Germany now fell into the same trap.''
Now for the promise: Mr. Soros remains a committed European, passionately supportive of the moral idea that animated European convergence.
''The European Union,'' he said, ''was meant to be an association, a voluntary association of equal states, each of which is devoted to the principles of democracy, rule of law, human rights, sacrificing part of their sovereignty for the common good.''
Millions of bitter experiences like those of the Soros family were the most powerful reason Europeans vowed never again, and embarked on their ambitious unification project. Mr. Soros notes that a successful European Union is important far beyond its borders.
''A united and prosperous Europe, devoted to the principles of open society, is very much needed by the world,'' he told me. ''I have a network of foundations working in various parts of the world, and I can give you personal testimony of how important it is to have a Europe that is strong enough to project its influence in the rest of the world. Take, for instance, the transformation that's taking place in Burma, or in some of the African countries; there's a very positive role that the European Union can play.''
As Europe teeters from one crisis to the next, Mr. Soros reminds us all that at its heart, the European Union is about more than deficits and currencies and bonds. Europe is also a political and moral idea -- one very much worth preserving.

HEADLINE: Obama Rebuffs Netanyahu on Setting Limits on Iran's Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and HELENE COOPER; David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Tuesday rejected an appeal by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to spell out a specific ''red line'' that Iran could not cross in its nuclear program, a senior administration official said, deepening the divide between the allies over how to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions.
In an hourlong telephone conversation, this official said, Mr. Obama deflected Mr. Netanyahu's proposal to make the size of Iran's stockpile of close-to-bomb-grade uranium the threshold for a military strike by the United States against its nuclear facilities. 
Mr. Obama, the official said, repeated the assurances he gave to Mr. Netanyahu in March that the United States would not allow Iran to manufacture a nuclear weapon. But the president was unwilling to agree on any specific action by Iran -- like reaching a defined threshold on nuclear material, or failing to adhere to a deadline on negotiations -- that would lead to American military action.
''We need some ability for the president to have decision-making room,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the talks. ''We have a red line, which is a nuclear weapon. We're committed to that red line.''
Israeli officials, however, say this guarantee may not be enough for Israel, which Iranian leaders have repeatedly threatened with annihilation. Diplomatic talks, the Israelis say, have done nothing to slow Iran's nuclear program -- nor have economic sanctions, though they have inflicted significant damage on the Iranian economy.
The telephone conversation came after a day that seemed to epitomize the frequently crossed wires between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu. It began with angry comments by the prime minister that the Obama administration had no ''moral right'' to restrain Israel from taking military action on its own if it refused to put limits on Iran. It continued with reports in the Israeli news media that the White House had rebuffed a request by Mr. Netanyahu's office for a meeting with Mr. Obama during the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month. The White House denied those reports, citing more mundane scheduling problems. Finally, on Tuesday evening, Mr. Obama called Mr. Netanyahu.
The source of the conflict is the belief by Mr. Netanyahu that Iran, having continued to stockpile uranium enriched to 20 percent, is nearing the point at which Israel will no longer be able to prevent it from making a bomb.
Administration officials contend that the United States will still be able to detect, and prevent, Iran from passing that point. Nor does the administration have evidence that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has even made a decision to build a bomb. Iran, for its part, insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes.
Israel's latest burst of anxiety about Iran comes in the midst of the American presidential election, leading some analysts to argue that Mr. Netanyahu is trying to use political leverage on Mr. Obama to stiffen his position. His Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, has accused Mr. Obama of not doing enough to protect a close ally.
Israeli officials flatly deny that Mr. Netanyahu is playing election-year politics. They said the prime minister was deeply frustrated by a recent interview with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in which she said the United States was ''not setting deadlines.''
People with close ties to Israel say Mr. Netanyahu and other Israeli officials are also frustrated because the Americans do not appear sufficiently concerned about Iran's growing stockpile of medium-enriched uranium. In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency says the Iranians have amassed enough low- and medium-enriched uranium that, with further enrichment, could fuel as many as six nuclear weapons.
Basing a military judgment on Iran's stockpile of medium-enriched uranium could be tricky, however, because while the overall amount of this material has increased, the amount that can be readily used to fuel a bomb has declined since Iran converted some of it into plates to be used in a research reactor in Tehran.
''The Israelis are worried that once Iran accumulates a bomb's worth of 20 percent-enriched uranium, it's an easy dash to get weapons-grade nuclear fuel,'' said David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who met recently with Israeli officials. ''Before they decide they're on their own, I think they want to know that they and Washington see eye-to-eye that this is a red line that cannot be passed.''
Indeed, Israeli officials appear reluctant to act without the backing of the United States. Mr. Netanyahu faces deep divisions within his own country about the wisdom of a military strike. On Thursday, Israel's deputy prime minister for intelligence and atomic affairs, Dan Meridor, appeared to undercut Mr. Netanyahu, saying in an interview with Israeli Army radio, ''I don't want to set red lines or deadlines for myself.''

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Expected to Act to Spur Economy

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are expected to conclude a two-day meeting Thursday and announce new measures to aid the ailing American recovery.
This year, the central bank has raised its unemployment forecasts, lowered its growth estimates for the overall economy and noted a significant slowdown. In recent communications, the Fed's top policy-making committee has strongly signaled that it plans to do more. 
''It is important to achieve further progress, particularly in the labor market,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, said at a conference at the end of August, as he made the case for the bank to act again. ''Taking due account of the uncertainties and limits of its policy tools, the Federal Reserve will provide additional policy accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery.''
Stocks traded slightly higher Thursday morning ahead of the Fed announcement. The Fed was to announce its strategy at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time, and Mr. Bernanke was expected to speak at a news conference at 2:15 p.m.
Although it is possible that the Fed would hold off action until its next meeting, there are several options available.
It provided some hints in an official account of its last meeting, which ended on Aug. 1.
First is what bankers, economists and traders have termed ''QE3,'' a major round of asset purchases aimed at pulling down long-term interest rates. Many market analysts believe that the Fed might include aggressive purchases of mortgage-backed securities, to aid a housing market that is just showing signs of recovery. QE3 is shorthand for what would be a third round of quantitative easing, a strategy designed to bring down long-term rates to spur growth.
Second, the bank could promise to keep the federal funds rate, or short-term interest rates, near zero for a longer period than it has already indicated. The Fed has already signaled that it anticipates keeping rates low through 2014. Members also discussed tying the bank's guidance on interest rates to the state of the economy, rather than the calendar.
Finally, the participants in the Aug. 1 meeting talked about reducing the interest rate paid on commercial bank reserves, a move that should encourage financial institutions to lend that money in favor of higher yields.

HEADLINE: Amid Mideast Turmoil, Aides Say What a President Romney Would Do

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ASHLEY PARKER; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Ashley Parker from Fairfax, Va.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If Mitt Romney were in the Oval Office during this week of turmoil in the Middle East, his foreign policy advisers said on Thursday, he would have already told Iran that he would not allow it to get close to building a bomb, setting a ''red line'' in a far different place from President Obama's.
He would tell the Egyptians that if they wanted $1 billion in debt forgiveness -- as promised by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton this month -- they would have to put far more effort into protecting American interests in the country, starting with the United States Embassy. 
And he would provide far more aid to elements of the Syrian opposition, including, according to one adviser, ''facilitating'' the provision of lethal arms from other Arab states. But, like President Obama, he would stop short of arming them directly.
And the United States would have been far more involved in the formation of a new Libya, the advisers insisted, though they conceded it was not clear that could have stopped the attack that killed the American ambassador there and three other American officers.
Those contrasts were described on Thursday by two of Mr. Romney's most senior foreign policy advisers, Eliot Cohen and Richard Williamson, in response to a request for a description of how Mr. Romney would have handled an enormously challenging week in the Middle East. The specificity was far greater than what Mr. Romney himself has been offering up on the campaign trail, where he speaks in broad strokes about his foreign policy plans.
Over the past few days, he has stuck largely to accusations that Mr. Obama has ''apologized'' for America and projected weakness, suggesting that was the root cause of this week's protests in Cairo and the lethal violence in Libya.
Even on Thursday, as the turmoil in Egypt and Libya seemed to bleed into other areas of the region, Mr. Romney largely chose to bypass discussion of the challenges in dealing with the two countries, instead offering a more general critique of the president. ''As we watch the world today, sometimes it seems that we're at the mercy of events, instead of shaping events, and a strong America is essential to shape events,'' Mr. Romney said, speaking to a modest-size crowd in Fairfax, Va., just outside Washington.
And in an interview with ABC News, Mr. Romney declined to respond to Mr. Obama's charge that he has a tendency to shoot first and aim later. ''Well, this is politics,'' he said. ''I'm not going to worry about the campaign.''
The sharpest foreign policy difference, described by Mr. Cohen, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a former senior official in the State Department under President George W. Bush, came in response to questions about how Mr. Romney would handle Iran.
President Obama has said he would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but has so far refused calls from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to set a ''red line'' sooner, one that would put Iran on notice that it would be subject to military attack if it continued to develop the capability to build such a weapon. Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu continued that debate in an hourlong phone call on Tuesday night, hours after the Israeli leader suggested the United States had no ''moral authority'' to restrain Israel from attacking Iran if it was unwilling to set clear limits for the Iranians.
Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Romney ''would not be content with an Iran one screwdriver's turn away from a nuclear weapon.'' But he stopped short of saying exactly where, in the development of nuclear capability, Mr. Romney would draw the line. It could be in a different place than Mr. Netanyahu draws it, he said.
That vagueness is crucial because by some definitions, Iran already has the capability to produce a nuclear weapon, though it might take several months or years to realize.
''Once they get a weapon, or on the verge of getting it, it's too late,'' Mr. Cohen said.
Mr. Romney has said he would never allow Iran to enrich uranium, suggesting he would enforce a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that Iran ''suspend'' its production of all nuclear fuel. But Iran was in violation of that demand through most of Mr. Bush's second term, and suffered fewer economic consequences than it has under Mr. Obama, who has imposed the first sanctions against Iran's oil revenues.
Both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Williamson said the president had been far too cautious in supporting opposition forces in Syria, describing him as too risk-averse in the Middle East. ''It's playing out in Syria,'' said Mr. Williamson, a former ambassador who has served a series of Republican presidents. ''We are not better off in letting things drift. We have 20,000 dead, and the more it goes on the fewer choices we have.''
Mr. Cohen suggested that the only way to separate out ''the good guys and the bad guys among the opposition'' was to engage them. ''If we don't help, these guys they will turn to whoever can help.''
But both men stopped short of saying that the United States should provide lethal arms. A senior Obama administration official said that ''sounds a lot like they are endorsing our position.''
On Egypt, Mr. Cohen suggested that the administration had failed to make clear that American aid was contingent on the protection of American interests. In fact, Mr. Obama's aides, in trips to Cairo, have been careful not to threaten pulling that aid, but they have warned the Egyptian authorities that Congressional approval could be enormously difficult unless the country's leaders reaffirmed the peace treaty with Israel.
Mr. Williamson continued the Romney campaign's attack on a statement issued by the American Embassy in Cairo hours before protests began there, saying ''you don't issue a conciliatory statement that says we don't support freedom of speech.'' The statement did condemn a virulent anti-Muslim video that set off the violence, but it also included references to both the importance of free speech and religious tolerance.

HEADLINE: An Expiring Tax Credit Threatens the Wind Power Industry

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
When Brad Sawyer graduates next spring from Texas State Technical College in Sweetwater, he hopes to get a job as a wind turbine technician, working on the towering three-bladed machines that dot the West Texas countryside.
''I think that the jobs will be there,'' said Mr. Sawyer, who is in the wind energy technology associate's degree program. However, he added, if the federal government changes its policy on wind power, things could get ''pretty tight.''
Mr. Sawyer and wind power companies are closely watching developments in Washington, where a tax credit benefiting wind farms is due to expire at the end of this year. The implications of that could be especially significant in Texas, the top wind power state, which contains about a fifth of the nation's turbines and is building expensive transmission lines to support more growth.
Some of the state's leading Republicans, despite advocating for wind power in the past, are now doing little. 
''We haven't had the industry come to a stop like this before in a long, long time,'' said Walt Hornaday, president of Cielo Wind Power, an Austin-based wind farm developer. His company is pursuing work in other countries, but otherwise, he said, ''we would definitely be looking at very large layoffs.''
Federal tax policies lie at the heart of the industry's woes. An incentive called the production tax credit, in existence since 1992, expires in December. It allows wind farm owners to lower their tax bills in exchange for producing electricity. Wind companies want Congress to extend the credit, as has happened many times before, to sustain their emissions-free and drought-proof energy source. But a growing number of Republicans, including the presidential nominee Mitt Romney, are pushing back against green energy subsidies.
Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who has approved extensions of the credit in the past, voted in the Senate Finance Committee in August against a bill containing a one-year extension. (The extension passed the committee but remains stuck in Congress.) However, he would back a one-year extension if the tax benefits were reduced by 20 percent.
''People are starting to question, and that's a good thing, but it's taken a long time,'' said Patricia Lapoint, who lives near a West Texas wind farm and has been fighting the industry for years.
Jessica Sandlin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cornyn, said in an e-mail that the senator ''believes Congress must undertake real, comprehensive tax reform rather than a piecemeal approach.'' Similarly, Gov. Rick Perry, viewed as a wind power stalwart for championing transmission lines and signing a renewable energy mandate in 2005, now emphasizes the need to remove federal energy subsidies -- a popular talking point among Tea Party supporters.
Because wind farms must begin operating this year to be eligible for the credit, which they can then claim for 10 years, developers are rushing to finish wind farms. Next year, activity is expected to drop sharply. Construction is especially busy in parts of South and North Texas, said Andy Bowman, the president of Pioneer Green Energy, an Austin-based renewable energy developer. West Texas has seen activity slow while more transmission lines to carry the power get built, he said.
Some wind experts think the credit extension will ultimately pass Congress, albeit after the November election, because it has strong bipartisan support in other windy states (if not Texas). But others do not, and the industry is bemoaning the difficulty of long-term planning. A one-year extension could mean the wrangling resumes next year. Mr. Hornaday said that Texas could benefit more than other states from an extension because there are fewer rules here, making wind farms easier to build.
If obstacles to permits surface in other states, Mr. Hornaday said, ''I can always pick up the turbines and put them in Texas.''
But if the credit is not extended, the surviving development activity could move to states with clean-energy requirements or higher energy prices than those in Texas, Mr. Bowman said. (Texas has long surpassed its renewable power mandate.)
Texas is feeling the slowdown. Vestas, a major turbine manufacturer based in Denmark, is closing a research and development facility in Houston that opened just three years ago and once employed 75 people. Trinity Industries, a Dallas-based manufacturer of industrial equipment, foresees a ''significant decline in wind tower production in 2013'' if the credit expires, according to comments in July by William A. McWhirter II, a senior official with the company.
Officials are also expressing concerns about wind power's role in the Texas electric grid. Wind accounted for 8.7 percent of the grid's energy for the first eight months of this year. But some officials recently complained that the turbines bring down wholesale electricity prices because their fuel -- wind -- is free, and the production tax credit reduces the price further, so sometimes it is even negative.
As the theory goes, this cheap energy cuts into the profitability of companies that operate natural gas- or coal-fired power plants, making them disinclined to build new plants, which are needed to keep the lights on.
Last week at a State Senate committee hearing, Donna Nelson, chairwoman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, blamed federal renewable energy incentives for distorting the market and being ''one of the primary causes'' of the grid's current strains. Wind advocates counter that the abundance of natural gas, not wind, is the chief reason power prices are low.
''I think we all need to move with extreme caution before adopting any additional incentives or mandates,'' Ms. Nelson said.
Ms. Nelson's agency has helped give wind power an important lift. Because of legislation passed in 2005, Texas is building $6.9 billion in transmission lines -- about $270 for every Texan -- to transport wind power from West Texas to cities hundreds of miles away. The lines should be finished by the end of next year, and costs will be recouped from ratepayers, subject to the approval of the utility commission, which is overseeing the buildout. The expansion is supposed to increase the amount of wind power currently on the Texas grid by about 60 percent or more.
But if the tax credit expires, there might not be as much wind power at the end of the lines as Texas officials had envisioned, at least initially.
''It's kind of like in real estate -- if you build a bunch of roads to real estate development, and then the real estate market comes to a stop, eventually houses will get built,'' Mr. Hornaday said. ''But yes, there's a pretty big potential that a lot of those improvements will be idled for a few years.''
Wind faces other obstacles, too. Texas officials have recently begun scrutinizing property tax breaks that wind developers receive and are listening to naval aviators' concerns about radar interference from the turbines that have proliferated along the Texas coast. Asked what to expect during the next legislative session, Russel Smith, the executive director of the Texas Renewable Energy Industries Association, said he planned to emphasize the economic development benefits of wind.
''There's certainly a sense that even more than last session,'' Mr. Smith said, ''there's going to be a lot of playing defense.''

HEADLINE: Spotlight Is on Libya, but Bigger Challenge for White House May Lie in Egypt

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and MARK LANDLER. 
Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington, and Richard Berry from Paris.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For all the harrowing images of the deadly attack on the American mission in Benghazi, the Obama administration is grappling with the possibility that its far bigger long-term problem lies in Egypt, not Libya.
Hours before the attacks in Benghazi on Tuesday, the American Embassy in Cairo came under siege from protesters. While the violence there did not result in any American deaths, the tepid response from the Egyptian government to the assault gave officials in Washington -- already troubled by the direction of President Mohamed Morsi's new Islamist government -- further cause for concern.
President Obama telephoned Mr. Morsi and the president of Libya's National Assembly, the White House said early on Thursday, in calls that seemed different in tone, suggesting dissatisfaction with Cairo's response as opposed to Tripoli's.
To Mohammed Magarief, the leader of Libya's National Assembly, Mr. Obama ''expressed appreciation for the cooperation we have received from the Libyan government and people in responding to this outrageous attack,'' the White House said in a statement. 
To Mr. Morsi, there was no mention of appreciation. Instead, the White House said in a separate but parallel statement that Mr. Obama ''underscored the importance of Egypt following through on its commitment to cooperate with the United States in securing U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel.''
President Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, pointedly noted that Libyan authorities had tried to help the American effort to protect diplomats in Benghazi. ''This attack will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya,'' Mr. Obama said. The Libyans ''helped some of our diplomats find safety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens's body to the hospital, where we tragically learned he had died,'' he added, referring to the envoy J. Christopher Stevens.
The president found less reason to be pleased with Egypt, historically the second-largest recipient of American foreign aid after Israel, at $2 billion a year. Mr. Morsi issued only a mild rebuke of the rioters -- and on Facebook -- while his movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, has called for a second day of protests against the lurid anti-Muslim video that set off the riots. And though the Egyptian police coordinated with American officials, Mr. Morsi waited 24 hours before issuing his statement against the militants who stormed the embassy; Libyan authorities issued immediate, unequivocal statements of regret for the bloodshed in Benghazi.
On Thursday, Mr. Morsi said in a televised statement that while he supported peaceful protests, it was wrong to attack people or embassies, Reuters reported. ''Expressing opinion, freedom to protest and announcing positions is guaranteed but without assaulting private or public property, diplomatic missions or embassies,'' he said. Reuters also said that he condemned the ambassador's killing.
Mr. Obama seemed to indicate that the American relationship with Egypt is evolving. ''I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy,'' he said in an interview with Telemundo that was broadcast Wednesday night on The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC. ''I think it's still a work in progress, but certainly in this situation, what we're going to expect is that they are responsive to our insistence that our embassy is protected, our personnel is protected.''
For the United States, ''politically the bigger issue is Egypt,'' said Martin S. Indyk, a former United States ambassador to Israel. ''On the one hand, you didn't have Americans getting killed, but this was the fourth time an embassy was assaulted in Cairo with the Egyptian police doing precious little,'' Mr. Indyk said. ''And where was President Morsi's condemnation of this?''
Several foreign policy experts said they worried that Mr. Morsi was putting appeasement of his country's Islamist population ahead of national security. That comes on top of other moves by his government, including restrictions on press freedom and squabbling with Israel over how to crack down on terrorists taking root in the Sinai Peninsula.
While the killing of Mr. Stevens is a ''tragedy,'' said Robert Malley, Middle East and North Africa program director at the International Crisis Group, ''in the longer term, Libya mainly is a problem for Libyans.'' What happens in Egypt, by contrast, from ''popular attitudes toward the U.S., to its domestic economy, to relations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the army, to relations between Cairo and Jerusalem, to the situation in Sinai, will profoundly affect the region, and so will profoundly affect America's posture in the region,'' he said.
What makes Egypt's uncertain course so vexing for the White House is that Mr. Obama, more than any other foreign leader, has sided again and again with the Arab street in Cairo, even when it meant going expressly against the wishes of traditional allies, including the Egyptian military, the Persian Gulf states and Israel.
As recently as June, Mr. Obama was calling on the Egyptian military to quickly hand over power to the democratically elected civilian government -- a move that helped Mr. Morsi, whose movement has called for greater use of Islamic law, assume power. At the same time, the administration was chastising the military, which has for 30 years served as the bulwark of a crucial American strategic interest in the Middle East: the 1979 Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
For anti-American unrest to erupt in Egypt after all that could reflect a deeper divergence of a once-staunch ally from the United States. Mr. Morsi's belated reaction came after other actions that have troubled American officials, from his decision to attend a meeting of nonaligned countries in Tehran to his choice of China for one of his first overseas trips. Mr. Obama has pledged to forgive $1 billion in Egyptian debt.
''How does the president go to the Hill and say, 'We need to forgive $1 billion in Egyptian debt?' '' said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''The complication is that this is happening six weeks before the election. The things that the administration wants to do in Egypt have become a heavier lift.''
David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said: ''There are some real serious questions about the direction of the Egyptian government. Some of this will be submerged because of the election, but it is likely to come back later.''
The violence in Libya and Egypt reinforces what has been true from the start of the Arab uprisings last year: These are homegrown popular movements over which the United States has at best limited influence.
The odds of success may be greater in Libya, some analysts said, since that country's problems are rooted in a lack of effective governance and security problems with a heavily armed populace, rather than in a newly empowered movement with a long history of suspicion of the United States.
The killing of Mr. Stevens sets back American efforts to help Libya with its transition, officials said, but only because he was such a tireless figure in this work.
''Libya's public is quite pro-American, so it might produce a backlash against those responsible,'' said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser on the Middle East in the White House.
In Egypt, by contrast, Mr. Ross said: ''Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood continue to live according to their own reality. If they want to attract any amount of economic support and investment from the outside, they're going to have to create an environment of security.''

HEADLINE: An Argument Over Wind

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A new study suggests that distortions in the wholesale electricity market are getting bigger as more wind power is added. But wind proponents say that consumers are benefiting from lower prices. 

 BODY:
With the wind industry facing the expiration of a production tax credit at the end of the year, the sector's main trade association is facing off against Exelon, the big power generation company, over whether the tax break should be renewed. Last week, the Wind Energy Association expelled Exelon as a member because the company opposed a renewal of the credit.
The association says that if the tax credit expires, some 37,000 jobs will be eliminated next year and that deliveries of new turbines will spiral to zero. 
But Exelon says the tax credit is distorting energy markets because the credit itself is larger than the average value of electricity produced in the Midwest. Surges of wind energy late at night during periods of low electricity demand are driving the market price of electricity below zero, according to independent statistics. 
Exelon complains that in that circumstance, its nuclear plants actually have to pay grid operators to accept their electricity. The wind farms in that region do as well, but they remain profitable because they earn the production credit. 
The issue of the tax credit and so-called negative pricing has emerged in the presidential campaign, with the Obama administration favoring an extension of the credit and Mitt Romney opposing it. But the credit's fate may be resolved by the November election, depending on Congressional action. 
Exelon plans to release a study on Friday that says that distortions in the market are getting larger as more wind is added.

The company is not alone in its complaints. In Texas, the chairwoman of the state's Public Utility Commission, Donna Nelson,told a state Senate committee last week that Texas had a shortage of generating capacity as a result of a market distortion in which wind energy drove the price of electricity into negative territory. When wind developers can make money even when prices are negative, she said, it discourages others from building other kinds of power plants. 
The problem for Texas is that wind generation does not coincide with peak demand, which is on hot days that are mostly windless. State power planners estimate that for every 100 megawatts of wind machines installed in the state, only about 8 megawatts will be available on peak days. 
The tax credit, which applies to projects that are completed by Dec. 31, is 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Depending on the tax status of the wind farm developer, the credit can be worth as much as $34 per megawatt-hour. 
Joseph Dominguez, Exelon's senior vice president for governmental and regulatory affairs, said that in the last two years, the average price of a megawatt-hour at the Northern Illinois Hub , one of the main spots on the grid in eastern North America where electricity is priced, has ranged from $28 to $31.
There is a bit of a paradox in Exelon's exile from the wind association; the company owns nearly 2 percent of the wind capacity in the United States. 
Wind industry advocates say that negative pricing is rare and highly localized and simply points up shortcomings in transmission capacity. "It's all driven by a lack of transmission,'' said Michael Goggin, the association's expert on integrating wind into the grid. "Negative prices are the market's way of saying there is too much supply and not enough demand, and there's a roadblock keeping that low-cost electricity from reaching consumers.'' New wind machines are sometimes built faster than new transmission lines, he said.
The wind industry also argues that companies that burn coal and natural gas get a subsidy too, in that they are allowed to dump pollutants into the air without paying for the damage they cause. 
Sometimes new transmission lines can alleviate the negative pricing phenomenon. In 2010 in the Chicago area, the occurrence of negative pricing peaked at 3.1 percent of all hours, according to the regional grid operator, thePJM Interconnection. That dropped to 2.1 percent the following year when more transmission capacity was added. 
But across the country, wind farms are likely to be added faster than transmission lines. 
The study sponsored by Exelon, prepared by the NorthBridge Group, which does extensive consulting for utilities around the country, found pockets where the number of negative hours reached 12 percent or more. While various types of electricity generation have received subsidies over the decades, said Frank Huntowski, one of the authors, "I don't think we've seen something as dramatic as this.'' 
Part of the problem is also that wholesale electricity prices have declined because of an economic slump and a decline in the price of natural gas. Before the recession began, the subsidy for wind power production was smaller than the average price of a megawatt-hour. 
Negative pricing occurs mostly on spring and fall nights when the wind is blowing strongly but offices, stores and factories are mostly closed and temperatures are so mild that there is virtually no demand for home heating or air-conditioning. The phenomenon existed before the surge in construction of wind machines, but the new industry is making it worse, some industry participants say, especially for companies with baseload plants that were built to run at a steady rate around the clock. 
That is a special problem for Exelon, which runs many nuclear plants in the Midwest; nuclear plants cannot change their output quickly. 
"Prices will go down for an hour and then come back up and a few hours later, go down again, and it's very hard to maneuver the nuclear plants to work around that,'' Christopher Crane, the company's chief executive, said in an interview. "By the time you have briefed the crew to power down the plant, the price is up again,'' he said. 
The wind energy association argues that the production tax credit is an incentive to invest in a clean energy source and does not directly affect market prices. But opponents say that when new generation is added in a way that creates sudden surpluses, the market impact is clear.
Either way, low prices are a boon for consumers, said Peter L. Kelley, a spokesman for the wind association. "It's indisputable that wind energy, with or without the production tax credit, drives down electricity prices,'' he said. "Consumers receive massive benefits of billions and billions of dollars.'' 
Meanwhile, the wind business is already preparing for a slowdown. On Tuesday, a wind tower manufacturer, Katana Summit, said it would probably sell or close its two plants, in Nebraska and Washington State, because of the expiration of the tax credit. The two plants employ a total of about 300 people.
 An earlier version of this post misstated the number of jobs that the Wind Energy Association estimates will be lost if the wind production tax credit expires. It is 37,000, not 17,000.

If Pennsylvania executes Terrance Williams on Oct. 3, he will be the first person in 50 years to be put to death there while still fighting his sentence.
The House voted to extend the FISA Amendments Act for five years, an unfortunate law passed in 2008 that expanded the government's power to conduct surveillance without warrants.
It took until Thursday for Mohamed Morsi to condemn the killing of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Libya, and vow to protect foreign embassies in Cairo.

HEADLINE: Nine Months of Hell

BYLINE: WILL HICKOX


HIGHLIGHT: The waves of Northerners who signed up for short Army stints in 1862 had no idea what awaited them. 

 BODY:
It was mid-September 1862, and the 900 soldiers of the 130th Pennsylvania Infantry were marching through western Maryland. Pvt. Edward Spangler - all 16 years and 92 pounds of him - struggled to stay with his regiment. The heat was "intense," Spangler later wrote, "and the suffocating dust more than ankle deep." Hundreds of raw recruits, ill-prepared and exhausted, were collapsing by the roadside. 
The situation, however, was about to get worse. On Sept. 17, the 130th joined in an assault on Confederates defending a sunken road near Antietam Creek. Private Spangler was wounded in the battle along with 145 of his fellow Pennsylvanians, while 32 others were killed.
Spangler and his comrades had enlisted barely six weeks ago. They were militiamen raised for nine months' emergency service, part of a nationwide effort to turn the tide after a shocking series of enemy victories. They had expected relatively safe assignments; back home in York County, a newspaper had claimed that their brief service would consist of "garrison duty, and the elementary duties of a soldier's life." The men and boys of the 130th had reason to recall this breezy prediction as they made their punishing march north and fought Robert E. Lee's invaders. Clearly, a short tour of duty was no safeguard against the trauma of war.
The story of the nine-month men had begun earlier that summer. Late June saw one of the most stunning reversals in American military history as the rebels drove Gen. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac back from the outskirts of Richmond, Va.; by July, they seemed poised to attack Washington. In the North, rejoicing at imminent victory turned into despair. After a year of costly fighting, national reunion seemed more doubtful than ever before.
Abraham Lincoln knew that carrying on the war would require reinvigorating the Northern people and replacing the many thousands of troops lost through death, discharge or desertion. On July 2 he announced a call for 300,000 volunteers. The initial response was far from promising. With no end to the war in sight, few men were stepping forward.
Public officials and the press urged the president to take a sterner course. "Men will not volunteer for a lingering war," a committee of prominent citizens told Lincoln. "When you order, they will obey; but at present there unquestionably is a general indisposition to volunteer upon your mere invitation." 
With invitation proving a failure, it was time to try coercion. Lincoln's Militia Act of July 17 authorized the government to enroll all military-age male citizens for a possible draft and gave the president the power to order state militiamen into the Union Army for up to nine months. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton followed this up on Aug. 4 with a draft for 300,000 nine-month militia. In a year that was full of turning points, the Union war effort had reached yet another: the federal government now had the power to override state officials and compel citizens to serve. For the remainder of the war, Northerners would live under the threat of conscription.
A century and a half on, the notion that troops would only be needed for a nine-month term may seem foolishly optimistic. But logic and tradition undergirded the Aug. 4 call-up. A three-year enlistment was simply too long for the large numbers of potential recruits who were constrained by economic or family concerns. "I claim the right to decline," a Pennsylvanian explained, for "confining enlistments to a term of three years excludes a worthy class." Farm workers, for instance, would be available only for the short period after they had finished the fall harvest and before the next year's planting began. 
Brief service during times of national emergency was also an American tradition. Popular memory abounded with tales of the Minutemen and other citizen-soldiers of previous wars who had taken up arms, defended their country and returned home in short order. And in any case, despite recent setbacks, nobody in the North knew that the present conflict would last three more years.
As late summer turned into fall, communities across the Northern states made strenuous efforts to meet the call for volunteers. Boston's leading businessmen promised "that their employés who enlist shall resume their employment when returned," while numerous towns raised money to provide recruits with cash bounties and family assistance.. These and other measures proved effective. "Our people are responding to the call for troops with alacrity and enthusiasm," a New York official telegraphed Stanton on Aug. 15. "The popular feeling is at high war heat. It has cost much to get this steam up. Pray do not require the Governor to 'blow it off.'" 
To keep enlistments at full steam, the War Department announced that volunteers would be accepted for nine months in lieu of draftees, and that state governments could count each three-year recruit as as the equivalent of four nine-month militiamen. These measures may have been "of dubious legality and confusing arithmetic," as one historian has written, but they did the job. Although 87,588 men responded to the militia call, the total of enlistments that summer and fall was over half a million.
The majority of the nine-month men hailed from the Northeast, especially Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Pvt. Zenas T. Haines of Boston noted that his company included "54 former clerks, five merchants, and nine students of Tufts, Harvard, and Yale." This company boasted of a particularly far-sighted member: Pvt. Horace Parnell Tuttle, a renowned astronomer who "hoped to be placed upon the round of the night sentinel" so that he could resume his stargazing. 
The Rev. James K. Hosmer, a young pastor from Deerfield, Mass., turned down a position on a general's staff in order to serve in the color guard of the 52nd Massachusetts. "The cause of the North," Corporal Hosmer believed, was "the cause of civilization and liberty. To help this, I have preached, made speeches, and talked in private. Ought I not to practice what I preach?" The recruits of one New Hampshire regiment may have been less distinguished, but they were "full of patriotic fervor," according to an officer, "and a service for so short a time as nine months did not seem such a hardship to their youthful imaginations." 
When given enough time and intensive training, nine-month soldiers often proved effective combatants. But time was not on the Union's side in September 1862. Several barely organized regiments found themselves rushed to the front lines to counter Lee's invasion of Maryland. General McClellan, who had advised against short-term recruitment, was forced to integrate these raw troops into the Army of the Potomac just days before meeting the enemy at Antietam. A staff officer called the nine-month men of the 27th Connecticut "excellent material, but from the colonel down wholly inexperienced." The commander of the 128th Pennsylvania asked a three-year officer to show him how to form his men into line of battle, explaining that he hadn't had time to buy a drill manual. 
Some regiments, such as Edward Spangler's 130th Pennsylvania, stood and fired without maneuvering or taking cover, suffering grievous losses. Others panicked and fell apart. "The men were of excellent stamp, ready and willing," a corps commander observed, "but neither officers nor men knew anything, and there was an absence of the mutual confidence which drill begets." Historians frequently point out that McClellan's forces at Antietam greatly outnumbered those of Lee. It is worth noting, however, that a quarter of McClellan's infantrymen were new recruits, putting his failure to crush the invader in a somewhat different light.
No matter where they served, the dangers and discomforts of army life seemed to weigh especially heavily on the nine-month men. Among the regiments sent to Louisiana - where six nine-month soldiers died of disease for every one killed in battle - the harsh conditions and lack of battlefield success caused widespread demoralization. As Frank H. Sterns of the 52nd Massachusetts wrote his parents: "I think nine months is as much time as I can afford my country if they don't do things in a more business like manner." Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks blamed his short-term regiments for his failure to take Port Hudson, La., by storm, claiming that the men "openly say they do not consider themselves bound to any perilous service." Few seemed willing to risk their lives when their return home was just over the horizon. 
Long-service soldiers heaped scorn on their nine-month counterparts, accusing them of cowardice and mercenary motives. "Hump yourself, you Government swindler," a picket from a three-year regiment told a straggler from the nine-month 132nd Pennsylvania, "take your bounty-full carcass out of my sight!" The militiamen were derided as "poor stuff," "complete government robbers," and "the Pick Nic party." But insults from civilians and the press back in the North were especially stinging. Nine-month men were upset by attitudes like that expressed by The New York Tribune, which called them "beauties who enlisted for the bounties, and took into the service neither health, patriotism, nor honesty." 
Beset by such insults and the harsh Southern climate, many surviving militiamen found their muster out of service anticlimactic. Corporal Hosmer and the 52nd Massachusetts boarded a transport ship in late July 1863, having lost comrades from fever up to the very end. "We marched aboard," Hosmer recalled, "a nerveless, debilitated company, too weak and sick to show joy even at going home." 
Few of the nine-month men seemed to care that their term of service was ending during another desperate time for the Union cause: the defeat at Chancellorsville and Lee's second invasion of the North. A Union general complained that several regiments, "who had taken up arms having had no opportunity to use them," were now being discharged at a time when their services were badly needed. In one notorious incident, the secretary of war convinced members of the 27th Maine to briefly extend their term by promising each man a Medal of Honor. As their service came to an end, the Tribune summed up public opinion by dismissing the call for nine-month troops as a "costly and disastrous experiment."
Not surprisingly, nine-month veterans preferred to gloss over the uninspiring times when they reflected on their service in later years. They erected monuments to their regiments at Antietam Battlefield and wrote memoirs depicting themselves as the equals of the three-year men in courage and devotion. As one old soldier observed, "hostile bullets made little distinction between three months', nine months' or three years' men, and the man who left his arm or leg on the field was seldom asked whether his lost member was enlisted for the war or only for a limited period." These facts are beyond dispute. Edward Spangler and the 130th Pennsylvania learned them only too well in September 1862, as they advanced toward a sunken road near Antietam Creek.

HEADLINE: Village Voice Is Losing Its Editor in Chief and Music Editor

BYLINE: DAVID CARR and BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: Two top editors of The Village Voice are departing, and the newspaper is moving out of the building where it has had its headquarters for two decades. 

 BODY:
After five and a half years as editor of The Village Voice, Tony Ortega announced in a blog post that he would be stepping down to work on a book about Scientology. The music editor, Maura Johnston, took to Twitter to say she was leaving the newspaper as well.
Mr. Ortega said that he would leave next week and that staff members were available to handle the transition. No successor has been named, but Mr. Ortega said Christine Brennan, executive managing editor of the newspaper's parent company, Village Voice Media, was looking to hire in New York - a fact he said "should please all the writers out there."
That was a reference to the fact that Mr. Ortega, who came to The Voice from South Florida, led the publication through several rounds of layoffs as it confronted the headwinds buffeting newspapers of all kinds.
Michael Lacey, executive editor of the newspaper chain, credited Mr. Ortega with guiding The Voice through a tumultuous time.
"Tony Ortega did a great job for us and managed a difficult transition in a miserable economy," he wrote in an e-mail. "During that time he became the single most informed reporter on Scientology. No one is better positioned to write the book on that organization."
Mr. Lacey added, "His departure creates an opening for one of the most compelling jobs in journalism."
Mr. Ortega said he was leaving because the increased profile of Scientology - including the release of "The Master," a Paul Thomas Anderson movie about a Scientology-like sect, and a cover article about Scientology in Vanity Fair - made it a good time to shop a book on the topic. Mr. Ortega, who always wrote in addition to his editing duties, has published hundreds of blog posts on the religion in the last two years.
"I've been an editor in chief of The Village Voice for five years, and this seemed like a good time to try something else," he said. "I think we did a good job of focusing the paper back on New York stories, and I helped turn a weekly newspaper with a Web site into a digital enterprise."
Ms. Johnston, the music editor, said in an interview on Friday that, in her case, "the decision to leave was not mine."
Ms. Johnston, who began her career in music blogs, churned out a constant stream of Twitter messages and Tumblr posts each day in addition to her work at The Voice, which included editing the paper's music coverage and blog items by a stable of freelance and staff writers.
But she also embodied The Voice's tradition of thoughtful cultural criticism, and resisted the kinds of light, easily consumable items, like Top 10 lists and photo compilations, that tend to draw the most traffic online.
Giving in to "the Darwinistic page-view coverage of anything," she said, "is damaging to culture as a whole."
It was unclear on Friday who would take her place. Last week, Village Voice Media appointed Ben Westhoff, the music editor of LA Weekly, to oversee music coverage for the company's weekly newspapers, and Ms. Johnston's dismissal was widely seen as a result of a power struggle over the direction of that coverage.

HEADLINE: Higuaín Finds Comfort in Columbus

BYLINE: ERIC BEARD


HIGHLIGHT: Federico Higua&#237;n, the brother of the Real Madrid star, Gonzalo, has made an immediate impact since joining the Columbus Crew of M.L.S. six games ago. 

 BODY:
The Columbus Crew locker room had already emptied when Federico Higuaín emerged from his ice bath, still visibly irritated with his team's performance in its 2-0 loss to the New England Revolution. After all, it was the first loss Higuaín had experienced in the Argentine's six games with his new club, ending a streak of four consecutive wins. When the conversation shifted from the match to his first impressions of the ambiance in Major League Soccer, Higuaín smiled and said "of course" there were differences between M.L.S. and Argentina's Primera División.
"There is no fence needed in the stadium to divide fans," he said of M.L.S.
Higuaín added, "Anyway, I think this environment is ideal because it is more relaxed, and people can come to the stadium and watch a match without any problems."
Argentina may have the most passionate fans in the world, but recently this passion -- mixed with economic and political antipathies -- has transformed chants and fireworks into legitimate fears of fan violence. For high-profile players in Argentina, underachieving does not simply open the possibility to spending time on the bench; it can also mean a confrontation with a club'sbarrabravas, a group of the most die-hard fans (read: hooligans) to be found in South America.
Last May, the Colombian midfielder Giovanni Moreno of Racing Club - one of the Cinco Grandes (Big Five) teams in Argentina -- was afraid to leave his apartment because he was held at gunpoint by his club's fans after losing, 2-0, to Boca Juniors at home. Moreno said the hooligans threatened to "blow off" his leg unless his performances improved. Since that encounter, Moreno's agent has flown him to the other side of the world, and he now plays alongside Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka at Shanghai Shenhua. It is impossible to overlook the effects of these frequent outbreaks of violence involving players and fans, even though Higuaín is well respected by those in his home country.
Higuaín said he felt "very comfortable" in M.L.S. and "quite at home in this country." That is not to imply that Higuaín necessarily felt threatened in Argentina, but rather that Columbus was a welcome change. That introduction to soccer in a new country continues this weekend when the Crew travels to New Jersey to face the Red Bulls in a key Eastern Conference match at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J.
Higuaín is by no means the first Argentine to come to M.L.S., and Guillermo Barros Schelotto notably paved a path from Buenos Aires to Columbus during the twilight of his illustrious career. Unlike Schelotto, who came from Boca Juniors in his mid-30s, Higuaín is still only 27 years old and in the prime of his career. He seems to be settled in Columbus, despite learning English from square one.
Higuaín thinks having young Latin American players like Fredy Montero and Roger Espinoza capable of making waves in Europe will only help the league progress.
"There are many Latin American and North American players who play well in M.L.S," he said, adding that the league's reputation is important.
"It has grown and continues to grow, which has been indicated by its development since it first started," he said.
Higuaín cannot escape being compared to his younger brother, the Real Madrid and Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuaín. Perhaps Federico was unfortunate to be playing against the Revolution in front of 10,345 people at Gillette Stadium, considering that two days later his brother scored a match-winning goal in aWorld Cup qualifier against Paraguay on a chilly night in Córdoba, Argentina's second-largest city.
But Federico only brims with pride when speaking of his brother's success, and he looks at his career with dignity. The two are not so different technically with a ball at their feet, but Gonzalo's superior physique -- a couple more inches in height and broader shoulders -- molded the Real Madrid star into an outstanding striker in the box, capable of tormenting defenders with his aerial presence and a deadly instinct for goal.
This is not the first time M.L.S. has welcomed less-accomplished brothers of global icons into its league. Red Bull fans are all too familiar with Wayne Rooney's younger brother John, who failed to score a single goal in five appearances in M.L.S. In Federico Higuaín's first five appearances in the league, he recorded three goals and six assists and was recognized as the M.L.S. Player of the Week for two consecutive weeks. It cannot be emphasized enough that Federico is not the Columbus Crew's third designated player because of his brother's influence; he is a special player who has worked tirelessly to earn his reputation.
Paolo Aguilar/E.P.A.Gonzalo Higuaín, right, with Lionel Messi during a 1-1 tie at Peru Tuesday in a World Cup qualifier.
As Buenos Aires-based journalist Daniel Colasimone explains: "Having failed to make the grade at River as a youngster, Federico first made a name for himself at Nueva Chicago in the second division, and has also impressed during stints at Godoy Cruz and most recently, Colón de Santa Fe. Despite a couple of seasons where he bagged a double-figure goal tally, Higuaín has never been a consistently high scorer. His role is more to harass opposition defenses with intelligent runs, fine ball control and incisive passing. His hard work on and off the ball, and affable personality made him well liked wherever he played in Argentina. Even though Colón fans knew they were losing a valuable player when he signed for the Columbus Crew, there was more a sense of 'good for him, he deserves it,' rather than any resentment for the player. Argentine fans will no doubt be wishing him well on his adventure in the United States."
This weekend, Higuaín makes his first trip to Red Bull Arena. Sharing the field with Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill, he will certainly not be the player on whom all cameras are focused. But through hard work and his instinctual creativity with the ball -- the formula that won over so many in Argentina, Higuaín is already beginning to gain a similar reputation in a new continent. Preceding that objective, however, is his aim to get the Crew into the M.L.S. playoffs and win over his new supporters along the way.

In Federico Higuaín's first five appearances in the league, he recorded three goals and six assists and was recognized as the M.L.S. Player of the Week for two consecutive weeks. It cannot be emphasized enough that Federico is not the Columbus Crew's third designated player because of his brother's influence; he is a special player who has worked tirelessly to earn his reputation.
Paolo Aguilar/E.P.A.Gonzalo Higuaín, right, with Lionel Messi during a 1-1 tie at Peru Tuesday in a World Cup qualifier.
As Buenos Aires-based journalist Daniel Colasimone explains: "Having failed to make the grade at River as a youngster, Federico first made a name for himself at Nueva Chicago in the second division, and has also impressed during stints at Godoy Cruz and most recently, Colón de Santa Fe. Despite a couple of seasons where he bagged a double-figure goal tally, Higuaín has never been a consistently high scorer. His role is more to harass opposition defenses with intelligent runs, fine ball control and incisive passing. His hard work on and off the ball, and affable personality made him well liked wherever he played in Argentina. Even though Colón fans knew they were losing a valuable player when he signed for the Columbus Crew, there was more a sense of 'good for him, he deserves it,' rather than any resentment for the player. Argentine fans will no doubt be wishing him well on his adventure in the United States."
This weekend, Higuaín makes his first trip to Red Bull Arena. Sharing the field with Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill, he will certainly not be the player on whom all cameras are focused. But through hard work and his instinctual creativity with the ball -- the formula that won over so many in Argentina, Higuaín is already beginning to gain a similar reputation in a new continent. Preceding that objective, however, is his aim to get the Crew into the M.L.S. playoffs and win over his new supporters along the way.

HEADLINE: Week in Review: Contrarian Bets Looking Smart

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: We examined contrarian bets on European bonds that are looking pretty smart right now. And with Treasury set to reduce its A.I.G. bet below 50 percent, Andrew Ross Sorkin called a critic of the bailout. A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.

 We examined contrarian bets on European bonds that are looking pretty smart right now. And with Treasury set to reduce its A.I.G. bet below 50 percent, Andrew Ross Sorkin called a critic of the bailout.
A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
Mergers & Acquisitions »
 Thai Billionaire Tries to Edge Out Heineken for Singaporean Brewery | Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi's $7.3 billion takeover offer for Fraser & Neave could scuttle plans by the Dutch brewer to buy its beer unit, Mark Scott reported. DealBook »
The battle for Asia Pacific Breweries comes as many of the world's beer companies are turning to emerging markets in search of growth.
 Europe's Air and Military Companies in Merger Talks | EADS, which is the parent of Airbus, and BAE Systems said they were in discussions about a potential merger that would create an industry behemoth with a combined market value of nearly $50 billion, Nicola Clark reported. DealBook »
While government contracts provide steady revenues, large European countries and the United States are pulling back on their military spending, weighing on the prospects of BAE Systems. Passenger airlines, the main customers of Airbus, have perked up lately, after some difficult periods.
 As BP Refocuses, It Sells Gulf Assets for $5.6 Billion | DealBook »
 BP agreed "to sell a stake in a group of oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico to the Plains Exploration and Production Company of Houston for about $5.6 billion," Stanley Reed reported.
Robert W. Dudley, chief executive of BP, is raising money to pay for cleanup costs and potential fines resulting from a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Mr. Dudley has been refocusing BP on high-risk, high-return frontier exploration and production, including deepwater fields.
 Glencore Revises Merger Offer to Xstrata | The world's largest commodities trader confirmed that it was offering 3.05 of its shares for every mining company share, Mr. Scott reported. "The deal would value the combined company at $90 billion. Large shareholders, including Qatar Holding, balked at the initial offer of 2.8 shares to one." DealBook »
"The new proposal is structured far less aggressively than the straight takeover hinted at on Friday," Ash Lazenby, an analyst at Liberum Capital in London, said in a research note on Monday. "We expect the revised structuring should get Xstrata board's recommendation."
Investment Banking »
 Book by Former Banker Promises Peek Inside Goldman Sachs | Greg Smith's memoir comes just seven months after his Op-Ed page article detailed business practices that reflected, more broadly, a corrosive culture at the nation's largest banks, Peter Lattman an Julie Bosman reported. DealBook »
While Mr. Smith's opinion article became rich fodder for critics of Wall Street banks and the reckless lending and business practices that led to the global financial crisis, it was largely devoid of specific details. Whether the 288-page book fills in the blanks remains an open question.
 Morgan Stanley to Take Over Smith Barney, With Citigroup's Blessing | The banks agreed to value the brokerage operation at $13.5 billion. That figure was significantly closer to Morgan Stanley's estimate of the unit's worth, letting it buy the rest of the enterprise at a lower price, Michael J. de la Merced reported. DealBook »
Now the challenge will be whether the business of advising wealthy customers on their investments can help lift Morgan Stanley's sagging fortunes as its core investment banking and trading operations contend with difficult markets and a heavier regulatory burden.
 Deal Professor: Seeking Critical Mass of Gender Equality in the Boardroom | Steven M. Davidoff says that whether women directors add value just by their presence is undetermined because the number of women on boards remains low. DealBook »
Gender equality is one goal, but those who think that the number of women directors will reach a critical mass and change the way boards are governed are likely to be disappointed.
Even if it is true that women are different, the way boards are run in the United States may make these differences meaningless.
Hedge Funds »
 Bets on European Bonds Paying Off for Funds | "With the extraordinary level of support from the central bank, mutual fund managers are reaping big returns on their purchases," Peter Eavis reported. DealBook »
"This is a new chapter in monetary policy and a new chapter in the debt crisis," said Scott A. Mather, head of global portfolio management at the Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco. "It doesn't mean all the problems are solved, but this is a more effective and powerful program."
I.P.O./Offerings »
 In I.P.O., Japan Airlines Aims for Valuation of $8.5 Billion | The airline set the stage for the world's second-largest initial public offering this year, after that of Facebook, Hiroko Tabuchi reported. DealBook »
After robust investor demand, particularly from retail investors, the airline, also known as JAL, will seek a price of 3,790 yen (about $48.40) a share, the airline said in a news release.
Legal/Regulatory »
 Trial to Begin for Former UBS Trader Accused of Hiding Huge Loss | The Swiss bank will face the harsh glare of the spotlight again, as opening arguments begin in the trial of Kweku M. Adoboli, Mr. Scott reported. DealBook »
If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. The trial is expected to last up to eight weeks. Both current and former UBS employees could be called as witnesses, though the firm has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Legal restrictions in Britain limit the information that can be reported about the case to avoid biasing the proceedings. UBS and a lawyer for Mr. Adoboli declined to comment.
 DealBook Column: Plot Twist in a Bailout: It Worked | Andrew Ross Sorkin called Neil M. Barofsky, former inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to see if he had any regrets about his earlier pronouncements now that the rescue of American International Group appeared profitable. DealBook »
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! They are not making money!" Mr. Barofsky, now a senior fellow at New York University School of Law, said when I reached him. "They are on the path to very significant losses!"
What?
 Treasury to Reduce A.I.G. Stake Below 50% | "With the sale of at least $18 billion worth of shares in A.I.G., a number that could grow to $20.7 billion if investors prove enthusiastic, the Treasury Department could reduce its holdings to as little as 15 percent from 53 percent," Mr. de la Merced reported. DealBook »
Taking the government's stake in A.I.G. below 50 percent is the realization of a long-held goal by both the Obama administration and the company, helping to cut ties to one of the most controversial bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis. The Treasury Department expects to earn a profit on its investment in A.I.G., though it is unclear how large.
 Lawmakers Push to Increase White House Oversight of Financial Regulators | Lawmakers are pushing a bill that could curb the influence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other regulators, Ben Protess reported. DealBook »
The measure, which a Senate committee is planning to debate this month, aims to empower the president in the rule-writing process. The proposal would allow the White House to second-guess major rules and mandate that agencies carefully study the economic effects of new regulation. The change could, in effect, delay a number of rules for the financial industry.

HEADLINE: In Search of a Middle Eastern Strategy

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney and Barack Obama in the foreign policy briar patch. 

 BODY:
Here are four thoughts on the sudden intrusion of foreign policy into our all-about-the-economy political year:
1) Mitt Romney's instantly-controversial response to Tuesday's awful events in Cairo and Benghazi was indeed clumsy, badly-timed and self-defeating. Not because the cringing press release issued by our Cairo embassy just as the protests were gathering steam didn't merit criticism: The speed with which the White House repudiated the release basically testified to its indefensibility. But Romney's attack conflated an embassy communique with an official presidential statement, mischaracterized the release as a response to the murder of an American when it had actually preceded the violence, and dragged the spotlight over to presidential politics instead of focusing it on the White House's crisis management. Even allowing for a fog-of-war element in the details of the Romney statement, the timing alone was political malpractice: At a moment when the Republican nominee had everything to gain from waiting to see how the White House actually responded to the biggest recent foreign policy crisis on its watch, he effectively invited the press to make the story about his own campaign's fumblings instead - which, predictably, they did.
2) The fact that the press's feeding frenzy was predictable, however, doesn't mean it was admirable. Romney deserved to be questioned and criticized and held to account, but there was a period on Wednesday when you could have been forgiven for thinking that the most important thing happening this week was Romney's brief campaign season critique of the White House, not the actual death of a United States ambassador and the spreading (and, as of this writing, still-spreading) violence across the Middle East. The Republican nominee's statement was a failed rhetorical jab: It was not a move that cost Romney the election (that honor might belong to Ben Bernanke's QE3 decision, though time will tell), or a "Lehmann moment" or "death knell" from which he will never recover, or anything similarly apocalyptic. And none of the questions that have been flung at Romney over the last few days ("are you, or have you ever been, a neoconservative?") are as important as the questions that the people actually charged with conducting U.S. foreign policy should be answering right now.
3) The biggest of those questions has to do with the White House's overall strategy in the Middle East, and the failure of some its more naively optimistic hopes. Romney's repeated campaign-trail suggestion (which informed his hasty Tuesday night jab) that this president has "apologized" too often for America is the wrong frame for this issue: The problem isn't apologies, but wishful thinking, and particularly the belief that this president's identity and eloquence could enable the United States to transcend the hard realities of power politics that have long made us so disliked across the Middle East. From the Cairo speech to the intervention to topple Muammar el-Qaddafi to the decision to encourage Muslim Brotherhood participation in Egyptian politics, the White House has persistently looked for what Obama officials described to National Journal's Marc Ambinder as "a new foreign-policy paradigm, one that relies less on autocratic governments and their oil reserves and more on a genuine connection between Americans and citizens of the Arab world." What George W. Bush attempted to accomplish with the invasion of Iraq, in other words, they have sought to accomplish at a lower cost in blood and treasure - seeking a post-dictatorial paradigm with high-minded words and air campaigns and engagement with Islamist political parties. But they haven't found what they've been looking for: Four years into the Obama era, America is as disliked today in much of the Arab world as it ever was under George W. Bush, U.S. embassies are under siege from Tunis to Yemen, and there is every reason to see the "Obama doctrine," such as it is, as something of a bust.
4) But of course it isn't clear at all what Mitt Romney would actually do differently. Since their Tuesday night jab backfired, the Romney campaign has tried to flesh a more substantive critique of Obama's foreign policy, but the actual differences seem to be less substantial than the posturing suggests. Team Romney would put more pressure on Egypt's new president (which the White House is currently trying to do), extend more aid to Syria's rebels (but, like the White House, stop short of arming them), find unspecified ways to ramp up our commitment to the new Libyan government (which the White House is already committed too), and draw a red line on Iran's nuclear program that would differ from the White House's current line in, well, as-yet-unspecified ways. In a best-case scenario, a Romney foreign policy might be more hardheaded and less shot through with wishful thinking than the current administration's posture; in a worst-case scenario, it would blunder more deeply into messes where we're already enmeshed, substituting the rhetoric of toughness for actual clarity of purpose and chest-thumping for finesse. Either way, though, it's hard to discern a genuine alternative Middle Eastern strategy between the lines the Romney talking points. Which means that American voters are facing the same choice on foreign policy that they face on domestic issues: The incumbent's approach isn't working, but the challenger isn't giving us much reason to be confident that he knows what we should do instead.

HEADLINE: What New Polls Say About the Campaign

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Voters are more likely to blame George W. Bush than Barack Obama for the sluggish state of the economy. And they think the economy will improve. 

 BODY:
New presidential election polls out today, including a New York Times/CBS News poll, don't resolve the uncertainty of this race, which remains too close to call. But they do provide insight into how some of the big issues in the campaign have been playing - the economy, women's rights, and Medicare.
Two out of three so far seem to be going in President Obama's favor.
Republicans are not getting a lot of traction on the economy - or more precisely, they're not getting a lot of traction on their contentions that Mr. Obama has ruined the economy, or that Americans are worse off than they were four years ago.

The Times/CBS poll found that a majority of Americans think the U.S. is either better off or the same as it was four years ago. That's actually pretty remarkable given the depth of the financial crisis.
A CNN poll released today makes things look even bleaker for Mr. Romney on this front. It shows that 54 percent of likely voters think President George W. Bush and the Republicans are more responsible for the sluggish state of the economy than Mr. Obama and the Democrats.
The CNN poll also shows that 57 percent of likely voters think economic conditions will be "somewhat good" in four years, while 11 percent think they will be "very good." Only 9 percent think things will be "very poor." Maybe they're worried that Mr. Romney will win.
Onto the war on women. After months of news reports on Republican efforts to restrict access to abortions and deny women funding for prenatal care, family planning and cancer screenings, the Times poll reflected a significant gender gap. Among women who are likely to vote, Mr. Obama holds a 12-point edge. (Mr. Romney has an eight-point edge among men, which doesn't say much for my gender.)
Mr. Obama also beats Mr. Romney in every income category except those making over $100,000, and every age group except probable voters over 65, which brings me to Medicare.
Ever since Mr. Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running mate, Democrats have been pointing out that Mr. Ryan wants to turn Medicare into a voucher system, which would increase costs for seniors. Based on the latest numbers, I have to conclude that older voters are either not paying attention, or assume that all the talk about cutting Medicare is just bluff and neither party is really going to touch it. They might be onto something.

HEADLINE: Who Could Oppose a Jobs Bill for Veterans?

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans, that's who. 

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans, resolute in their commitment to deny the Democrats anything that looks like an accomplishment in an election year, have spent the week obstructing passage of the Veterans Job Corps Act of 2012. It's a perfectly inoffensive bill from Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat, meant to increase hiring and job training for veterans, especially those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Who could oppose hiring more veterans as cops, firefighters and national-parks workers? Who could be against helping veterans apply their military training to earn civilian occupational licenses? The unemployment rate for new veterans hit nearly 11 percent in August, compared with 8.1 percent nationwide. Veterans and active-duty soldiers are committing suicide at alarming rates. The men and women who defend America in uniform are 1 percent of the population. Why shouldn't the 99 percent give them a hand?

I'll let the Republicans explain.
Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma says it is dishonorable and cowardly to help veterans find jobs when there are more important things (what?) to do. Perhaps forgetting where he worked, he denounced the legislation on Wednesday as a "political exercise" and a waste of time, since the House wasn't going to pass it anyway. (If that's going to be the standard, the Senate might as well shut off the utilities.)
"Where is our honor? Where is our valor? Where is our sacrifice?" thundered Mr. Coburn, immediately after suggesting that the bill cost too much.
Rand Paul of Kentucky went further, saying he would block the bill until Pakistan freed Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the United States find Osama bin Laden. He also wants to halt all American aid to Pakistan until Dr. Afridi is released. If that halts American aid to veterans, too bad.
"I care deeply about the veterans . I care deeply about housing and helping the veterans who have fought for their country. But this is about whether we as a country and the American taxpayers will be asked to send good money after bad to allies that are not acting like allies."
It's only "about" that because of Mr. Paul. This ought to be about jobs for veterans.
Ms. Murray has not managed to open the Pakistani prison cell, but she has tried to make her bill as bipartisan as possible, by incorporating wholesale additions from Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican. The Senate could have rallied behind this bill, shown its dedication to the troops, and been done with it by now. But Democrats will have to pass this bill the hard, slow way, with repeated large votes overcoming Republican procedural objections. At this rate, it might pass on Wednesday. Or it might be killed by Republicans committed to making a bigger point about honor, valor, sacrifice and obstruction.

HEADLINE: In a Deck of Cards, Finding '52 Shades of Greed'

BYLINE: ALAN FEUER


HIGHLIGHT: In time for the anniversary of the occupation of Zuccotti Park on Sept. 17, Occupy Wall Street's Alternative Banking group is offering for sale a set of anti-capitalist playing cards. 

 BODY:
Just in time for the one-year anniversary of the occupation of Zuccotti Park on Sept. 17, Occupy Wall Street's Alternative Banking group is offering for sale an acerbically educational set of anti-capitalist playing cards.
The 56-card deck - it includes four jokers - has face cards depicting Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, as the King of Hearts ("Pushed to deregulate CDS"), and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, as the Jack of Clubs ("Fights aggressively and successfully against bank regulation"). The numbered cards are illustrated with lesser lights from the finance world (Angelo Mozilo, the former chief executive officer of the mortgage lender Countrywide, is the Nine of Hearts) and with technical terms from the Great Recession like Repo 105 (the Eight of Spades) and Shorting Your Clients (Five of Diamonds). 
The project, titled "52 Shades of Greed," started three weeks ago, when the banking group reached out to Marc Scheff, a freelance illustrator in New York, and asked him to do some drawings of "the people and institutions responsible for causing the financial crisis," Mr. Scheff wrote in a posting on the fund-raising Web site rockethub.com.
Mr. Scheff collaborated with a partner, Daniel Nyari, and soon collected drawings from 28 artists from around the world. "The vision evolved into making a visually dynamic and coherent set of cards with text and illustrations that would give people a snapshot of who the players are in this casino we call the world financial system," Mr. Scheff wrote.
The deck can be purchased for $25. A poster of the cards is available as well.
On Monday, Mr. Scheff said sales of the initial cards had been so successful that he was planning to produce a second deck. This deck, he wrote in an e-mail, would "focus not on 'the bad guys' but on resources and tools for people who want help navigating in the current economic environment."

HEADLINE: How Much Does the Fed's Plan Really Help Main Street?

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: In theory, the Fed's latest bond purchases should drive down borrowing costs for companies and consumers, making them more likely to take out loans to buy goods and services and thus stimulate the economy. But many rates, like those for credit card loans, remain stubbornly high. 

 BODY:
Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Thursday that the Fed's new stimulus was meant to help Main Street. 
One way to gauge the extent to which Main Street might benefit is to look at the interest rates ordinary people pay on their mortgages, credit cards and car loans. Those rates, however, don't make the strongest case for Mr. Bernanke being a man of the people. 
Since 2008, the Federal Reserve has purchased some $2.75 trillion of bonds. On Thursday, it promised to keep buying bonds until it felt comfortable that the jobs market was properly back on its feet. 
 The Fed's purchases aim to drive down borrowing costs for companies and consumers. In theory, this will make them more likely to take out loans to buy goods and services, stimulating the wider economy in the process.
By some measures, the Fed's policies have worked. Mortgage rates have fallen to multidecade lows, large corporations have had no trouble issuing bonds, the economy is growing and the private sector has been adding jobs for months now. 
The Fed's largess has even helped borrowers much lower down the credit scale. Lenders are making lots of subprime auto loans right now. Some $14 billion of such loans have been packaged up into bonds and sold to investors so far this year, according to Fitch Ratings. At the rate companies are lending, the 2012 total for subprime car loans could exceed $20 billion, which would put this year on par with 2005, a boom year. 
But in many cases borrowers could be getting an even bigger benefit. As the Fed's actions have pushed down some key rates, the ones that consumers borrowed at haven't fallen anywhere near as much. 
The federal funds effective rate, one short-term rate that banks use to lend to each other, is at 0.14 percent. That compares with a rate of 3.62 percent in September 2005. 
The 10-year Treasury note has a yield of 1.87 percent, down from 4.2 percent in 2005. These are huge declines. 
Yet the cost of credit card loans has hardly budged. The Fed's own data shows that average credit card interest rate was 12.06 percent earlier this year; in 2005, it was 12.45 percent.
One explanation is that the banks making credit card loans have to charge that level to cover the costs of their own borrowing. But that doesn't seem to be the case. 
For instance, JPMorgan Chase, a big credit card lender, paid an average of just 0.76 percent on its liabilities in the second quarter of this year. That's way down from 3.1 percent in 2005. 
The banks' fears of credit-card defaults could be a driver. They may want to charge more than 12 percent to cover these potential costs, which are always part and parcel of doing credit card loans. If so, that fear could prevent certain consumer rates from falling much further, limiting the impact of the Fed's policies. 
But even when fear of default is removed from the equation certain interest rates seem to be stuck too high. 
Take mortgages. The federal government agrees to shoulder the cost of defaults in nearly all of the mortgages made today. Banks make mortgages to borrowers, and then take those loans and attach the government guarantee of repayment to them. 
After that, they package the loans into bonds, which they then sell to investors. The Fed's purchases of these bonds have helped their yields fall to 2.2 percent. But the cost of mortgages to borrowers hasn't fallen anywhere near as much. 
The banks are choosing not to reduce mortgage rates further. One reason: By keeping the rates elevated, they are able to earn much larger profits when they sell the mortgages into the bond market. If the level of profits on those sales stayed at recent average levels, borrowers might, for instance, pay $30,000 less in interest payments on a $300,000 mortgage, according to a recent New York Times analysis. 
Based on these practices, it seems as if the banks are an obstacle to the Fed's latest efforts to generate economic growth. It's almost impossible to imagine the Fed forcing banks to lower credit card rates, or take lower profits on their mortgage sales.
Main Street may therefore have to wait a long time for the full effect of the Fed's latest actions.

HEADLINE: Defining Middle Class

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Both presidential candidates have suggested that the threshold for being rich starts around $250,000. That's about the 96th percentile for American households. 

 BODY:
In a discussion on "Good Morning America" about his tax plan, Mitt Romney suggested the cutoff for middle income was for households earning "$200,000 to $250,000 and less." President Obama has used a similar threshold in talking about extending tax cuts for the middle class.
To be clear, both politicians appear to be talking about the ceiling for the middle class, not its midpoint. It's a pretty high ceiling, though; here's a chart showing household income distributions for 2011, based on calculations from the Tax Policy Center:
As you can see in the chart, households earning $250,000 fall somewhere just above the 96th percentile. For context, the Tax Policy Center placed the median household at about $42,000 in cash income in 2011. (Using a slightly different metric, the Census Bureaureported on Wednesday that the median household income was about $50,000.)
As broad as these politicians' definition might be for middle class, historically Americans of all income levels have predominantly self-identified with that category. In a survey conducted in July by Pew Research Center, about half of American adults surveyed said they were middle class, including almost half of those earning more than $100,000.
Those self-identifications are changing, though.
Pew also found that the share of people who self-identify as lower class or lower middle class has risen substantially, from 25 percent in 2008 to 32 percent in 2012. The greatest growth is among younger Americans.
Since people seem to define middle class by culture and values as much by income, it will be interesting to see if this growing self-identification with lower class sticks in the years ahead as this younger cohort ages, and if it does, what kind of pressure (if any) that might put on politicians to redefine their stated socioeconomic class categories. As I mentioned in an earlier post, even as the median American family has gotten poorer, Americans overall have lowered their expectations for what the rich should pay in taxes.

HEADLINE: Romney Calls for Moment of Silence During Ohio Rally

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney also attacked President Obama's foreign and military policies. 

 BODY:
PAINESVILLE, Ohio - Mitt Romney began his rally here on Friday afternoon by calling for a moment of silence for the four Americans who were killed in the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Tuesday.
Mr. Romney, who was scheduled to take the stage as President Obama was at Joint Base Andrews for a ceremony honoring the dead, told the crowd that he had delayed his event slightly out of respect.
"I also want you to know that in the last few moments the bodies of four individuals who were killed in the service of our nation were brought back to the United States and welcomed home, and placed in hearses," Mr. Romney said. "I wanted to make sure to have my hand over my heart in recognition of these men and women."
Mr. Romney, who made a point of mentioning each individual by name, also called for a moment of silence. (He had tried to take a similar moment on Wednesday in Virginia but was unable to because of a protester who accused him of politicizing the situation in Libya.) 
"Whether, on a day like this, where the sky seems to be crying as well," Mr. Romney said, speaking under a gray and rainy sky, "or whether on a beautiful and sunny day, we remember those who serve and provide us with the liberty we enjoy, and the prosperity and the freedoms that are so much a part of the American experience."
After his initial remarks, Mr. Romney did not return to the turmoil in the Middle East, instead attacking Mr. Obama briefly in general terms on foreign policy. 
"I understand how important it is for America to be strong," he said. "I know what we have to do in terms of growing our principles and values, growing our economy and making sure our military is second to none. I will not cut the American military."

HEADLINE: Granholm and Her Curls on 'The Dating Game'

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor, was on "The Dating Game" in 1978, and YouTube has immortalized her 19-year-old self. 

 BODY:
As the former governor of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm was in the driver's seat during one of the state's most economically painful periods, and now she's in the anchor's seat on Current TV. But before that, Ms. Granholm was in the hot seat as a contestant on "The Dating Game" in 1978.
"Cute and curvaceous," as the host called her, the 19-year-old Ms. Granholm bounded onto the set in high-wasted pants, a puffy-sleeved shirt, and, oh, that big, seemingly weightless halo of blonde curls.
Although Ms. Granholm had long acknowledged her appearance on the show -- which came during her aspiring actress phase in Los Angeles -- the video only recently made its way to YouTube. 
She got to choose one of three men. She rejected the penta-lingual contractor from Texas who told her what he did with a sponge in the shower. She rejected the textile salesman and magician from (where else, then as now?) Brooklyn, who told her about his other girlfriend, Betty Boom Boom. Though she couldn't see them, Ms. Granholm plucked the model from the bunch, who made her blush with a joke about putting spaghetti somewhere.
Ms. Granholm begged for forgiveness for her coiffure on Twitter.
"I was a teenager in the 70's!" she wrote. "My hair could've been a nest for an entire family of birds!"

HEADLINE: The Debt of Medical Students

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Is medical education a public good that deserves public subsidy? Most economists view it as a privately owned form of human capital, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
In debates on health work force policy, it is frequently argued that medical education is a public good, because it benefits society as a whole.
The implication is that tuition charges at medical schools should be zero or close to zero. Many nations in the industrialized world follow that policy, although they have also kept tuition low for most college students. 
Most economists disagree with characterizing higher education as a public good. Only the individual receiving a professional education - including the M.D. degree - owns the human capital that the graduation documents certify to exist.
Medical graduates can use their human capital any way they wish. They can treat patients, do medical research or use their knowledge as business consultants to health-related companies or as financial analysts in the financial markets, as some of them do.
There may be some positive spillover for society as a whole from having this privately owned human capital produced, and these effects (called externalities by economists) might warrant some public subsidies toward the production of that human capital. That argument could be extended to many other forms of human capital, as well - e.g., engineers, scientists, nurses.

According to a fact sheet published by the Association of American Medical Colleges, annual tuition and fees at public medical schools in 2011-12 amounted to $30,753, and the total cost of attendance was $51,300. The comparable averages for private medical schools were $48,258 and $69,738. To most Americans, these will seem staggering amounts.
Which brings me to the sizable debt with which, almost uniquely in the world, American medical students now graduate. The association routinely collects data on these debts. A good summary of the most recent data, for 2010, can be found on the previously identified fact sheet, and I created this table from that source.
As the table shows, some of the students' accumulated debt by time of graduation from medical school was incurred to finance a liberal arts undergraduate education. The $18,000 shown in the table is actually on the low side. According to the Project on Student Debt, college seniors who graduated in 2010 had an average debt of $25,250, with a range among campuses of $950 to $55,250 a student. Individual students at private colleges may have even larger debts. And debt collectors collecting these debts.
Amortization of the large debt accumulated by medical students will clearly take a bite of the income they will earn in medical practice. But at least there will be a sizable future income stream to absorb the hit. Many other college graduates have much smaller incomes or are in even direr straits.
The table below conveys a rough indication of what the amortization of medical-school debt might mean for individual students.
In this table I have assumed that the student modeled here had average debt of $161,300 upon graduation from medical school. From that debt I deducted $24,400, the amount to which $18,000 of debt upon graduation from a liberal arts college would grow in four years at a compound interest rate of 7.9 percent (that's at the high end of the interest rate medical students are charged on debt). The remainder is debt related strictly to the medical education of the student.
I assume that after residency, the practicing physician has a starting net income (after practice costs) of $150,000 or $300,000, and that these incomes will grow at an annual compound growth rate of 3.5 percent over time. Physician incomes vary considerably across specialties and even within specialties.
To get a feel for the data, readers may want to look at severalsurveys of .
According to the association, graduate and professional students pay an interest rate of 6.8 percent on Stafford loans. For Direct Plus loans, students or their parents pay a rate of 7.9 percent, the rate I used in the table.
Finally, I assume two distinct amortization models. Under one, students pay back their debt with flat annual (or monthly) payments over 20 years. That payment is $13,840 a year. Under the alternative approach, the annual amortization payment rises in step with the assumed annual increase in physician income. The first annual payment in that approach is $10,659.
The data in the table represent these annual debt-amortization payments as a percentage of physician net income in years one, 10 and 20 of medical practice.
Clearly, these payments are a noticeable burden, even over 20 years. For amortization over 10 years, they would naturally be higher. On the other hand, the numbers would decline sharply with reductions in the interest rate charged. The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the first-year payment to interest rates and amortization horizon for the payment stream that increases in step with assumed increases in practice income.
The annual amortization payments would be particularly burdensome for primary care physicians, with their relatively lower incomes. That fact is a potential policy lever Congress might employ if it took seriously people's lament that America is suffering from an acute shortage of primary care physicians.
I shall muse about that and other options in a future post.
An earlier version of this post misstated the name of the Association of American Medical Colleges. It also referred incompletely to a subsidized form of Stafford loans. While there are subsidized loans at 3.4 percent interest, they are not available to medical students and other graduate and professional students.
In addition, because of an editing error, an earlier summary misstated the author's view of subsidies for medical education. He writes that medical education is no more worthy of public subsidies than other professional preparation, not that it might warrant subsidies.

 BODY:
McKEON--Robert Brian, passed away in Darien, CT on September 10, 2012. He was an extraordinarily compassionate and generous person, a loving husband and father, a devoted son and sibling, and a cherished friend. Mr. McKeon was born to Diana Brady McKeon and Donald Stillwell McKeon in Bronx, NY on August 6, 1954. From an early age, Robert displayed a deep love for learning and a hard working, industrious spirit. He graduated magna cum laude from Fordham University with a B.S. in Economics and received his MBA from Harvard Business School. His constant intellectual curiosity, his integrity, and his passion for the pursuit of knowledge underpinned a distinguished business career that began at First Boston Corporation in the Mergers and Acquisitions Group. 
He then went on to become a founding partner of Wasserstein Perella & Co., where he served as the Chairman of Wasserstein Perella Management Partners. In 1992, he founded Veritas Capital, a private equity firm based in New York. As Chairman and Managing Partner, he led the firm's exceptional growth and success and served on the boards of many of the firm's portfolio companies. Under his leadership, Veritas Capital achieved amongst the very highest and consistent returns for its investors in the industry. Mr. McKeon realized his good fortune in finding a career that he loved and always encouraged his children to pursue their own dreams, once referring to the ancient Greek ethos that happiness is the use of your talents along the lines of excellence. Mr. McKeon pursued a diverse range of interests that reflected his intellectual curiosity, love of life, and spirit of adventure. He was an avid art and book collector, loved music, was a voracious reader, and an enthusiastic painter. He loved walking, jogging, skiing, shooting, tennis, and horseback riding. He traveled extensively with his family and particularly loved the natural beauty of East Hampton, Telluride, and the English countryside. He was a generous supporter of his alma maters, including his high school Albertus Magnus, and served on the board of trustees at Fordham University. In 2005, he established The Robert B. McKeon Fellowship Fund for Military Personnel at Harvard University. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, where he endowed The Robert B. McKeon Endowment Series on Military Strategy and Leadership. Mr. McKeon was appointed by the Governor of Connecticut to serve as Chairman of the state's Health and Educational Facilities Authority, a public authority that finances hospitals and universities in Connecticut. For those who were privileged to know Bob, he will be profoundly missed and will remain a source of inspiration and love forever. Mr. McKeon is survived by his wife Clare Elizabeth Smith McKeon, their son Alexander, his previous wife Patricia Finnegan and their children Robert, Jacqueline, and James. He also leaves his brothers and sister: Karen McKeon of Manahawkin, NJ, Donald McKeon of Buffalo, NY, Joseph McKeon of Waverly, NY, George McKeon of Walden, NY, Matthew McKeon of Albany, NY, and his late brother John McKeon of Cornwall, NY, as well as 16 nieces and nephews. A private family service will be held on September 15, 2012. A memorial celebration is being planned for the future. Mr. McKeon's family thanks the many friends who have already written and called with their condolences. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Kidney Cancer Association (Chicago, IL) in Memory of John T. McKeon and Robert B. McKeon.

HEADLINE: Kraft Foods to Leave Dow; UnitedHealth to Join

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average, perhaps the most widely known barometer of Wall Street, announced Friday that it would boot Kraft Foods out of the index to make room for UnitedHealth Group, the insurance company.
The change takes effect Sept. 24. S.& P. Dow Jones Indexes, which manages the average, said it was dropping Kraft because it was about to become a much smaller company after spinning off its North American grocery business.
The shuffle will not affect the level of the Dow, which closed Thursday at a four-year high at 13,539.96. The formula used to calculate the average is recalibrated every time a company is added or dropped. 
Kraft, which makes Cool Whip, Cheez Whiz and the familiar blue-box macaroni and cheese, had a short life on the Dow. It was added during the financial crisis in September 2008, replacing the crippled insurer, American International Group.
The UnitedHealth Group was added because of health care's growing importance in the American economy, said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee. The Dow includes the drug makers Pfizer and Merck, but no companies focused on health insurance.
The Dow is made up of 30 stocks. A small committee, including the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones, decides which companies get added and dropped.
The purpose is to give investors an idea of how the entire stock market is performing, not stocks that will be most profitable.
The committee tries to choose companies that can remain on the index for a long time. For a 17-year stretch between 1939 and 1956, the makeup of the Dow did not change. It went another 17 years without changes from 1959 to 1976.
Since it was born in 1896, the Dow has changed to reflect the engines of the economy, shedding agricultural companies and coal miners for banks and fast food. Of the Dow's 12 original stocks, only General Electric is still a member. The last change was in June 2009, when a bankrupt General Motors and a hobbled Citigroup were kicked off. They were replaced by Cisco Systems, which makes computer networking equipment, and Travelers Companies, the insurance provider.
The Dow takes pride in being the oldest stock index, and maybe the best-known in popular culture, but it has critics. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a much wider gauge of the market, is preferred by investing professionals.
How the Dow works is also a matter of contention. Companies with a higher stock price -- not necessarily a greater market value -- have a bigger pull on the average.
A small percentage change in I.B.M., which trades above $200 a share, could move the Dow more than a giant percentage change at Bank of America, which trades at about $10.
Some have been pushing for the Dow to add red-hot technology stocks like Google or Apple.
In a conference call Friday morning, Mr. Blitzer told reporters that the stock prices of Google or Apple would probably distort the index because they would carry so much weight. Both are trading around $700 a share.
Besides, he said, technology companies are already well represented on the Dow: ''I don't see Intel, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard as old and decrepit by any means,'' he said.
In an interview in April, John Prestbo, then of Dow Jones Indexes, said he always called companies beforehand to give them a heads-up if they were about to be kicked off the Dow. For the additions, the news is a surprise.
''They find out about it on the wire,'' he said, ''like everyone else.''

HEADLINE: Costs Rise at Fastest Pace in 3 Years

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
An increase in the cost of gasoline pushed consumer prices up in August at the fastest pace in more than three years and squeezed spending on other items, threatening to further slow the already sluggish United States economy.
At the same time, production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities dropped by 1.2 percent, the biggest decline since March 2009, other data on Friday showed.
The sour mix of numbers was tempered by an unexpected increase in consumer sentiment in early September and signs that underlying inflation pressures remained contained. 
With gasoline costs increasing, service stations chalked up healthy receipts. A second report from the Commerce Department showed sales at gasoline stations shot up 5.5 percent last month, helping to push overall retail sales up 0.9 percent, the biggest gain in retail sales since February.
Economists said the reports helped justify the Federal Reserve's decision on Thursday to introduce a third round of bond purchases to try to lower borrowing costs and spur growth.
''It's very clear the economy is soft and it doesn't look like there is any real underlying inflation pressures the Fed needs to worry about, so they are going to keep their foot on the gas for a long time,'' said Jeremy Lawson, a senior economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
The Consumer Price Index increased 0.6 percent last month, the first increase in five months and the biggest gain since June 2009, the Labor Department said. Gasoline prices, which also rose the most since June 2009, accounted for about 80 percent of the rise.
Sales of automobiles and building and garden equipment were also strong, but sales elsewhere were weak. A gauge that tracks the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product actually fell 0.1 percent.
That and the strong C.P.I. number left most economists anticipating modest gains in growth of the G.D.P. in the third quarter after output increased at an annual pace of 1.7 percent in the April-to-June period, well below the 2.5 percent rate that is needed to keep unemployment steady.
''For overall G.D.P. in third quarter, we now see some modest downside risk to our current call for a 1.5 percent growth rate,'' said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
While the Consumer Price Index rose sharply, the so-called core index, which strips out volatile and food and energy costs, edged up just 0.1 percent for a second consecutive month.
In the 12 months through August, overall consumer prices increased 1.7 percent, staying below the Fed's 2 percent target, but advancing from July's 1.4 percent rise.
Food costs rose only marginally in August, but they were expected to rise significantly later this year as the impact of a severe drought, which caused a spike in corn and soybean prices, worked its way through to the supermarket.
Also Friday, data on business inventories showed stocks of unsold vehicles piling up in July.
A plunge in auto production contributed to the drop in industrial output in August, although Hurricane Isaac, which disrupted oil refineries in the Gulf Coast, was also a factor.
''Even though an unwinding of these special factors will likely buoy industrial production in September, we do not look for much improvement in underlying manufacturing production trends at this point,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

HEADLINE: Legislators Tainted by Scandal Find Defeat at the Polls

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
In a state with a scant history of electoral upsets, it was not in any job description, but it might as well have been: Once an incumbent, always an incumbent.
The results of Democratic primaries on Thursday turned the tide, though, on job guarantees for those in Albany facing financial-wrongdoing inquiries.
Two incumbents -- Assemblywoman Naomi Rivera of the Bronx and State Senator Shirley L. Huntley of Queens -- lost after being embroiled in scandals that were tabloid fodder for weeks leading up to the election. 
A third incumbent, Assemblyman William F. Boyland Jr. of Brooklyn, who is facing federal bribery charges, won his race, though with less support than some expected for a son of a prominent political family.
''People have had it with candidates who are tainted and bring dishonor to their community,'' said George Arzt, a political consultant, adding that in recent years, voters have set higher expectations for politicians. ''I think more and more voters are looking for bright new faces who care about them and not about themselves.''
That was echoed by Vishnu Mahadeo, a Queens businessman, who said that he thought Ms. Huntley had been in office ''much too long.'' Ms. Huntley, first elected to the Senate in 2006, was charged last month with conspiring to help a niece and an aide steal taxpayer money directed to a nonprofit agency that Ms. Huntley had founded. Ms. Huntley and her co-defendants have pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Mahadeo, who is president of the Richmond Hill Economic Development Council, contributed $4,000 to Ms. Huntley's opponent, City Councilman James Sanders Jr. Mr. Sanders won the primary with 57 percent of the vote; Ms. Huntley received 40 percent.
Basil Smikle, a political strategist, said voters had less patience now for elected officials accused of misappropriating taxpayer money because so many voters were struggling to pay their own bills in a tough economy.
''They don't want to see you doing well on their backs,'' Mr. Smikle said.
In addition, others said, even relatively minor transgressions can loom large over elections when they are magnified through the lens of countless news media outlets, Web sites and blogs. ''Scandals have never been good,'' said Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant. ''Now, with the 24-hour news cycle, it's even worse. You never want to be involved in a scandal.''
Ms. Rivera is being investigated after The New York Post reported that she may have misused her position and taxpayer funds to hire her current and former boyfriends. She has not been charged with a crime, and she could not be reached for comment on Friday.
Ms. Rivera was defeated in the primary, 52 percent to 41 percent, by Mark Gjonaj, a real estate agent and community activist who was a first-time political candidate. She has served in the Assembly since 2005 and comes from a powerful Bronx political family: she is a daughter of Jose Rivera, an assemblyman and Bronx political leader, and a sister of City Councilman Joel Rivera.
Zef Balaj, a Bronx resident, said that while the corruption allegations ''didn't help'' Ms. Rivera, he, like other voters, had also grown dissatisfied with what he saw as her lackluster record. ''She really did not deliver to the constituents,'' Mr. Balaj said.
Gjon Chota, a real estate broker in the area who knows Mr. Gjonaj, concurred: ''She hasn't done much, so somebody has to step to the plate.''
In Brooklyn, however, voters were willing to give Mr. Boyland another chance even though he was arrested last year on bribery charges, less than three weeks after being acquitted in a different bribery case.
Mr. Boyland, who has pleaded not guilty, held off six challengers to win his race, with 37 percent of the vote.
Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor at Hunter College, said that Mr. Boyland had the name recognition and resources to dilute the impact of the bribery charges. ''He won in spite of being under a cloud and very wet,'' he said. ''He had an organizational advantage that no one else could overcome.''
Some political consultants also pointed out that Mr. Boyland had a reprieve because unlike Ms. Rivera and Ms. Huntley, the investigation of him did not surface right before he ran for re-election.
''If you have a scandal,'' Mr. Arzt said, ''don't let it be in your election year.''

HEADLINE: Peter Lougheed, 84, Ex-Premier of Alberta

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
Peter Lougheed, the Alberta premier who harnessed his province's vast oil and gas resources to transform its economy, died Thursday in Calgary, Alberta. He was 84.
His family attributed his death to natural causes. 
A former professional in the Canadian Football League despite his slight build, Mr. Lougheed (pronounced LAW-heed) turned Alberta into a major player in oil and gas and a pioneer in the development of oil sands after his Progressive Conservative Party took power in 1971, ending the long reign of Social Credit, a populist farm movement.
Mr. Lougheed arrived in office at a time of great political and economic upheaval in Canada. He clashed frequently with Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the country's Liberal Party prime minister, over pivotal constitutional and economic issues.
While Alberta's oil and gas industry was founded with the discovery of the Leduc well in 1947, Social Credit governments had neglected it, even though, as is generally the case in Canada, most of the resource was owned by the province rather than landowners.
Mr. Lougheed raised royalties and channeled their revenues into the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, which today holds about $16 billion. As the global oil crisis struck, pushing up prices in the 1970s, the province's wealth rose with it.
The energy crisis led to Mr. Lougheed's greatest clash with Mr. Trudeau, who tried to introduce greater federal control over energy and who sought a portion of royalty payments for the central government. After Mr. Lougheed cut oil production in Alberta, the prime minister relented, and in 1981 acknowledged that provinces had full control over their resources.
Edgar Peter Lougheed was born in Calgary on July 26, 1928. He studied law, obtained an M.B.A. at Harvard and moved into business after his brief career in football.
Oil sands have made Alberta the United States' largest source of imported oil today, but the projects struggled initially and were widely viewed as economically and technologically unsound. But Mr. Lougheed's government participated in a bailout of Syncrude, the industry's pioneer, in 1975. Newer oil sands projects pump the tarlike bitumen from underground rather than removing it through strip mining using technology developed through research financed by Mr. Lougheed's government.
Mr. Lougheed is survived by his wife, Jeanne; his children, Stephen, Andrea, Pam and Joe; and seven grandchildren.
Mr. Lougheed was a social liberal in a province that has been a bastion of social conservatism, yet he was extremely popular among Albertans.
He left office in 1985. This summer, he was named the best Canadian premier of the last 40 years by the Institute for Research on Public Policy.
