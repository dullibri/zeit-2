HEADLINE: Why Stocks Swing on World Events

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
Boris Yeltsin orders the Russian legislature dissolved, and 4,683 miles away, the Dow Jones industrial average sells off 38.56 points. A knee-jerk reaction? You bet. As happens in connection with so many news events unrelated to the immediate stock market or economy, by yesterday the Dow had already begun to bounce back, gaining 9.78 points.
Traders tend to lose their collective cools when stunning news is announced, and, when the news can be linked to the market or economy, the reaction frequently makes sense. 
 The Dow took a 32 percent nose dive in the 12 months after Saudi Arabia announced its oil embargo on Oct. 20, 1973 -- an economic shock wave that tripled oil prices in the United States.
"This wasn't just a case of somebody shooting their mouth off," said William LeFevre, market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, a New York brokerage firm. "The tripling of oil prices had a real impact on the economy."
But not all Dow-movers have. Take, for example, Wall Street's dreaded "Boesky Day," the day the Government announced that Ivan F. Boesky, the arbitrager, had plea-bargained with the Government on charges of securities violations.
The Securities and Exchange Commission did not make its announcement about Mr. Boesky until after the 4 P.M. close of trading on Friday, Nov. 14, 1986. But on the following Monday and Tuesday, traders who arguably knew more than the Government helped knock 53.38 points off the Dow.
The reaction came in part as investors speculated that Wall Street could lose credibility and business if Mr. Boesky brought down too many big players (which arguably, he did). By the end of that same week, though, the Dow stood higher than it had been on Boesky Day. Maybe the really bad guys never got a subpoena.
The arrest of Dennis Levine on May 12, 1986, had even less impact. The Dow edged down 2.10 points that day, a signal, perhaps, that Wall Street mistakenly figured that Mr. Levine -- who implicated Mr. Boesky -- would be more discreet than he proved to be.
Most of the time when news shakes the markets, it pays to do nothing, Mr. LeFevre said. "You're better off waiting a day or two till you get all the information, and then act," he said. "By the time you get your order in when it's happening, the market is already down -- and even with a terrible story, there's always a bounce."
Investors frequently "let their emotions get the better of them, though," Mr. LeFevre added, and the rush to bet on unpredictable long-term implications can be expensive.
The attempted coup when Mikhail Gorbachev led the Soviet Union prompted a 69.99-point selloff by the close on Monday, Aug. 19, 1991. Earlier in the day it was down 100 points. By the next day, even before the Soviet leader was reinstated, the index had recovered 15.66 points.
 
Markets Shut Down
 Sometimes in the face of potentially market-moving news the New York Stock Exchange shuts down. The Big Board closed at 2:07 P.M. on Nov. 22, 1963 -- the day President John F. Kennedy was shot.
The decision to close took some time, Mr. LeFevre said, because the stock exchange in 1963 required a quorum of its board of governors to vote for a shut down, and news that the President had been shot came near the lunch hour, when a number of the governors could not be tracked down.
By the time they voted to close, the Dow had lost 21.16 points, or 2.89 percent of its value. But like many news-induced selloffs, on the next trading day it gained 32.03 points -- up 4.50 percent for the day.
Seventeen years later, when news was hitting the wires that President Ronald Reagan had been shot, Big Board rules required the approval of only three governors to shut the exchange. Thus, trading was halted quickly, with the Dow down only 2.62 points when the New York Stock Exchange stopped trading on March 30, 1981. "And by the next day, when we found out he was O.K., up it went," Mr. LeFevre said.
 
Mixed Reactions
 The onset of war brings a mixed bag of reactions. The Dow rose the day after the Arab-Israeli war began in October 1973 -- a reflection of bad investment decisions considering the long-term economic implications of soaring oil prices. The Persian Gulf war, on the other hand, prompted a selloff that began on Aug. 2, 1990, with the Dow at 2,899.26, and falling 19 percent by Oct 11, when the Dow closed at 2,365.10.
The action by President George Bush months later made Wall Street happier: the Dow rose 114.60 points, to close at 2,623.51, on Jan. 17, 1991, the morning after Operation Desert Storm began. What did Wall Street like about that? "When they started bombing, the market went cuckoo," Mr. LeFevre said. "People felt like we were finally doing something."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Health Benefits and Care: Who Will Get How Much?

 BODY:
By channeling most consumers through the same purchasing alliances, the Clinton plan would go a long way toward providing equal access to medical care for all Americans. Everyone would have insurance and would chose from the same package of benefits, with premiums paid by some combination of employers, employees, unemployed people and government subsidies.
But some people with high incomes or better benefits at work would still be better off than others, while poor people in rural areas and inner cities may still have trouble finding quality care. 
 As with many things, more services bring higher price tags. In general, available care would fall into these four categories:
 
Basic
 Health maintenance organizations would generally offer the most economical choices.
 
Basic, plus
 Some people may choose to pay more up front for plans that charge higher premium prices because, for example, the plans offer nicer facilities or have a better medical reputation.
Many people who want a wider choice of doctors, perhaps because the children's pediatrician is in a different plan than the parents' internist, may choose unrestricted fee-for-service plans, which will charge higher deductibles and co-payments for all medical services.
 
Adding extras
 Some employees, especially those in large corporations or strong unions, will continue to receive benefits beyond the standard package from their employers. These may include adult dental care, broader mental health coverage or in-vitro fertilization. Other families may choose to buy supplemental insurance with their own after-tax dollars. To attract employees or because of union agreements, some companies may also continue paying more than the required 80 percent of premiums, giving some workers a virtual free ride.
 
Unlimited
 Those who can afford it may pay directly for services not covered by the system, including extensive psychiatric therapy, cosmetic plastic surgery, orthodontia or costly fertility treatments.
People may also privately pay a preferred doctor for services like surgery that are included in the standard benefits. But officials think this would be rare, since anyone could join an unrestricted medical plan that offers freedom to seek out any doctor and pay regulated fees.

HEADLINE: Anheuser-Busch Will Cut Salaried Work Force 10%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
With the beer market flat and many beer drinkers searching for less expensive brands, the Anheuser-Busch Companies announced yesterday that it would take a $565 million charge against earnings and cut its salaried work force in the United States by 10 percent.
The moves, part of an extensive program to reduce costs and improve efficiency, follow what has become a pattern among large consumer product companies when buyers have more choices than ever and consumer confidence has not returned to freer-spending ways of the 1980's. 
 While it remains the world's largest brewer, with about 44 percent of the domestic market -- its brands include Budweiser, Budweiser Light, Michelob, Natural Light and Busch, among others -- Anheuser-Busch has crafted a strategy to save about $100 million through next year and up to $500 million by 1997, while pepping up sales.
Jerry E. Ritter, the company's chief financial officer, said in an interview that the changes were not being made as a safeguard against a possible "sin tax" to help pay for the Administration's health care plan presented by President Clinton last night.
Mr. Ritter said that he did not expect financing for health care to include a tax increase on alcohol products. In its lobbying efforts, he added, the company made it clear to the Administration that the last tax increase on beer, a jump to $18 a barrel from $9 in 1991, drove up the price of Anheuser-Busch products 11 percent and led to the loss of 60,000 job in the brewing industry.
"We feel we presented a very good argument with the Administration," Mr. Ritter said.
Within the "restructuring and reorganization" part of Anheuser-Busch's strategy, the company intends to eliminate approximately 1,200 salaried jobs in the United States, all through attrition and early retirements, by the end of next year. The retirements will be offered to employees who are 53 and older. The company's 33,000 unionized employees, including 9,000 who work for the brewery, would not be affected.
Further, the company said that all salaries would be frozen during 1994, and its food businesses -- Campbell Taggart, the country's second-largest maker of frozen baked goods, and Eagle Snacks -- would be moved to St. Louis, where Anheuser-Busch headquarters are, from Dallas. About half the 475 corporate employees in Dallas will be offered a chance to relocate; the others will be let go.
The company also said that the board of directors had approved the one-time earnings charge of $565 million for the third quarter of this year. Last year, the company earned $917.5 million. All the changes were announced after the close of the stock market yesterday, and thus did not affect the company's stock, which lost $1.125 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $45.
As the changes are carried out, Anheuser-Busch officials stressed, efforts to promote the company's premium brands, like Budweiser and Bud Light, would be intensified. Also, the company intends to forge ahead with the introduction and marketing support for new products, like Ice Draft from Budweiser, which will be available for the first time next month on the West Coast.
 
 
'More Competitive'

"This comprehensive effort will make Anheuser-Busch more competitive for the global marketplace of the 1990's and beyond," August A. Busch 3d, chairman and president, said in a statement. "By significantly reducing the corporation's cost, by broadening our line of premium products and by aggressively supporting our brands in the market place, we will be better able to provide products at a competitive price."
Price increases in the future, he added, would be "moderate." Competitive pricing, ultimately, is behind the series of moves. In a pinched economy for nondurable goods, it's a buyer's market. And while micro-breweries are enjoying some vogue with beer drinkers these days, and some imports, like Heineken, remain popular, the mass-market choices have expanded enough to let consumers be price picky.
"The thing Anheuser-Busch has to deal with -- and the industry in general -- is this period of several years with a sluggish economy and the impact of a retroactive tax that is going to hit early next year," Emanuel Goldman, a securities analyst for Paine Webber in San Francisco, said. "With another period of extreme sluggishness, there would be further trading down by consumers and the continued inability of the company to increase price. Anheuser-Busch's response is just reflective of what's going on throughout the American nondurable consumer landscape."

HEADLINE: Tax-Cut Temptation

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Promising not to raise taxes is tricky business for any politician. Ask George Bush. Or Gov. Jim Florio, whose record $2.8 billion tax increase came within months of a 1989 campaign promise to resist the temptation.
Now Christine Todd Whitman, Mr. Florio's Republican challenger in the governor's race, has promised not only not to raise taxes, but to slash the state's income tax for most residents by 30 percent over three years. 
 Everyone wants lower taxes, but with the promises of Mr. Bush and Mr. Florio still ringing in their ears, do voters believe it when a candidate says it can be done? Do they want to hear the promise even if they do not believe it?
"The voters are extraordinarily cynical right now," said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Washington.
"Florio has been extraordinarily disadvantaged by virtue of his promise," Mr. Gans said. "Whether this will put Ms. Whitman in the same boat by virtue of making a promise that people feel she cannot live up to, I don't know. But you are rapidly getting into a campaign in which both candidates have a credibility problem."
 
What They Want to Hear
 Politicians may like to believe that voters want to hear promises of a tax cut. But analysts said voters do not respond uniformly when an election presents a choice between a tax-cutting candidate and one who promises to maintain or even raise taxes. In 1990, voters punished incumbent governors in Kansas, Florida and Nebraska who promised no new taxes but reversed themselves once they took office. On the other hand, Illinois voters picked a Republican who supported retaining a 20 percent surcharge on state income taxes that went to improve schools over a Democrat who wanted the surcharge to expire.
In New Jersey's recent past, a Republican candidate, Raymond Bateman, plummeted in the polls and eventually lost after he criticized the new state income tax during the 1977 gubernatorial campaign. Polls showed that initial voter opposition to the income tax eased after increased state aid translated into lower property taxes. The polls also showed that voters did not believe Mr. Bateman when he said he could run the state without an income tax or its equivalent in other taxes.
The question many voters will have for Mrs. Whitman will concern which services she would cut to make up for the loss in revenue created by her tax cuts, as well as for a projected $1 billion shortfall in the state budget for the next fiscal year.
As governor of New Jersey, Mrs. Whitman would have a line-item veto and the power to impound appropriations. In theory, she could simply refuse to provide money to any program, salary or agency she considered wasteful or mismanaged, even if the program had already been approved.
Mrs. Whitman said she would probably use that power to trim $250 million from Mr. Florio's 1993-94 budget as soon as she took office in January.
 
Would Cuts Cause Pain?
 But some analysts doubt whether Mrs. Whitman would be able to find as many cuts as she would like without raising cries from the people who benefit from government services.
"I think voters at this point realize that the same bills are going to be due whether the tax cut goes through or not," said Michael Ettlinger, tax policy director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a research and advocacy group associated with labor unions. "Reagan said he was going to cut taxes and increase military spending without cutting anywhere else and look where it got us: $4 trillion in debt. The bills have to be paid somehow."
A few major programs, such as Medicaid, could not be touched without agreement from the Federal Government. Others, such as debt service and Social Security contributions, health benefits and pensions for state workers, are based on signed contracts and could not be touched without negotiations.
Those programs account for about $3.6 billion of the state's $15.6 billion budget.
Technically, any of the other programs could be impounded by the governor. But that includes $6.7 billion for state aid, which means aid to schools and municipalities that have the effect of offsetting local property taxes. It also includes $4.6 billion for state operations, which include the bureaucracy of state agencies but also includes parks, prisons and state police.
"There is mismanagement everywhere," Mr. Ettlinger said. "But there isn't a billion dollars of mismanagement anywhere. There is always money to be saved and I'm all for that, and for eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. But that isn't the bulk of what governments spend money on."
While sweeping in its promises, Mrs. Whitman's proposal provided few detailed plans for cutting services to make up for the reduction in revenue and cover a projected $1 billion shortfall in the state budget for the next fiscal year.
Mrs. Whitman said she would not discuss specific cuts because she would not know the true budget numbers and see the results of performance audits until she was in office. One of the few details she did offer was an estimated $150 million in savings that would come from the privatization of public agencies, where feasible.
But Norman J. Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, said privatization of essential services would just shift the cost of essential services from taxes to higher prices paid by consumers.
"If the services are needed they are going to have to be paid for somehow," Mr. Glickman said. "It seems to me that the governor's campaign is going to raise those kinds of questions. When the opponent says that, it creates questions in voters' minds."
 
Florio Responds
 Mr. Florio is already trying to exploit voter skepticism about the Whitman plan.
"I would like to go before the people of New Jersey and, like Mrs. Whitman, promise a 30 percent tax cut," Mr. Florio said today. "But it's not real. The numbers don't back it up."
In his first public comments on Mrs. Whitman's plan since she released it on Tuesday, Mr. Florio called it "insulting to the intelligence of New Jerseyans."
"This is her plan: three years in the making," he said at a news conference in Piscataway as he held aloft a copy of Mrs. Whitman's economic blueprint. "One page of so-called spending cuts, with no specifics. And one page of very specific tax cuts, mostly for the rich. Two pages, that's it."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Falls as Russia Remains Calm in Struggle

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark and other currencies yesterday as Russia remained calm, although uneasy, in a power struggle between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his opponents in Parliament.
The dollar surged on Tuesday after Mr. Yeltsin dissolved the Russian Parliament. 
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.6285 marks from 1.6365 marks. It had jumped on Tuesday amid concerns that the Russian turmoil could spill into Eastern Europe. Germany is also Russia's largest creditor.
The dollar also slipped to 106.20 yen from 106.37 yen.
"Russia looked much calmer," said Carl Amendola, vice president at the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank. Even so, he expects jitters about Russia to keep the dollar from tumbling much further, at least through the end of the week.
 
Army Declares Neutrality
 The dollar fell after the Russian Army declared its neutrality in Mr. Yeltsin's conflict with Parliament. Foreign support for Mr. Yeltsin also made investors more willing to sell the dollars they had bought the day before as a safe haven.
"People are used to putting up with political conflicts in Russia as long as the military isn't involved," said Amy Smith, market strategist at IDEA, a financial consulting firm.
The dollar also suffered amid widespread speculation that Germany's central bankers would not lower interest rates when they hold their policy meeting today.
The meeting is the last for Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president. Mr. Schlesinger, a dogged inflation fighter, probably will not "bow out with a rate cut," said Nick Parsons, chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London.
Lower German interest rates would make mark-denominated deposits less attractive, diminishing demand for the currency.
The dollar fell against the yen, meantime, amid signs that the United States might not be content with the latest efforts by Japan to curb its swelling trade surplus. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Japan must do more to spur domestic growth, even though it has just announced a $59 billion stimulus package and cut its discount rate to a record low of 1.75 percent from 2.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Share of Foreign Chips In Japan's Market Slips

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
American and Japanese officials announced today that the market share of imports in the Japanese computer chip market, a widely watched trade figure, had dropped again, to 19.2 percent in the second quarter.
The lower market share for computer chip imports provoked immediate dismay from American Government and industry officials. The drop was politically ill timed because it came just five days before President Clinton is scheduled to hold his first meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan, in New York at the United Nations. 
 In 1991, under pressure from the United States, Japan set a target under which imported chips would have 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992. The Clinton Administration calls the agreement a model for opening the Japanese market.
But senior Japanese officials have said that they regret the agreement, which they say establishes the unwelcome precedent for Japanese Government intervention in market shares, something that Tokyo has condemned as managed trade.
Today's announcement, made in Tokyo and here, gave a sour note to the conclusion this afternoon of four days of trade talks in Hawaii between Japanese and American officials. The talks were the first round in a series of negotiations aimed at producing deals by January on trade in industries ranging from car manufacturing to insurance.
 
Target Met Last Year
 The 20 percent target for computer chips was met for the first time last year when sales of imported chips in Japan reached 20.2 percent in the fourth quarter. But imports have slid since then, to 19.6 percent in the first quarter and now 19.2 percent.
"This negative trend needs to be reversed immediately," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in a statement. "It is important that the Japanese Government and industry take the necessary steps so we see substantial improvements in subsequent quarters."
Mr. Kantor pointed out that the 1991 accord called for "steady and gradual" improvement after 1992. He repeated his contention last spring, which Japanese officials have rejected, that such improvement should mean an average market share of at least 20 percent during the four quarters of 1993.
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee's panel on trade, questioned the good faith of Japanese officials. "At a minimum, the downward trend clearly violates the spirit of agreement," he said in a statement.
 
Japanese Reaction
 Hidaki Domichi, the economics counselor at the Japanese Embassy, said that it was "not appropriate to make comments on one quarter."
Hidehiko Yoshida, the senior vice president of the Toshiba Corporation and the chairman of a Japanese semiconductor industry group, said that he was "pleased to see that the foreign market share figures have remained in roughly the same high range for three consecutive quarters."
The Japanese Government calculates the foreign market share as 21.6 percent under a different formula for calculations that is allowed under the 1991 agreement but is politically irrelevant because the United States has always pushed for a 20 percent market share under its formula.
A senior Administration official said today that the United States had complained about the computer chips figures during the talks in Hawaii.
The United States and Japan also agreed there that the 15-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation should focus on trade and investment issues and would set up a trade committee, the official said. The group consists of most countries with Pacific coastlines.
The trade talks in Hawaii have covered trade in cars and insurance and government procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications equipment and services. Both sides discussed their priorities but did not try to resolve substantive differences, the senior Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Europe Sees a Plot: 'Anglo-Saxons' Ruin Currency Plans

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Here at the headquarters of the 12-nation European Community, where Europe's recession and political disarray have put many officials in an irritable mood, there is a new dirty word: Anglo-Saxon.
The term, employed scathingly in recent weeks by politicians, including the president of the community commission, Jacques Delors, and the Belgian Foreign Minister, Willy Claes, does not form part of some abstruse historical debate. Rather, in phrases like "Anglo-Saxon plot" or "Anglo-Saxon movement," it has come to denote the perceived maneuverings of financiers in New York and London intent on destroying Europe's faltering attempts at creating a single currency by 1999.
 
Against a Strong Europe?
 "There is a kind of plot," Mr. Claes, who is currently president of the community's Council of Ministers, told the French weekly magazine Le Point last week. "In the Anglo-Saxon world, there exist organizations and personalities who prefer a divided Europe, condemned to a secondary economic role, rather than a strong Europe with its own monetary and foreign policy." 
 Mr. Delors, addressing the European Parliament, then weighed in with a speech last Wednesday denouncing "this movement of ideas led by the Anglo-Saxons condemning as unrealistic or dangerous the objective of a single European currency."
A barrage of speculative attacks over the last year has left the European Monetary System, the core of Europe's push toward unity, in tatters. The British pound and Italian lira have left the system, which once imposed narrow margins of fluctuation on the community's currencies, and the remaining currencies now float within a wide 30 percent band.
 
Debacle Hurt Unity
 With this debacle, the vision espoused by some member nations -- but not Britain -- of a federal Europe has suffered a severe setback.
Asked to explain the composition of the nefarious "Anglo-Saxon world," Mr. Claes's spokesman, Ghislain Dhoop, said the minister was referring to financial circles in London and the United States and personalities like the financier George Soros.
But Mr. Soros hardly fits the traditional definition of an Anglo-Saxon. He is a Hungarian-born Jew who speaks with a noticeable accent. The notoriety in Europe of Mr. Soros, a New York-based trader and investor, stems from the fact that he made about $1 billion last year by betting on the devaluation of the pound as the system began to fall apart, and also speculated against the French franc last July.
Such is the opprobrium now weighing on Mr. Soros in some circles that he was at the center of a small diplomatic incident in the brandy-producing Armagnac region of France last weekend.
Invited, along with the Japanese Ambassador to France, as an honorary guest at a gathering of a prestigious local institution called the Circle of Armagnac Musketeers, Mr. Soros was pointedly snubbed by the top state official in the region.
 
Prefect Snubs Soros
 The regional prefect, Philippe Martin, refused to attend the dinner, saying that "Mr. Soros did not hesitate, this summer, to attack the monetary policy of the French Government by speculating against the franc." The respected daily Le Monde summed up the fracas with a brief headline: "The Prefect Boycotts the Speculator."
David Kronfeld, a spokesman for Mr. Soros, said that Mr. Soros favored an effective European Monetary System, but was convinced that the system had ceased to function positively for European nations before its recent collapse. "We're not going to respond to this nonsense about Anglo-Saxon plots," Mr. Kronfeld said.
Most analysts argue that Europe's monetary travails have stemmed essentially from misguided policies and political difficulties. "It's fundamentals that have driven this, not the acts of a few traders," said Kim Schoenholtz, chief economist for Salomon Brothers in London.
In this view, Europe's failure over several years before 1992 to adjust exchange rates despite widely differing economic performances in European Community members set up the disaster. This failure was compounded by the unusual pressures on currencies created by the combination of high German interest rates and a deep European recession.
"Financial operators like Soros understand a turkey shoot when they see one," said Alan Stoga, the managing director of the Kissinger Associates consultancy firm in New York. "The European Monetary System is floundering because of policy failures in Europe."
 
Belief Is Deep-Seated
 Nonetheless, the view in Continental Europe of a deliberate British and American plot against a drive toward a federal Europe, and the creation of a single European currency to rival the dollar, appears deep-seated. Former Prime Minister Raymond Barre of France has also recently singled out "Anglo-Saxon financial institutions" as being determined "not to promote -- in fact to do everything to prevent -- the creation of a European monetary and economic union."
Mr. Delors went so far as to suggest last week that some controls could be reimposed on the movement of capital. "I do not see why, at the international level, we should not study ways to limit monetary movements," he said. "Bankers cannot act at will. Why should we not draw up some rules of the game?"
Few took Mr. Delors's suggestion seriously, however. Daily foreign exchange movements of about $1 trillion are now widely regarded as impossible to regulate. It will therefore not be easy to rein in the marauding latter-day Anglo-Saxons.

HEADLINE: OLYMBICS;
I.O.C. Choice Comes Down To Envelopes

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTE CARLO, Monaco, Sept. 22

 BODY:
In an atmosphere that resembled a political convention more than a sporting occasion, the five cities bidding to be host to the 2000 Summer Olympics scrambled to outmaneuver one another today in the hope of influencing the International Olympic Committee's crucial vote Thursday.
According to London bookmakers and an overheated Monte Carlo rumor mill, Beijing is favored to win despite strong Western criticism of China's human-rights record. Sydney, Australia, is running second, and Manchester, England, is a possible surprise choice, while Berlin and Istanbul are rank outsiders. 
 But, with the I.O.C. due to make its decision by secret vote Thursday evening, no city was about to throw in the towel today. Sweet-voiced children, beefy athletes and, of course, politicians were all on hand to sing the praises of the various cities competing for the best possible Olympic gold.
Three Prime Ministers -- John Major of Britain, Paul Keating of Australia and Tansu Ciller of Turkey -- will even be present when Manchester, Sydney and Istanbul, respectively, make their final 55-minute presentations to the I.O.C. Thursday.
In practice, 89 votes will be cast because one Bulgarian member is under criminal investigation at home and has been forbidden to travel. The I.O.C. president, Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, who was re-elected to another four-year term by acclamation today, does not vote. So the winning city will be the first to receive at least 45 votes.
If no city wins an absolute majority in the first round, the city with the least votes will be eliminated. Under new rules, though, the breakdown of votes will not be revealed to I.O.C. members before they vote again. With five contenders, a maximum of four voting rounds is therefore possible.
On the eve of the vote, the expectation is not only that Beijing will win, but also that it might do so after just one or two rounds. And, if this is the case, it might well reflect the I.O.C.'s anger over Western demands that it reject Beijing on human-rights grounds.
Today, it was the turn of Britain's Environment Minister, John Gummer, to raise the problem of China's treatment of its dissidents.
"I think there will be a time when Beijing will be the very sensible hosts of an Olympic Games," he said. "I do not think that time is now."
While the United States Congress and the European Parliament as well as the British Government have spoken out against Beijing's bid, the Australian, German and Turkish Governments have been more cautious, fearing that direct attacks on China may simply help Beijing's case before the I.O.C.
Today, Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who heads a 200-member Chinese delegation here, expressed the Chinese Government's "full and unreserved support for Beijing's bid as well as the ardent hope and fervent aspiration of the Chinese people to host the 2000 Olympics."
Questioned about China's human-rights record, he pointed to China's rapid economic development and said that many who criticized its human-rights record had never visited the country.
"We have a saying, it's better to see once than to hear 100 times," he said.
Richard Dicker of the New York-based lawyers' group known as Human Rights Watch, said today that the human-rights issue will not go away even if Beijing is picked.
 
Framing the Debate
 "Human rights is not deciding this -- money is -- but human rights has framed the Olympic debate over the past six months," he noted.
For all the controversy over Beijing's candidacy, Monaco has insured that little spoils the party in this self-governing principality on the French Riviera. A group of Tibetans and Western sympathizers were banned by Monaco's police from distributing leaflets, carrying banners or even wearing T-shirts saying "No Beijing Olympics 2000 -- Free Tibet."
Several Germans, including one journalist, who opposed Berlin's candidacy, have also been asked to leave by local authorities apparently worried that anti-Olympic demonstrations might disrupt Thursday's formal announcement ceremony.
At a series of news conferences today, however, competing cities were intent only on making last-minute sales pitches. Along with a half-dozen German gold medal winners from the 1992 Summer Olympics, for example, Wilma Rudolph, the American who won the women's 100 meters at the 1960 Rome Olympics, spoke out on behalf of Berlin.
"To me, Berlin means more than just a city that will host the Olympics," she said. "It symbolizes the whole idea of East and West coming together. And the audiences I have performed before in Berlin symbolize the friendship that makes the Games what they are."
Sydney used its news conference to disclose the results of a poll of 100 athletes in five European countries, including Britain and Germany, which showed that 60 favored Sydney, 21 Berlin, 10 Manchester and 4 Beijing. Five backed Brasilia, which later withdrew its candidacy, and none supported Istanbul.
Rod McGeouch, who heads Sydney's bid committee, said he released the results of the poll "in response to media inquiries." It nonetheless served to reinforce Sydney's claim that it offers the best sporting installations for any Olympic event.
 
Still Hope for Manchester
 Refusing to give up hope, Manchester's promoters, who brought a children's choir, a red double-decker bus and a handful of cheerful bobbies along as props, said they thought that many I.O.C. members had still not made up their minds.
"We think the final presentations will be crucial," said Bob Scott, who heads the Manchester bid.
Only Istanbul, it seems, is resigned to defeat. But its bid has not gone unnoticed. A huge Turkish yacht, the Savarona, which carries the colors of Istanbul's candidacy, is docked in the port of Monaco, dwarfing the yachts and cruise boats of the many millionaires who make Monte Carlo their home.

HEADLINE: Dow Manages an Unenthusiastic Rebound

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The stock market bounced back modestly yesterday from the preceding day's 38-point loss, but analysts said the somewhat lackadaisical gains suggested that investors lacked real enthusiasm.
Michael Metz, chief portfolio strategist for Oppenheimer & Company, said the preceding day's selloff, which analysts say was sparked by the political turmoil in Russia, suggested that "the market was in the mood to find an excuse to sell off, and it seized on that." 
 He added, "I think the market has some other problems besides what's going on in the former Soviet Union." He noted that he expected investors to start finding out that third-quarter earnings estimates were "overly optimistic," which will further reduce investors' attraction to stocks.
 
'Mutual Fund Junkie'
 One particularly negative development, he said, was that "at least one" mutual fund found that its cash flows from individuals "dried up dramatically" in the last week.
"The stock market is really a mutual fund junkie in that it depends on these cash flows to stay up in the air," he said. "If there is some disenchantment among individuals with the outlook for the stock market or the economy and this results in their tempering their enthusiasm for mutual funds, we could really have a serious problem."
The Dow Jones industrials gained 9.78 yesterday, closing at 3,547.02. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 289 million shares, down from 300.3 million on Tuesday. The Dow Jones transportations were up a sharp 16.46, to 1,614.46, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 3.25, to 456.20. The American Stock exchange composite was up 3.20, to 450.29.
 
Techs Elevate Nasdaq
 A big gainer yesterday was the over-the-counter market. The Nasdaq composite closed up 11.98, to 745.54, mostly on the strength of technology and computer-related stocks, which were pulled up early in the day by a strong earnings report from Oracle Systems.
Patrick Davis, the chief Nasdaq trader at Salomon Brothers, said other technology stocks rose in sympathy. "They were down for a couple of days, and we were due for a bounce already," he said. "The Oracle earnings added a little fuel on the upside."
Speaking of the particularly sharp Nasdaq gain, he said, "It's been going down harder and up higher than the Big Board over the last couple of weeks, and the trend just continued a little bit more today."
Mr. Metz noted that the Nasdaq composite was strongly weighted toward high-tech stocks, meaning that good days for high-tech stocks produce the appearance of good results for the entire market.
Among computer stocks, Oracle soared 3 7/8, to 58 5/8, on its strong earnings report. Sybase, which announced a joint project with I.B.M. on RISC work stations on Tuesday, jumped 5 5/8, to 62 5/8. Informix was up 2 3/8, to 21 1/8; Progress was up 3 7/8, to 48 1/4; Intel was up 2, to 67 1/4, and Microsoft was up 1 1/4, to 77 1/4.
Travelers, the insurance company, and Primerica, the financial services company, announced that they were in merger talks. Travelers was up 5/8, to 36 5/8, while Primerica was up 1 3/8, to 47 3/8.
The continuing romance involving Paramount Communications and Viacom produced gains for everyone yesterday: Paramount was up 7/8, to 77 7/8; Viacom, Paramount's first suitor, was up 2 1/8, to 58 7/8; and QVC, Paramount's second suitor, was up 3 7/8, to 60.
Among the day's biggest losers was Snapple, which has long been the apple of Wall Street's eye. About 50 directors and other officers announced plans to sell stock worth a total of $200 million, and the company's shares fell 4 1/2, to 46.
Also sinking steeply was Applied Immune Sciences, which announced that the Food and Drug Administration had declined to approve a company product that is designed to help the human immune system. The stock fell 5 1/8, to 14 1/8.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
The Republican Alternatives

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress have professed their willingness to work with President Clinton on health care reform. But a number of G.O.P. plans have also been put forward, most notably by a group of Senate moderates led by John Chafee of Rhode Island and Phil Gramm of Texas and by a group of House members.
While the Republican plans differ, all rely far less on Government intervention to expand coverage or hold down costs than the Clinton plan does. Instead, they say, their plans would increase competition, making insurance more affordable and adding incentives for holding down costs. None of the G.O.P. plans would require all employers to pay for health care, as the Clinton plan does. None would set as rapid and definite a target for universal coverage. None would reshape the health care system in the aggressive way the President's plan proposes, and none would impose mandatory ceilings on the growth in the nation's medical spending. 
 At the conservative end of the spectrum is Senator Gramm's proposal to give individuals the chance to be more responsible for their own health costs. The money an employer spent on a premium could go into a tax-free savings account dedicated to health care. Some of the money would be used for a required catastrophic care policy, and the employee would spend or save the rest.
Here is a comparison of the provisions of the various Republican proposals and the Clinton plan.
 
Coverage
 
Chafee Plan: Requires everyone to obtain coverage and offers vouchers to help low-income workers buy it. Requires employers to offer workers the chance to join a group plan, but does not require employers to help pay for it. Like the Clinton plan, protects benefits regardless of medical status, barring insurers from seeking only healthy clients. Standard minimum benefits, to be defined.
 
Gramm Plan: Requires all employers to offer access to coverage through a group plan, but not to help pay for it. Protects benefits against job change. Those with unavoidable pre-existing conditions would be guaranteed the right to buy coverage at higher rates.
 
House Republican Plan: Requires all employers to offer access to affordable coverage meeting minimum standards set by National Association of Insurance Commissioners, but not to help pay. Protects benefits regardless of job change or medical status.
 
Clinton Plan: Requires employers to provide coverage. Insurance guaranteed for all, regardless of job or medical status. Standard package of benefits. Range of options guaranteed, including fee-for-service, H.M.O.'s and combination plans.
 
How it Works
 
Chafee Plan: Creates insurance pools to make coverage more affordable for small businesses; provides vouchers for the working poor. Expands deductibility of insurance costs.
 
Gramm Plan: Creates tax-free savings accounts for employer and employee contributions, that can be used to buy catastrophic coverage and to cover lesser out-of-pocket expenses. Employers required to allow choice between regular plan, H.M.O. coverage or self-financing through tax-free accounts. Tax credits for the working poor. Expands deductibility of insurance costs.
 
House Republican Plan: Requires insurers to offer affordable coverage to small businesses, creates risk pools to gain more competitive rates. Establishes tax-free saving accounts for medical expenses and premiums for supplementary coverage, like for long-term care. Expands deductibility of insurance costs.
 
Clinton Plan: Employers required to pay at least 80 percent of premium. Coverage provided by large regional or corporate pools that would seek out best rates. Networks of doctors and hospitals would compete for their business.
 
Financing
 
Chafee Plan: Raises $210 billion over five years to pay for vouchers by reducing growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending by that amount, primarily money now spent to compensate for care of the uninsured.
 
Gramm Plan: Cuts growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending by $119 billion over five years, raises $50 billion by taxing employee benefits above specified levels (such as $6,000 a family).
 
House Republican Plan: Raises $17 billion over five years by lowering Medicare subsidies to the most affluent, raising Federal retirement age to 62 from 55 and pre-financing Government retirement health benefit costs.
 
Clinton Plan: Raises $105 billion in new taxes on cigarettes and possibly on liquor. Levy on large corporations that choose to arrange for own health plan is under consideration. Plans cuts of $238 billion in Medicare and Medicaid growth, expects large savings in private sector.
 
Cost Controls
All the plans expect savings from administrative streamlining and malpractice reform.
 
Chafee Plan: Savings from insurance market reform.
 
Gramm Plan: Tax-free accounts create incentives for saving.
 
House Republican Plan: Increased competition and incentives to save.
 
Clinton Plan: Competition among plans expected to curb spending growth, with mandatory ceilings set by National Health Board as backup that would keep growth in line with economy. Doctors operating outside H.M.O.'s subject to fee schedules.
 
Timing
 
Chafee Plan: Vouchers phased in from 1995 to 2000, or sooner if savings are greater than expected.
 
Gramm Plan: No date yet.
 
House Republican Plan: Many provisions phased in over five years.
 
Clinton Plan: Between Jan. 1, 1995, and Jan. 1, 1997. Benefits expanded in 2000.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
A New Framework for Health Care

 BODY:
To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join together in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the true cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy.
 
The Overseer
A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators of the quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising quesions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive.
 
The Payers
 
EMPLOYERS
Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in their region, and to support family coverage for married workers.
 
EMPLOYEES
Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments.
 
SELF-EMPLOYED AND NON-WORKERS
Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently, only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible.
 
GOVERNMENT
Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances.
 
LARGE CORPORATIONS
Woudl have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums.
 
The Brokers
 
HEALTH ALLIANCES
The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for service provided outside H.M.O.'s.
 
ACCESS: All citizens and legal residents would be covered.
 
COST: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range.
 
ELIGIBLE PLANS: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements.
 
OPTIONS: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is oversubscribed.
 
QUALITY: Alliances would publish information to help consumers compare the service and the medical performance of various plans.
 
SIZE: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Large cities would have one alliance.
 
STRUCTURE: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance.
 
CORPORATE ALLIANCES
 
If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their own alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employeees might have fewer providers to choose from.
 
The Options
 
Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service option offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,800 a year for an individual and $4,200 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in prices; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars.
 
H.M.O.
 
The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subscribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay 40 percent of the bill.
 
Combination Plan
 
The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits.
 
Fee For Service
 
The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family.
 
The Benefits
 
All Americans would be issued a "health security card" that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below.
 
Dental: Preventive care for children. Adult benefits phased in by 2000.
 
Drugs: Prescriptions.
 
Eye & Ear: Routine vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only.
 
Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year.
 
Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days.
 
Hospice Care: for terminally-ill people.
 
Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary.
 
Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays.
 
Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance.
 
Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices. when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents further deterioration.
 
Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illnes or injry. Re-evaluated every 60 days.
 
Preventive Care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening.
 
Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services.
 
The plan excludes services that are not "medically necessary or appropriate," citing cosmetic orthodntia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services.
 
A Consumer's Guide: How Different Groups Would Be Affected
 
Working, with good insurance
 
Many employees would see little difference, especially if they have already joined an H.M.O., and some would have more plans to choose from. Workers opting for free choice of doctors would often pay more up front toward premiums and have higher costs as they received care. Companies would be required to pay 80 percent of average premium costs, but could pay more if they wished. If currently offered, company-sponsored benefits beyond those in the standard package remain tax-free to employee for 10 years.
 
Working, uninsured
 
Employers would be required to contribute and employees would be required to purchase coverage, paying 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium, less if they chose a cheaper one. Workers would receive subsidy toward their share, on a sliding scale, if family income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. (The poverty line in 1992 was $14,340 for a family of four; 150 percent of that is $21,500.)
 
Nonworkers or Unemployed
 
Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with unearned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost of premium if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line.
 
Part-time workers
 
Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a pro-rated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates.
 
Self-employed
 
Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee. As contribution toward the employer share -- 80 percent of average premium cost -- they would pay from 3.5 percent to a maximum of 7.9 percent of business income, depending on income level. They would also pay employee's 20 percent share, or less if family income was below 150 percent of poverty. Combined payments would approach full cost of premium at income of about $30,000. All premium payments would be tax-deductible, compared to 25 percent now.
 
Two-earner families
 
In most cases entire family would sign up for same plan, but spouses may be allowed to join different ones. Each of the two employers would contribute, and each earner, but the two earners together would not pay more than the normal family share -- 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium. Whether most families would pay more or less than now depends on many factors.
 
Household employee
 
For those working more than 10 hours a week and considered an employee by Social Security, employer would make a contribution based on wages, ranging from 3.5 percent of annual wages under $12,000 to 7.9 percent of $24,000. Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line.
 
Retiree, under 65
 
The Government would subsidize retirees not yet eligible for Medicare. If not covered by former employer or pension plan, they could get coverage through the alliance and pay only 20 percent of the cost of an average premium, as though they were employed. Part-time work or a spouse's earnings would alter the subsidies.
 
Medicare recipient
 
The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or better current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered. Monthly premiums would rise, especially for affluent retirees. Once alliances are established, people turning 65 have option of remaining in former health plan, paying any difference between Medicare contribution and plan cost.
 
Medicaid recipients
 
Poor people on Medicaid would receive mainstream medicine, signing up for a plan through the alliance. In most cases the Federal and state governments would make set payments to the health plan, rather than paying providers on a per-service basis with a fee schedule as in the past. Recipients could choose any plan with premium at or below the regional average without making additional payment.
 
Student
 
Students attending school full-time in a distant location, but covered under their family's policy, would sign up for coverage through the alliance where they attend school. A portion of family and employer premium payments would be transferred from the home alliance to the alliance providing coverage.
 
Illegal immigrants
 
Not eligible for coverage through the health alliances, but could still receive emergency and other care as they do now.

HEADLINE: One Specious Argument for Nafta

 BODY:
With the Congressional vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement shaping up as a nail-biter, advocates on both sides of the issue are firing away with arguments fair and foul, hoping to swing critical votes their way. On balance, the pro-Nafta side has argued more carefully and, in our view, more persuasively.
But one line of pro-Nafta argument insults North Americans on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border. Delay or defeat of the treaty, some claim, would have disastrous consequences for U.S. foreign policy in Mexico and throughout Latin America, undermining reformers and speeding a return to the anti-gringo nationalism of the past. 
 That contention misreads the revolutionary reorientation of economic thinking that in recent years has transformed Latin America between Tierra del Fuego and the Rio Grande. And it ignores the fact that for all President Salinas' accomplishments on economic reform, he and his Institutional Revolutionary Party remain an obstacle to fuller democracy in Mexico.
Parties as diverse as Argentina's Peronists, Chile's Christian Democrats, Venezuela's socialist Democratic Action Party and Mexico's PRI have embraced free-market, free-trade policies, welcoming U.S. investments and imports that once were denounced as instruments of neo-colonial bondage.
The reason for this changed attitude is plain. For decades, Latin America's protected economies sank into stagnation and debt while those of East Asia, initially more backward, achieved rising living standards through export-led growth. Beginning at the end of the 1970's with Augusto Pinochet's Chile, Latin policy makers abruptly reversed course. Chile's success inspired many imitators.
In the past decade democracy and market economics have largely advanced hand-in-hand in Latin America. For years, protectionism and government-sanctioned monopolies had been used to shore up support for the old authoritarian regimes. But those government-provided goodies enriched only the privileged few. Broader democratic electorates seem more interested in lower inflation, less bureaucracy and faster growth.
In the long run freer political choices are likely to reinforce freer economic choices. And freer political choices -- that is, wider democracy -- ought to the primary goal of U.S. foreign policy, in Latin America as elsewhere.
But in Mexico, politics and economics are on a collision course. President Salinas' PRI has ruled Mexico for more than six decades without interruption, relying heavily on economic patronage and blatant ballot-box fraud. His own election in 1988 was barely credible. And the limited political reforms he has introduced since then augur poorly for next year's vote to choose his successor.
In the PRI context, Mr. Salinas is a reformer. But in today's Latin American context, Mexico is not much of a democracy. Americans should decide the fate of Nafta on the merits -- its likely effects on the U.S. economy, on the Mexican economy and on the prospects for better understanding and cooperation between two neighboring peoples. The fate of particular political parties or candidates has no obvious place in these calculations.
If Mexico is going to have reasonably fair elections next year, it would be best that the U.S. not take sides. If it isn't, cross-border relations are in for trouble, with or without Nafta.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Yeltsin Planned His Coup

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, the President of Russia had a long telephone conversation with the President of the U.S. The Russian, who gave no hint of an intent to dissolve Parliament, wanted to know in detail about the progress of the aid package and repeal of trade restrictions; in turn, the American asked him to increase pressure on the Serbs and to withdraw troops from the Baltic States.
A few days later, asked to assess Boris Yeltsin's political position, Bill Clinton said: "He is in a weaker position than he was, politically, right after he was elected -- because of his inability to work through an effective political compromise with his opponents." Should the U.S. be talking to his rival, Aleksandr Rutskoi? "I don't think we should be hedging our bets," replied Mr. Clinton. 
 Ten days later, Mr. Yeltsin's political standing eroding in the face of a budget showdown with the Soviet-era Parliament, the Russian President struck, dissolving the institution that opposed his reforms, and setting legislative elections in three months.
The document he signed was more carefully drawn than any of his previous decrees; it included such details as the wages for legislative staff until Dec. 13. It was no impulsive act.
In this time of nascent democracy and rampant corruption, Russian political power does not yet rest fully on the will of the people. The Red Army and the K.G.B. still figure strongly in the struggle between free-market reformers and command-economy reactionaries. Consider the Yeltsin courtship of these elites:
On March 30, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was interrogated by the anti-Yeltsin parliamentarian Ruslan Khasbulatov, in a way that many top Red Army officers considered insulting; the general was publicly accused of not giving straight answers. This soured many officers on the Parliament and its ally, Vice President Rutskoi, a combat pilot the generals consider an upstart.
In the referendum about a new constitution a month later, which Yeltsin's position won with 59 percent of the vote, fully 67 percent of the Red Army officers supported the President (whose acquiescence to their wage demands further endeared him to them). General Grachev traveled to the U.S. and talked with President Clinton in the office of the national security adviser, Tony Lake.
Meanwhile the K.G.B., which has a new name but is still the K.G.B., was on the knife's edge, its leader leaning toward the agency's old Communist allies in Parliament. At the end of July Yeltsin fired Viktor Barannikov, whom a source calls "a friend who turned unreliable," as Security Minister.
Yeltsin's choice to replace the head of internal security was Nikolai Golushko, a longtime K.G.B. officer in the directorate charged with putting down dissent. His appointment reassured the agents in the ranks, and because he had long been stationed in Ukraine, outside the orbit of the old-timers' Moscow K.G.B. headquarters, Yeltsinites considered him more reliable.
Last week Yeltsin paid a visit to the Interior Ministry's Dzerzhinsky Division (named after "Iron Feliks" Dzerzhinsky, founder of Stalin's secret police), on combat alert a half-hour's ride from Moscow.
And last week the confrontation between the reform executive and the Red legislature came to a head over -- of all things -- the budget. Parliament proposed a foolhardy deficit of 25 percent of G.N.P., which it was ready to pass over Yeltsin's veto. His economic advisers at home and abroad told him that would take the nation over the brink, beyond hope of stabilization.
With his Red Army and K.G.B. and Dzerzhinsky ducks all in a row, and his personal relationship with Washington secure, the Russian leader -- assured that no Clinton bet on him would be hedged -- made his move.
This is a calculated power play, long planned and extra-constitutional, that is likely to put too much power in the hands of the Russian chief executive. Are we wise to support it?
Yes, considering the alternative of political paralysis leading to economic catastrophe leading to social upheaval. Clinton's unstinting public approval, tied to a promise of democratic elections, is wise.
But we should keep a wary eye on the renewed political power of the Red Army and K.G.B. The armed forces that are needed to put a democratic government in place should be radically reduced when the reformers take full charge.

HEADLINE: Nafta Maintains U.S. Environment Standards;
Good Idea, Bad Time

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In the debate over the Nafta ratification campaign, everyone seems to have overlooked one possibility: that Nafta is a good idea that's come along at the wrong time. 
The Administration's argument for opening the trade routes between ourselves and our largest trading partners is logically faultless; indeed, opening the doors to trade has historically benefited all trading partners in the long run. The question that remains unasked is whether this good long-run idea is worth the pain in the short run during a time of already slow job growth.
In a situation in which both sides' arguments seem correct, perhaps the best solution is to agree with both and to ratify Nafta after it has been amended to begin taking effect only when the U.S. unemployment rate hits a target, perhaps 4 percent. By timing Nafta to take effect in a period of economic growth, we can avoid its current harmful effects and give it a running start toward boosting the continent's trade when it does take effect.

HEADLINE: Holtzman-Hevesi Debate Centers on Ethical Lapses

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Alan G. Hevesi accused City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman yesterday of violating Federal law in accepting a $450,000 campaign loan from Fleet Securities but then went on the defensive himself when asked about charges that he had missed as many as 1,000 Assembly votes.
In their first head-on debate since a close three-way primary forced a runoff election for the Comptroller's post, Mr. Hevesi explained his absences by both dismissing the importance of the votes and, for the first time, citing a debilitating illness suffered by his wife, Carol. He suggested that her illness had occasionally distracted him from some of his less pressing duties in the Assembly. 
 A good part of the debate focused on charges that Ms. Holtzman acted improperly in accepting the bank loan from Fleet. Ms. Holtzman's behavior in obtaining the 1992 loan was criticized by a city Department of Investigation report, which faulted her as grossly negligent for failing to inquire whether Fleet was trying to increase its share of city bond business when she was asking it for a loan.
Before the release of that report, Mr. Hevesi used the Fleet issue repeatedly to criticize Ms. Holtzman. He pledged to drop the matter once Ms. Holtzman released the report, which she did. But last night he sidestepped that pledge by citing Federal laws, not the investigation agency report, to claim that her actions were illegal.
 
Denies Wrongdoing
 Ms. Holtzman has consistently maintained that she has at no time broken any law, and reiterated that in new radio ads yesterday. Last night she pressed what she saw as a critical distinction in the case, namely that she obeyed the letter of the law but was not "sensitive" to the appearance of a conflict and the impact such appearances could have.
"I think there has been a lot of confusion and a lot of distortion about what happened," she said. "I wish things had been done differently," she added. "But I was very careful about making sure that the law was obeyed."
 
'Criminal Wrongdoing'
 Mr. Hevesi bore into the issue, charging the Comptroller with "criminal wrongdoing" based on Federal banking regulations. Citing those guidelines, he said the Comptroller had violated the law because she did not repay the money on time.
"The idea that the loan violated no law is false," Mr. Hevesi charged. "The failure to repay by itself makes the loan illegal," he said. "It violates Federal law."
Ms. Holtzman immediately dismissed the charge, saying that her opponent apparently "hasn't really read" the applicable laws. She maintained that campaign law specifically allows repayment to be made contingent on the net proceeds from a banquet or other fund-raising event, which was how her own loan was written. "We are in the process of repaying the loan," she said.
Challenged about his own acceptance of campaign contributions from school bus contractors and others who would most likely be doing business with the city if he is elected Comptroller in November, Mr. Hevesi said he would recuse himself from any decisions regarding organizations or individuals who contributed to him.
Both candidates agreed that campaign finance laws should be modified. But Ms. Holtzman went on to say that all openings for conflict should be closed lest there be a hypocritical emphasis on one industry.
 
Auditing City Agencies
 Ms. Holtzman and Mr. Hevesi also focused on issues of governing in the Comptroller's office, including the auditing of city agencies.
Mr. Hevesi accused Ms. Holtzman of falling down on her duty by conducting only 71 audits last year, compared with the average of 225 audits conducted by her predecessor, Harrison J. Goldin, whose office averaged 225 audits a year.
"The numbers do count," said Mr. Hevesi. "Even if you don't find anything wrong, that's good. When you do an audit, it is the preventive effect of every Commissioner knowing that an independent group of auditors is coming over from the Comptroller's office."
Ms. Holtzman responded that quality counts over quantity in audits, but added that budget cuts had forced her to reduce the size of her auditing staff.
"It's silly to get into a discussion of quantity versus quality," said Ms. Holtzman. "Everybody understands that you can churn out lots of audits, but if they're not any good, what's the point ?"
 
'Focus on the Numbers'
 Mr. Hevesi was quick to respond.
"Here we have a very basic disagreement," he said. "The City Charter requires us to focus on the numbers. The City Charter requires specifically that every mayoral agency be audited at least once in a four-year cycle, have one of its programs audited."
The candidates clashed on the question of the economy and balancing the city's budget. Ms. Holtzman highlighted her experience as Comptroller. "I'm the only one who's had experience in helping balancing a budget," she said.
Asked whether she had been so badly damaged that her appearance on the Democratic slate with Mayor David N. Dinkins would hurt the Democrats, Ms. Holtzman repeated that "there's been a lot of confusion and a lot of distortion."
 She then cited her advocacy for issues affecting women and children, concluding, "We need a woman's voice."
 
Long List of Endorsements
 Mr. Hevesi, in turn, cited a long list of endorsements, saying that he would be a better, stronger, less tainted Comptroller.
"It is crucial we have a full-time Comptroller," he said, "with a new vision, with refreshing new ideas, with new approaches, with an attitude toward reform."
He added, "I want this office to be absolutely independent and expert and nonpartisan and totally credible."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 24, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions yesterday about a debate between the Democratic candidates for New York City Comptroller misstated Alan G. Hevesi's position on the decisions from which he would disqualify himself, if elected. He said he would recuse himself from decisions relating to school bus contractors, not from all decisions regarding organizations or individuals who contributed to him. Developments in the campaign are reported today on page B7.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: Reporter's Notebook;
Props and Fuzzy Anecdotes In a Sober, Grown-Up Talk

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
It was the night Elvis stayed home.
President Clinton came to Congress this evening and spoke without the usual array of facial expressions he often borrows from his childhood idol -- the lip-biting, the downcast eyelids, the tucked-in chin. 
 Instead, he gave a thoroughly grown-up, sometimes stern, sometimes passionate and sometimes even angry speech about health care, with a direct and forceful demeanor and few contrivances.
 
Emulating Reagan
 It was his big chance to regain the momentum he had lost through a series of political stumbles soon after his last address to a joint session of Congress, February's speech on economic policy, when the new President seemed to have Congress eating out of his hand.
He borrowed the best rhetorical devices of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. He saluted some members of Congress as he walked up to the lectern. He clenched his jaw when he talked about spiraling prices, and his voice cracked just a bit when, with patriotic fervor, he told the members of Congress to "look in your heart and tell me that the greatest nation in the history of the world is powerless to confront this crisis."
He used a Reaganesque prop: a specially made-up blue card with a magnetic strip on the back, a red bar across the top with the legend "Health Security Card," a United States seal, a white stripe and two gold stars.
And, mostly, he avoided his tendency to drift into technical language -- except for a sprinkling of health care jargon like "pre-existing condition" -- and he illustrated his points with warm and fuzzy anecdotes, one about a man whose business lost its health insurance because his mom and pop, both employees, got so old they were considered high risk.
He also returned to campaign themes that had served him well: "personal responsibility" and "the courage to change."
Both sides of the aisle received the President warmly. But when he began talking about raising taxes on tobacco to pay for the plan, or the need to cut Medicare and Medicaid, many on the Republican side of the aisle began snickering, shaking their heads skeptically and making faces at each other.
As any Democratic President knows, when it comes to taxes, there is never consensus.
Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton got several standing ovations from both sides of the aisle. Some members were amused that a man who is not known for his fitness or abstinence drew applause when he offered a list of services that would be covered under his plan and ended with "cholesterol tests, substance abuse and mental health treatment."
 
No Reruns, Mr. President
 After all the writing and rewriting, after all the day's careful orchestrations , what if Mr. Clinton had delivered the wrong speech? It almost happened.
Moments before Mr. Clinton opened his address, he glanced at the Teleprompter, only to realize that it was displaying the State of the Union address he gave last winter.
"He turned to Al Gore and said, 'That's the wrong speech,' " said Mandy Grunwald, a Democratic consultant who was involved in preparing the speech.
Ms. Grunwald said it took White House officials seven minutes to feed the right speech into the Teleprompter. Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton had to rely on a paper text on the lectern in front of him, trying not to look down too much.
The twist is that Mr. Clinton ad libbed much of the State of the Union address, but he closely followed the text in tonight's speech.
 
Late Hours and Jet Lag?
 The Scowcroft award -- given to Bush Administration officials who could fall asleep anywhere, anytime, in any nerve center of the world, with any number of eyes upon them -- went tonight to Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Like former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, who would sometimes nod off in the middle of important meetings and go pitching head first toward the flowerpot on the table in the Oval Office, Mr. Christopher showed true napping talent by yawning surreptitiously and nodding off several times during the President's 53-minute speech, then jerking himself up guiltily.
Mr. Christopher's daring was all the more remarkable since he was seated right in front of the President, in a row of Cabinet members who kept the requisite alert, intrigued, moved and proud demeanors as his chin kept hitting his nattily attired chest.
 
Festival Seating
 In Washington parlance, they are known as "velcroids," officials who go to extraordinary lengths to get into the picture with the President.
The acknowledged vizier of House velcroids is Sonny Montgomery, the Mississippi Democrat who has been a Congressman since Bill Clinton was a student at Georgetown.
At 6:45, two hours and 15 minutes before the President's big speech was to begin, Representative Montgomery, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, could be found sitting in an almost empty House chamber, on the aisle of the third row from the back -- prime territory to be seen on television by the folks back home, shaking the President's hand when he arrived at 9 P.M.
Clearly a master of the maneuver, Mr. Montgomery came prepared. Though it is not customary to bring food and drink to the floor, he had lined up at his feet enough junk food to satisfy even Mr. Clinton. While the Republican and Democratic leadership dined in splendor in the Senate dining room, Mr. Montgomery waited patiently on the floor, munching on popcorn and crackers and passing Pepperidge Farm cookies to the handful of colleagues who had also arrived early to claim aisle seats. A large bottle of Coke and a small bottle of Sprite sat on the floor at his feet.
In his rush to get to the floor, Mr. Montgomery put out his prepared "reaction" to tonight's speech -- saying he was "very pleased" with its contents -- at 4:50 P.M.
When Mr. Clinton finally arrived at 9:05, Mr. Montgomery was ready to pounce. He held out his hand and got a shake from the President. Not satisfied with that triumph, he waited again, while the rest of the room cleared out, to pat the President on his way out the door.
 
Opinions on Parade
 In the instant analysis popular among members of Congress looking to see their names in print, lawmakers were prowling the press galleries for reporters to give opinions to, and using the pay phones calling reporters back home with random portentious thoughts about health care.
The large and folksy Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama sat in the middle of the Senate press gallery and opined that the President had given "an excellent presentation."
Asked about the tobacco tax, which would hit the South hard, the Democrat shrugged.
"Obviously we can't pay for it without some taxes," he said. "It depends on how much and what."
Mr. Heflin's lack of concern about the tobacco tax became more understandable when a reporter asked how he would feel paying more for his beloved stogies.
"I don't smoke now," he said in a resigned tone. "I haven't lit a cigar in three, four-and-half months. The doctors cut me off. Can't use 'em."
 
The Rainbow Was Women
 If anyone doubted that the era of the mannish navy blue suit for women in powerful positions was gone, they had only to look across the Democratic and Republican aisles tonight.
The great majority of the female members of the House and Senate, and Clinton Cabinet, wore shades of purple, pink, coral, salmon, red and orange. And that, no doubt, made it the most colorful joint session of Congress in history.
But, proving that rituals in the capital die hard, Hillary Clinton's role on her big night was the same as that of every more domestic First Lady before her: to sit silently in the gallery beside the Vice President's wife, look elegant and gaze admiringly as her husband, the President, talked.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the Congressional reaction to President Clinton's address on health care misstated the writer's observation, in some copies, about a standing ovation. The passage should have read: "Mr. Clinton got several standing ovations from both sides of the aisle. Some were amused that in a body that is not known for its fitness or abstinence, one ovation came when he offered a list of services that would be covered under his plan and ended with 'cholesterol tests, substance abuse and mental health treatment.' "

HEADLINE: Hang Tough, Boris

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is director of Russian and Eurasian studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
By dissolving Parliament and scheduling early elections, President Boris Yeltsin has thrown Russia into one of its periodic fits of political uncertainty. Yet the "crisis" is very peculiar. For all the supposed drama of the confrontation, the most important political forces all have the same interest: to see Mr. Yeltsin succeed. If he holds on to his strength, Russia may turn a crucial corner in creating democratic institutions.
Two groups will be among the arbiters of the confrontation: the military and the heads of provincial governments. Since the failed coup of August 1991, Russia's generals have sought to keep their institution out of politics and have largely succeeded. They say the politicians should sort out their differences. 
 Yet the military leaders understand how risky complete neutrality could be. An indefinite political stalemate and the disintegration of the Government that would follow from it raise the danger that the army would be forced to restore order. This is not the job it wants. That's why it tilted strongly toward Mr. Yeltsin in March, when he called for a national referendum to settle his dispute with Parliament. And it's why the defense and interior ministers strolled the streets of Moscow with him yesterday to show their support. Backing the President today is their way of avoiding more dangerous involvement in politics later.
Similar calculations guide the provincial politicians. The standoff in Moscow offers them an opening to claim broad new powers for themselves, but they cannot press their advantage without risking all they have gained. A full breakdown of national institutions would increase the likelihood that at some point a government would be formed in Moscow with a mandate to recentralize. Seeing this possibility, provincial leaders, though less united than the military, will also back President Yeltsin.
No group has a stronger stake in his success than leaders of the new parties forming across Russia. For them, elections offer a chance to break into the political arena and claim a role in setting the country's direction. These people are not yet power brokers in the sense that the generals and provincial bosses are, but by supporting Mr. Yeltsin now they will strengthen his claim to speak for the nation as a whole.
Seeing how many groups have an interest in President Yeltsin's success makes clear that his moves are hardly the mad dictatorial power grab his critics claim. More than anything, he is preparing the way for the post-Yeltsin era. He will, after all, end up with a legislature whose popular legitimacy rivals his.
The President proposes to open the Government to new politicians who will before long think of themselves as his rightful successors. If he succeeds, he will start to make himself dispensable and cease to be Russia's only true national political leader. Even a big electoral win in December, while greatly enhancing his prestige, would give a still bigger boost to future rivals, who will emerge as leaders of large parliamentary blocs. That's why even some of Mr. Yeltsin's critics, among them extreme conservatives, favor early elections.
By contrast, the members of Parliament -- the Supreme Soviet -- who aim to thwart Mr. Yeltsin are a very small and unprepossessing bunch. Yesterday, the Speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov, had trouble even mustering a quorum. There may also be a low turnout if he tries to convene a session of the larger Congress of People's Deputies. The power of both bodies depends entirely on stalemate; they are undemocratic, Soviet-era institutions with no real legitimacy.
The lineup of political forces, then, is strongly in Mr. Yeltsin's favor -- so strongly that many have asked why he took so long to act. In particular, he has been criticized for losing the momentum created by his stunning referendum victory in April, when the people expressed strong support for him and his program. Mr. Yeltsin's delay has had very negative political and economic consequences and has made the man who broke the coup two years ago seem, of all things, weak.
Yet the real reason for President Yeltsin's delay has been more serious, and not of his own making. Russian political leaders still fear accountability; they often do not know whom they speak for and thus seek protective cover in consensus.
During Mr. Yeltsin's long confrontation with the Parliament, many of those in the middle wanted him to win without being ready to offer him open support. Instead, they pushed him to seek compromise, to explore every possibility of agreement, so that no new "crisis" would be necessary.
That led to Mr. Yeltsin's summerlong dawdling -- his search for a formula that would unite all political forces in favor of a new constitution and new elections. While he let the momentum of April slip away, the Parliament replied with all-out war against him, passing measures that would have undone his economic reforms, foreign policy and ability to govern.
And yet his position has not eroded as feared. Instead, the Parliament's barrage of anti-reformist votes has powerfully reinforced Mr. Yeltsin's argument that it is unredeemable. Having made his effort at consensus, he is in a much stronger position to reject pressures for one last attempt at compromise.
If he is to prevail, he has to insist that the time for compromise is past. Doubtless some of his supporters will again want to have it both ways. Their timidity will parade as statesmanship -- a noble desire to pull the country back from the abyss -- but it will be timidity all the same.
Once the parliamentary leaders begin to see that they are failing, they too will doubtless float an effort at compromise. If all they want is a face-saving solution, Mr. Yeltsin can safely oblige them. He has already said he is prepared to run for re-election next year. If he now agrees to go further and fix a specific date, no great harm will be done and his fair-mindedness will be loudly praised.
But Mr. Khasbulatov and Vice President Rutskoi may have more than mere face-saving in mind. Getting Mr. Yeltsin into negotiations offers them the chance to come out on top. Mr. Yeltsin surely sees this: he has had brushes with back-room disaster before. Even his confrontation last March was almost undone by bargaining in which Parliament to a very large extent regained the upper hand.
If Mr. Yeltsin now accepts the (legally correct) idea that it is Parliament that calls elections, he runs a real risk that the balloting will never be held. In the meantime, the country will continue to disintegrate.
For Mr. Yeltsin, the stakes are as high as they can be. But some will say the latest confrontation doesn't really matter much: Russia is headed irretrievably toward chaos and elections won't stop the slide.
This view is wrong. Outright defeat for President Yeltsin might well make the breakup of Russia's national political institutions inevitable. The military would slowly begin to split apart as members of the officer corps chose sides politically. The emergence of national parties would be aborted without elections around which they can organize themselves.
But if Mr. Yeltsin succeeds and elections are held this year, Russia will take a long step toward revitalizing its national politics. The job of completing the transition from Communism will remain disorderly, but Russia will at least have institutions more suited to the task -- a working, legitimate legislature, even one that is often at odds with the President, and parties with real constituencies.
It is a lucky country whose problems can be even partly simplified by elections. With all its problems, Russia retains a kind of stubborn luck. Whether that luck holds depends on how its leaders act this week.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The President;
President Hints at Higher Taxes If Health Plan Savings Fall Short

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Sept. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton said tonight that if the cost savings anticipated in his health plan did not materialize he would either have to slow the introduction of certain benefits or find a way to "raise more money."
Mr. Clinton made his remarks in resonse to a question from John White, an economist who helped Ross Perot draw up his economic policies during the 1992 Presidential campaign. Mr. White challenged the financial underpinnings of the President's health care plan during Mr. Clinton's appearance at a town hall meeting here televised by the ABC News program "Nightline." 
 In response to Mr. White's question, the President seemed to open the door to the possibility of raising additional taxes to pay for his program, beyond the limited levies on cigarettes and some corporations that he outlined in his speech on Wednesday night.
"All of us have to be prepared to face the consequences if the cost savings don't materialize," Mr. Clinton said. "If something happens and they don't materialize, then we're going to either have to slow down the benefits or raise more money. I don't think it will happen."
He added, "That's why we have to phase these things in carefully so it doesn't get away from us."
Mr. Clinton's comments came at the end of a day in which he kicked off what White House aides were calling "health care a-go-go," a nationwide blitz of talk show appearances, town hall meetings and even visits to local diners intended to answer one question: what does the President's health care proposal mean for me?
Late today, he came to Tampa for a two-and-a-half-hour town hall meeting in which he fielded a wide array of questions, many of them pointed, from 1,200 local residents and experts chosen by ABC.
Sitting on a stool on center stage at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, the President, like a politician on a house call, dispensed assurances and massaged doubts of an audience that seemed to share his sentiment that health reform was good for the nation. But the same audience also clearly needed to be convinced that his plan would be good for them personally.
 
Personal Stories
 "I have a 4-year-old son who had a near drowning accident," a woman told the President. "He needs physical and occupational and speech therapy three days a week, and I am concerned that he won't be able to continue long term therapy" under the Clinton plan.
"First of all, it won't get any worse," the President answered. "If you are paying for it now and getting coverage, there is nothing to prevent that. You shouldn't worry about that. But in all probability, because of the changes in our plan, you will have more secure coverage. If this plan passes, you will know that the coverage you have can never be taken away from you, especially in the event your husband has to change jobs."
A psychiatrist in Tampa asked Mr. Clinton whether mentally ill patients will be able to get all kinds of costly treatment services or will be limited to low-rate options.
"I really believe that it is important for us to cover mental health benefits," Mr. Clinton said, "but we won't be able to cover the full range because we don't know how to cost them out well enough." There will not be unlimited coverage of mental health treatment until the year 2000, he said, adding that it would have to be phased in.
 
Care for the Elderly
 A woman who takes care of an elderly mother and husband, both with Alzheimer's disease, wanted to know how the plan might help her.
"It will do three things," Mr. Clinton said. "First of all for people with Alzheimer's, we will continue to cover that and we will cover that at least as good or better as now. Over a period of years we will also reimburse people for in-home care. Often it is less expensive to maintain people in home than in a nursing home."
The President said that under his plan, people taking care of sick family members would even be able to hire in-home nurses for a specified period of days to get a break each week from the pressure of their duties.
Mr. Clinton engaged in a long back and forth with a woman who objected to abortions being covered in his plan. She said that it offended her morally to be indirectly financing abortions, and the President countered that his plan would also be indirectly paying for preventive programs that would help inhibit unwanted pregnancies. The President also added a zinger: "If every pro-life advocate in this country adopted a child this world would be a better place."
 
Treatment of AIDS Patients
 A school teacher who was forced to retire because he had AIDS asked how the plan would affect those who are H.I.V. positive.
People with AIDS, the President answered, often have to quit working to get Medicaid to cover their expenses.
"No. 1, you will be covered while you are able to work," Mr. Clinton said. "You will always have health insurance and it won't break your employer, so more people with H.I.V. positive will be able to work longer without bankrupting their employers. That is a huge thing."
At one point, Ted Koppel, the host of "Nightline," asked Mr. Clinton if he was not painting an overly rosy picture. Who is going to be worse off, the President was asked. "The following people will pay more," Mr. Clinton said. "Single healthy who are insured in big plants will pay about $6 a month more that gentleman up there with AIDS."
Employers that cover only catastrophic illness will have to pay more, said Mr. Clinton, who agreed to continue answering questions well after "Nightline" ended.
"Who will get less?" the President said. "The people who benefit from the paperwork explosion. Hospitals will hire fewer clerical workers. And insurance companies will not grow as rapidly, and there may be fewer of them."
Mr. Clinton's answers varied from the detailed to the general, which underscored the tension in his health care political strategy, between his need to keep things general at this point and his need to meet the public's demand for very specific answers. Now that the debate on health care has started, and the public's interest has been piqued, people want details on exactly how it is going to change their lives. To win over public opinion, the White House knows it must provide precise answers.
But to win over the Congress, the President has been trying to keep his proposals, for now, as general as possible so that opposition will not crystallize early around specific details, and so that the plan will be defined by its whole and not its parts, and so that he can be flexible without appearing to backtrack when the real horse trading starts with Congress in a few months.
 
The Right Speech
 Tonight Mr. Koppel began by asking the President to recall how he felt when he was ready to start his address last night before a joint session of Congress and discovered that the wrong speech was on his teleprompter. Instead of his health care address, his Feb. 17 State of the Union address was rolling before his eyes.
The President said he turned to Vice President Al Gore and whispered to him that they had the wrong speech on his teleprompter.
"He said, 'That's impossible,' " the President recalled. "I said: 'You're not reading it. Read it.' "
Earlier in the day, the White House invited radio talk show hosts to broadcast their shows live from the White House front lawn, where every senior official in the Administration with any knowledge of health care, and a few with no knowledge at all but with enough of a title to fool listeners, was sent to sit for interviews and do their best to answer questions.
Set up on dozens of portable tables and chairs, the talk show hosts created a bizarre cacophony: a health care gabfest that looked and sounded like Larry King meets Dr. Kildare.
 
'How About a Senator?'
 "Who wants Mark Gearan? Who wants Mack McLarty? You want a congressman? How about a senator?" a White House staffer shouted at the radio hosts, offering the communications director and the White House chief of staff. Those who could not get anyone on the White House staff settled for White House reporters, with CNN's Wolf Blitzer in heavy demand by the talk show impresarios.
"Yes, acupuncture will be covered in the President's plan," a nearby broadcaster was telling a listener who had telephoned from his car in Portland.
"The initial reaction from callers has been very specific -- What's in it for me?" said Bill Gallagher of Portland's KXL News Radio. "The union guy wants to know how his plan is going to be affected. The unemployed want to know what it's going to do to them. A lot of people -- I mean a lot -- want to know if alternative medicines will be covered. I got a lot of calls from chiropractors."
Judy Jarvis of Talk America said: "I would say the callers have been 50-50 for and against the plan. I am surprised how much initial support there is. But the attitude is sort of: 'Nice speech, Mr. President, but when can you tell us the details? Come back again.' "

HEADLINE: U.S. LAYS OUT RULES FOR A BIG AUCTION OF RADIO AIRWAVES

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Kicking off what could be the wildest scramble for public property since the Oklahoma land rush, the Federal Communications Commission announced the rules today for a multibillion-dollar auction of the nation's airwaves to provide a new generation of wireless communication services.
The technology holds rich promise: a broad new family of portable phones and computer services that could be cheaper and more powerful than today's cellular networks. 
 But the bidding could be even richer. The Government hopes to raise $10.2 billion by auctioning thousands of new licenses for the wireless services.
 
Complex Plan Adopted 2-1
 By a vote of 2 to 1, the F.C.C. adopted a complex plan that would license as many as seven new wireless services in every American city and town, each of which could be a competitor to today's cellular companies. For consumers, the competition could bring innovative services at attractive prices.
But for the businesses that would have to spend billions of dollars to win licenses and build networks, the number of potential players may make the risks too high for some companies to enter the game at all, some industry executives complained today.
Andrew C. Barrett, the F.C.C. commissioner who cast the dissenting vote, said he feared that the commission would splinter the market and make it impossible for new entrants to raise money on Wall Street.
"In an attempt to make everyone happy, the majority has created a consensus decision that involves a complicated labyrinth," he said.
 
Competitive View Wins

But the F.C.C.'s majority view, held by the acting chairman, James H. Quello, and Commissioner Ervin S. Duggan, was strongly in favor of fostering as much competition as possible in the hope of spurring low prices for consumers.
Mr. Duggan said the agency was trying to give the marketplace enough flexibility to accommodate different visions of what personal communication services should be. "We are making educated guesses," he said. "But I am confident that we are erring on the educated side of that phrase."
The plan carves the nation into 51 oddly shaped regions with 492 subdivisions. Two licenses will be granted for each of the 51 regions. Each of the 492 subdivisions, roughly corresponding to individual metropolitan markets, would receive up to five licenses. A rich company or group of companies could bid for a nationwide license by combining bids for a license in each region.
The auctions, mandated by Congress earlier this year, will mark a major departure in the way the Government parcels out rights to the airwaves. Until now, the Government has always awarded free licenses through merit-based comparative hearings or lotteries. But those systems have been heavily criticized for inefficiency or vulnerability to exploitation by speculators.
Virtually every big telecommunications company, as well as scores of new upstarts, had been anxiously awaiting today's rulings. Cellular telephones have exploded in popularity since they made their commercial debut 10 years ago. But the shortage of available space on the radio band that was set aside for cellular service has limited the country to just two systems in each market.
 
Auctions Before June
 The F.C.C.'s action today opens up blocks of the spectrum that add up to more than three times the size of the bands used by cellular services today. The first auctions are expected before June, and some companies hope to start offering new services as early as the spring of 1995.
But many industry experts cautioned that the F.C.C.'s plans might have simply created a new way for companies to lose billions of dollars, with consumers left stranded.
"It's just creating chaos," said Cliff Bean, a consultant for Arthur D. Little Inc., who has estimated that 60 million Americans will subscribe to new wireless services by the end of the decade. "There's no way that more than two additional carriers can survive economically."
Misgivings aside, almost every company in the communications industry -- whether cellular or regular telephone company, cable television operator or newspaper publisher -- is already angling for position and lining up investment partners.
On one of the thorniest issues, the F.C.C. ruled that existing cellular telephone companies would be allowed to bid on some of the new licenses in areas where they already provide service.
Aspiring rivals to the cellular industry, like the long-distance company MCI Communications and the cable and media conglomerate Time Warner Inc., had lobbied intensively to keep cellular companies out, because they already have the right to use a radio band width totaling 25 megahertz, or millions of cycles of radio waves a second.
Partly addressing such concerns, the F.C.C. ruled that cellular companies could bid only for a license giving them an extra 10 megahertz in each market, while all other new entrants will be able to bid on as much as 40 megahertz in each market.
That decision received a mixed reaction. Thomas E. Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, called it a good decision. But the BellSouth Corporation, the nation's third-largest cellular operator, accused the F.C.C. of "squandering a scarce and valuable resource."
There was concern among the cellular carriers' aspiring rivals, too. "We had argued that the commission should issue two or at most three licenses," said Dennis Patrick, president of the Time Warner Telecommunications unit. "We're concerned that the market will be too fragmented."
Many of the nation's biggest companies have already been forming partnerships to compete for the new wireless licenses. MCI, the nation's second-biggest long-distance carrier, has put together a consortium which now includes more than 150 cable and local telephone companies. Time Warner is seeking to build its own nationwide consortium, and it has already teamed up with U S West, the Denver-based regional Bell company, to build high-powered networks that offer wireless services as well as advanced video services over fiber optic and coaxial cables.
Foreign companies are not expected to be allowed to bid on the new licenses.
The new wireless services will have to compete against entrenched cellular networks, and each technology group has different advantages. The new networks will be starting from scratch with the latest in digital transmission technology, which will allow them to be far more efficient and to carry a much broader array of data and images than today's cellular systems can manage.
In theory, the newer technologies make it possible to accommodate 20 times as many customers as traditional cellular technology on the same number of radio frequencies. That should cut a network operator's cost per subscriber to a small fraction of cellular's costs -- and translate into lower prices for customers.
But the start-up costs are still astronomical. Arthur D. Little, the consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that the construction costs for a network serving Chicago will cost about $140 million.
Nationwide, billions will be necessary. MCI has said it can build a nationwide network for $8 billion to $10 billion -- not counting the hundreds of millions that may have to be bid for a nationwide collection of licenses -- and the company's executives have already budgeted $1 billion to $2 billion of MCI's own money for the effort.
In many cases, the new personal communications services will be able to exist alongside many current users, but the total capacity of the new wireless services would be constrained.
For current cellular companies, the biggest advantage is their huge head start. They already offer voice communication services and are racing to link their systems into nationwide networks that can patch calls to customers wherever they roam.

THE AIRWAVES
 The F.C.C. is setting aside blocks of radio frequencies, more than three times the amount now devoted to cellular telephone service, for a broad family of new portable telephone and computer services.
 
THE LICENSES
 More than 2,500 licenses are to be awarded by the F.C.C.
 Two licenses will be awarded for each of 47 "major trading areas" on the continental United States and Hawaii. In addition, four other areas will each receive two regional licenses: Alaska; Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands; Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.
 Within the 51 regions, there will be 492 smaller "basic trading areas," each roughly corresponding to a single metropolitan area. Five licenses will be awarded for each basic trading area.
 
THE BIDDING
 By next June, the F.C.C. will begin a series of auctions. A company or group of companies can make a nationwide bid. If that bid is higher than the combined total of the highest bid in each region, a nationwide license will be granted.
 Most companies will be allowed to bid for more than one license in each market, as long as they do not acquire frequencies totaling 40 megahertz -- a swath of radio bandwidth about 60 percent bigger than today's cellular licenses. Cellular telephone companies would be limited to acquiring only 10 additional megahertz beyond the 25 megahertz covered by their current cellular licenses.
 
THE WHEREWITHAL
 The F.C.C. has proposed requiring bidders to make big non-refundable deposits -- perhaps 20 percent of the amount bid -- and to pay the remainder immediately if their bid wins. Small businesses and minority-owned companies, however, could make payments over a longer period.
 All winning bidders be required to complete networks serving at least one-third of their potential customers within five years or risk losing their licenses. EDMUND L. ANDREWS

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Nunn Says He Wants Exit Strategy Before U.S. Troops Go to Bosnia

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
As President Clinton's top national security advisers traveled to Capitol Hill to test Congressional support for sending American troops to enforce a cease-fire in Bosnia, a leading Senate Democrat said today that the Administration would have to prove that it had an exit strategy before deploying troops.
Reflecting deep anxiety among lawmakers over American involvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, "My big question will be not how do we go about it, what our goals are, but how do we get out if the parties begin fighting again?" 
 He told a group of editors and reporters for The New York Times that the United States must not repeat the mistakes made in Somalia, where a United Nations peacekeeping mission is bogged down in fighting with Somali militiamen.
"We ought to have a much better sense of what the mission is than we did in Somalia," Senator Nunn said. "That's coming back to haunt us."
He said it was not at all certain that Congress would support the deployment of American troops.
"I don't believe people have decided yet," he said. "It depends on what case is made by the Administration."
 
A High-Profile Team
 Making the case on Capitol Hill today were Secretary of State Warren Christopher; Secretary of Defense Les Aspin; Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake; Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American representative at the United Nations; and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They met in separate sessions with the House and Senate leadership and with lawmakers involved in foreign and defense policy in separate sessions.
Although the officials also discussed the peacekeeping mission in Somalia, the turmoil in Russia and the Middle East peace, the main purpose of today's meetings was to brief lawmakers on the likelihood and pace of a negotiated settlement in Bosnia, the conditions for sending American troops as part of a NATO operation to enforce the agreement and the cost of such an operation, a senior Administration official said.
Just as important, the Administration officials sought to gauge the level of political support for sending American troops into Bosnia, a mission that some lawmakers fear could become not only dangerous but also unpredictable. By sending such a high-level team to Capitol Hill, the Administration was also sending an important signal that the views of lawmakers were crucial to Mr. Clinton's decision making.
But it was not clear whether today's consultations were the beginning of a campaign to win Congressional support for eventually sending American troops to Bosnia or to lay the political groundwork to pull back in the face of widespread opposition.
After the meeting, Representative Tom Foley, the House Speaker, declined to discuss the substance of the meeting, but praised the Administration's effort "to consult fully and adequately and meaningfully with members of Congress."
 
Presenting the Facts
 Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York, said that the officials did not try to win Congressional support for deploying American troops, and that their sober presentation had left him more, rather than less, concerned.
"It wasn't so much advocacy as to make sure that all the facts were presented to us for the first time in an extensive consultation," he said in a telephone interview. "It gave us all a great deal of concern about what could be up to the road."
As the three factions in Bosnia have moved closer to agreement on a partition of the country along ethnic lines, the Administration has moved closer to having to make good on its promise to the parties and its allies that it would help enforce an agreement with American troops.
Mr. Clinton told reporters this month that he would seek the approval of Congress before agreeing to let American troops join a peacekeeping force in Bosnia -- the first time he had ever made such a vow. Mr. Clinton also stressed that such peacekeeping forces would have to be under NATO command and not United Nations control.
 
$4 Billion Operation
 In his confirmation hearing on Wednesday to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili said the overall NATO operation in Bosnia would cost $4 billion in the first year. At the end of August, the United States was $799 million in arrears in its dues at the United Nations, and with new peacekeeping assessments it will be more than $1 billion behind by the end of the month.
General Shalikashvili made a strong case for sending the peacekeeping force, which he said had a good chance of being able to succeed in its mission.
But General Powell seemed far less certain this morning, reflecting questions within the Administration about whether the mission involves unrealistic expectations.
Asked at a breakfast with military reporters today whether the American people would support sending 25,000 troops to Bosnia, he said, "I think if the mission is well understood, if it has finite limits, if there is some understanding of how long we're going to be doing it, if there is a feeling of shared sacrifice on the part of others -- others are contributing to it and we are, you know, one of many contributing to it -- and if we make that case to the American people, I think the American people will support it."
 
Nunn Wants a Detailed Map
 But Mr. Nunn said public support was not assured, asking:
"What it's going to cost? What's the projected mission? How do we exit? Do we exit if it gets to be a war rather than peacekeeping or peacemaking? If we exit, what are the conditions for getting out? If we leave, do we leave equipment for the Muslims? Leave people defenseless over there? I don't think we should. There will be a lot of questions about this."
Asked how long it would take the United States to deploy troops after the parties reached a settlement, Senator Nunn said: "I think it would be a matter of weeks. It wouldn't be overnight."
Mr. Nunn estimated that the United States probably have to pay 30 to 50 percent of the cost of the operation, or $1.2 billion to $2 billion, in the first year.
 
Albright Lists Conditions
 In a speech at the National War College earlier in the day, Ms. Albright expressed the Administration's reservations about the future of United Nations peacekeeping, proposing stiff conditions for creating peacekeeping operations and calling for a restructuring of the way the United Nations makes decisions on peacekeeping. She also said the United States was now "insisting" that certain questions be asked before the United Nations creates a one:
*Is there a real threat to international peace and security?
*Does the proposed peacekeeping mission have clear objectives and can its scope be clearly defined?
*Is a cease-fire in place and have the parties agreed to a United Nations presence?
*Are the financial and human resources to accomplish the mission available?
*Can an "end point" to participation by the United Nations be identified?
Critics of the Clinton Administration's foreign policy have suggested that the Administration was ceding too much authority to the United Nations and putting too much faith in multilateral solutions to intractable ethnic or intrastate problems.
The speech also reflected the widespread anxiety within the Administration over open-ended peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Bosnia, and Ms. Albright stressed the limits rather than the strengths of multilateralism.
 
Presenting Foreign Policy Map
 "The Berlin Wall would be upright today if we had relied on the U.N. to contain Communism," she said.
Ms. Albright's speech was the third in a series of speeches by senior Administration officials this week designed to set out the principles of American foreign policy. On Monday, Mr. Christopher outlined Administration plans to finance the Middle East peace efforts, and on Tuesday, Mr. Lake said the Administration aimed to replace the cold war policy containing the Soviet threat with one that would enlarge the family of democratic market economies.

The Economy
The F.C.C. announced rules for an auction of the nation's airwaves to provide a new generation of wireless communication services. The Government hopes to raise $10.2 billion in auctioning off as many as seven new wireless services in every American city and town, each of which could be a potential competitor to today's cellular companies by providing a broad new family of portable phones and computer services. [Page A1.]
Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America increased 20.9 percent in mid-September, with almost every auto maker posting gains over the same period a year earlier. [D3.]
 

Companies
The Travelers board approved a merger with Primerica that would create a huge and diverse financial services company. Sanford I. Weill, Primerica's chairman, sees synergies beyond using his company's Smith Barney Shearson brokerage network to sell Travelers insurance products. [D1.]
Viacom filed antitrust suits against QVC, Liberty Media and Tele-Communications in an effort to thwart their bid for Paramount, which has agreed to a merger with Viacom. [D1.] The battle for Paramount has caused a feeding frenzy among fee-hungry investment bankers, lawyers and public relations firms. [D4.]
The ailing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio is said to have attracted the interest of William I. Koch, the head of Oxbow and Kendall Square, who may be exploring a possible bid. [D1.]
Pepsico named Roger A. Enrico, a company veteran, to the new post of vice chairman. The move touched off speculation on whether Mr. Enrico was still the heir apparent. [D1.]
Value Health agreed to buy Preferred Health Care in a stock deal valued at $425 million. The merger is another sign of consolidation in a health care industry facing change. [D3.]
GPA Group and its lenders agreed on a rescue plan that leaves control of the aircraft leasing company to GE Capital. [D3.]
Mercedes-Benz will announce next week where it will build its first automobile assembly plant in the United States. [D3.]

HEADLINE: Traffic Agents Battle for Respect;
Can Blue Uniforms or Positive Ads Protect a Battered Force?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Many New Yorkers seem to view traffic-control agents as sinister troublemakers in ugly brown uniforms who exist solely to harass upstanding citizens and feather the public nest.
It seems to matter little that without parking enforcement, there would be even fewer places to park. It is but a trifling detail that without traffic tickets, lanes would be hopelessly clogged to ambulances and fire trucks. The bottom line to many New Yorkers is that parking is warfare and the enforcers are the enemy. 
 "Extremely rude is the best thing you can say," Lucius J. Riccio, the Transportation Commissioner, said of the public's treatment of his agents.
 
Enforcers Under Fire
 Actually, mere rudeness would be almost a relief. Each day, on average, at least two of the 1,500 ticket-writing agents are assaulted. Each year, a third are threatened, spit at or otherwise harassed; a tenth are assaulted outright.
Clashes on the job are so routine, in fact, that some agents are being used as subjects of a university psychologist's study of interpersonal conflict.
The Transportation Department has been campaigning on several fronts to improve the image of the department, raise the morale of agents and, most important, protect the beleaguered troops from irate motorists.
In February, a two-year-old program to replace the hated brown uniforms with spiffy police-like blue will be complete. Agents have been directed not to enforce minor technical violations that do not impede traffic. The psychologist has begun teaching agents better ways of dealing with dangerous situations. And a public-relations offensive complete with subway posters may be on the way.
So far, at least, the efforts do not seem to be having the desired effect. Assaults against agents rose from 158 in 1990 to 190 last year and are running still higher in 1993. Particularly alarming is that attacks are becoming more vicious and injuries more serious, department officials say.
Take the case of Dawn Davis, who on Sept. 13 was confronted by two men who began ranting and raving against traffic agents, although neither even had a car. One sliced her arm with a razor blade, causing a wound that required 22 stitches.
"You don't know who to trust," said Ms. Davis, who has also been hit by a car and had her jaw broken by a fist in her three years on the job. "People feel they have to hit you."
 
Agents as Fair Game
 Beyond the motorists who turn ugly or violent, traffic agents are alarmed by what they see as a broader public perception -- expressed only half in jest -- that they are fair game. A New York Post cartoon last year showed an agent flattened against a car's grille, with the caption "Motorist's Fantasy." A recent editorial in a Queens neighborhood newspaper seemed to condone violence against traffic agents. Similarly, news accounts of attacks on agents routinely ignite readers' letters in support of the attackers.
Still another example is the almost annual failure of a bill in the Legislature to stiffen sentences for those convicted of assaulting agents to the same as those for attackers of sanitation workers, dog wardens, toll takers and park rangers.
The defeated legislation would have made assaulting an agent -- now generally a misdemeanor, like any other simple assault case -- a felony and set a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment. Currently, said Edward W. Luczynski, an assistant commissioner, "assaulting an agent is usually about the same as a traffic violation," usually resulting in a fine of $300 or less.
"At a minimum, the bill's passing would be a signal to the agents that they are respectable people," said Mr. Riccio, who fumed with rage at a news conference after the legislation's most recent defeat.
The uniform change is also intended to foster respect for agents -- whose salaries start at $20,000 a year and can rise to $24,000 -- and give pause to potential attackers who might at first think they are tangling with a police officer. At the very least, the agents will no longer be confused with doormen or United Parcel Service workers.
Benjamin Ward, then the Traffic Commissioner, ordered the change to brown from blue in 1974. His goal was to make agents look less like letter carriers at a time when their enforcement powers were being expanded. But the brown uniforms quickly became distinctive of nothing but the hated function they represented, and agents came to be derided as "brownies." That the vast majority of agents are members of minority groups made this appellation doubly distasteful, department officials say.
Accordingly, officers in 1991 began spending their $400 annual uniform allowance on blue uniforms. Some immediately noticed the difference.
"I feel a lot better," said Steve Kopczynski, an eight-year veteran. "I think we get a little more respect."
Other officers say nothing has changed. "Blue, brown, it doesn't matter," said Theon Phillips.
Also underway is a pilot project in which some agents are using handheld computers to produce tickets instead of pen and pad. Agents say it makes them feel more professional, while increasing efficiency and perhaps facilitating quicker escapes.
Most helpful, perhaps, has been an effort to weed out regulations that have little to do with traffic flow, such as the requirement that cars park no more than 12 inches from the curb.
Similarly, traffic authorities have begun discussions with community boards to hear their enforcement priorities, partly in the hope of reducing hostility to agents.
The primary reasons for those changes are traffic control and community relations, but Mr. Riccio said he hopes they will also lessen abuse of agents. That might lead to better enforcement, since officials believe that agents' concerns over confrontations may be a factor in a sharp drop in the number of tickets issued last year.
Despite the drop, agents more than pay their way. In the current fiscal year, the department's payroll and benefits will total $40.5 million, while revenue from tickets is expected to reach $200 million -- $123 million this year, with the rest coming in over the next seven years.
 
Defusing Conflict
 Another new initiative grew out of research by Elizabeth Brondola, a psychologist at St. John's University, who saw agents as the perfect subjects for a study of interpersonal conflict. Among other things, she has been measuring agents' blood pressure at 15-minute intervals.
A key early result is a growing body of observations about how some agents are able to cope peacefully with situations that turn nasty for others. This appears to involve filtering out low-level annoyances, as well as an ability to make instant critical judgments, Dr. Brondola said.
Often, the agents who best handle stress cannot say why, she said. But she hopes that she and her team can learn useful techniques from watching agents' responses. The first class begins next month. Another class to help supervisors ease agents' stress has already begun.
Dr. Brondola said her goals are realistic. "There are a number of situations in which the agents in fact can do nothing," she said. "The people are sufficiently out of control that even the best conflict-management skills are not going to help the person calm down."
Another tactic the department is exploring is public relations, though funds are scarce. Tom Jelliffe, assistant commissioner, hopes to create an "image enhancement campaign," with radio spots and subway ads. The goal, he said, would be to "create a constituency for the service we provide." One possible message: Agents are not paid by the ticket.
Meanwhile, the agents' war stories pile up. One officer tells of being assaulted by a priest wearing his clerical collar; another tells of being taken to the hospital with broken bones and discovering that his X-ray technician was his attacker.
Many say that police officers do not do enough to help or protect the agents. "They talk down to you and make you feel like you're nothing," said Felice North, an agent in Queens. "And people figure if the cops can do it, they can, too."
Despite the hardships and indignities, the poor economy and tight job market are prompting agents to stay on the job twice as long, on average, as they used to four years ago.
Mostly, agents say, they would just like a little respect. "They are somebody's family member, somebody's neighbor," said Mr. Luczynski. "They go to church and Little League. They're human beings like every other citizen of the city."

HEADLINE: After Big Gains, Angolan Rebel Offensive Is Halted

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GANDA, Angola, Sept. 17

 BODY:
After months of euphoric advances in which his guerrillas extended their reach over more than two-thirds of Angola's territory, the rebel movement of Jonas Savimbi appears to have been fought to a standstill, and in some places turned back, by a rebounding Government army.
Here on the embattled central plateau that is Mr. Savimbi's political base and the war's greatest symbolic prize, the Government has expelled the insurgents from several towns conquered during their great surge, and is slowly amassing troops and weapons for a promised major offensive. 
 But while the tide may have turned again in Angola's relentless civil war, neither a decisive military outcome nor a diplomatic settlement appears to be within reach.
 
Long Standoff Seen
 Officials and diplomats in Luanda, the capital, say the country seems doomed to months or years more of a lethal standoff that has already created some of the most wretched pockets of misery in Africa and demolished what little remained of the Angolan economy.
The prevailing view of diplomats and military analysts is that the Government has not yet mustered the strength to throw a knockout punch. Mr. Savimbi, in turn, is considered largely immune to diplomatic pressures, such as the United Nations Security Council's threat on Sept. 15 to declare an oil and arms embargo unless the rebels stop fighting and show signs of accepting their defeat in elections a year ago.
"We're looking at a protracted stalemate," said a Western military expert in Luanda. "The most realistic hope is that the Government can eventually push Savimbi back to where the country has a degree of normalcy, but with a guerrilla threat continuing indefinitely."
By most accounts, the last year of war has been the most punishing in 30 years of fighting -- first against Portuguese colonialists, then, after independence in 1975, between rival Angolan factions, armed and abetted by the superpowers. The patrons of Mr. Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known by its Portuguese acronymn, Unita, were the United States and South Africa
Since Mr. Savimbi spurned the election outcome and led his guerrillas back into the bush, an estimated 50,000 people have been killed, and 2 million more of the country's 12 million people have fled the fighting to crowded city slums and refugee camps.
The rebels' swift advances isolated many cities and towns that were not disturbed in the earlier bush war, disrupting food supplies and raising fears of famine.
 
Government Massing Troops
 The Government has been massing forces on two fronts: one just north of Luanda, where the main targets are the rebel-held oil town of Soyo and two northern provincial capitals, the other at a Cuban-built air base in Catumbela, on the Atlantic coast. From that base the army directs its advance toward Huambo, Angola's second-largest city and Mr. Savimbi's headquarters.
"Huambo has no military value," conceded Gen. Armando da Cruz Neto, the commander of the central front, in an interview. "But it has great psychological value for Savimbi."
In the field, the only noticeable impact of diplomatic maneuvering is to set off periodic struggles for position, in the event a cease-fire takes hold.
Just outside Ganda, a highland agricultural town that is as close as reporters are allowed to the front line, rebels attacked from behind the eucalyptus trees early Thursday morning.
Col. Jose Manuel de Sousa, the 30-year-old commander whose troops had recaptured Ganda from the rebels just a month ago, said the attackers were routed with heavy losses. But the fact that they could muster such an attack behind Government lines reflects the see-saw nature of the battle.
Despite his party's reputation for corruption, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, a colorless petroleum engineer, won the elections last year by running as the peacemaker against the bellicose, charismatic Mr. Savimbi.
The demobilization and elections were sparsely monitored by international observers, and it soon became obvious that while the Government's battle-weary army had virtually collapsed, Mr. Savimbi had kept plenty of firepower in reserve.
Denouncing the election as a fraud, he ordered his 30,000 guerrillas back into the bush, and salvaged the heavy weapons he had secretly cached. This time he has tended to portray his war less as an anti-Communist crusade and more as a defense of his minority Ovimbundu people, although the Ovimbundus are sharply divided in this war.
Mr. Savimbi's forces gobbled up territory far beyond what the rebels had held during the earlier war. He is still estimated to have loose control of about 65 percent of Angola's land area, including 4 of 18 provincial capitals and roughly a third of the population.
He conquered the important diamond fields of Lunda Norte province, menaced the outskirts of Luanda with hit-and-run attacks and in March, after an eight-week battle in which thousands died, he took Huambo.
"If Unita was going to win the war militarily, their chance was between October and April," said a Western military expert. "They didn't do it."
Slowly the Government has built a new army from inexperienced teen-age conscripts, and distributed assault rifles to thousands of urban civilians.
Western officials believe the Government has already mortgaged its oil income for the next three years to raise money for weapons.
 
Besieged Provincial Capital
 The fiercest fighting of the renewed war now centers on the provincial capital of Cuito, northeast of Huambo, where 2,000 Government troops have held out since January.
Government radio broadcasts from the besieged city tell of dogs devouring unburied corpses in the streets.
The United States, after supporting Mr. Savimbi for years, recognized the dos Santos Government in May, but some Angolan officials are bitter that this has not brought military help.
"In my opinion the United States does not want to abandon the monster it created," asserted Reis Esteves, the Vice Governor of Benguela province.
"We didn't create Savimbi," retorted an American official, when asked about American responsibility for the situation. "We may have rented him for a couple of years, but I don't believe we owned him." Washington, the official added, has no popular mandate for any deeper involvement in Angola.
It is generally believed Mr. Savimbi uses money from his captured diamonds to buy black market weapons, bringing them in through neighboring Zaire and Namibia.
A United Nations embargo, diplomats in Angola say, might raise the price of his weapons, but would not cut off his access to arms merchants.
As for diplomacy, neither Mr. Savimbi nor the Government has shifted position since the last peace talks ended in failure in May.
Margaret Anstee, then the United Nations special envoy to Angola, now retired, has said the talks might have succeeded if the United Nations had been willing to invest in a small, symbolic presence of peacekeeping troops.
But other participants in the talks said Mr. Savimbi would not agree to withdraw from territories he captured after the election.
The Government, in turn, flatly rejects any settlement that allows Mr. Savimbi to keep his gains.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: Interest Groups;
Lobbyists of Every Stripe Turning to the Grass Roots on Health Care

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Anheuser-Busch is outfitting its trucks with placards urging Bud drinkers to dial 1-800-BEER-TAX. Thousands of consumers have responded and then received pamphlets describing how the Clinton health care overhaul could drain their pockets if it includes "sin taxes."
IVAC Corporation, a San Diego-based company that manufactures intravenous pumps, has set up a telephone bank staffed by 20 employees to call other health industry workers and urge them to write to their representatives to oppose proposals to limit hospitals' access to medical technology. 
 It is all part of a frenetic nationwide effort to mobilize citizens that has picked up speed since President Clinton's speech on Wednesday night. Tonight, for instance, he went to Tampa, Fla., to take part in a special edition of the ABC News program "Nightline," in which the President fielded questions about his plan at a town hall meeting. [Page A21.]
And it is also emblematic of the changes that have transformed the old lobbying arts of political arm-twisting into a more populist enterprise.
"It's the largest mobilization since the establishment of Social Security," said Frank Mankiewicz, a former Kennedy Administration official who is a partner at Hill & Knowlton Inc., a public relations firm that is lobbying for the Medical Rehabilitation Education Foundation. "I have the feeling the big-name lobbyists will mean less."
 
From All Walks of Life
 Lobbyists successfully turned to the grass roots in this year's budget battle, when the oil industry mobilized constituents in oil-producing states with high-priced advertising campaigns to urge their lawmakers to vote against higher energy taxes. Now special interest groups have an issue on which they can find spokesmen from all walks of life, from all over the country.
Hundreds of R. J. Reynolds employees, for instance, volunteered to take vacation time this spring to travel to Washington and, with some guidance from the company, lobbied the North Carolina Congressional delegation against higher cigarette taxes.
Because health care is so large an industry and affects virtually every American, competing citizen armies appear to be emerging. AIDS activists are staging 1960's-style street theaters. Doctors are raising their concerns to patients during physical examinations. And members of Congress say they don't have the time to schedule all the face-to-face meetings that have been requested from dance therapists, masseurs, chiropractors and podiatrists, armed with scripted palm cards from one trade association or another.
Much of the grass-roots pressure is being artificially stirred. Pharmaceutical companies, for instance, are writing to their shareholders warning them that profits could suffer if price controls impede drug research. Planned Parenthood is encouraging its members to deluge Congress with a post-card campaign demanding that abortion, prenatal care and estrogen replacement therapy are covered under a proposed insurance blanket.
But there are also signs that spontaneous grass-roots lobbying is also beginning to catch fire. Stationery store owners, restaurateurs and other small business owners, who face the prospect of having to pay for health care coverage of their lower-wage employees for the first time, are flocking to Capitol Hill from all over the country.
"The telephone lines are burning up," said Representative Mel Reynolds, a freshman Democrat from Chicago who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
 
Balancing Concerns
 Mr. Reynolds said owners of eight Mom-and-Pop groceries accompanied by a tobacco industry lobbyist came into his district office last week to warn that higher cigarette taxes would cost them sales and force them to lay off workers. "When constituents come in like that, it gives you a moment of pause to think," he said.
But Mr. Reynolds said he would still support the "sin tax" because his inner-city constituents "die disproportionately from cigarette smoking."
Still, major interest groups like the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians are spending millions of dollars hiring lobbyists. Political action committees linked to groups like the American Medical Association, the National Association of Life Underwriters and the American Dental Association have greatly increased their campaign contributions to lawmakers of both parties with the intention of increasing their access and influence.
Most of the special interests are diversifying their strategies, to drive home different messages inside and outside the Beltway. Pfizer Inc., for instance, is offering a new drug giveaway program for people not covered by insurance.
 
Passing the Word
 At the same time, four Pfizer executives recently sent checks totaling $5,000 to Senator Orrin G. Hatch for his legal defense fund. The influential Republican from Utah is facing an Ethics Committee investigation into his efforts to help a business associate obtain a loan from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed amid charges of fraud.
The Health Insurance Association of America, a coalition representing commercial health insurers, enlisted Bill Gradison, a former Republican Congressman who was popular with his colleagues, to lead their lobbying.
But the major emphasis of their campaign is glossy advertising and grass-roots organizing. The organization has set up an "800" number and telephone bank to get out their message that the Clinton plan would mean higher insurance premiums and fewer health care choices for consumers. It is also encouraging insurance sales people to give their clients literature that says the Clinton plan could raise their taxes and enmesh them in regulatory red tape.
 
Ads and More Ads
 The association quickly attracted the ire of competing special interest groups because of a television advertisement it ran showing a young couple sitting over their kitchen table grumbling that the President's plan will grant Government bureaucrats powers that will serve to limit their choices of doctors and insurance plans.
"The Government may force us to pick from a few health-care plans designed by Government bureaucrats," the spot said. "If we let the Government choose, we lose."
The commercial was run before Mr. Clinton even announced his program, inciting the Democratic National Committee to air a competing commercial accusing the insurance industry of jumping the gun and using scare tactics to protect profits.
 
The Kitchen Table
 The brouhaha developed into a case of dueling interest groups. The Health Care Reform Project assembled what it called a "truth squad" to urge local insurance companies to use their influence on the association to pull the commercial, which they did today.
Charles N. Kahn 3d, executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America, denied that his group dropped the commercial under pressure. "We felt the ad served its purpose," he said.
The Health Care Reform Project is planning its own advertising campaign, one that is likely to be friendlier to the Administration. Formed by a coalition of such diverse organizations as the A.F.L.-C.I.O., American Airlines and the League of Women Voters, the group hopes to encourage a Congressional compromise by organizing town hall meetings for members of Congress. They hope to build a consensus around some compromise for slowing the inflation rate for medical care and covering the 37 million who are uninsured.
The American Association of Retired Persons, one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington, has begun an advertising campaign to include coverage of prescription drugs and long-term care in the health insurance overhaul. But in an exercise of participatory democracy, the A.A.R.P. will not take a firm position on the Clinton plan until after it holds town hall meetings to solicit the opinions of its members.
"This thing will be won or lost around the kitchen tables around the country," said John Rother, the A.A.R.P.'s chief lobbyist. "If people say it's too complicated and don't get involved, then its Gucci Gulch -- the high-priced lobbyists, through their campaign financing -- who will prevail."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The H.M.O.'s;
Health Professionals Brace for a New Age

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Sept. 23

 BODY:
No group was listening more intently to President Clinton's appeal to the nation to adopt a sweeping program that would guarantee all Americans health insurance than the professionals in the health care fields. Mr. Clinton is proposing nothing less than an upheaval in the way one-seventh of the American economy operates. These are some of the immediate reactions to the President's speech on Wednesday night from doctors with a health maintenance organization, insurance company executives and medical students.
 
 
The Faithful Hear the Sermon
 Sixteen years ago, newly married and embarking on their life's work, Dr. Sharon Levine and Dr. Jay Crosson decided to abandon the prestige and perquisites of East Coast medicine and head for Northern California, where the modern health maintenance organization was born.
"The question for the next two decades was not going to be what was the newest therapy," said Dr. Crosson, who was one of 50 executives and policy analysts from the nation's largest H.M.O. who gathered here on Wednesday to watch President Clinton address Congress. "The major question was going to be how were we going to deliver the health care we already had." 
 If ever there was a choir to preach to, it was here at Kaiser Permanente's regional headquarters and the crowd was hushed and attentive as Mr. Clinton spoke. Those who stayed after work to watch the President listened to a recitation of health care principles that had long been their credo. Even though Mr. Clinton did not mention them by name, they knew that the Kaiser model was the heart and soul of his formulation.
"He touched people where they live to move them where he wants them to go," Dr. Levine said. "The six principles he's identified are absolutely right. This is not a medium to deliver the details but a medium to approach a broad group of people and I think he did that very effectively." For years, the H.M.O. model, pioneered by Kaiser, drew fierce opposition from the mainstream medical community, which barred Kaiser doctors from joining professional organizations and practicing in most hospitals. But that gradually gave way to grudging admiration, and lately to Presidential acclaim.
It is a source of gratification, Dr. Levine said, to be cited by the President, his wife and their squad of health care planners as a prototype for national reform. "But at the same time," she said, "it's a real trumpet call to do what we do even better because people are looking at us."
What Kaiser does is deliver relatively low-cost health care to 6.6 million Americans, 16 percent of those enrolled in H.M.O.'s across the nation. It is the predominant provider of health care in Northern California. Each member pays a fixed fee (between $130 and $150 a month for an individual and between $340 and $400 for a family of three).
Under President Clinton's health plan, which encourages the use of prepaid health plans rather than fee-for-service medicine, very little would change here at Kaiser. Dr. Crosson, an executive with the regional medical group as well as a practising pediatrician, said that Kaiser would be likely to expand greatly under the Clinton plan and get more involved in training others.
The uneasiness elsewhere in the nation over the proposal dates to a bygone idea of health care, Dr. Crosson said. "Most people have grown up with a clear vision of what medicine is about," he said. "It's one physician, and it was usually a him, practicing by himself in a small office with a nurse."
But with technological advance, Dr. Crosson said, "the black bag could not hold all the tools of the trade, the small office could not contain all the tests and interventions a patient could need." Thus group practices became more common and "the new challenge became how to deliver that complicated care in a way that's still personal."
Dr. Levine, also an executive and a pediatrician, said the fear that a large, prepaid system diminishes the quality of care disappeared quickly among new Kaiser patients, who have their own doctors, just as they did before. "The loyalty I have to my patients and my patients have to me exists outside the payment system," she said.
Fear also disappears quickly for new Kaiser doctors, Dr. Levine said, who discover the pleasure and challenge of practicing in a system where "physicians are taught from Day 1 to talk about the art of medicine, the science of medicine and the business of medicine" and where each member of a group practice has the responsibility to make cost-conscious decisions.
Dr. Levine said 50 percent of the new Kaiser doctors in the last three years have come from fee-for-service practices. "The word on the street has changed," she said. "Our success is now accepted as legitimate."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: Principles;
Experts' Grades: 'A' in Security, 'C' in Simplicity, 'D+' in Savings

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
In proclaiming six principles as "guiding stars" on the journey to health care reform, President Clinton set forth a benchmark to measure the plan he presented to Congress on Wednesday. By those standards, he is being given high marks for some parts of his health plan and low marks for others.
Consumer advocates, economists and health policy experts said today that they generally accepted Mr. Clinton's principles as criteria by which to judge health care legislation. The six principles, in the shorthand used by Mr. Clinton, are security, simplicity, savings, choice, quality and responsibility. 
 Experts analyzing Mr. Clinton's plan agreed that it would go far toward providing security of health insurance coverage for all Americans. Under his proposal, people would be assured of coverage even if they lost their jobs or had a history of medical problems.
But Mr. Clinton's proposal received a mixed grade on another criterion, simplicity, and a comparatively low mark on a third, savings.
The current health care system is immensely complex. The President said he would simplify life for consumers by establishing a uniform package of health benefits and a standard insurance claim form, in place of hundreds now used by different insurance companies.
"For consumers, it will be simpler than the current system," said Edwin S. Rothschild, a spokesman for Citizen Action, a consumer group with three million members.
But in other ways Mr. Clinton would make the system even more complicated. He would create new agencies and a complex new apparatus to buy insurance. There would be regional health alliances, health plans, a powerful National Health Board, a new Federal advisory committee to assess the reasonableness of new drug prices and a new Government agency to decide the number of young doctors entering each medical specialty.
Theodore R. Marmor, a professor at the Yale School of Organization and Management, said: "Simplicity is the Administration's standard for reform, but its proposal is incredibly complicated. The President's plan is a fragile Rube Goldberg contraption."
The process of setting and enforcing a national health budget, as described in White House documents, is exceedingly complex. It involves rate-setting mechanisms, "weighted-average premiums," inflation factors and a "base-line per capita budget" for each alliance.
 
Skepticism on Savings
 Prof. Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, said the Clinton plan "would produce some administrative savings and would substantially reduce administrative hassles."
"What the insurance industry burns up in commissions, marketing and claims processing costs is almost unspeakable," said Mr. Reinhardt. "Clinton would reduce those costs."
But there is still widespread skepticism that the Government could squeeze as much money out of the system as the President contends. On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton defended the numbers he had used to estimate the cost of his proposals. But on Capitol Hill, some lawmakers said today that Mr. Clinton made David A. Stockman and Richard G. Darman look like amateurs in the use of "smoke and mirrors" to balance the budget.
Mr. Stockman, as budget director for President Ronald Reagan, and Mr. Darman, in the Bush Administration, were repeatedly criticized by Democrats who said they used overly optimistic economic assumptions and underestimated Federal budget deficits.
If Mr. Clinton's program is not adequately financed, the guarantee of "health security" could be compromised because there would not be enough money to pay for all the promised benefits.
Another principle cited by Mr. Clinton was choice. Many people, especially the uninsured, would have more choices under Mr. Clinton's plan than they do now. But many others would have fewer choices. There would be strong incentives for people to join health maintenance organizations or other networks that limit their ability to select doctors and hospitals.
Consumers could select a traditional fee-for-service health plan, offering free choice of doctors and hospitals, but they would probably have to pay more. Senator Paul D. Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, said, "Many Americans would not be able to afford the health plans that offer free choice of doctors and other health care providers."
Bill Gradison, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group for commercial insurers, said that Mr. Clinton would eliminate a choice that consumers now have. Under the President's proposal, consumers and small businesses would not buy coverage directly from insurers, but would have to go through purchasing cooperatives known as regional health alliances, he said.
The alliances could thus restrict insurers' access to potential customers. Insurers, Republican lawmakers and conservative Democrats say the alliances should not have such power. "By giving so much regulatory power to the alliances, Clinton's plan will undermine the competition we are trying to promote," said Representative Michael A. Andrews, Democrat of Texas.
Mr. Clinton wants to issue "report cards" allowing consumers to evaluate and compare the performance of competing health plans, doctors and hospitals. These data would presumably enable consumers to make more intelligent choices. But other parts of Mr. Clinton's proposal, including significant cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid and strict Government limits on private health insurance premiums, could adversely affect the quality of care, consumer advocates and health care executives say.
Michele A. Davis, an economist at Citizens for a Sound Economy, which advocates conservative policies, said Mr. Clinton's plan would force insurers and H.M.O.'s to ration care to survive under federally established premium caps. And Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, warned that Federal limits on new drug prices "threatens to squelch research and development" that may produce cures for various cancers, AIDS, multiple sclerosis and other diseases.
The last of the principles cited by the President was responsibility. Mr. Clinton would create new financial incentives for consumers to take responsibility for their health care. Employees are now often insulated from the true cost because employers pay most of it. But under Mr. Clinton's plan, consumers who choose costly health plans would pay more, and those who choose less expensive plans would pay less.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Nike stumbles amid a pack of troubles in its market.

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky

 BODY:
HALFWAY through the 400-meter final at the world track and field championships last month in Stuttgart, Germany, Quincy Watts's left shoe fell apart. With his heel flapping, the American runner finished fourth in the race.
While this was bad enough for Mr. Watts, the 1992 Olympic champion, it was ghastly luck for Nike Inc., the athletic apparel company that made his shoes and prides itself as being the worldwide leader in marketing shoes for runners. 
 Yet a broken shoe could not have been a more fitting symbol for the company at the moment. Just as unusual heat on the track might have softened the glue that held Mr. Watts's shoe together, an unusual confluence of events has helped cut Nike's stock price nearly in half in less than a year.
In late November, Nike class B shares traded at $90.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. After an announcement this week that earnings for the first quarter fell by 7 percent from a year earlier, the class B shares closed at $46.50 yesterday.
Of all the factors for Nike's decline, several are worth noting for investment guidance.
Foremost is economic trouble in Europe, especially in Germany and France, where unemployment has steadily increased in the last year: in Germany, from 6.5 percent in October to 8 percent in July; in France, from 10.3 to 11.7 percent over the same period.
Track stars like Mr. Watts enjoy much greater celebrity in Europe than they do in the United States, where track and field is considered a minor sport.
"Especially among those 18 to 30 years old," said Willard Brown, a stock analyst for Dean Witter, Discover & Company in Boston. "That's Nike's target audience."
But as much as Europeans yearn to run -- or dress -- as Mr. Watts does in athletic shoes that can be priced at $75 or more, hard times may mean making do with an old pair of shoes, and that has affected Nike. Its international sales of athletic shoes fell 10 percent for the first quarter, and sales of athletic apparel fell 13 percent.
Another factor has been the American market for athletic shoes. While Nike still commands the dominant position, with 33 percent of a market approaching $2 billion, Reebok International Ltd. continues to make a formidable challenge. Reebok holds about 25 percent of the market and seeks to grow with new directions in advertising and promotion.
Last week, Reebok switched advertising agencies, consolidating its $140 million worldwide brand account with the Leo Burnett Company of Chicago and leaving Chiat/Day, which had done impressive work with the Dan and Dave campaign last year, among others. A Reebok vice president said the move was made to help make Reebok "a world global brand."
Another factor is more difficult to quantify but is not so hard to spot: the growing popularity of the grunge look among young people. Torn trousers, frayed shirts and clunky boots are now fashion icons, not symbols of spare living. Doc Martens, the British working-class boots popularized by Madonna, among others, have played a major role in the trend. Those boots and mountain boots, chukka boots and military boots are replacing athletic shoes as the favorite choice of many youths for everyday wear.
For all its problems, Nike has made an indelible mark on the popular culture with its promotional admonition "Just Do It," a phrase that has rocked more than a few people out of a sedentary life style. In Stuttgart, it was amended to "Just Glue It," and the same might be true for the company's finances until more favorable conditions return.

HEADLINE: A Vow to Keep Battling Gambling Laws

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MERIDEN, Conn., Sept. 22

 BODY:
The roulette wheel was gone, confiscated by the police last weekend, but Paul Giacobbe sat at a table in his restaurant with a handful of gambling chips made of chocolate and vowed to continue challenging state laws that prohibit gambling.
Mr. Giacobbe created a stir last week when he announced he would operate a roulette wheel in the banquet room of Jacoby's, the East Main Street restaurant he has owned here for 21 years. 
 The authorities seized his roulette wheel even before the gambling began, but he said he was not giving up his fight, and said he planned to bring back another roulette wheel or some other game of chance.
 
Opposes a Monopoly
 Mr. Giacobbe is upset with what he calls a monopoly on gambling in the state by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians, who operate the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino on their reservation in Ledyard.
"I'm just fed up with not having the same right as the Indians," Mr. Giacobbe said. "It's an unfair advantage for them, and every restaurant owner in the state is being hurt by it." He said that the combination of the casino and the recession had cut his business in half.
Even though Ledyard is more than 75 miles away, the casino is hurting his business, Mr. Giacobbe insists. "People who used to come in here all the time on weekends tell me they're up at the casino now," he said. "Look, this is a small state and everybody's being hurt by it."
Mr. Giacobbe and his lawyer, John Donovan of Meriden, say he has a legal right to operate a roulette wheel as long as he does not profit from the game's operation.
 
The 'Roulette Club'
 Mr. Donovan says that because Mr. Giacobbe established "the Connecticut Roulette Club," with about 90 people signed up for $1 annual memberships, he is adhering to state laws that only require a bona fide social relationship to exist among the gamblers for it to be a legal activity as long as there is no house profit.
"With no house profit, no law has been broken and we will demand the return of all the equipment seized by the police," Mr. Donovan said.
State authorities say that is not going to happen. In fact, they say that Mr. Giacobbe faces possible criminal charges and could face up to a year in jail because the mere possession of gambling equipment is against state law. Even charitable organizations that run Las Vegas nights must apply for permits, said the New Haven County State's Attorney, Michael Dearington.
"The fact is, he broke the law, you cannot possess or operate a roulette wheel," Mr. Dearington said. "If he thinks he is being treated unfairly, he should pursue it through legal channels, not by setting up an illegal activity." Mr. Dearington said his office is still considering whether to prosecute Mr. Giacobbe for criminal activity.
Gerald Langlais, director of the State Department of Liquor Control, said his office was awaiting a decision by the State's Attorney as well. He said he could not remember an establishment openly publicizing its intention to offer gambling.
Paul Bernstein, manager of the state's Charitable Game Section of the Division of Special Revenue, which issues permits to charitable groups, organizations and clubs that wish to operate Las Vegas nights, bazaars and raffles, says Mr. Giacobbe has clearly broken the law. He said a permit can only be issued to a nonprofit group after it has been in existence at least two years. Even then, groups are only permitted to hold four Las Vegas nights a year, Mr. Bernstein said.
"I don't see how he has a leg to stand on," Mr. Bernstein said. "There is nothing in the state statutes that would allow him to operate a roulette wheel in his restaurant."
But the people who showed up to play roulette at Jacoby's last weekend say they want the right to gamble without making the 90-minute drive to Ledyard.
"I like to gamble and I should be able to do it locally," said William Tomkiewicz of Berlin, who despite winning the state's $3 million lottery in 1989 said he still enjoys gambling and signed up to play in Mr. Giacobbe's roulette club.
Cindy Hebert of Middletown said that although she is not a gambler, she joined the club because "it would be fun to have a drink and play some roulette."
"I don't see how they can stop him from trying to compete with the Indians," she said.
Mr. Giacobbe said the state should just give him and other restaurateurs the same opportunity as the Pequots.
"Look, I just want to be able to play on the same field as the Indians," he said. "I've had a tough time with the recession and I feel I have a right to do the same thing they're doing in Ledyard to help my business."

HEADLINE: In Microcosm, New Jersey Senate Race Tests Party Power

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EWING TOWNSHIP, N.J., Sept. 23

 BODY:
If any legislative district could stand for all New Jersey, the capital region's 15th is it. Here, the Trenton poor and the Princeton Ivy Leaguers vote Democratic, the prosperous business suburbanites favor Republicans, and Gerald R. Stockman and Richard J. LaRossa are struggling in a Senate race for the same shifting middle that will probably decide the race for governor as well.
For Democrats like Mr. Stockman and Gov. Jim Florio, the 15th was once considered so safe a seat that Mr. Stockman, then a 10-year incumbent State Senator, was chosen to sponsor Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990. The next year, Mr. La Rossa harnessed anger over the taxes to his fame as the man who called the state lottery results on television and won a humbling upset over Mr. Stockman. It was a defeat that the state Democrats ardently want to reverse.
 
'Not Something I Brag About'
 "This was the most Democratic district in the state until I lost," Mr. Stockman, a 57-year-old trial lawyer, said recently as he doggedly worked the sidewalks and front porches of Trenton's West Ward. "It's not something I brag about." Indeed, Mr. La Rossa is the first Republican to represent the city of Trenton in the Senate since 1946, the year, he likes to point out, when he was born. 
 Now, three years after the tax increase and after two years of Republican control of the Legislature, the tax issue that once cut like a knife through New Jersey politics has become a duller and more ambiguous memory to many voters.
For some, the memory was revived by the three-year plan to cut income taxes by 30 percent announced Tuesday by Christine Todd Whitman, Mr. Florio's Republican challenger. At the same time, the Whitman proposal seemed to to harden positions instead of shifting them, as well as to stir uneasy memories of the aftermath of other tax cuts.
In what could turn out to be a lesson-laden preview of how Mrs. Whitman's proposal might turn out, many voters still talk about how the Republican legislative majority rolled back a one-cent Florio sales-tax increase last year. Today, people in the 15th seem to be talking more about the state-employee layoffs that followed than about the tax savings.
"People certainly weren't happy with the $2.8 billion tax increase, but then again they weren't so happy about the one cent they did roll back, because it put so many people out of work just when the economy was bad," said Jack Ball, the two-term Republican Mayor of Ewing, Mr. La Rossa's home township. "So I think for a lot of people, getting that penny back wasn't as important is keeping people working."
Mayor Ball helped nominate Senator LaRossa in 1991, but says he believes Mr. LaRossa double-crossed him by supporting a rival in the Mayor's losing re-election primary race this summer. Now Mr. Ball plans to become an independent, and will vote for Mr. Stockman.
 
Concern for G.M. Plant
 In the Cadwalader Heights section of Trenton, meanwhile, Edith Lieber recently lost the first prospective buyer for her house in five years. The deal fell through earlier this year after General Motors announced it would close its Ewing parts plant, which would idle 2,000 workers, including her prospective buyer. The township is trying to save the plant, which is still operating with a reduced staff.
Mrs. Lieber, a widow, is also firmly for Mr. Stockman, because, she said, Mrs. Whitman's tax cuts would shift the burden to homeowners, a point Trenton's Mayor, Douglas H. Palmer, has been pounding home.
"Our property taxes are already so high, we just feel like we're stuck," she said. "If Mrs. Whitman cuts the income tax, who's going to make up the difference?"
But in West Windsor, where new suburban developments and new high-technology factories are nestled among the cornfields at the 15th's northeast corner, Arthur Kaminer, a self-employed reinsurance consultant, said he was with Mr. LaRossa and Mrs. Whitman to the end.
 
'Taxes Are Too High'
 "Politicians can explain things a million different ways to make it look like it's not their fault," he said at the Princeton Junction train station on Wednesday as he waited for the commuter run to New York. "Florio is a master at it. But what we need are people who can stay focused on the main problem, which is that taxes are too high to keep businesses going in New Jersey, and I think Mrs. Whitman is on to that."
West Windsor is a LaRossa stronghold, a township he won two-to-one over Mr. Stockman in 1991.
The other townships in the 15th -- New Jersey state legislative districts do not cut township lines -- unfold to the west and south. "The Princetons," township and borough, arehome to liberal academics and a cadre of campaign volunteers from the college dorms that helped Mr. Stockman roll up a two-to-one margin there over Mr. LaRossa.
Below Princeton is Lawrence Township, also coming to be known as Lawrenceville, a mix of new and old Trenton suburbs, and in this year's elections a toss-up. Ewing, heavily blue-collar, is home to thousands of state employees who are angry at Governor Florio's layoffs but perhaps worried about further cuts under a Republican. It was Senator LaRossa's power base two years ago.
 
Son of Trenton Detective
 At the south end of the district lies Trenton, Mr. Stockman's hometown, where he still lives.
Mr. LaRossa, whose father, Mickey LaRossa, was a much-loved Trenton detective, has worked hard in Trenton's heavily Italian, working-class South and East wards to undercut Mr. Stockman there. If early election returns show him running ahead there, Senator LaRossa says, the Democrats will be in trouble.
Like Mr. Florio, Mr. Stockman is a longtime Democrat, a Roman Catholic, a lawyer-politician with roots in New Jersey's fading urban centers. To explain his candidacy, he speaks sentiments about "giving something back to society," and seems to know more people on Trenton's streets than the people who live there.
Mr. LaRossa, a professional singer with a performer's personality, had received almost all his recognition from spending 11 years calling the state's weekly lottery drawing on television before succeeding in his first campaign for office in 1991. He runs without a political history and often seemingly without a label, criticizing politics-as-usual among Republicans and Democrats equally. He has already set his eyes on a higher prize than the 15th District.
"People are desperate; they're fed up with the usual political bull," he said. "If Jim Florio gets back in, I think you'll see Dick LaRossa's name in the governor's race in four years." He is making no allowance for losing in November.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS UNEQUIPPED TO DISARM A-BOMBS

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Federal Government is facing enormous technical challenges in disassembling the nation's nuclear arsenal and is ill prepared for the job, according to a report released yesterday by the Office of Technology Assessment.
The costs of the effort may already have reached $1 billion a year, the study found, but the job has been slowed because there is no more storage space for plutonium. The office, an arm of Congress, also said the delays were caused by a lack of national policy on what should be done with nuclear fuels -- plutonium and highly enriched uranium -- and by a lack of attention to the problem on the part of the White House. 
 Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who asked for the study last year, said yesterday that the report showed that the current management team, consisting of the Departments of Energy and Defense and the National Security Council, "is designed to supervise the nuclear arms race and not to end it."
Dismantling the arsenal, the Senator said at a news conference in Washington, will require environmental sensitivity and safeguards against material going astray, rather than expertise in the military use of weapons. "Unfortunately, the ability of our cold-war-created bureaucracies to respond to these changes is proving slow and disjointed," he said.
 
Ending Much Secrecy
 Senator Glenn, who is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said the report "raises serious questions" about meeting the weapons-disassembly schedules laid out in agreements with the former Soviet Union.
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said in a phone interview yesterday that the study portrayed the department as it operated in the Bush Administration, and that new personnel, including two from the Office of Technology Assessment, would prove more able than their predecessors.
Mrs. O'Leary noted that the report criticized the department for continuing to keep secret many of the details about its nuclear bomb fuel. But she said that since May her department had been working to declassify material and that in the next month, "substantial information will be available."
The report comes as the Energy Department is trying to decide what parts of its weapons production complex to close and what parts to preserve. Those decisions, which have attracted far more attention than the problems of weapons disposal, are sure to be heavily affected by the need to store tons of bomb materials that will remain highly radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years.
 
Turnabout in Agency's Mission
 The report hinted strongly that it was time to bring other agencies and public oversight into the process. While not making explicit recommendations, the report said the Department of Energy's Office of Defense programs "may not be well suited to carry out the new nonmilitary mission."
"Historically, its activities have been subject to minimal regulation," the report stated. "Its operations have been conducted in secret, and it has not sought or welcomed public involvement or been concerned about the international implications of its actions. Its priorities continue to be maintaining the warhead stockpile."
But Mrs. O'Leary said that "handing off" the problem to another agency would delay the process by years.
The report says Government efforts so far have not been adequate because of weak management at the Department of Energy and a lack of public trust in the agency. Mrs. O'Leary said she was working to build trust by increasing outside input.
The report also noted that the technologies available for dismantling warheads and storing nuclear materials are quite limited. Russia, which faces a similar task, has even fewer resources and faces problems its government considers more pressing, the report said.
 
Dangers for Pantex Workers
 Among the problems cited by the report was the shortage of storage space for plutonium at Pantex, the Energy Department's plant near Amarillo, Tex., where nuclear bombs have been assembled for decades. Pantex has already sustained environmental damage from the intentional burning of high explosives from old bombs that have been disassembled, and report warned that the exposure of workers to radiation could soar if they handle more weapons.
Pantex disassembled nearly 1,300 bombs last year and more than 13,000 since 1980. If all goes according to plan, at least 10,000 more will be dismantled in the next decade, the report said. The office also warned that decommissioning weapons could be delayed by environmentalists who fear that without long-term planning Pantex will become a de-facto permanent repository for plutonium.
There is currently no plan for long-term disposal of plutonium or highly enriched uranium, the two primary bomb fuels, the study noted, although the uranium can be diluted for use in commercial power reactors. Plutonium can also be used in reactors, but the study predicted that would be unlikely, because of unfavorable economics and public opposition.
The Government might be able to build a fission reactor to destroy the plutonium, perhaps producing electricity in the process, but the research to build it could require decades, the report said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Soybeans and Corn Climb On Threat of Midwest Chill

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Soybean and corn futures surged yesterday amid the threat that a cold air mass heading for the Midwest next week may kill crops.
Gains in those commodities helped drive the Commodity Research Bureau's index to its highest level since Aug. 30. The index, which tracks the performance of 21 commodities and is a widely watched gauge of inflation, rose 2.31, to 217.49. 
 Gains in coffee, cocoa, precious metals, livestock and lumber futures also contributed to the rise in the index.
The National Weather Service said temperatures across most of the Midwest will be much below normal during the next six to ten days, reinforcing worries about a crop-killing frost.
"In most areas of the central and northern Corn Belt, harvest hasn't begun because the soybean and corn crops aren't mature." said Victor Lespinasse, a grain analyst with Dean Witter in Chicago. "A frost would just stop their growth, and that means lower yields,"
Soybeans for November delivery closed 11 cents higher at $6.4925 a bushel, the highest price in almost three weeks, on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn for December delivery closed 2.75 cents higher at $2.4875 a bushel, the highest price in about two months.
A cold air front headed south from Canada will bring colder temperatures though the week. The next significant threat of a frost will be Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, although the intensity and the duration of the cold air system is still uncertain, said Jon Davis, a meteorologist with Smith Barney-Shearson.
Meanwhile, heavy rains in the southern portion of the Midwest raised additional concerns about those crops, said Gary Wilhelmi, an independent analyst, based in Chicago.
On other commodity markets, crude oil prices rose as traders grew optimistic that a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, scheduled to begin tomorrow, would yield an agreement to limit production. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for November delivery gained 4 cents, to $17.63 a barrel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold Rebound Amid Russian Uncertainty

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark and other European currencies yesterday amid continuing political tension in Russia, while gold rebounded from a sharp loss the day before.
Traders said both the dollar and gold were bolstered by reports that a group of gunmen tried to storm a military headquarters in Moscow, along with the uncertainties about the power struggle between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his opponents in the Russian Parliament. 
 "The market is going to be vulnerable to that for the time being," said Bob Ortiz, vice president for corporate foreign exchange at the Continental Bank in Chicago.
But some traders said much of the activity reflected a knee-jerk market reaction to buy dollars and gold as a safe haven in times of international turmoil. Yesterday, Mr. Yeltsin called for presidential elections in June, two days after he seized control of the Government to break a deadlock over economic and political changes in Russia.
A group of hard-line opponents in Parliament elected Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi as their president.
In late New York trading, the dollar jumped to 1.6435 marks, from 1.6285 marks on Wednesday. And the British pound fell to $1.5055, from $1.5181. But the dollar slipped to 105.90 Japanese yen, from 106.20 yen.
Gold for October delivery gained $4, to $358.10 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Other precious metals prices also rose.
William O'Neill, a senior strategist at Merrill Lynch Futures, said gold prices were being pushed up in part by short-sellers who had bet on Wednesday that prices would go down but now were reluctant to maintain those positions overnight because of the shaky Russian situation.
Curtis Perkins, a currency trader at the Chemical Bank, said the dollar was also being pushed up by uncertainties surrounding this weekend's meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven large industrial democracies.
Mr. Ortiz also said that many large investors had been buying dollars even before the political troubles in Russia. "The market may have been looking for excuses to buy dollars," he said.
The Group of Seven meeting has traders concerned partly because of the array of potential topics on the agenda: aid to the Palestine Liberation Organization, interest rate reductions and trade policy.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for jobless benefits rose to a seven-week high last week, but analysts said the recent trend still suggested continued employment growth.
First-time claims for unemployment insurance totaled 335,000 last week, up 11,000 from the previous week and more than what many analysts had expected. It was the highest level since 339,000 new claims were filed during the week that ended on July 31. 
 Michael P. Niemira, an economist for Mitsubishi Bank in New York, attributed much of the increase to the delay in opening New York City's public schools, which left bus drivers and cafeteria workers without jobs.

Picasso's Turn
Matisse fever gripped the New York art world last season, with the giant Matisse retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art and a flurry of important Matisses setting record prices at auction. This season, everyone is selling Picassos. No fewer than 88 go on the block at Sotheby's in New York one night in November, and, as it happens, several important Picasso exhibitions are in the works.
"We seem to be periodically reminded of the singular status of Picasso," said Richard Gray, a Chicago dealer. "The breadth of interest and curiosity in his work is such that no one can compete." 
 Mr. Gray is a player in the latest Picasso craze. The dealer recently was tipped off about a pastel, "Woman and Child by the Seashore" (1902 to 1903), in a private collection inFrance. He was able to buy the work and export it to the United States. "No one has known its whereabouts since World War I," he said.
Mr. Gray would not say exactly what he was asking for the pastel, just "somewhere in the mid-seven figures." Other experts value the work at more than $5 million. So far, Mr. Gray said, several American institutions have expressed an interest, but he predicted that it would probably end up in a private collection.
 
88 in One Night
 For Picasso collectors, this fall should be something of a field day. Picassos in every medium and nearly every price range can be found at the New York auctions in November. The biggest stash, 88 works dating from 1899 to 1972, will be offered in a special single-owner sale at Sotheby's on Nov. 4.
The collection is being sold by Stanley J. Seeger, an American collector living in Switzerland who has been buying Picassos since 1980. Mr. Seeger, whom Picasso experts describe as a reclusive collector, bought about 95 percent of the works in his collection at auctions here and abroad.
"He set out to do what he accomplished," said David Nash, the head of Impressionist and modern paintings for Sotheby's. "Every phase of Picasso's work is represented."
And every price range. The big-ticket items in the sale include "Women and Children at the Seashore" (1932), expected to fetch $2.5 million to $3.5 million; "Glass, Flowers, Guitar and Bottle," a 1919 still life estimated to bring $2.5 million to $3.5 million; "Playing Cards, a Pack of Tobacco, Bottle and Glass" (1914), $1.5 million to $2 million and "Nude Woman With a Bird and Flutist" (1967), $1 million to $1.5 million. The sale also includes many less expensive works, beginning at $10,000. Sotheby's estimates that the entire collection will bring $22 million to $31 million.
 
Warhol Redux? Not Likely
 Christie's in New York is also auctioning several Picassos in its sale of Impressionist and modern artworks on Nov. 2. Among the works are "Woman in an Armchair" (1929), estimated at $900,000 to $1.2 million; "Still Life With Bird and Cage" (1947), $600,000 to $800,000, and "Bullfight" (1956), $400,000 to $600,000.
Are all these Picassos coming on the market the same week too much of a good thing? Auctiongoers will no doubt remember last May's disaster when 16 Warhols went on the auction block in New York within 24 hours and only two sold. (Sotheby's, in particular, flooded the market by trying to sell 12 Warhols in one sale, 10 from the collection of Frederick W. Hughes, the artist's business manager.)
But experts are hoping this November will be different. Reasonable estimates, good quality and varied selection, they suggest, could attract buyers even in this depressed economic climate.
 
In the Museums
 Meanwhile, several museums have announced Picasso exhibitions, two scheduled for next year. Opening Feb. 16 at the Tate Gallery in London is a show of about 200 sculptures, paintings, drawings and ceramics, many on loan from Picasso's family. The show will explore the wire works and iron sculptures of the 1930's and the paintings associated with them, the still-life paintings of World War II and after, and works from the 50's and 60's.
"This will be the first show that explores how sculpture and paintings inform and influence each other," said John Golding, a painter and art historian, who organized the show with Elizabeth Cowling, a senior lecturer in art history at Edinburgh University.
In the United States, a traveling exhibition, "Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar," opens on Feb. 10 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, then travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in June and the Art Institute of Chicago in October. The show, which includes 60 works, has been organized by Judi Freeman of the Portland Museum of Art in Maine.
In the spring of 1996, William Rubin, director emeritus of the department of painting and sculpture at the Modern, is planning yet another Picasso show there, "Picasso and the Portrait: Representation and Transformation." He is organizing with the Picasso Museum in Paris, where it is to travel in the fall of 1996.
 
Disputed Silver
 It's been a week for international disputes over ancient artifacts. On Wednesday, the Metropolitan Museum of Art ended a six-year legal battle by agreeing to return to the Turkish Government what has been popularly called the Lydian Hoard, more than 200 gold, silver and bronze objects from the sixth century B.C. Another dispute is much further from a conclusion.
The jury selection began in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in a long-awaited case that will decide the rightful ownership of the $70 million Sevso treasure, a hoard of 14 ornately cast pieces of silver dating from the fourth and fifth centuries. The collection's name comes from an inscription on one piece that refers to an official of the Roman Imperial Army named Sevso.
The case, which has been unfolding for years, has become something of an art-world epic. It involves the Marquess of Northampton, who says the silver is his to sell, and the Governments of Lebanon, Croatia and Hungary, each of which has been trying to prove title to it, contending that the silver was illegally excavated and smuggled out of its territory and is therefore its national property.
Lord Northampton began buying pieces of the silver in the 1980's, in partnership with Peter Wilson, the former chairman of Sotheby's, who died in 1984, and Rainer Zietz, a German art dealer. They bought the silver from Halim Korban, a Lebanese dealer who purchased it from a Yugoslav dealer living in Vienna. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Zietz bought the first pieces and included Lord Northampton only when their money ran out.
Questions about the silver's origin began 10 years ago when Lord Northampton, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Zietz began negotiating to sell the silver to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., and an export license was denied because of questionable signatures dating from before the three men purchased the silver. They eventually obtained an export license, but the Getty declined to buy it. In February 1990, Lord Northampton consigned the silver to Sotheby's.
When the auction house announced it would sell the treasure, representatives of Croatia, Hungary and Lebanon raced to lay claim to the pieces. (Lord Northampton became the owner of record for selling purposes, but 37 percent of the proceeds are to go to Mr. Zietz and to Mr. Wilson's estate.)
 
A Dismissal, a Dropout
 On Tuesday, Justice Beatrice Shainswit dismissed the fraud claims brought by Croatia against Sotheby's and Lord Northampton. Croatia contended that both parties knew or should have known that the silver had come from inside its borders; the judge ruled that "Croatia can point to no damages compensable in an action for fraud." Croatia is still pursuing the court action seeking to prove the treasure is part of its heritage.
Lebanon withdrew its claims to the silver on Tuesday, leaving Croatia, Hungary and Lord Northampton's trustee to fight it out. To defeat Lord Northampton, Croatia or Hungary needs to prove that the silver was found within its borders, its laws give it title to the silver and the United States should recognize these laws.
"Croatia and Hungary are engaged in a treasure hunt," said Harvey Kurzweil, Lord Northampton's lawyer in Manhattan. "Neither one has any evidence that they saw the pieces excavated from the ground."
Sotheby's isn't totally out of the woods yet. "We're thrilled; we feel we've been vindicated by the judge's decision," said Marjorie E. Stone, general counsel for Sotheby's, after Croatia's fraud claims were dismissed. "But we're still holding the silver in our possession until the court decides the case."

Questions, but No Answers
With an odd mixture of pride and paranoia, the producers Robert Michael Geisler and John Roberdeau announced a new play headed for Broadway, providing a phone-book-sized volume of information about the production. Then, through a spokesman, they refused to answer any questions about it.
The play, an adaptation of the Japanese film "Sansho the Bailiff," from 1954, is to have a six-week workshop at the Brooklyn Academy of Music beginning Nov. 1, and the producers say it will be ready for a Broadway opening next October. 
 One might ordinarily dismiss such chin music as mere bravado, particularly since the subject matter -- it's a parable about oppression, set in 14th-century Japan -- sounds a tad ponderous to be economically feasible as Broadway fare. But a remarkable creative team has committed to the project, and met this week in New York to prepare for the workshop. Its members include the lighting designer Jennifer Tipton ("La Bete"); the scenery and costume designer Eiko Ishioka ("M. Butterfly"), and the sound designer Hans Peter Kuhn ("Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights"). The show is to be directed by the prolific Polish film and theater director Andrzej Wajda, and most notable of all, the script has been written by Terrence Malick.
Mr. Malick, who wrote and directed two acclaimed films, "Badlands" (1973) and "Days of Heaven" (1978), is also the author of a notable disappearing act, having been absent from creative life -- publicly, at least -- for 15 years. He has apparently been living in Texas (of late, at least), working on this script and two screenplays. All three of those projects were commissioned by Mr. Geisler and Mr. Roberdeau, whose unwillingness to speak to a reporter is likely tied to Mr. Malick's reluctance to reveal what he has been up to for a decade and a half.
"It's definitely odd," said the show's spokesman, Adrian Bryan-Brown. "I've never been involved in a situation where a producer didn't want to talk about good news."
 
Answers, but No Questions
 Then there's a show in the opposite situation: It's just about ready to open and anybody connected with it will talk, but nobody seems to be asking any questions. The show is "Cyrano," a musical version of the classic story about a woman, a man and his nose, which is set to begin previews at the Neil Simon Theater on Oct. 19.
The show is a large one: 32 actors and 20 musicians. The budget, said Peter Kulok, an American who is co-producing with a Dutchman, Joop van den Ende, is in the neighborhood of $7 million. Still, in spite of this and some rather prominent print ads the past few weeks, it seems to be the Broadway equivalent of a child throwing a tantrum and being ignored anyway. Mr. Kulok said advance sales had been better than he expected, but admitted that the numbers aren't huge: about half a million dollars, he said.
Part of the reason is that it all seems a little highbrow on the one hand and foreign on the other, two tough images with which to court a mass audience. Though the show played for nearly a year in Amsterdam, the Netherlands isn't exactly a place with a strong tradition of exporting musicals to America. And though the producers made inquiries as to the availability of some American actors to play the lead (among them were Mandy Patinkin and Terrence Mann), they will open with Bill van Dijk in a reprise of the title role that made him a star in Europe. The show is sung through. "It's operatic in style in that way," Mr. Kulok said, "though I hate to use that word because it really doesn't have that weight."
And it has been translated from Dutch into English by an Englishman, Peter Reeves. Some lyrics are now being Americanized, and others are being added, by Sheldon Harnick. Mr. van Dijk's accent -- his English is flawless but rather formal, Mr. Kulok said -- is being Americanized, too.
"We're forging new territory, no question about it," Mr. Kulok said cheerfully. He said that at capacity -- the Simon has 1,366 seats -- the show's investors, who are Dutch, would get their money back in about a year, probably a rosy assessment given the weekly cost of running such a sizable show. He added it was clear the success of the show would depend upon the critical response and word of mouth. He admits to being an optimist.
"If you're asking me what we're selling, we're trying to decide that. At the moment what we're selling is that the Cyrano story is well known, a great, classic love story. What we're selling is that we're doing a full, lush production of that story on the Broadway stage in the musical form."
 
Tribute to a Producer
 In what was certainly the most stirring theatrical experience of the week, R. Tyler Gatchell Jr. was remembered in a memorial service on Tuesday at a nearly packed Shubert Theater. Mr. Gatchell, a prolific general manager and producer long associated with the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, died in July of a heart attack at 50.
He was saluted in speech and song by a variety of industry luminaries, among them Bernard B. Jacobs, president of the Shubert Organization; the advertising executive Nancy Coyne, and the performers Betty Buckley and Laurie Beechman, who sang rather heartbreaking renditions of ballads from Gatchell shows. Mr. Gatchell was remembered, with both sadness and humor, for his fastidiousness, professionalism, wit and, above all, his gift for creative problem-solving, a talent best represented by a story told by Bill Evans, a press agent who knew Mr. Gatchell for 18 years.
Mr. Evans recalled that for all his other talents, Mr. Gatchell had a black thumb, which was a particular irritation to his companion, Mark Shannon, an actor and something of a home horticulturist who got tired of returning after weeks on the road to a houseful of dead plants. Disputes ensued.
Mr. Gatchell's solution? "The day Mark left, Tyler would take photographs of all the houseplants," Mr. Evans told the assemblage at the Shubert. "Then the day before he returned, he'd race to the florist with the photos and tell the florist he had to have plants that looked exactly like the photos, delivered immediately."
 
Footlights
 *Jennifer Jason Leigh decided this week to accept a role in Sam Shepard's new play, "Simpatico," which goes into rehearsals in November for an opening, probably on Broadway, early next year. To accept the role, she declined an offer from David Rabe to appear Off broadway in his play "Those the River Keeps."
*The Ensemble Studio Theater's 13th Annual Octoberfest, a 25-night marathon of plays, musicals, readings, etc., begins on Oct. 6 at the theater's performance spaces at 549 West 52d Street. Among 80 projects to be staged is a new work by John Ford Noonan and Romulus Linney. Admission is free.

GRAPHIC: Photo: "A New Bogosian Talker" -- "Suburbia," a new multi-character play by the monologuist Eric Bogosian, is to open at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater on Jan. 24. The play, set in front of a 7-Eleven, is the third entry in the Lincoln Center Theater Festival of New American Plays. It follows "The Lights," by Howard Korder, which opens Oct. 13, and "Hello, Again," a musical by Michael John LaChuisa, opening Dec. 30.

HEADLINE: City Opera Chief Takes Leave of Absence

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Christopher Keene, the general director of the New York City Opera, told members of the company's board on Wednesday evening that he would take an immediate leave of absence to be treated for alcoholism at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
Mr. Keene flew to California yesterday. Susan Woelzl, the company's spokeswoman, said that there was no firm date for his return, but that he expected to be in New York to conduct the New York Philharmonic in the first week in November. 
 Mr. Keene, who conducted a performance of Sir Michael Tippett's "Midsummer Marriage" on Wednesday evening, left a statement that was read to the company's staff and musicians yesterday afternoon.
 
Pressures and Tragedies
 "During this past year, with its load of personal tragedy," Mr. Keene's statement read, referring to the deaths of several company members and personal friends, "and all the relentless pressures of the economy upon the continuing survival of our company, I have finally had to acknowledge to myself that I have developed an alcohol problem which is beyond my own control.
"The situation is not only threatening to my own health but endangering the futures of both my family and the company."
He added that "I know this is an illness which can be cured -- and I look forward to returning to you refreshed and cleansed, able to contribute my very best to solving the problems which confront us."
Mr. Keene took over the directorship of the City Opera from Beverly Sills in 1989. His first season was curtailed by a musicians' strike, and in recent seasons the company has posted operating deficits totaling about $4.5 million.
Yet Mr. Keene has been widely credited with raising the company's performance level. His departure takes him away from the company just before it celebrates its 50th anniversary with a week of world premieres, starting Oct. 6. Donald Hassard, the managing director for artistic administration, will be in charge in Mr. Keene's absence.

COMPUTER MAKER FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
System Integrators Inc., which makes computers for newspapers and magazines, has filed for Federal bankruptcy protection. The company, based in Sacramento, Calif., said the Chapter 11 filing on Wednesday was an effort to get banks to refinance a $56 million loan at lower interest rates. "We haven't been able to get a satisfactory resolution, so we filed for Chapter 11," a company spokesman, Roger Peterson, said. "We thought that through the assistance of the court we could get a fairer hearing." The bankruptcy filing listed $30 million in assets and $81 million in liabilities. The company plans no layoffs of its 297 employees, Mr. Peterson said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The Students;
Health Professionals Brace for a New Age

BYLINE: By, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
No group was listening more intently to President Clinton's appeal to the nation to adopt a sweeping program that would guarantee all Americans health insurance than the professionals in the health care fields. Mr. Clinton is proposing nothing less than an upheaval in the way one-seventh of the American economy operates. These are some of the immediate reactions to the President's speech on Wednesday night from doctors with a health maintenance organization, insurance company executives and medical students.
 
 
Marcus Welby Is Disappearing
They cheered on President Clinton for pledging to extend health insurance to all, to simplify paperwork, to crack down on malpractice lawsuits. That was all good. But for two dozen young medical students here, the President's speech on health care offered a glimpse into their own future as doctors, and many came away profoundly nervous.
"We're going to have a nation of Doc-in-the-Boxes," said 24-year-old Richard Gardner, a fourth-year student at Baylor College of Medicine here. "His idea seems to be that all doctors are going to go right into H.M.O.'s." 
 Most of the students who gathered in the medical school lounge to watch the speech on Wednesday night readily acknowledged that with or without the President's plan, the era in which both doctors and patients could enjoy a sense of intense familiarity and mutual trust was long gone. "No one gets to be Marcus Welby anymore," said Matt Kim, a third-year obstetrics student from Dallas. "Times have changed. You've just got to watch your back all the time. They'll sue you no matter what."
Still, while they hoped to hear more from the President about how his proposal might strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, many said the speech left them with an image of a giant national factory in which, even if all were served, not all could possibly be served well.
"One of my main reasons for being a doctor was I wanted to run my own clinic," said David Williams, 24, who is from a suburb of Salt Lake City and is interested in rural medicine. "I wanted do it on my own, and it sounds like he's trying to force all doctors into larger health care organizations instead of allowing any kind of entrepreneurial spirit in doctors."
Many students said they took it as a given these days that they would not make a huge amount of money as doctors. But, as one said, even the most stringent controls would probably still allow them to live "a solid upper-middle-class existence." The issue that really seemed to preoccupy them was not money anyway, but their autonomy.
"Let's face it," broke in Christopher G. Tobin, a second-year student from Wichita Falls, Tex. "A physician is the kind of personality type where we like to be in charge. We're mostly Type A's here."
A giant national health care system, many feared, would only aggravate a trend toward having to practice medicine by bureaucratic decree, whether from the government or a private insurer.
"A lot of doctors I know have to punch a timer when they go in to see a patient," said Monica Serrano, 26, of Dayton, Ohio, who wants to be a family practitioner. "You have to follow the form. If you feel you need to spend 20 minutes with this patient but the insurance company says it's only 15, that's it. And that's appalling to me. That's an appalling way to have to practice medicine."
Not surprisingly, many said their own vision for a health care system would include much more independent authority for doctors to evaluate patients and prescribe treatment, and a much more limited scope for malpractice lawsuits, but no one expressed any optimism it would really come to pass.
"Congress is filled with lawyers and how are we going to pass that through a bunch of lawyers?" Mr. Tobin said. Someone suggested that more doctors should go to Congress but Rob Cook, a third-year student in general surgery, shot back, "Nah, that would be such a waste of good medical training"
Whatever their qualms with the mechanics of Mr. Clinton's plan, all the students who discussed the speech with a reporter afterward embraced the concept of universal health insurance, which they said could free them to treat a whole range of patients without worrying about who has insurance and who does not.
"When I used to think about my future, I thought I had to make a choice," Mr. Kim said. "I had to do the Beverly Hills doc sort of thing or be at our local county hospital. There was no happy middle. But with Clinton's plan, I think there's a possibility you could help a lot of people."
Many of the students seemed genuinely moved by Mr. Clinton's portrayal of a country where no one would have to worry about affording the care of a sick child or having to stay in a job or a town simply for fear of losing their benefits. But hashing out the plan amongst themselves afterward, many said it all seemed too good to be attainable.
"There are three areas of health care," said Tracy Lyon, a second-year student from Dallas. "There's quality, there's cost and there's availability. You can't have the best of all of those three worlds. It can't be done, and that's not something the President brought up tonight. He didn't say some things the public needs to know, such as, there's going to have to be rationing. Nobody likes to use that word, nobody likes to hear it, but there's going to have to be rationing."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The Insurers;
Health Professionals Brace for a New Age

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD, Conn., Sept. 22

 BODY:
No group was listening more intently to President Clinton's appeal to the nation to adopt a sweeping program that would guarantee all Americans health insurance than the professionals in the health care fields. Mr. Clinton is proposing nothing less than an upheaval in the way one-seventh of the American economy operates. These are some of the immediate reactions to the President's speech on Wednesday night from doctors with a health maintenance organization, insurance company executives and medical students.
 
 
Copious Notes On Legal Pads
There was little dread in the bright, green-carpeted employee lounge of the Cigna Corporation as executives of the insurance giant gathered here watch President Clinton's health care speech on Wednesday night.
Disagreement, yes: Lawrence P. English, the president of the company's health care unit, shook his head and grimaced at some points, and raised his hands and shrugged at other moments. And with every reference to price controls, however oblique, nearly every pen in the room leaped to attention, scribbling hostile notes on legal pads. But ultimately the insurance executives had more suggestions about fine-tuning the President's plan than fundamentally changing it. 
 "I think I have more to feel good about than there is to be concerned about," said Mr. English, who came back to the office with his wife Carol to watch the speech with colleagues in the health care unit on a small lounge TV with a fuzzy picture and rabbit ears for an antenna. "How could you not agree with the principles he has articulated?" Mr. English said.
Cigna, along with two other insurance giants -- Aetna Life & Casualty and the Travelers Corporation, both based in nearby Hartford -- are considered likely winners in the great reshuffling of the health care deck implied by Mr. Clinton's plan. All three companies, which collectively dominate much of the central Connecticut's white collar economy, have already moved aggressively into an area that the President's proposal would push even faster: managed health care. Cigna is one the largest operators of health maintenance organizations in the nation, with 2.6 million patients served by 44 plans.
Dr. W. Allen Schaffer, the national medical director for Cigna Healthcare, said he thought that Mr. Clinton's withering critique of the current health care system was five years out of date. The explosion of H.M.O.'s, he said, which now care for one in five Americans, is already achieving some of the economies of scale that is part of the President's goal.
"We're experiencing negative cost trends, actually less than inflation, in some managed health care products," Dr. Schaffer said.
Other employees were skeptical that a vast new Government bureaucracy could streamline anything, let alone medical care paperwork. They said the most up-to-date H.M.O.'s already had more ambitious goals, like getting rid of all paperwork.
"We want to get to a paperless environment," Mr. English said.
Some people said they thought that the potential costs of the plan, especially in the beginning, were underestimated by the President, and several said the speech was notable for what it omitted entirely. A managed, universal health care system, they said, would invariably create questions of rationing. For example, what levels of treatments were justified for frail, terminal or simply very old patients.
"The R-word, rationing, didn't come up," Dr. Schaffer said. "But certainly it's a component. It's a big part of the proposal."

HEADLINE: Two Stock Exchanges Drop Plans to Build Complex

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The New York and American Stock Exchanges have canceled a plan to build an enormous new trading complex and office tower on Wall Street, public and private officials familiar with the project said yesterday.
There was no immediate indication why the exchanges canceled the undertaking, as neither would comment. 
 The exchanges project would have been an economic and psychological shot in the arm for lower Manhattan's distressed real-estate market by showing that major downtown institutions had enough faith to build on a large scale. It would also have been a tangible symbol of New York City's continuing role as an international financial center.
Even in its earliest stages, however, the project had hurdles to clear, perhaps the most daunting being that the New York Stock Exchange had already spent $600 million to modernize its existing trading floor.
And it was not at all apparent where tenants would have been found to fill one million square feet of office space -- as much as in the Chrysler Building -- at a time when another 20 million square feet are available downtown.
 
Near Both Exchanges
 The complex would have been built directly across Broad Street from the New York Stock Exchange, on a block bounded by Wall Street, William Street and Exchange Place. The site is four blocks east of the American Stock Exchange, which is on Trinity Place.
At the base would have been a great boxlike structure with two 50,000-square-foot trading floors. That would have been topped by a skyscraper of some 50 stories, with more than one million square feet of space.
Much of that block is owned by J. P. Morgan & Company, whose headquarters were once on the site, at 23 Wall Street. Morgan had formed a development team for the exchanges project with the Hines Interests, Rudin Management Company and Sterling Equities. The architects were Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
 
Many High Hopes
 No cost estimates were ever released, nor had it been settled how much the city's Economic Development Corporation would have pumped into the project.
The Dinkins administration had pinned high hopes on the project, as had local business interests.
"We're very disappointed," said Dr. Barbara L. Christen, president of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association.
"We had been very hopeful that it would have come to pass," she said. "We saw it as having much the same effect on lower Manhattan as Chase Manhattan Plaza had in the late 50's and early 60's." That tower was the first major project after a long hiatus following World War II, when downtown lost much of its ground to mid-Manhattan.
John H. Alschuler Jr., a partner in the real-estate firm of H. R. & A. and a consultant on the exchanges project, said: "Lower Manhattan needs to be redeveloped. The redevelopment process means the recycling of obsolete space and the creation of new and viable opportunities for tenants.
"The exchanges project would have been a catalyst on the order of Chase or Battery Park City and would have been a symbol for the revitalization of the core of lower Manhattan, which is where the significant problems lie."
Despite the loss of the exchanges project, Dr. Christen said several things contributed to her optimism about the future. One is the impending release by Mayor David N. Dinkins of new planning guidelines for the area. Another is the possible development of a downtown business improvement district.
"Lower Manhattan has tremendous potential," she said. "We have 20 million square feet of vacant office space but we also have 90 million square feet of occupied office space."
About the site itself, a spokesman for Morgan said, without elaboration, that the company "plans to evaluate alternatives."

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN AFRICA;
Mandela Calls to an End to Sanctions

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Proclaiming that "the countdown to democracy in South Africa has begun," Nelson Mandela called today for the lifting of all remaining economic sanctions against his country.
Almost instantly, governments and cities, including New York, initiated measures to end the years-old sanctions, which have been maintained despite a steady erosion of the racial separation policies known as apartheid. The call by the leader of the African National Congress, made here the day after South Africa's Parliament adopted a package of laws giving blacks their first say in the country's Government, is expected to eventually revive investment in South Africa.
 
'Stability and Social Progress'
 "To strengthen the forces of democratic change, and to help create the necessary conditions for stability and social progress," Mr. Mandela told the the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, "we believe that the time has come when the international community should lift all economic sanctions against South Africa." [Excerpt from the speech, page 5.] 
 South Africa's President, F. W. de Klerk, who made his first appearance at the United Nations on Thursday, endorsed the call by Mr. Mandela.
"I have always been of the opinion that the A.N.C. should have taken this decision sooner," President de Klerk told The Associated Press. "I am glad now that they have come on board. The sanctions harmed the interests of all those in South Africa."
 
Influence of Violence
 Although almost all American Federal sanctions against South Africa were lifted by President Bush in 1991, remaining restrictions prohibited lending by the Export-Import Bank to companies operating in South Africa and required the United States to vote against loans to South Africa by international lending agencies.
Officials in Washington and the rest of the country acted quickly to remove economic and trade sanctions against the Pretoria Government. But experts warned against any expectations of an immediate flood of capital into South Africa, in part because of the continuing political violence there. [Page 5.]
In addition, about a hundred American cities and 27 states still enforce various financial measures against South Africa and firms doing business there, including California, Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida as well as Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago.
Pension systems, endowments for colleges and universities and other funds with assets totaling $300 billion do not put money into South Africa or into gold mines and other companies doing business there, according to calculations by the Africa Fund, based in New York. Most major banks in the United States also do not extend credit to South African businesses.
Unaffected by Mr. Mandela's appeal to lift economic sanctions, however, is the 1977 mandatory Security Council embargo on the sale of weapons to South Africa. This led South Africa to develop an arms industry of its own and become an important exporter.
Mr. Mandela also left it up to the General Assembly to decide whether to repeal an ineffective voluntary embargo on oil deliveries to South Africa that was adopted in 1986.
He urged nations that do not have diplomatic ties with Pretoria to establish them. But he said they should treat the Transitional Executive Council, established by Parliament on Thursday as the vehicle for black majority rule, as the true representative of all the peoples of South Africa, rather than the current Government.
Mr. Mandela stressed that lifting sanctions would allow new investment to flow into South Africa, whose economy is mired in recession and unemployment, as companies that withdrew in protest against apartheid start doing business there again and as new investors enter the market.
 
De Klerk Meets Executives
 Echoing that hope, President de Klerk met in New York with 50 American business executives at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. People in the audience said later that he had been received "very positively," as one put it, but many remained cautious about investment out of fear that the transition to majority rule might be disrupted by violence or other problems.
Mr. Mandela's appeal today is also expected to lead to the repeal of a 1992 nonbinding General Assembly resolution urging governments, private banks, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund not to advance new credit to South Africa, an action that crimped that country's ability to raise international loans.
Noting that millions of South Africans "have no food, no jobs, no homes" Mr. Mandela said South Africa needs "a massive injection of funds" to prevent its recession from getting worse, to halt the spiraling rise in crime and violence that threatens to undermine its move toward democracy and to prevent the country from becoming "another Somalia or a Bosnia."
Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York accompanied Mr. Mandela to the United Nations and said at a joint news conference that he had already acted to reverse city rules that restrict relations with South Africa. These include ordinances barring pension funds from investing in companies doing business with South Africa and giving preference in awarding city contracts to firms that have no South African ties.
"New York City, a world leader in implementing and upholding sanctions against South Africa, is now ready to unlock those economic chains," said Mr. Dinkins, who added that he had written to the United States Conference of Mayors to urge civic leaders to repeal similar laws and ordinances that discourage business dealings with South Africa or stop pension and college endowment funds or foundations from investing there.
 
Commonwealth Ends Sanctions
 Meeting in Nassau, capital of the Bahamas, Finance Ministers of the 50 Commonwealth nations announced the immediate lifting of all trade, investment and financial sanctions that they have imposed against South Africa.
"The lifting of these sanctions confirms the beginning of a new relationship between the Commonwealth and South Africa, a country that is now irreversibly committed to joining the community of democratic nations," said Eleazar Chukwuemeka (Emeka) Anyaoku of Nigeria, the Commonwealth Secretary General.
At the news conference, Mr. Mandela sought to reassure foreign investors, saying they had nothing to fear from a majority government and stressing that his African National Congress was no longer committed to nationalizing South Africa's mining industry. Foreign investors would be allowed to repatriate profits and dividends, he said.
Mr. Mandela also appeared to confirm reports the Congress had been holding secret talks with right-wing Afrikaaners about their demand for a semiautonomous white homeland in South Africa after majority rule.
Although he called their fears "baseless," he acknowledged that they were "real" and said that the congress must "address these fears realistically and seriously." While rejecting what he called "an ethnic solution," he said he could imagine a compromise based on "the basic demand of a people wanting a particular region in which to run their affairs." The Afrikaaners have been seeking about 16 percent of South Africa for themselves, mostly in the Transvaal and Orange Free State.
In his address to a meeting of the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, held in the huge General Assembly hall here, Mr. Mandela, who received a standing ovation as he entered, said that with Thursday's Parliamentary vote, South Africa had turned its back on white-minority rule and was now heading irreversibly toward democracy.
While he said sanctions had helped bring about this change, he made clear that his first concern was with the country's fast deteriorating economy and the rising tide of violence.
"The apartheid system has left a swath of disaster in its trail," Mr. Mandela said. "We have an economy that is tottering on the brink of an even deeper recession than the one we are experiencing. What this means practically is that millions of people have no food, no jobs, no homes."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH CARE PLAN: White House Memo;
On Health, Clinton Finds Heaven Is in the Details

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Sept. 24

 BODY:
Before ABC News's "town hall" on health care went on the air Thursday night, Ted Koppel came out to instruct the audience on the pace of live television.
The "Nightline" host told those in the crowd in the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center to keep their questions for President Clinton "pithy and to the point." 
 Not one to mince words, even with a President, Mr. Koppel gave Mr. Clinton the same instructions, telling him to "zip" right along.
Mr. Clinton nodded sympathetically, as he is wont to do, and then unleashed two and a half hours worth of highly detailed "first, secondly" and "let me just add this" and "I want to make this very clear" and "Can I say one thing real quick?" and "I would like to amend that answer" answers about his health care plan.
 
Putting Me First
 If health care is an issue that everyone in the country wants explained individually -- What about my acupuncture bills? My aunt's lumbago? My massage therapy clients? My husband's favorite chiropractor? My protection against malpractice suits? My pharmacy's problems with drug manufacturers? -- this is a President who is willing, nay, eager to do it.
"Bulimia?" he repeated after an elegant red-haired woman who had pushed up to the stage after the program. "That'll be covered."
The President had promised to stay as long as anyone had a question -- a promise that alarmed his staff members, who envisioned the policy equivalent of the dance-marathon movie, "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"
"Do you want a Xanax?" asked Robert Boorstin, a White House health policy aide, jokingly offering a tablet of the anti-anxiety medication to a reporter who planned to stay up as long as the President.
Other Presidents would have retreated to a majestic distance after introducing the plan with a masterly speech to Congress: Float above the fray. Let the public absorb the general idea while the Administration experts fanned out to explain the tricky, politically thorny details. Preserve political capital.
Not this President. He did not wait a day, after his dignified, well-received speech on Wednesday night, to return to his cherished role as a chatty national talk show host. Although Ira Magaziner, the chief White House adviser on health care, was seated on the aisle of the fourth row so that he could field the questions that were too technical for Mr. Clinton, the President never called on him for help.
"It's the most personal, specific issue in the world," said Mandy Grunwald, a media adviser to the President who helped set up the program. "Why shouldn't he be the one to educate people and reassure them about their fears?"
 
Presidential Gratification
 And, in an insight into the gratification Mr. Clinton draws from this kind of format -- the same enjoyment George Bush got from the freewheeling news conferences that showed he was more a master of details than Ronald Reagan -- she added, "I don't know of any other President who could have answered those questions about his own policy."
Mr. Clinton is supremely confident in this sort of setting, although Mr. Koppel lost patience with the torrent of words at one point and complained that the President was being glib to the point of obfuscation.
As the President was giving a long, politically careful answer to a woman who opposed the prospect of her health care payments' going into a common fund that could be used to pay for abortions, Mr. Koppel interjected, saying, "Mr. President, this is a curious criticism to make, but sometimes I think you're so specific in your answers or so detailed in your answers that it's a little hard to know what the answer to the question was."
Mr. Clinton looked cross in reply, his mouth like the rim of a purse snapped suddenly shut, just as he did at another moment when he was tossing around remarks about things that would be covered in the year 1996 or 2000 and the moderator drily noted: "There's a little thing called 're-election' that has to kick in before you can be sure that you're going to be able to continue doing these things into a second term."
As Mr. Koppel looked on bemusedly, the increasingly hoarse President continued to take questions from people in the front rows during commercial breaks, even though his microphone was turned off -- making him look, from the rear of the hall, like a gesticulating figure on a television set when the mute button is on.
When Mr. Koppel interrupted a long story by a questioner with AIDS, trying to speed up the man, Mr. Clinton jumped in breathlessly, like a high school contestant on "It's Academic."
"I know the question," the President proclaimed, proceeding to ask the question he felt the man was working up to, about Medicaid coverage of AIDS patients, and then answering it at some length.
Long after Mr. Koppel, who had a bad cold and kept checking his watch, looked as if he was ready to be on his way, Mr. Clinton was still eagerly scanning the crowd for questioners and jumping up from his black leather swivel chair to get a little roving room while he talked.
He was deeply involved now in explaining things about long-term care benefits and basic benefits, and about model forms for doctors, variations on the model forms and variations on the variations -- all intended to elucidate a plan that is supposed to simplify the process of getting health care.
Mr. Clinton was live from 10 P.M. to 11 P.M. in the "town hall" portion of the program; then the network began taping the questions and answers for more than an hour of broadcasting on "Nightline."
He continued to take questions from people who crowded around the stage for another 20 minutes after ABC News finally pulled the plug on the program at 12:15 A.M. Mr. Koppel said that was at the suggestion of White House aides who were worried that Mr. Clinton needed his rest.
But he ignored his advisers, David R. Gergen and Mandy Grunwald, and his personal aides, Andrew Friendly and Wendy Smith, who surrounded him like sheepdogs and, tugging and nudging, tried to herd him off the stage.
At one point, at 12:30 A.M., the usually smooth Mr. Gergen started to look a little desperate when the President stopped talking about anorexia and got into an argument about the North American Free Trade Agreement. "Prove it!" he challenged a man who had yelled the Ross Perot argument at him that Nafta would cost American jobs. Then he began reeling off trade statistics and environmental data.
 
He Knew About Cobra
 The President paid no attention to the ABC technician who reached under his jacket and took off his microphone. He was busy with a question from a woman who had lost her job and was worried about transitional health insurance.
"That's the problem with Cobra," Mr. Clinton told the woman, easily using the acronym for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, which concerns people who lose insurance coverage when they lose or leave their jobs.
Renata Major walked away impressed. "He knew what Cobra was right away," she said. "He told me I asked an excellent question."
Of course, with this President -- who subscribes to that famous Dashiell Hammett line from "The Maltese Falcon" that "talking's something you can't do judiciously unless you keep in practice" -- just about any question is an excellent question.
By 12:35 A.M., Mr. Gergen had coaxed Mr. Clinton over to the edge of the stage, close enough where they could actually pull him backstage without too much effort.
 
Looking for More Converts
 But Mr. Clinton was still looking longingly at the crowd, hoping to win a few more converts. His hoarse voice could be heard fading in and out on dozens of different aspects of the plan:
"That's the problem with health centers in rural towns. . . . If you had a heart attack tonight? No. . . . Lifetime limits to the policy, the thing can turn out to be a real trap. . . . To my knowledge, the F.D.A. approved the drug. . . . We're in the process of redesigning the entire unemployment system, so there's a whole lot of these things that have to be readjusted because the nature of unemployment is different."
With one last tug from his advisers, the President was finally backstage. But it did not stop there. He went up to his health care advisers, Mr. Magaziner and Christine Heenan, wanting to go over various points he had made. "Now, was I right about this?" he asked them.
Laughing that it took "hours" to get the President off stage, Mr. Gergen said, "I told him if we stayed a little longer we could just go straight into 'Good Morning America' with Charlie Gibson."

HEADLINE: Think Nationally, Stump Locally: Democrats Move to Dinkins's Aid

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The White House and the national Democratic Party, increasingly worried about Mayor David N. Dinkins's prospects for re-election, are organizing a series of efforts to help his campaign, capped by a visit from President Clinton on Sunday to help the Mayor raise a million dollars.
A Presidential appearance to raise money in a mayoral race, even one as important as New York's, is unusual enough. But the White House is not stopping there -- it is dispatching Vice President Al Gore and several Cabinet members to the city to campaign for Mr. Dinkins and sending money to help the state party get people to the polls. 
 The reasons are both narrowly tactical and more broadly strategic. Although the New York mayoral race, with its many local issues, is far from a referendum on national Democratic urban policy, the Democrats are concerned that their troubles are spreading and that a Dinkins loss would only make it harder to rescue their image as the voice of the inner cities.
 
Stunned in Los Angeles
 The Democratic Party was stunned by the election last spring of Richard J. Riordan as Los Angeles's first Republican Mayor in 36 years, and party officials feared that it sprang from a perception that the party has nothing to offer to solve inner-city problems like racism and poverty.
Democrats here are even more nervous that the election of a Republican Mayor in a Democratic stronghold like New York would complicate Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign in three years. "We'd rather be running in '96 with a Democratic mayor than a Republican mayor," said Joan N. Baggett, the White House political director.
The efforts on behalf of Mr. Dinkins address immediate political concerns, but do nothing about the broader issue of devising concrete answers to the cities' problems. Nor do they provide what Mr. Dinkins would probably find most beneficial: Federal money that he has lobbied for but never received as the Clinton Administration put other priorities ahead of urban aid.
Mr. Clinton's visit comes at a crucial moment for the Mayor's campaign coffers as Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, has outpaced the Mayor by better than 2-to-1 in fund raising in recent weeks.
"There's a lot riding on it." said David Wilhelm, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "We're going to do whatever we can to help win what promises to be a very close race."
Where the Democrats see danger, the Republicans see political opportunity. Because the New York campaign is so tightly contested, and because there are few other elections of national interest this year, the Republican Party is also giving the race unusual attention, sending party leaders to stump for Mr. Giuliani.
White House officials said the decision by Mr. Clinton to appear with Mr. Dinkins shows the depth of his commitment in the face of polls that suggest a difficult race for Mr. Dinkins. The officials said it was decided that the potential payoff to the Mayor and to the party of a high-profile appearance by Mr. Clinton outweighed the risks of his alienating the white ethnic Democrats who do not support Mr. Dinkins, as well as the embarrassment if the Mayor loses.
 
Closer Ties to Dinkins
 By contrast, only after much internal debate did Mr. Clinton appear briefly at a news conference in Los Angeles last spring with Michael Woo, the Democrat who ran against Mr. Riordan in what was officially a nonpartisan race. One reason Mr. Clinton did not give more than a lukewarm endorsement was that some of his top advisers were friends of Mr. Riordan. Both Mr. Clinton and several of his aides have closer ties to Mr. Dinkins.
Presidents hardly ever deliver local elections, and most New Yorkers are certain to base their votes on their views of Mr. Dinkins's performance in office, something much closer and more tangible than a visit from Washington.
But as the Dinkins campaign is struggling to keep Democrats from defecting to Mr. Giuliani, the President's support could make a difference by dramatizing the Mayor's ties to the White House.
"I think the connection between a Democratic Mayor and a Democratic President is a very persuasive argument to vote for David Dinkins," said Harold M. Ickes, a New York lawyer who is a close adviser both to Mr. Clinton and to Mr. Dinkins. "The fact that the President is committed to helping the Mayor sends a strong message to New Yorkers that there will continue to be a good working relationship between Washington and New York City."
The President's visit, especially after a week when he drew positive reviews from his health-care speech to Congress, is certain to draw much-needed favorable publicity for Mr. Dinkins.
But the Democrats' ability to help in more tangible -- that is, financial -- ways is hampered by several factors, among them election laws that limit the amount that national parties may funnel to local races. On a larger scale, Mr. Clinton lacks the traditional ability of some past presidents to woo voters by funneling Government resources to the city or some other favored constituency because of the tight budget in Washington and the Congressional defeat of the Administration's economic stimulus package.
But despite these limits, Mr. Ickes said that the Clinton Administration is scrambling to find ways to send Federal help to New York City. "The City Hall people are working with various Cabinet departments to get some dollars into New York," he said. "If we lost New York to the Republicans, obviously it would be disturbing."
Another fear among Democratic officials is that a Dinkins defeat would suggest that Mr. Clinton lacks leverage in local races, giving Republicans a boost in recruiting candidates to run next year in elections around the country.
Citing not only Los Angeles, but also the election in May of Mayor Bret Schundler in Jersey City, the city's first Republican Mayor since 1917, Republicans are trying to portray the New York race as part of a pattern and thus a high-stakes urban referendum on Mr. Clinton and the Democrats.
"Rudy Giuliani's election would be another powerful demonstration that Republican ideas will sell in the big cities," said Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee. "People are looking for alternatives to the big government, high-tax Democrat administrations that have been controlling these cities."
Although the Administration is limited in the Federal money it can dispense for New York, there are other ways it can try to help Mr. Dinkins. Some Republicans have suggested that Attorney General Janet Reno had sought to protect Mr. Dinkins by putting off an expected announcement that her agency would not prosecute civil-rights violations in the Crown Heights disturbances. The Justice Department denied any political motivation.
 
Looking to 1996
 While Democratic officials speak of the need for a Democratic mayor who is in sync with Mr. Clinton's agenda, the President has more pragmatic reasons for wanting Mr. Dinkins to hold on to his job: Winning New York was crucial to Mr. Clinton's campaign last year. Though issues like the economy and health care will likely determine Mr. Clinton's popularity in New York, the last thing he wants is a Mayor who actively works against his re-election, forcing him to spend time and resources securing what should be a secure Democratic base.

HEADLINE: White House Scraps Welfare Rule Change

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration retreated today from a plan to relax work requirements for thousands of married parents on welfare after lawmakers angrily objected to the change.
The Administration's plan would have allowed welfare recipients from two-parent families to spend as few as eight hours a week on the job, instead of the 16 hours Congress required when it passed the law in 1988. 
 The change had been announced in a Sept. 21 memorandum to state welfare agencies in advance of the Oct. 1 deadline for finding jobs or training for as many as 120,000 unemployed parents.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, accused the Administration of weakening the work requirements while promising to force recipients to take a job after two years on the rolls.
The Administration had argued that the changes would have given states flexibility to design programs to help participants find permanent jobs.

HEADLINE: Japan's Premier Stands Firm on Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Preparing for his first visit to the United States since taking office, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa suggested today that despite sweeping changes he was seeking in his country's political and economic systems, Japan would continue to take a hard line on trade disputes with Washington.
Two months after ousting Japan's aging and corrupt leadership in elections, Mr. Hosokawa said that he and his Cabinet were leading "a revolution in peacetime" in Japan, but he staked out a position showing that his Government would take much the same approach as past Governments on closing the trade surplus. 
 In a wide-ranging discussion tonight with a group of American correspondents, the 55-year-old leader of the Japan New Party still seemed a bit surprised to find himself in the Prime Minister's residence.
 
Plans for Major Changes
 In sharp contrast to his predecessors, the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, whose 38-year control of the country ended in scandal and a party revolt, Mr. Hosokawa talked at length about his plans to use his office to "break the collusion between politics, the bureaucratic system, business and industry."
Mr. Hosokawa said he was following three simultaneous paths to "the restructuring of Japan": political reform, economic reform -- including a review of the country's budgeting and tax system -- and deregulation. "All these reforms will see their direction by the end of this year," he said. "That is the time limit that has been set."
But on the issue of trade, he dismissed the thought that governments could mandate an end to trade surpluses with targets for exports and imports, as demanded by Washington, saying that the huge trade surpluses Japan had run up with the United States "are the natural outcome of free market activities" rather than any mercantilist Japanese policies.
In his meeting with President Clinton, scheduled for Monday in New York, Mr. Hosokawa said he would continue to voice Japan's opposition to any use of "numerical targets," which the United States has been seeking.
Later, though, he said he had a commitment to "reduce the surplus in a significant manner" by improving American access to the Japanese market and reviving the moribund economy here, which he said the other day was in a state of emergency.
 
Calls for Efforts by Clinton
 He placed an equal burden on Mr. Clinton, saying the United States "would be expected to make various efforts," including increasing industrial competitiveness, boosting the savings rate and reducing the budget deficit. Past Japanese Governments have made identical demands.
Mr. Hosokawa argued that the changes he was trying to bring about, including a broad deregulation of Japanese industry, would accomplish many of the goals the United States sought. "I have to explain to President Clinton," he said, "that what I am trying to do will take time to bring about."
Over the last few weeks Mr. Hosokawa, while enjoying popularity ratings over 70 percent, has often been accused of letting his oratory overstep his action. And today he was relatively unspecific about many of the details of his plans.
Looking relaxed and clearly enjoying the chance to talk about how he had shaken the political establishment here, Mr. Hosokawa said he had used one of his first official appearances to apologize for Japan's atrocities during World War II because "unless we do this, we will not be able to make a fresh start" with Japan's neighbors in Asia.
Many have speculated that Mr. Hosokawa's comments would make it easier for Japan to claim a place on the United Nations Security Council, a move the United States has endorsed.
But to the dismay of many bureaucrats here, including those in the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Hosokawa has been reluctant to press the issue. He said today that his country was "in neither active pursuit nor lukewarm retreat" on the matter.
 
Ready for a Larger Role
 Mr. Hosokawa made it clear, though, that while Japan was concerned that its "peace Constitution" -- with its sharp limits on the actions of the military -- could come into conflict with its responsibilities under the United Nations Charter, the country was ready to take the leap.
He also denounced North Korea, saying its growing arsenal of missiles and its attempt to build nuclear weapons were definitely "a threat to our country." Although he said he was interested in building a "defensive shield" to protect Japan, he stopped short of endorsing a proposal made by the United States this week for an elaborate, American-designed missile defense system. But he said the proposal "would be a matter of interest to us."
A descendant of one of Japan's leading samurai families that ruled southern Japan for centuries, Mr. Hosokawa sees his rise to power on a reform platform in a broad historic context.
"In the modern history of Japan, there were three instances of major change," he said. "One was the visit by Commodore Perry, and the ensuing Meiji Restoration," he said, referring to the era in the 1860's when the United States forced the opening of Japan and with it helped speed the downfall of the feudal regime. "The second major change was the end of World War II" and the American Occupation, he said.
But both of those changes "were induced by gaiatsu," he said using the Japanese word for external pressure. "Whereas this time around, for the first time in the modern history of this country, the major change is being generated from inside. This by itself, I believe, is a remarkable thing, almost revolutionary."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
A Cure for Paperwork, Or Just New Headaches?

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
President Clinton's promise to cut the mounting paperwork clogging the American health system will be welcomed by consumers befuddled by complex benefit forms. And it could save a great deal of money for doctors and hospital administrators who have to employ staffs to cope with the bewildering range of forms and requirements imposed by insurers.
But at the same time, critics are asking whether Mr. Clinton's proposed new layers of state and Federal agencies will simply replace one set of costly bureaucratic headaches with another. 
 Under the Clinton plan, hundreds of existing insurance forms would be replaced by a single simplified claim sheet for both doctors and patients. And because standardized benefits packages would replace the widely varying benefits now offered by insurers, consumers would find it easier to compare plans, and doctors and hospitals would save billions now spent paying administrators to decipher what is covered under each patient's policy.
But even if the Clinton plan makes life simpler and less expensive in these ways, a range of health care experts are asking just how much huge new Federal and state agencies and boards will cost, and whether they will simply create more red tape for consumers, doctors, hospitals and businesses.
 
Specter of Monster Agencies
 "There is a tremendous potential for this to become highly bureaucratic and highly regulatory," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a professor of political economy at Princeton University. "The kind of people who run the department of motor vehicles would be the kind of people who would staff the alliances. Who else would staff it?"
Under the Clinton plan, most people and companies would buy health insurance through large regional alliances that would represent perhaps a million consumers or, in big cities, even more. These alliances, set up by state governments, would determine which medical groups and insurers could offer health plans to the public and how much they could charge. They would collect and distribute most insurance premiums and collect and publicize data on the performance of health plans.
Because these alliances are charged with so many responsibilities, critics say they could grow into monsters that would be unresponsive to consumers' problems and become the focus of a new industry for lobbyists and regulatory consultants. The result, they say, is that overall savings in administration may not be as great as the President hopes.
"In the end, I frankly don't think it will simplify things at all," said Joseph A. Califano Jr., a domestic policy aide under President Lyndon B. Johnson and Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under President Jimmy Carter.
 
Staffs of Paper Shufflers
 Still, everyone agrees that paperwork and duplication plague the current system, and some of the Clinton proposals are widely cheered.
Large hospitals now employ entire departments of highly specialized workers just to determine what each patient's insurance policy covers, what information each insurer demands, whether a second or third type of insurance may supplement the patient's primary coverage, and how to redistribute the costs of the uninsured among the bills of insured patients.
In his speech, the President cited the example of Washington Children's Hospital, saying it spent $2 million a year filling out unnecessary forms. If doctors and other medical providers were freed of that paperwork, he said, the hospital could treat 10,000 more children a year.
 
20 Hours a Week on Paperwork
 Medical groups say that many private offices have also been forced to hire administrative staffs to handle forms, and that some doctors spend more than 20 hours a week on paperwork.
The White House estimates that administrative costs account for at least 15 cents of every dollar paid to insurance companies in premiums. The Clinton plan, would cut four to six cents in current administrative costs, an Administration officials say. The new alliances and other new administrative costs would add about 2.5 cents in costs, they say, for a net reduction of between 1.5 cents and 3.5 cents for each dollar spent on health care.
"If you are familiar with the incredible disorder now, you know that things can be better," said Paul Starr, one of the President's advisers on health care. "This plan will be a huge help to small businesses and to consumers."
The White House contends that the Clinton plan would simplify things in several ways.
In addition to the standardized benefit packages and streamlined claims forms, the Administration hopes that employers will no longer need to employ health benefits specialists or pay health insurance agents and brokers to find their employees the best health plans. That would be left to the alliances and the employees themselves.
 
'Major New Bureaucracy'
 The White House also says the Clinton plan would simplify Federal regulations on Medicare and Medicaid and cut bureaucracy by merging the medical benefits of workers compensation and automobile insurance policies with the health plan's coverage.
Mr. Starr said consumers would be safeguarded by the requirement that the alliance's boards include equal numbers of representatives of employers, consumers, the self-employed and other covered groups.
The alliance boards would not include people associated with health care providers, law firms involved with health care, pharmaceutical companies or suppliers of medical equipment and services.
But a number of health economists and public policy specialists say the plan could create bureaucracies that would be at least as expensive as those in the current system. Their concerns center on the alliances.
"I am not sure there is going to be that much savings," said Patricia M. Danzon, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the administrative costs of health care in Canada and the United States. "It all adds up to a major new bureaucracy that is duplicating functions that today are being performed elsewhere in the system."
Experts predict many alliances will collect and distribute more money than the governments of the states in which they operate.
 
Spawning New Lobbies
 Professor Reinhardt said he feared that in cases where consumers find that the alliance has an incorrect address or Social Security number, they might face civil servants who are even less responsive than workers at large insurance companies. To compound the problem, the consumer would no longer have a company benefits manager to argue his or her case.
Mark Pauly, the chairman of health care systems at the Wharton School, said another cost to society of the Clinton plan would be new industries of lobbyists and consultants who specialize in guiding their clients through the various alliances in each state or through dealings with a new Federal entity, the National Health Board, which will oversee the state alliances.
When the states established a comparatively modest process in the 1970's -- requiring certificates of need for hospitals that wanted to expand or reduce their services -- they found they needed to hire teams of experts to help them through the regulatory process.
Mr. Califano said he, too, feared that boards of alliances, which could be appointed by a governor, might become a major source of patronage. In addition, he said, powerful lobbies in Washington and state capitals might protect their clients' profits by preventing crackdowns on excessive costs.
"Most large companies would have a lab test provided by the lowest bidder, for example," Mr. Califano said. "Attempts to do the same thing with Medicare were repeatedly stymied by Congress. Those are the kinds of things that are quick to do in the private sector and are hard to accomplish in the public system."

 The Economy
The Federal Reserve decided against any move to raise interest rates last month because economic growth was sluggish and inflation was abating. Most economists say they believe the Fed embraced a similar neutral stance this week. President Clinton reaffirmed the central bank's independence, saying he opposed nominating the heads of the Fed's 12 district banks. [Page 37.]
The Administration's nominee to head the agency in charge of cleaning up bankrupt failed savings and loans, Stanley Tate, has been waiting since July for a Senate vote on his nomination. He says the delay is prolonging problems at the Resolution Trust Corporation. [37.]
Orders for big-ticket items like cars and computers rose in August for the second time in three months, advancing 2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $131.2 billion in August. [45.]
 
Companies
Pressure is mounting on Paramount's board to consider QVC Inc's $9.9 billion offer at Monday morning's special board meeting, because it could be worth far more than Viacom's bid, which has tumbled in value to $7.8 billion from its initial $8.2 billion. [37.]
General Motors is headed toward employing only 200,000 hourly workers, down from 265,000 now, but a deadline of 1996 seems too early for either G.M. or the U.A.W. [37.]

HEADLINE: Stocks End a Bad Week On a Mostly Flat Note

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The stock market's worst week since February ended yesterday not with a bang but a whimper, as most market indicators were flat or up only modestly in slow trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 70.14 points for the week -- after losses of 37.45 points on Monday and then 38.56 points on Tuesday -- to give the Dow its worst loss in points since the trading week that ended on Feb. 19, the week President Clinton's budget plans sent the market down 70.25 points. 
 But yesterday, the early Yom Kippur weekend and the exhaustion from a tough week left the Dow Jones industrials to close up a modest 3.36 points, at 3,543.11, on volume of 248.3 million shares, down from 275.4 million shares on Thursday. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index finished at 457.63, down 0.11 point.
 
 
Another Nasdaq Record
 The Nasdaq composite index closed up 2.39 points at 754.65, the second consecutive record high.
While events in Russia were part of the reason for Tuesday's big selloff, the situation there yesterday had little discernible effect on the market. The bond market posted gains on a mildly positive economic report, the Commerce Department's announcement that August durable goods orders were up 2 percent, the third increase in seven months and a better gain than most economists had foreseen.
The durable-goods report appeared to have also brought some strength to blue-chip stocks. Among the best performers in the Dow Jones industrial group were Exxon, up 1, to 65 1/2; Caterpillar, up 1 1/8, to 78 1/8, and American Express, up 7/8, to 35 3/4.
Deere was up 2 1/2 at 70 1/8 on a report of an increased earnings forecast. Procter & Gamble rose 7/8, to 47 1/4, on an upgrading from Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Some television networks did well yesterday, with CBS closing up 8 1/2 at 274 and Capital Cities/ABC up 22 1/8, to 571, after the Clinton Administration said it would help broadcasters in their efforts to own and syndicate reruns of prime-time television shows.
Andrea Electronics, which is working on noise-reducing technology, closed down 1 7/8 at 30 7/8. Andrea had gained about 10 points in the last week before its sudden drop.
Integrated Circuit Systems advanced 2, to 17 3/4, on an upgrade from Alex. Brown & Sons.
 
 
Perrigo Plunges
 Perrigo, a maker of over-the-counter drugs and health care products, got a lower rating from Oppenheimer & Company, the day after shareholders filed a plan to sell 13 million shares. The stock plunged 4 1/2, to 29 1/4.
Amgen, the biotechnology company, was downgraded by Merrill Lynch. The stock fell 1 7/8, to 39 3/4.
Autoimmune, which makes a drug for rheumatoid arthritis, gained 2 3/8, to 9, when a study found that the drug helped ease symptoms of the disease.
BEI Holdings, an asset management company, closed up 2, to 6 1/2, when it agreed to a merger.
In Tokyo yesterday, Japanese stocks rose in slow trading. The Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 132.91 points, to 20,307.53. For the week, the Nikkei lost 83.51 points.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN AFRICA;
American Culture (and Goods) Thrive in South Africa

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Sitting in a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, sipping Coca-Cola and listening to a Whitney Houston tape, Gift Neku does not seem like a man starved for Americana.
Indeed, after years of anti-apartheid sanctions -- and, in a perverse way, because of them -- South Africa is a country awash in American consumer goods, colonized by American pop culture, and obsessed with American celebrities. 
 About the only important thing missing is American capital, and that is what Mr. Neku, a 23-year-old black student, hopes will flow as a result of Nelson Mandela's urging for the end of sanctions against his country.
Investment, jobs and prosperity, not Big Macs, Chevys and "Sesame Street," are the bounty Mr. Mandela must deliver, black and white South Africans say.
 
Optimism on the Street
 Although economists have warned that foreign investors will return only warily to a country they see as violently unpredictable, at street level hopes are running high.
"Everyone is just waiting for sanctions to be lifted," said Shabier Samrod, describing the excitement among businessmen who are clients of his burglar-alarm company. "You'll see a lot of investment. You'll find unemployment going down now."
Mr. Neku endorsed the hope, although he cautioned, "It doesn't mean things will go easily. When sanctions are lifted, these companies will still want to come and see the situation. Are they going to invest in a country where people are being killed?"
Rumored projects aside, the only imminent surge of cash is an $850 million loan from the International Monetary Fund, which may become available by the end of the year with Mr. Mandela's blessing.
So far, most of the American companies scouting opportunities here have been bent on selling, not producing. But upon arrival they are often astounded to discover that South Africans are not lacking for things to buy.
 
Well-Stocked Shelves
 Throughout the years of South Africa's moral isolation, about 130 American companies and numerous European concerns retained subsidiaries here, and others that ostentatiously withdrew during the 1980's continued to sell their products through distributors and franchise arrangements.
Supermarket shelves are stocked with Kellogg's cereals, Colgate toiletries, and Johnson floor products. Shopping centers feature Pizza Huts and Benettons.
"Most of the things we want from overseas, we are getting," said Frank Dube, a black schoolteacher, as he towed his young son through the cavernous Toys 'R' Us outlet at a shopping mall in suburban Roodeport.
Where sanctions created gaps, local entrepreneurs have filled them with South African knock-offs.
One brazen entrepreneur recently announced plans to open his own "McDonald's" chain, golden arches and all, asserting that the company had forfeited its trademark.
Culturally, the Americanization of South Africa has been accelerated by a sanctions anomaly.
Although 40 percent of South African whites are of British descent, and many hold United Kingdom passports, South Africa has been denied most British films and television programming because the British actors' union d imposed a stringent boycott.
As a result, seven of the 10 most-watched entertainment shows on South African television are American, topped by "Who's the Boss."
 
A Cultural Predicament
 "We're faced with a predicament," said Johann van Rheede, a spokesman for the South African Broadcasting Corporation, contemplating the end of the English sanctions. "Our children have been weaned on American programming. Though a lot of our population is of British origins, it would be quite a radical change going to British programming."
Likewise, American films monopolize the theaters and American music fills the air, in black townships no less than in white suburbs.
Some whites, like two Afrikaner women studying the ware at Toys 'R' Us, take pleasure in seeing Mr. Mandela imploring the West to invest.
"Mandela's going to get a bankrupt country he himself begged for with his sanctions," said one, who would identify herself only as Marie. "He's beginning to think about that."
"It's mostly his people who are without jobs," added her companion, Hannelie.

HEADLINE: Fed Took A Neutral Rate Stand

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Concluding that economic growth was sluggish and inflation was abating, the Federal Reserve announced today that it had decided last month that there was no need for it to lean toward raising interest rates.
In a surprise to many economists, the Fed took this action unanimously at its Aug. 17 meeting, and most economists say they believe it embraced a similar neutral stance at its meeting on Tuesday, meaning it was not leaning toward raising or lowering rates. 
According to a report released today about the August meeting, Fed officials believed that "economic growth did not seem particularly robust" and that "more favorable performance of key measures of prices in recent months had tended to relieve earlier concerns about a possible worsening of inflation."
 
Usually Consults Members
 Concerned about a spurt in inflation earlier this year, the Fed's policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, adopted a bias toward higher rates in May. Such a bias means the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates if there is a month or two of bad inflationary news.
By tradition, this meant that its chairman could raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of 1 percent without consulting other members. But Fed officials say that Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, does not usually act without first consulting his colleagues.
"They moved to a neutral position because of the obvious softness in the economy and the slower price increases in the summer," said Jay Woodworth, vice president and chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust. By tradition, the neutral position means Mr. Greenspan would have to consult his colleagues before raising rates, though he could act on his own in an emergency.
In a letter released today, President Clinton reaffirmed the central bank's independence by stating that he was opposed to proposals under which the President would nominate the heads of the Fed's 12 district banks.
 
Gonzalez's Argument
 Federal Reserve officials have been wary of that proposal, pushed by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, because they say it would reduce the central bank's independence from political pressures. At present, the presidents of the 12 district banks are chosen by their boards, which are dominated by local bankers and business executives.
Mr. Gonzalez argues that elected officials, rather than bankers, should appoint the regional presidents, who help determine the central bank's monetary policy. For more than a year, he has accused the Fed of preventing a robust recovery by not allowing more growth in the money supply.
The regional presidents hold 5 of the 12 votes on the Federal Open Market Committee, which helps determine policy on short-term interest rates. The other seats are held by the Federal Reserve Board's seven members, all of whom must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
In a letter sent to Mr. Gonzalez on Sept. 20, President Clinton said his proposal had merit, but there were also arguments on the other side.
"I am disinclined to seek a change in the Federal Reserve Act at this juncture," the President wrote.
In what some economists construed as praise for Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Clinton said the Federal Reserve System "is functioning well and does not need an overhaul just now."
"Changing the way bank presidents are elected at this time," he added, "runs the risk of undermining market confidence in the Fed."
Mr. Clinton also said, "There is virtue in having the Federal Open Market Committee input (and votes) that truly come from outside Washington."
 
Factors Against Increase
 In the Fed's summary of the August meeting, the central bankers said several factors argued against changing rates in the near future: slow economic growth in the first six months, the drag on growth associated with the President's deficit-reduction efforts, and the encouraging inflation statistics of recent months.
Nonethless, the central bankers made clear that a rate increase was inevitable eventually.
They again voiced concern that inflation might pick up steam because real interest rates -- interest rates minus the inflation rate -- were zero and sometimes negative in recent months.
The summary stated: "This conclusion was seen as reinforcing the view that monetary policy probably would have to move in the direction of restraint at some point to resist any incipient tendency for inflationary pressures to intensify."
David M. Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said he was surprised by the Fed's abandonment of its bias toward higher rates. He said there was a chance the central bank went back to its tilt to higher rates at Tuesday's meeting because of some signs of stronger growth and because the August rise in inflation of three-tenths of 1 percent was slightly larger than expected.

HEADLINE: Lillian R. Kessler Is Dead at 85; Established an Export Company

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Lillian Ruth Kessler, founder of the Kessler International Corporation, which exports railroad parts, electronics and heavy industrial equipment to Asia, Africa and South America, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 85.
Her daughter, Elinor Fuchs, said her mother had Alzheimer's disease. 
 Ms. Kessler founded the company in 1946. It is now based in Rockville, Md.
Before she established the business Ms. Kessler served for a year as an analyst for the Foreign Economic Administration, a Federal agency, conducting studies of postwar industrialization in Ethiopia and China. She then worked as an industrial economist for an international engineering firm and as a foreign markets consultant for the Sinclair Oil Corporation.
 
W.P.A. History Project
 While still a doctoral student in economic history in what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ms. Kessler was asked to direct a pilot history project for the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program established in 1935 to provide employment through public works projects; eventually, the history project grew into the W.P.A.'s Historical Records Survey.
Ms. Kessler was named the director of the project for Ohio in 1939. During her work with the W.P.A. she wrote a guidebook to American folk songs, "Songs of Yesterday: A Song Anthology of American Life," with Philip D. Jordan.
She was born in Cleveland and attended Radcliffe College before enrolling at the Cleveland university, where she received an undergraduate degree in 1929.
In 1930 she married Joseph Fuchs, the violinist, who was then with the Cleveland Orchestra. They divorced in 1940.
Besides her daughter, Ms. Kessler is survived by a brother, Dr. Edwin S. Kessler of Washington, and two granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Panel Approves Proposal For a Stadium in Hartford

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 24

 BODY:
A select committee of the General Assembly today approved Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s proposal to build a $252 million football stadium in Hartford if -- and the ifs are still many -- the New England Patriots of the National Football League can be induced to move here from Foxboro, Mass.
The 28-to-4 vote set up a final debate on Monday before the full House and Senate that supporters believe will be just as lopsided in favor of a measure that for the moment is entirely conditional: only if the team is sold to an investors' group that has promised to relocate here, and only if the league then approves the move, which has not even been formally proposed, would any state money be spent. 
 But even as a resolution, and perhaps indeed partly because it was a resolution that in the end might signify little or nothing, much of the committee's debate was couched in broad terms about the future of Connecticut's capital city.
 
Proposal Called Irresponsible
 Several dissenting lawmakers said that with gang-related crime on the increase, the school system in trouble and layoffs continuing in core industries like insurance, making a commitment to build a stadium for use perhaps 22 times a year by the Patriots and the University of Connecticut football team was irresponsible. Others cited studies showing that football stadiums in some cases have been notorious money losers for the home-team cities.
People on both sides of the issue cited concerns about the Travelers Corporation, the city's second-largest employer, which this week announced a merger with the Primerica Corporation of New York, raising the fear that another old-line Connecticut company will be answering to a corporate parent with allegiances elsewhere.
"How do I say to somebody in my district that's been laid off by Travelers, or laid off by Aetna, or laid off by Pratt & Whitney, well don't worry, at least you can go to the football game?" said Representative Robert Farr, a Republican from West Hartford and one of the dissenting voters.
 
Attracting Suburbanites
 One supporter responded that the stadium would be worth its cost if suburban residents who now shun downtown could be induced to make the trip -- even if it was only 22 times a year. Besides, having a football team would put Hartford on the map as never before.
"I don't think that even though the state is in bad times we must put on a hair shirt and never enthusiastically grab at something that might give a lot of pleasure to some people," said Representative Andrew McCall Norton, a Republican from Colchester who voted yes. "I don't think that just because things are quite bad you should neglect to do some things that are perhaps no better described than fun."
Because of all the caveats and hedged bets, supporting the 70,000-seat stadium is also for now an idea that carries very little risk, and many lawmakers and local officials have jumped aboard enthusiastically.
Hartford's Mayor, Carrie Saxon Perry, who is running a hard-fought three-way race for re-election in November, pledged this week -- to cheers from a noontime crowd at a downtown rally-- that she would exchange her trademark big floppy hat for a Patriots' helmet at the first home game.
Mr. Weicker, who is credited with putting the Patriots plan in motion earlier this summer, also said today that he would announce his plans on whether to run for a second term as governor next week, perhaps even as "Pumped for the Pats" buttons are expected to reach their maximum degree of visibility on Capitol lapels.
State economic development officials in Massachusetts, meanwhile, said today that they believe the chances of the Patriots' moving out are almost nil. This summer Gov. William F. Weld proposed building a $700 million convention and sports center to house the Patriots in Boston's South Bay. And even if the plan is not approved by the Massachusetts Legislature this year, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Office of Economic Affairs, Kevin P. Kutz, said that "our calls on these things suggest that the Patriots will stay."
With the new Massachusetts stadium approved, Mr. Kutz added, "a long shot would recede to the infinitesimal."
Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner of the N.F.L., has also expressed the view that the Patriots should not be moved.
"The commissioner thinks a downtown Boston stadium would best serve the long-term interest of the Patriots," said a league spokesman, Greg Aiello.
Mr. Weicker said in comments to reporters, however, that simply by making the commitment to build a stadium, the state is playing in the big leagues and that team owners everywhere -- perhaps the Patriots, perhaps someone else -- will notice.
"Nothing could send a stronger message than that Connecticut is in the position to provide a stadium," he said. "That's probably the single most important factor in getting the Patriots here."

HEADLINE: Durable-Goods Data Show Rise in U.S. Manufacturing

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Orders to American factories for big-ticket items like cars and computers rose in August for the second time in three months, the Government said today.
Economists took the report as evidence that manufacturing was starting to recover from a slump earlier this year, but they said the rebound was not fast enough to produce significant hiring. 
 Orders rose 2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $131.2 billion in August, following a 2.8 percent drop in July and a 4.3 percent gain in June, the Commerce Department said. From March through May, new orders declined for three consecutive months.
 
 
'Slowly Picking Up the Pieces'
 Mark M. Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa., said the latest gain "is just one more piece of evidence the manufacturing base is slowly picking up the pieces from the dismal performance it had in the first half."
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production, increased 3.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $133.9 billion, their largest rise since December 1992.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the latest increase in orders "confirms our confidence that economic growth will pick up in the second half of the year."
Mr. Zandi and other analysts, however, noted that a key indicator of future factory employment continued to deteriorate in August.
 
 
Backlog of Orders Falls
 The backlog of unfilled orders fell six-tenths of a percent, to $432.9 billion, the lowest level since July 1988. It was the sixth consecutive decline and the 25th in 30 months.
With the backlog falling, hiring is generally not needed.
"Shipments are still going out faster than orders are coming in, so the backlog whittled down somewhat," said Stuart G. Hoffman, an economist with the PNC Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh. "That says there won't be a robust jump in production. But it doesn't preclude a more moderate improvement in production and some leveling off in layoffs."
Analysts say that manufacturers have worked down inventories that built up in the spring and that sales have improved, especially for autos. But manufacturing cannot begin growing strongly, they say, until the Japanese and Germans recover from recessions and start buying more American goods.
"The critical factor for boosting growth in the remainder of 1993 will be the performance of trade and, currently, exports are achieving only slow gains in the face of sluggish global demand," said Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers.
In August, orders for transportation equipment jumped 7.9 percent, following a 16.3 percent drop in July. The latest increase was bolstered by gains in aircraft and autos.
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders rose three-tenths of a percent, the third consecutive increase.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Mark As Concern on Russia Eases

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the German mark and other European currencies yesterday as concerns about Russia's political crisis eased. Gold prices also retreated.
Even so, investors refrained from selling dollars aggressively, to protect themselves in case President Boris N. Yeltsin's power struggle with his rivals in the Russian Parliament intensifies during the weekend, traders said. 
 "People are still nervous about what might happen in Russia over the weekend," said Carl Amendola, vice president at Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank. "They're in a wait-and-see mood."
In late New York trading, the dollar dropped to 1.6395 marks, from 1.6430 marks on Thursday. And the British pound rose to $1.5090 from $1.5060. But the dollar edged up to 106 Japanese yen from 105.90 yen.
Meanwhile, gold for October delivery slipped 60 cents, to $357.50 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Considered a haven from international strife, the dollar had risen almost 3 percent against the mark since Tuesday, when Mr. Yeltsin dissolved the Russian Parliament to thwart hard-liners who oppose his economic policies.
The dollar surged against the mark in London amid reports that Mr. Yeltsin had ordered his supporters to disarm crowds guarding the Parliament building. But it later retreated after Mr. Yeltsin said he would not storm the building, and the Parliament's leader, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, said he would not use force to defend it.
"Yeltsin seems to have everything under control," said Ezra Zask, president of Ezra Zask Associates, a currency trading fund with $105 million under management that is based in Norfolk, Conn. "It's hard to see how he could be undermined."
Still, the situation remained tenuous enough to keep the dollar in demand. "Anything can happen in Russia over the weekend," David De Rosa, foreign exchange manager at the Swiss Bank Corporation, said.
Meanwhile, the dollar finished slightly higher against the yen afterTreasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as saying the United States was comfortable with the dollar's value. Traders had driven the dollar down as much as 20 percent this year amid signs that the Administration wanted the yen to strengthen in order to curb Japan's swelling trade surplus.

HEADLINE: For Computer Convention, Be Sure to Pack Vision

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Sept. 23

 BODY:
Not since George Bush was under fire for what he called "the vision thing" has any chief executive -- whether government or corporate -- drawn so much criticism and commentary on that subject as Louis V. Gerstner Jr. after a remark he made two months ago. At the time, the new I.B.M. chairman was announcing a dreadful financial result for the company, a dividend cut and another round of shedding workers and plants.
"The last thing I.B.M. needs right now," Mr. Gerstner said, "is a vision." 
 His statement, if nothing else, showed that Mr. Gerstner, who previously headed a cigarette maker and before that a credit card company, is an untutored newcomer to the computer industry. Mr. Gerstner explained his remark by saying that the most pressing need for the International Business Machines Corporation was to get the basic economics of the company in order so that it could stop losing billions of dollars a year.
 
Regular Rules Don't Apply
 In most industries, that might seem a reasonable view. Not in the computer business, where to call someone a "visionary" is the highest accolade, and chief executives are expected to market not merely products but "visions" of America's high-tech future and how their companies will help shape it. Which is why Mr. Gerstner's comment hit such a nerve: he spoke heresy.
One way to understand the importance of "the vision thing" to the computer digerati was to spend the early part of this week here, where a few hundred executives gathered to talk to themselves about their industry's future. Called Agenda, and presided over by the wry, chubby editor of Infoworld, Stewart Alsop, the annual conference attracts most of the big names in the personal computer industry: Bill Gates of Microsoft, John Sculley of Apple, Jim Manzi of Lotus, Eckhard Pfeiffer of Compaq, Michael Dell of Dell Computer, Philippe Kahn of Borland, and many others.
The topic for this year's gathering, held at a sprawling luxury desert resort, the Phoenician, was "digital convergence," which means the expected technological melding of computers, telecommunications, television and publishing.
Convergence is a big conceptual ball of string that wraps in 500 television channels and the information superhighway, hand-held personal digital assistants and massively parallel supercomputers, computers that talk back and intelligent software "agents" programmed to act as a person's alter ego. It is the ultimate high-tech vision -- and a $3.5 trillion business, by one estimate -- beckoning on the horizon.
The personal computer business is still young and self-confident. To the people here, it is more than a business. The industry's mission, one executive said, is to "make great products, build companies and change the world." The notion that the business combines capitalism, progress and virtue is an implicit part of the vision. And they take their high-minded mission, and themselves, seriously.
A telling moment came during an after-dinner speech given by the publisher Rupert Murdoch's emissary to this gathering, John Evans, the president of News Electronic Data. Mr. Evans pointed out that his company was interested in the new fields not to pursue "the great cause of the electronic media," but to pursue profit. "I don't know about you, but I'm in it for the money," he declared with refreshing candor. When he paused, there was dead silence; not a chuckle or a clap to be heard.
Whether the vision animating most computer executives is really any different from the vision driving other business executives -- namely, stringing together enough financially respectable calendar quarters to hold on to their jobs -- is open to question. Another question is whether vision and success are much related in the computer industry, or any other.
It can be argued that the success of Mr. Gates, the foremost entrepreneur of the last decade, did not have much to do with vision. Not much, that is, unless getting plucked from anonymity in 1981 by I.B.M. to supply the software operating system for the I.B.M. PC and eventually developing a program, Windows, that mimics the easy-to-use software of the Apple Macintosh qualify as startlingly original visions.
Maybe they do, and Mr. Gates is undeniably brilliant. But drive, timing and sheer energy would seem to be a big part of the vision thing. Mr. Gates held court into the nights here, all but shutting down the hotel himself, debating any and all comers in his combative style, clearly enjoying the sheer sport of it.
High-tech executives seem to possess the most vision when their companies are doing well, and their vision vanishes when fortunes change. This, of course, is a computer industry reworking of the economist John Kenneth Galbraith's adage that genius is a rising market.
 
A Fickle Accolade
 Not long ago, Mr. Sculley of Apple was hailed in the financial press and on Wall Street as a "technovisionary." But since Apple has been pummeled in the personal computer price wars, with losses and work force cuts, Mr. Sculley has been replaced as chief executive and no one talks about his vision anymore.
"It's a roller coaster ride," Mr. Sculley said. "We're either given more credit than we deserve, or it's the other way. It's not much in the middle."
Yet high-tech visions, properly marketed, can be useful and profitable. Roger McNamee, a general partner of Integral Capital Partners, an investment firm specializing in the computer industry, cited a possible byproduct of the hype about a brave new digital future: a financial mania.
"We could find ourselves at the center of some truly loony behavior," he told the group. "And we could benefit if we're quick and smart."
Some essential conditions for a speculative mania are in place, Mr. McNamee. The digital revolution is new and it has people excited, and the excitement is fueled not only by greed but also by patriotic fervor, with the likes of Vice President Al Gore promoting the data superhighway.
Still, Mr. MacNamee told the computer executives that some care and caution is advisable. Remember, he said, "Several of the business visionaries of the 1980's, like Mike Milken and Ivan Boesky, served jail time."

HEADLINE: Lunch Break

 BODY:
It's refreshing to have an Administration in Washington that finally takes child nutrition seriously. Last week Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy promised to improve the quality of federally financed school lunches.
The link between diet and chronic disease makes this a serious issue. About 25 million children -- nearly 60 percent of all public-school students -- are fed through the Agriculture Department's lunch program, most at reduced cost or no cost. For many children this is the only meal of the day. 
 Too often the lunches are crammed with fat, cholesterol and sodium. The average school meal, the Agriculture Department estimates, derives about 40 percent of its calories from fat -- violating common dietary guidelines, which recommend a maximum of 30 percent.
A disturbing new report by the consumer advocacy group Public Voice for Food and Health Policy finds that more than half the children in the school lunch program eat less than one serving of fruit a day. About a third of them consume less than one daily serving of vegetables, and their vegetable of choice is fried potatoes.
Under its new "Fresh Start" initiative, the Agriculture Department plans to reduce fat and salt, and double the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables provided to schools under the commodities program, from 8.8 million to 16 million pounds, beginning this school year. That's not much of an increase for each student. But it's progress -- if the department can solve some daunting delivery problems in getting the produce to the schools in good condition.
Mr. Espy promises no more cuts in the financing of the school lunch program. But improving the offerings on the tray may require some increase in funding, which, adjusted for inflation, has decreased over the past decade.
Obviously, any attempt to change kids' eating habits comes up against all those junk food ads on television and the entrenched patterns of many school lunch administrators. But Ellen Haas, the former head of the Public Voice group, whom Mr. Espy has chosen to lead the new effort, is right to be optimistic. "It's not alien for kids to eat fruits and vegetables," she observes. What they need, for starters, is fresher, tastier choices.

HEADLINE: The Black Caucus Gets Mugged

 BODY:
In the days ahead, the Congressional Black Caucus may find itself in an advantageous position. In a Congress riven with discord over Nafta, the economy and other issues, the Black Caucus counts 39 votes in the House, and 1 in a Senate that often produces squeaker votes.
But the Black Caucus's chairman, Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland, seems not to understand the uses of power. When Mr. Mfume embraced Louis Farrakhan last week in Washington, he temporarily lost the savvy he has shown while legislating, and behaved like a novice. Mr. Mfume was had. So was the Black Caucus. 
 The occasion for this mugging was the Caucus's annual legislative meeting, specifically a panel on race and politics at the Washington Convention Center. The participants included Mr. Mfume, Mr. Farrakhan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Benjamin Chavis of the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Farrakhan's presence was an invitation to trouble, given his previous anti-Semitic railings and especially his description of Judaism as "a gutter religion."
Mr. Mfume declared a detente between the Caucus and the Black Muslims, among others. "No longer will we allow people to divide us," he said, adding that such a union was needed to bring about "change." Some say Mr. Mfume, who only recently abandoned radical for mainstream politics, was "caught up in the moment" and broached the issue without consulting the Caucus.
Perhaps. But his conduct suggests a misconception about what constitutes genuine leadership and whence its power flows. The members of the Black Caucus were given mandates and missions by the voters who sent them to Washington. They have a real political foundation of voters who expect "change," all right, but expect it in legislation that will benefit them.
It's reasonable for the Caucus to reach out. But Mr. Mfume and his duly elected colleagues needn't be threatened or guilt-tripped into sharing platforms with people without portfolio who would soon drop from sight if the press ceased to cover them -- or if the Black Caucus ceased to invite them to conferences.
Mr. Mfume diluted his hard-won authority of office by extending it to a freelance rhetorician well known as a hater. The Caucus gets only bad karma and negative publicity in return.
That's a political mugging, pure and simple. The chairman of the Black Caucus ought to know better. Perhaps his membership can teach him.

HEADLINE: Viewing the Stock Market as a Savings Vehicle;
Greed and Fear Cycles

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on the surge in mutual fund investments (Sept. 7) deserves our full attention. The greed cycle that has dominated the market and led to historic highs will yield, as it always must, to fear, compounded by the growing realization that the malaises that plague us run exceedingly deep. The economies of the Western world aren't likely to "recover" any time soon. 
 If stocks plunge, billions of dollars in real savings will be transferred out of the pockets of investors, accompanied by loud cries of woe. This is likely to deal yet another in a long series of blows to our economy, most of which may be directly attributed to Wall Street's obsessive concentration on short-term gain.
When it is over, the move to very low interest rates that drove this money out of the banks and into the market will (like the deregulation of the savings and loans) suddenly appear to have been a huge mistake, but by then it will be too late.
Capitalism may indeed be the best system we know of for improving the global standard of living and creating wealth, but it has become a slave to bankers and economists who are unable to look any further than the next balance sheet. Recent history suggests these professionals have collapsed into a sociological black hole, from which they are unable to observe the real world or the human beings in it.
The best proof of this is that economists cannot understand why Americans aren't out there "feeling more confident" and spending again. Apparently they don't realize that the middle class has no disposable income left. Most of us can no longer afford to live in the brave new world that bankers, lawyers, insurance brokers and health care professionals have created, a world where we cannot save for the future even if we do have the means.
No, in order to realize "reasonable rates of return," our investment gurus now advise us to pump our cash into the growth of our national short-term economic cancer. This after years of being told that America must save more! How surreal. If the market does indeed drop, and our savings do evaporate, you may be sure we will be treated to lectures from our economists about how that's really actually good for us, just like leveraged buyouts and junk bonds.
Unless things start to change, we may ultimately all live to see Karl Marx's prediction that capitalism carries the seeds of its own destruction within itself proved correct. What comes next? I'm not sure I want to know.

HEADLINE: Trials of a Small Business in New York City

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Every day I see something in the newspaper or on television explaining how New York City is going to make it easier for small businesses to operate because they are the nucleus of a successful economy. 
 I am the owner of just such a business. I have run a small discount store for the last eight years on the West Side of Manhattan, during which I have been continually harassed. Here is a typical week:
Monday: Truck making a delivery gets a $55 ticket for parking in front of my store for 10 minutes to unload.
Tuesday: I get a $50 summons from a Sanitation inspector because someone tore up some Lotto tickets on the sidewalk. (I'm supposed to have an employee outside all day with a broom.)
Wednesday: Two storm troopers from the Department of Environmental Protection enter my store with cameras to take a picture of my bathroom. I'm handed a violation because it has improper ventilation. (I've served on jury duty in city courts where not only is the toilet not ventilated but did not even have running water.)
In previous weeks, I have been given summonses for having a "We develop film" sign outside the store, having a sign with my name atop it, and having a tiny hole in a basement step where I store merchandise downstairs. That's a summons on each of three levels. Where should I conduct business, in a helicopter?
Is this my reward for paying sales, commercial rent, occupancy, city, state and Federal taxes, plus a $2,500 monthly rent for a store worth no more than $700 a month? Shouldn't somebody reassess how to make it easier for small businesses to operate in New York City?

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds That Play the Markets for You

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
Mutual fund companies are casting a wide net for neophyte investors who lack the desire or the skill to construct their own fund portfolios. The product of the moment? Asset allocation funds.
These funds can buy stocks, bonds and cash in any combination. Their selling points are instant diversity and the flexibility to respond to market conditions. But that built-in flexibility means that funds flying the asset-allocation banner may have very little in common. 
 "The whole category is so loosely organized that there are no hard-and-fast rules," said Thomas A. Desmond, associate editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, a Chicago newsletter.
 
Know Your Manager
 To know what you're getting, you need to look much more closely at the fund's investment strategy and at its manager than you would with other types of funds. "I'd want to have a lot of confidence in the manager," Mr. Desmond said.
Some asset allocation funds are free to shift nearly their entire portfolio into stocks or bonds, or even cash. In fact, the Blanchard Strategic Growth Fund used a huge cash position to create an outstanding return of 16.4 percent in 1987.
Since then, asset allocation funds have grown in number from 12 to 64. Fidelity Investments has heavily promoted its Asset Manager for retirement accounts in full-page advertisements, and the fund's assets have doubled from $3.4 billion in January to $6.9 billion. The Dreyfus Corporation jumped in the market in July.
These hybrid funds are close cousins to the better-established balanced group. As a rule, balanced funds own relatively fixed ratios of stocks and bonds, usually in a 60-40 mix.
 Balanced funds have been the better performers. For the three years ended in June, they returned an average of 11.6 percent a year, compared with 9.9 percent for asset allocation funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
Some critics say the lag in performance may come from the huge amount of data that the allocation funds must follow: central bank policies, business cycles, stock values, inflation rates and sector performance in markets here and abroad.
"We have yet to find a single organization with all the necessary expertise in stock, bond and money markets," said Michael D. Hirsch, president of Hirsch Investment Management in New York.
Investors who have designed a mix of stocks, bonds and cash in a portfolio of funds may want to shy away from these funds and their unpredictable combinations. Mr. Hirsch says investors would be better off combining several growth funds with bond funds and a money market fund.
 Still, investors who own just one fund or who like the concept of one-stop shopping might go the allocation fund route. They should look for a fund whose strategy matches their risk tolerance and investment goals.
Picking a fund may be dicey, given that the top 10 performers in the last three years excelled using very different tactics. Cash holdings recently ranged from zero to 43 percent, stocks from 18 to 67 percent, and bonds from 2 to 64 percent.
Among them, Fidelity Asset Manager has kept a relatively stable mix over the last four-plus years, with cash a quarter of the portfolio, bonds 35 percent and stocks the remainder.
 Phoenix Total Return generally puts half its portfolio into stocks and splits the remainder between bonds and cash. Right now, more than half its assets are in cash. "The big decision has been to get out of bonds -- and it's been a bad decision so far," said Robert Milnamow, its manager.
 Quest for Value Opportunity also has a small amount in bonds, just 5 percent. It is heavily invested in stocks, with 10 percent in cash.
Merrill Lynch Global Allocation has changed its spots a few times. Cash has jumped from 15 to more than 25 percent, stocks from 40 to 45 percent, and bonds, 35 to 40 percent.
FBL Managed marches to a different drummer. In the last two years, the fund has averaged 80 percent in bonds, mainly convertible bonds. Its manager, Roger Grefe, calls convertible securities "the most undervalued part of the market."

HEADLINE: A Corporate Image Problem;
Fighting for the Rights To the Ameritec(h) Flag

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Ameritec v. Ameritech is more that just a battle over an 'h' this time. Now it's over a $30 million image campaign.
As part of the promotional campaign, the Ameritech Corporation, the Chicago-based telephone company that serves much of the Midwest, is wiping out its old signature as a Baby Bell company and raising a freshly designed corporate logo. 
 Therein lies the latest problem. The new logo's typeface and red- white-and-blue color scheme resembles the flag and hues of the Ameritec Company, a Covina, Calif., manufacturer of phone-testing equipment.
The companies have already been at loggerheads over the similarity of their names, and in 1986, they reached a licensing agreement over the Ameritec name and its variations.
Privately owned Ameritec sold $30 million worth of equipment to local and long-distance phone companies and businesses last year. Its logo has been the same since its founding in 1980.
Earlier this week, Ameritec filed suit in Federal District Court here seeking to prohibit Ameritech from rolling out its new logo.
Mike Brand, an Ameritech spokesman, said nothing in the 1986 agreement "precludes us from changing the logo."
But Jeff Briggs, Ameritec's lawyer, said that part of the agreement included the promise that both companies avoid taking steps that would create confusion. "They've done exactly what they said they wouldn't do," he said.
Mr. Brand said: "We're not creating confusion. We're putting $30 million into further differentiating us from other communications companies in the industry."
Typically, disputes like Ameritec v. Ameritech result from an oversight by a designer rather than deliberate imitation, said David Stewart, a University of Southern California professor and consumer behavior expert.
"Given that the phone company changed its logo, the small company will have a stronger leg to stand on because of first use," he said.
Courts often use a test of economic harm in disputes involving confusion over trademarks. There, Ameritec's cause is undercut because the companies share few common markets, Mr. Stewart said.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
Of Candy Bars and Public Art

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
There is a new paradigm for public art in this country. It is not always easy to distinguish from social work, and it is certainly a long way in conception from the old model of "plop" art, with its casual regard for the relationship between sculpture and site. The new public art also goes beyond the percent-for-art programs that emerged during the 1970's and 80's and aspired to bring artists and architects closer together in planning new buildings and urban designs.
The latest brand of public art is something else again: artists collaborating directly with the communities that will come into contact with the work, the process of collaboration becoming, in many cases, as important as the end result.
The approach, strictly speaking, isn't new. Its roots -- and the problems it poses -- go back at least to the 1960's, grounded as they are in movements like Process Art and Performance Art, and in the left-wing political activism that moved artists of that time from their studios to the streets (not only here but abroad, as in London, where Conrad Atkinson and Stephen Willats collaborated with workers from the East End). The political art of recent years has spawned a new generation of artists and curators who have picked up strands of 60's thinking and adapted them to 90's issues.
The latest manifestation of the new public art has been in evidence here, during the last few months, in a program that winds down this week called "Culture in Action." It was sponsored by Sculpture Chicago, supported by money from the National Endowment for the Arts and various private groups and organized by Mary Jane Jacob, an independent curator. The program (total cost around $800,000) is actually eight separate projects, mostly in neighborhoods distant -- if not geographically, then economically and sociologically -- from Chicago's gleaming commercial heart.
The outcomes of such projects have been about as far from the towering Picasso and Calder sculptures that adorn Chicago's Loop as can be imagined; they have taken the form of block parties and parades, paint charts, chocolate bars and hydroponically grown leafy vegetables.
One project is based in the hotly contested area near Maxwell Street, for a century a thriving Old World bazaar in the shadow of the Loop. There, city planners and a nearby university have combined to raze blocks as part of a scheme to build athletic fields and other structures and eliminate the busy marketplace that still caters mostly to low-income people.
Another project took place on a West Town street, a couple of miles west of the Loop, occupied mainly by Latinos and fractured by competing gangs. Yet another took place in a factory where a dozen union workers from a large chocolate company banded together to design their own candy bar and wrapper. And a project that involved hundreds of people united members of disparate communities across the city, including a Mexican-American neighborhood around Harrison Park and the black neighborhood around Garfield Park.
The Chicago program is only one example of the new public art. In a kind of collaboration with their South Bronx neighbors, John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres have produced sculptures depicting residents of that community. Other public art blurs the division between advertising and art, volunteerism and Conceptualism. The red ribbon that has come to symbolize concern about AIDS was conceived by artists who belong to a group called Visual Aids -- a whopping success by the standards of the new public art.
Programs like the one here in Chicago highlight many of the knotty questions that the new public art raises. The questions are not only about esthetics. They are also about the often fine line dividing exploitation and collaboration in the relationships between artists and their communities. Such programs raise the now inevitable questions about public financing, too: Would the money be better spent on established social programs, not to mention art that aspires to something more visually ambitious than a leafy vegetable?
How, in fact, do you compare a leafy vegetable with a park designed by Vito Acconci, much less with a Titian? For that matter, how do you compare the social service provided by these art projects with the work done by real social service organizations?
AND HOW DO YOU COMPARE SUCH projects even with the political art that filled the last Whitney Biennial and the Aperto at the Venice Biennale? An essential element distinguishes this new public art from much of what was on view in New York and Italy: it eschews galleries and museums, where such art often takes on a boutiquish odor. The work may stem from the same ideas and idealism that inspire artists to make sculptures and installations for more conventional sites, but it takes those ideas in a different direction. It is not primarily about addressing the traditional art public and its debates over quality.
What may come to mind is the recent brouhaha involving three artists in Southern California who doled out $10 bills to undocumented migrant workers. By all accounts, that publicity stunt masquerading as art had nothing to do with serious collaboration between the artists and the workers; both as social service and as a meditation on the problems at the Mexican-American border it was laughably meager. Its real audience was the art world and its critics, among whom the gesture of giving away public money for the arts had precisely the intended incendiary effect. Had it not provoked a response from that group, the whole gesture would have been, on the face of it, empty.
One can think of that California project as the new public art at its worst. But much of the new public art is different. It almost always derives from good intentions. Of course, the streets of Chicago's West Side are paved with them.
Some of the "Culture in Action" projects are examples of such well-intended duds. Suzanne Lacy, who for years has been putting together spectacles and performances that involve large groups of people, organized one of the most disappointing and tradition-bound projects with a group of women from around the city. The group drew up a list of 100 local women of distinction, dead and alive, chosen from more than 400 nominations solicited through newspapers and women's organizations; then limestone rocks, each embedded with a brass plate bearing the name of one of the women, were distributed around the Loop.
The impulse to recognize the achievements of these mostly unheralded women was admirable. But the rocks, with their small and difficult-to-read plaques, turn out to be undistinguished testimonials to distinguished women, clunky obstacles on busy streets where they may be likelier to annoy than to enlighten passers-by. As to an even more questionable component of Ms. Lacy's project, a dinner party to which Gloria Steinem, Anita Hill and a small group of other prominent women have been invited, it is difficult to see why such a private event, oddly caricaturing Caryl Churchill's caustic 1983 play, "Top Girls," should be underwritten by a public art program (even if it is videotaped for outsiders to see).
Another dubious project involved the artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler, who asked a group of residents of Ogden Courts Apartments, a housing project, to help them design a paint chart, each color relating to some event in the history of public housing or some aspect of life in such housing -- Urban Renewal Lime, Cabrini Green, Pruitt-Igoe Dust. (It is being distributed in paint stores.)
Some Ogden Courts residents, Ms. Jacob volunteered, wondered quite understandably what possible benefit they derived from contributing to this artsy exercise, especially one that reduced catastrophes like Pruitt-Igoe to something as decorous as a wall coloring. It was agreed that after completing the chart, Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler would collaborate with the residents on thinking up something more to the point.
Yet another well-meaning but fuzzily conceived project is by a quartet of artists who call themselves Haha. In a storefront in Rogers Park, near Evanston, they have joined a group of residents and others to create a hydroponic garden. The aim is to make the storefront a meeting place for AIDS volunteers and people interested in discussing AIDS, the garden becoming both a source of therapeutic food for people with AIDS and a metaphor for nurturing and caring.
The artists in Haha are sensitive people dealing with an immense problem about which they are trying, as artists, to make some constructive statement. But with all the serious work to be done and already being done by volunteer AIDS organizations, the project seems hopelessly precious, not to say ineffectual. The garden is too small to be much of a contribution, and in any case, its physiological benefits are questionable. And where is the art in all this? As metaphor, the garden is trite. As interior design, the storefront is unexceptional. Surely this can't be described as good Performance or Process Art, either, even by the most generous definitions of those terms.
SO WHAT ARE THE BEST OF THE "Culture in Action" projects? A local artist named Inigo Manglano-Ovalle organized a block party on Erie Street near Wood Street in West Town, collaborating over many months with children and teen-agers, gangs, and community organizations. For the party, which took place late last month, more than 70 video monitors were set up along the street. They displayed videotapes of neighborhood residents made by the young people with whom Mr. Manglano-Ovalle collaborated. The young people were trained in the use of video; they decided on the subject matter of the tapes, and some of the equipment they used was contributed to the neighborhood after the project was finished so the young people could continue to make videos with it.
Gangs that usually fight over turf banded together for the party and for the supervision of the street. And where was the art here? In the more than 40 visually lively tapes made by the young people. In the theater of the party. And in the peculiarly artistic demonstration of community solidarity.
Another project was put together by Daniel J. Martinez, the artist responsible for the notorious "I Can't Imagine Ever Wanting to Be White" buttons at the Whitney Biennial. For "Culture in Action" he did something as sensitive and upbeat as the buttons were crude and off-putting. He spent around two years enlisting 800 volunteers from Mexican-American and black neighborhoods that don't generally mix with each other. The group organized a colorful, costume-filled parade that moved from one neighborhood to the other, stopping in between at Maxwell Street. Like Mr. Manglano-Ovalle's project, this was an artistic, theatrical illustration of community organization and embrace.
At the same time, Mr. Martinez created an installation on a fenced-in lot near Maxwell Street that is owned by the University of Illinois at Chicago, which is trying to drive out the market. The installation (done without the university's involvement) consists of a platform made from giant granite blocks. The blocks come from a plaza that the university designed during the mid-60's for its campus several blocks away.
That plaza partook of the sort of now discredited liberal design mentality of the time that obliterated old neighborhoods and replaced them with housing projects. Its destruction, and the use of its remains on the disputed site of an old neighborhood that the university asserts it will improve by eliminating is thus full of reverberations and double-entendres. The platform Mr. Martinez has created also suggests a giant soapbox, a place for speakers to exhort crowds. His sentiments are clearly with one side. But his spare installation avoids preaching and, like good political art, aims at provoking serious debate without pretending to be able to effect major change.
There are obviously plenty of pitfalls with the new public art. One of the most dangerous, condescending assumptions that can underlie it is ghettoization under the guise of public outreach -- that art for lower-income communities, immigrant communities, must take the form of social activism, that the history of Western culture as presented in museums is irrelevant to such people.
Yet another danger -- perhaps an inevitability -- is that such projects as "Culture in Action" will be imitated by every arts organization that wants to seem trendy and politically correct, turning what should be painstaking and long-term community involvement into the quick-hit, radical-chic, plop art of the 90's. Fly in the artists, stage an event with the city's downtrodden, alert the media! Ms. Jacob says she has already received calls from organizations around the country that would like her to put together in their cities something similar to what she put together in Chicago. No wonder she is reluctant to speak of paradigms.

HEADLINE: EUROPE: FALL AND WINTER;
Stronger Dollar Eases Pain of Prices

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING; ALAN RIDING is chief of the Paris bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
FOR European governments, currency speculators are quite simply the personification of evil. Time after time over the past year these shadowy manipulators have imposed their will on exchange markets and forced once-proud currencies into humiliating devaluations. Just ask central bank officials in London or Rome or Paris what they think of currency speculators. Greedy, irresponsible, dangerous . . . the epithets pour out.
But wait! Why not ask an American arriving in Europe with dollars to spend? Thanks to the speculators, the dollar has made significant gains against European currencies since the late summer of 1992. The dollar has yet to recover its privileged (or overvalued) status of the mid-1980's, but it has shaken off its image as the currency no one wants. 
 First, a quick warning. Most West European countries are no longer outrageously expensive for Americans, but the likes of Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria and France are still expensive compared to the United States.
Even with the dollar variously worth between 10 and 50 percent more than last year, it is amazing how quality hotels, restaurants and boutiques continue to escape being bargains. Nonetheless, good deals are easier to find.
In truth, prices invariably fall as travelers distance themselves from capital cities and major tourist resorts. In this case, though, it is on the periphery of Western Europe itself that the dollar has jumped most in value -- in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece to the south and in Sweden, Norway and Finland to the north. Even the British pound has slipped by around 20 percent against the dollar in the past 13 months.
It is still a problem, of course, trying to keep up with currency swings. For several years, it was relatively simple. The dollar's rate in Europe varied as the dollar strengthened or weakened against all European currencies, but there was little movement among European currencies themselves. Then, in September 1992, the European Community's system of tightly linked exchange rates buckled and disarray followed.
The pound and the Italian lira pulled out of the system and promptly lost value, while the Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Irish punt stayed inside but were sharply devalued. Soon the infamously pricey Nordic countries were also forced to cut their currencies loose from the German mark. Then, early last month, the system cracked again, with all but the mark and the Dutch guilder freed to float by 15 percent above or below the system's official rates.
What this means is that today the dollar has its own ever-changing rate against each of the European currencies, which are in turn floating against each other. The European reference point, though, remains the German mark. And if the European Community currencies are to have any hope of meeting their target of fusing into a single regional currency by 1999, it will be because they have regained their stability against the mighty mark.
For the moment, though, things are still confusing. Sharp swings are now unlikely because with most European currencies floating, speculators can no longer gamble on forcing -- and reaping the profits of -- a sudden devaluation. Yet, even between the time this article is written and read, dollar rates in Western Europe will change. Early in August, for example, a dollar was worth 6.10 French francs; early in September, it was worth 5.70 francs. But in mid-August 1992 the dollar fetched just 4.92 francs -- so vive la difference!
Elsewhere -- in Mediterranean and Nordic Europe -- la difference has been much greater, enough to ease the cost of a good vacation, enough perhaps to entice a traveler to head for, say, Italy instead of France. Why not? With the dollar's value in Italy jumping from 1,100 to around 1,560 lire in barely one year, a $100 dinner for two in Siena last summer now costs just $70, a $250-a-night double room in Rome in August 1992 now goes for $176. The same applies to Spain, where the dollar, trading at 94 pesetas last summer, is worth around 131 pesetas now. And to Sweden, where the krona has lost 33 percent of its value against the dollar in less than a year.
AN economist would probably argue that these devaluations have really been against the German mark -- and the dollar has simply benefited. But who cares? The American traveler can expect only between 7 and 10 percent more for his dollar when he visits Switzerland, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands -- and that is hardly enough to take the sting out of prices in those countries. But, for the first time in several years, it is worth having a currency table handy when looking through holiday brochures for Europe.
The Nordic countries have become particularly interesting. Italy and Spain only became exorbitantly expensive in the late 1980's and are now reasonable again, but it seems that Sweden, Norway and Finland have always been pricey -- and now their fjords, lakes, mountains and majestic emptiness are also within reach. In winter? Well, they do have skiing -- and Lillehammer in Norway will be host of the Winter Olympics in February.
For travelers looking for sun and food cooked in olive oil next summer, the best bargains are likely to be Greece and Portugal, two countries that had not reached "European" prices even before their currencies began to slide.
But will the exchange situation still be this favorable next year? The answer lies in the dollar. After the convulsions of the past year, most European currencies have now found their natural levels in relation to each other. The unpredictable variable is how the dollar will perform. From now on, if Western Europe is to become still cheaper, it will be because the dollar has strengthened -- and not because European currencies have crumbled.

HEADLINE: EUROPE: FALL AND WINTER;
Sir Peter Hall Is Star Of London's Season

BYLINE: By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE; BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE is the chief theater critic of The Times of London.

 BODY:
WHO is the busiest theatrical director in London this fall? Surprisingly, it is not Stephen Daldry or Sam Mendes or another of the drama's bold young Turks, though they too have lively-sounding productions about to bubble to the surface. No, it is the Grand Old Man of the British theater: the creator of the Royal Shakespeare Company, former chief executive of the National Theater, the 62-year-old Sir Peter Hall.
Here he is with no fewer than five productions already arrived in London or soon to hit town. His revival of Terence Rattigan's "Separate Tables," a double bill about outcasts and loners in the dowdy British 1950's, continues to run successfully at the Albery, as does his version of Aristophanes' "Lysistrata" at Wyndhams. On Oct. 12 his production of Shakespeare's seldom-performed "All's Well That Ends Well," with Sophie Thompson (Emma's younger sister) as the heroine, comes to Royal Shakespeare headquarters at the Barbican. A week later Goldsmith's genial "She Stoops to Conquer" opens on Shaftesbury Avenue, followed by yet another of Sir Peter's autumn offerings, Pam Gems's portrait of the greatest of French chanteuses, "Piaf." 
 "Piaf" won Jane Lapotaire a Tony Award when it was first produced in New York in 1980. This time it is Elaine Paige, still best known for creating the title role in "Evita," who will be huskily insisting that "Je ne regrette rien." It is a performance sure to get plenty of attention when it reaches the West End, probably at the beginning of December. But by then critics and audiences alike may be feeling a bit glutted, and not only with work by Sir Peter. Given that Britain is still precariously clambering out of recession, it promises to be one of the theater's fuller falls.
Already, Harold Pinter's first full-length play in 15 years, a dark and fascinating piece called "Moonlight," has opened at the tiny Almeida Theater in Islington, north London. The National's magical production of "Carousel" has been revived at the Shaftesbury. And the Royal Shakespeare Company has given Tom Stoppard's "Travesties" its first major airing for nearly 20 years, casting Antony Sher as our guide to Lenin, Joyce and the other inhabitants of Zurich circa 1917. But there is more to come from both the big companies, not to mention Mr. Sher himself.
He has become one of the most highly-regarded performers in the British theater, an actor of such charisma and energy that you feel a lightning rod should be installed on any stage he occupies, just to insure he doesn't electrocute the rest of the cast. For those not familiar with his work, an ideal introduction would be the title character in Terry Hands's production of "Tamburlaine the Great," which was seen at Stratford last year and resurfaces at the Barbican on Oct. 14. Imagine a blend of wolf, snake and noble savage, and even then you have only just begun to define the complexities of his personal zoology.
Later in the year, the Shakespeare company is offering two other productions of particular interest. One is a new play by Alan Ayckbourn called "Wildest Dreams," about the lurid fantasies and drab lives of a group of Dungeons and Dragons fanatics. The other is a "Macbeth" that promises to be somewhat unusual, since the protagonist is being played by Derek Jacobi, an actor whose subtle, sophisticated skills will certainly be stretched by the challenge of playing Shakespeare's rough thane.
"Macbeth" opens on Dec. 16 and will continue through Christmas and into the new year. Those in search of more seasonal fare would do better to try the National, where Alan Bennett's gently bucolic "Wind in the Willows" is being revived for the second time. But that does not mean a bland, undemanding fall season on London's South Bank. With the National presenting both parts of Tony Kushner's AIDS saga, "Angels in America," in November and staging what it calls "The David Hare Trilogy" a month earlier, the very opposite would seem to be the case.
David Hare is the dramatist who sent New York the superb "Plenty" and, more recently and less successfully, "The Secret Rapture." His work has always been highly political, and usually pretty skeptical about the state of Britain itself; but his trilogy is more systematically so. The first play, "Racing Demon," in 1990, was a look at the Church of England. "Murmuring Judges," which followed in 1991, examined the judiciary, the police and the other forces of law and order. Both will be revived in tandem with the new "Absence of War," in which the Hare blowtorch will be turned onto Westminster and Whitehall.
On Oct. 15 Stephen Daldry, whose production of J. B. Priestley's "An Inspector Calls" won every major directing award last year, is tackling a still obscurer nearly 20th-century play. That is "Machinal" by the American dramatist Sophie Treadwell, the expressionist crime story that back in 1928 introduced a boyish Clark Gable to Broadway. Also in October, Eileen Atkins and Penelope Wilton come to the West End in a new piece called "Vita and Virginia," about the relationship, both personal and literary, of Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West. And on Nov. 11 a highly promising younger actor, Alan Cumming, brings his performance of Hamlet to the tiny Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden.
The Donmar is a theater well worth discovering. In the 1970's the Royal Shakespeare Company presented some of its most important productions there, including the world premiere of "Piaf." Now it has been remodeled and rebuilt and, less than a year after its reopening, is becoming the pacemaker in the aging heart of the West End. New plays by Michael Frayn and Athol Fugard have been performed there, as has the most successful production yet of Stephen Sondheim's "Assassins." But nothing is likely to attract more notice than its last offering of the year, a revival of the musical "Cabaret" with the gifted Jane Horrocks as Sally Bowles.
That will be staged by the theater's director, Sam Mendes, who at 28 is just two years younger than Peter Hall was when he formed the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford. Thirty-five years from now, will he too be a Grand Old Man, with productions pouring into town like honeybees into a hive? I would not be at all surprised.

HEADLINE: Life in the Baltics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In her review of "The Baltic Revolution" (Aug. 29), Liah Greenfeld on the one hand states that the Baltic countries started the breakup of the Soviet Union and on the other says that Anatol Lieven has written a detailed book on only marginally significant countries. Are the Baltics really so insignificant as Ms. Greenfeld seems to think? 
 The subhead of her review says that even though there is no more Soviet Union, "that doesn't mean life in the Baltic states has got better." By every liberal standard, life in the Baltics is better now. People can travel as they wish, nobody is sent to Siberia, the governments are latitudinarian, and the press is pre-capitalist pluralistic. Vigorous parliaments exist in the Baltics and, surprisingly, economies are stable -- stores are filling up. Human rights in the Baltic countries, a special concern of Ms. Greenfeld's, meet the world's highest standards.
Citizenship rights, in comparison even with the United States, are liberal. Eighty percent of Russians living in Latvia, for example, had the right to vote in Latvia's elections. The Baltics have always, except for longer or shorter periods of occupation, been multicultural societies, and nothing since the liberation has occurred in any one of them to threaten that.

HEADLINE: EUROPE: FALL AND WINTER: What's New, From Soho to Salamanca -- Hungary;
A theater festival, fashions and food

BYLINE: By Jane Perlez

 BODY:
In the early 1980's, as Hungary's politics began to thaw a little, so did the cultural scene. It was then that a group of actors broke away from the establishment Nemzeti theater and established the Katona Jozsef Company. The group of 30 actors quickly became known at home and abroad for its spectacular style, a reputation that helped Budapest to be selected for this year's festival of the Union of European Theaters.
The festival's arrival in Budapest is yet another sign that Eastern Europe is fast joining Western Europe spiritually, if not politically and economically. 
 From Oct. 22 to Nov. 7, 10 companies ranging from Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company to St. Petersburg's Maly Drama Theater will perform in Budapest theaters, including the pretty Arany Janos Szinhaz and the turn-of-the-century Operettszinhaz.
The plays were selected by each company wanting to show its work to colleagues from other countries rather than by a festival director imposing a certain taste. The choices are varied. The Royal National Theater of London will bring its new production of "Sweeney Todd," directed by Declan Donnellan. The Piccolo Teatro di Milano will stage "Il Campiello" by Carlo Goldoni, the 17th-century Venetian writer.
Perhaps the biggest attraction will be the drama from St. Petersburg called "Gaudeamus," written and directed by Lev Dogyinm. The play is based on a novel about life in the Soviet Army and is described as satirical and cruel.
The Royal Shakespeare Company will perform Adrian Noble's version of "The Winter's Tale;" the Teatre Lilure from Barcelona is staging Heiner Muller's "Quartett;" and the Odeon from Paris will show Ibsen's "John Gabriel Borkman," directed by Luc Bondy. Running parallel to these main performances will be six productions of the Katona Jozsef Theater's small-stage, 100-seat theater, Kamra. They include "Hamlet," scheduled for Oct. 30 and Nov. 5.
Most performances will offer simultaneous translation by earphones. Tickets to the festival are on sale at Budapest's Central Box Office at Andrassy ut 18 near the Opera House. Of more permanence are two restaurants popular with the city's stylish young crowd. Luau, a Polynesian restaurant, is as strong on visual effects as on eating. A large Gauguin-inspired painting of the tropics hangs in the entrance. The seafood -- lobster, crab and shrimp -- comes from the United States and Australia. About $10 for a five-course meal. 5 Zoltan Street, Budapest V;, (361) 131 4352.
At Remiz, the owner, Alise Mezody, has fashioned a simple, airy bistro with an outside terrace. The waiters are chosen as much for their looks as their service. The food is European and Hungarian, but it's mostly the table hopping and chatter that the patrons come for. 5 Budakeszi ut, 1021 Budapest; (361) 176 1896.
Before World War II, Budapest had many fine couturiers.

HEADLINE: The Big City Newcomer Housing Blues

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
AFTER growing up in Cincinnati and graduating from college, Tracy Hildebrand and Cheryl Braje moved to Manhattan earlier this year and embarked on what is, perhaps, the city's first and most daunting survival test: finding an apartment.
With little trouble, Ms. Hildebrand found the apartment of her dreams. She moved in with two other young women in an affordable three-bedroom apartment in a modern doorman building in a safe, affluent block on the Upper East Side. 
 "It was smooth sailing for me," she said.
Ms. Braje's search, meanwhile, was a nightmare. She briefly lived in a Murray Hill apartment, where she was conned out of a month's rent by an landlady who yelled at her in Arabic. She then bounced between a family friend's co-op, a Staten Island flophouse, a Day's Inn in Stamford, Conn., and a spartan $155-a-week room in a building in an undesirable part of Manhattan, on 34th Street at 10th Avenue. She now lives in a one-room third-floor walk-up in SoHo that she shares with two roommates.
"It's cheap, but it's small," she said.
The stories of Ms. Hildebrand and Ms. Braje, who knew each other in Cincinnati but attended different universities, illustrates the wide range of experiences that 20-something out-of-towners have when they move to Manhattan and look for their first apartment.
Though the stream of young newcomers moving to New York is much smaller than in recent years, in large part because of the almost half-million fewer jobs in the region, they still arrive each summer and autumn by the thousands, eager, if not to settle in the thousands, eager, if not to settle in the city permanently, then at least to pursue its pleasures and parry its perils for a few years.
SOME, the lucky ones, come with well-paying first jobs; new associates at law firms often start at about $90,000 in Manhattan, and management consultants just starting out often earn $75,000. Or, they may have spouses or live-in companions to help pay the rent.
Or, like Ms. Hildebrand, who is 23 years old and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in marketing, they may have an easy time finding roommates who will help cut living expenses in half, or in thirds or even more.
They also may have a combination of street-smarts from living near or visiting the city. Or they may have a few years of added maturity thanks to graduate school,law school or an M.B.A. program.
Or -- most important, perhaps -- they may be fortunate enough to work for a company with a relocation policy that not only pays moving expenses but also brokers' fees and security deposits and puts up their recruits in temporary housing while they look for an apartment or a roommate or both.
Others, though -- the unknowing, the unconnected, the unattached, those earning $18,000 a year as administrative assistants or $28,000 as account executives for a public relations firm or $35,000 as management trainees for a department store -- are more likely to have an experience like that of Ms. Braje, who is 23 and graduated from the University of Miami of Ohio with a marketing degre. They wander nomadically from sublease to sublease or share to share. Or they move to an outer borough or to suburbs like Jersey City or Hoboken. Or, worse, they move back home.
"It is exciting for the first couple of hours and then you start to get worried when you find out what you get for your money," said Brad Gibbs of Rye, N.Y., who graduated from Brown University and moved to Battery Park City, on the southern tip of Manhattan, this summer to take a job as a $35,000-a-year analyst with an investment bank on Wall Street. "You worry that you might have to move home with Mom and Dad, which crossed my mind."
Though recent arrivals in New York may find it difficult to believe, the lower end of the rental market is more affordable than it was five to eight years ago. In 1986, as a previous generation of new New Yorkers will attest, it was almost impossible -- without bribing a superintendent with "key money" or knowing someone who would illegally lease a rent-regulated apartment -- to fin a decent large studio or small one-bedroom apartment in a nice Manhattan neighborhood for under $1,000 a month.
Today, though finding such an apartment without a broker may still be difficult and require hours scouring classified ads, it is at least possible. Moreover, the term "key money" has virtually disappeared from the real estate lingo. And, in some less desirable neighborhoods, market-rate apartments may actually be lower priced than some rent-regulated units.
NEVERTHELESS, for many young newcomers to the city, living alone, even at what is considered the bottom price range of the market -- the $800-a-month studios and $1,100 one-bedroom apartments -- is still an option too expensive to consider.
"In the lower price ranges there is a very large proportion of people sharing apartments," said Nancy Packes, owner of the Feathered Nest, a real estate brokerage that specializes in rentals.
Living in Manhattan, as opposed to the other boroughs or the suburbs, is also much more of a possibility in the 90's. In the mid-80's, for instance, a large percentage of newcomers were priced out of Manhattan and moved to -- and helped gentrify -- cities like Hoboken or neighborhoods like Carroll Gardens, Park Slope, Boerum Hill and Cobble Hill in Brooklyn. Today, however, tose neighborhoods are fading in popularity among new arrivals to the city.
Michael Santomauro, owner and founder of Roommate Finders, a 14-year-old service that matches people seeking apartments with apartment renters seeking roommates, said he had stopped taking listings for Hoboken and Jersey City and was thinking about doing that for Brooklyn and Queens by year's end. "People with apartments in these areas aren't getting responses," he said.
Mr. Santomauro added that overall his business had dropped about 50 percent since the mid-80's, to about 3,500 clients a year, and that most of his competitors from that era had gone out of business. He noted, in particular, that the number of people with apartments seeking roommates had swelled.
"We are getting more apartment listings than people looking," he said. "It wasn't like that in the 80's. A big chunk of our clientele are those coming to New York for their first job, but unfortunately there aren't as many jobs, so the influx isn't as big as it was."
He also said that the type of person seeking a share situation was different than in the 1980's. Back then, he said, it was an economic necessity for many people moving to Manhattan, while now more people in their 20's are likely to take a roommate because they know no one in New York and they hope it will make their social adjustment easier.
"In the mid-80's they would usually come to us when they were exasperated," said Mr. Santomauro, who charges people seeking to share an apartment $195. For those who have an apartment and need a roommate, the fee is $39; formerly, there was no charge.
Virtually all of Roommate Finders' clients are under 35; most are between 25 and 30. The exceptions are usually the recently divorced, often newly single mothers.
UNLIKE the lower end of the rental market, the middle and higher ranges are as tight and expensive as ever, largely because of the dearth of new construction and because so many recession-shocked would-be buyers are renting.
Thus, finding a large one-bedroom unit in a quality building in a fashionable neighborhood for under $1,600 a month is not only difficult but also beyond the means of many young people starting their careers, particularly those who want to live alone. Agents, moreover, are also more needed in this price range. They generally charge tenants 15 percent of a year's rent.
Newcomers to the city are often stunned to find that New York is one of the few places in the nation where brokers usually collect fees from tenants. In most other places, landlords pay the fees.
In few cities, however, is the supply and demand for apartments so off-kilter. This, in large part, is because of the city's controversial rent-regulation system, which has taken many of the city's apartments off the market and given them to long-time occupants, regardless of need, at reduced rents.
"The product that people can find without brokers isn't there anymore," said Mrs. Packes of Feathered Nest. "There is a very limited offering by management companies, and if you counted the private person ads there are maybe a quarter to a third of the number of broker ads. And those ads are a small sampling of what is available through brokers."
Ms. Packes of Feathered Nest said that most of the clients who were recent graduates and new to the city had their fee paid for them by their employer, usually as part of their relocation package. "All of the companies that recruit the big banking, accounting, law, management consuting, investment banking firms, they usually pay the fees," she said.
She added that most of these clients know what to expect in the city's real estate market. "During recruitment, they give them an idea of what they should be prepared for," she said. "The last thing they need to do is offer a job and they come here and it's shock city."
Ms. Packes, who has one of the city's largest listings of rentals, also cautioned about the city's many unscrupulous brokers. "There are brokers that advertise nonexistent apartments to attract tenants in the hope that they can convert them to the paltry listings that they have," she said. "You're not going to know from the ads."
She advised new apartment hunters not to waste their time with ads that tout apartments that sound too good or too affordable to be true.
"There are very few anomalies in this market,"' she said.
Because of fears about crime and daily commuting by subway, newcomers often seek apartments that are close to their jobs. Battery Park City, for example, a short walk to Wall Street, is popular with new employees in the financial industry. Many apartments there, moreover, do not require the tenants to pay broker's fees.
There are drawbacks to Battery Park City, though. Brad Gibbs, for example, said that many of the people living there were older and had children. The development also is somewhat isolated from the rest of Manhattan and suffers from a lack of nearby nightlife and cultural amenities.
"But," he added, "I figured I would rather walk to work and commute to play than commute to work and walk to play."
Even in Battery Park City, however, sharing the rent is almost a necessity for those just starting out. Mr. Gibbs, for instance, lives with a girlfriend, Robin Peterson, also a Brown graduate, who earns about $30,000 and also works as an analyst for a financial firm on Wall Street.
Mr. Gibbs, 23, and Ms. Peterson, 22, live in a junior one-bedroom of about 650 square feet in one of the development's high-rise doorman buildings; they live on the fifth floor and do not have a view of the Statue of Liberty, which would have cost them several hundred dollars a month more than the $1,250 they now pay.
"A doorman was one of our major considerations," Ms. Peterson said, echoing the sentiments of many women in the city. "And we wanted to be in a safe area, so you pay a premium for that."
During their four-day search, the couple looked at 30 or 40 apartments south of Greenwich Village. "We were adamant about having as short a commute as possible," Ms. Peterson said.
For some young people, particularly those right out of undergraduate programs, a lack of credit or job history can result in being rejected by management companies, not to mention more stringent co-op boards. Sometimes a co-signer on the lease, usually a parent, is necessary.
For Mr. Gibbs and Ms. Peterson, however, the approval process was smoothed by letters from their employers verifying their income. "We heard horror stories, but for us it was really sort of fun," Ms. Peterson said. "But we had good salaries and cooperative brokers and had a good choice between apartments we really liked."
She conceded, though, that she was fortunate to have a boyfriend with whom she could share the rent on a one-bedroom apartment. "Most of my friends who have their own bedroom have to pay $700 or $800 a month," she added. "A colleague of mine pays $725 for a studio."
Tracy Hildebrand was also lucky. She didn't have a high-paying job; her sales position with a menswear company pays only "in the thirties." Nor did she have a live-in boyfriend to share the rent. Instead, last December, when she graduated, she went to Roommate Finders and quickly met two other women looking for a third to share a three-bedroom apartment at 72d Street and Second Avenue. The total rent: $2,100 a month, or $700 each -- about one week's gross pay -- which is about what most real estate brokers and financial planners cite as the typical rent a tenant pays.
(In the 80's, the amount was often higher, either about one and a half week's gross pay or one-third of a month's gross salary. By this yardstick, the salary needed to comfortably pay for an average one-bedroom apartment in New York, which, according to Ms. Packes, rents for about $2,000 a month, is about $100,000 a year, beyond the range of even the highest earners in their first jobs.)
Like Mr. Gibbs and Ms. Peterson, Ms. Hildebrand's company also paid for a five-day apartment-hunting trip. "I just immediately went to Roommate Finders because I knew I couldn't find anything on my own," she said.
She recalled her meetings with prospective roommates as "hysterical."
"There were a lot of unique individuals," she said "There was a whole range from completely bohemian to the anal-rententive, this-is-my-corner-that's-your-corner kind of person."
Ms. Hildebrand described her current roommates as a "perpetual student" and a museum employee thinking of going to law school. They are 28 and 24, respectively and "have both been in the city for a while," she said.
THOUGH she is at ease with her roommates, she foresees having her own one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan in about two years. She expects, however, to pay only $1,200 a month, a rent that may be unrealistic and that, at least on much of the Upper East Side, would probably not include a doorman.
Cheryl Braje, meanwhile, doesn't have a doorman in her tiny SoHo studio on Sullivan Street between Price and Houston Streets. Her rent, however, is a fraction of Ms. Hildebrand's. Ms. Braje splits $875 a month three ways, not much even for someone earning only $30,000 a year as a management trainee for a department store chain.
Ms. Braje, however, has just quit her job and intends to seek work in advertising. Originally, she said, a campus recruiter lured her to New York with talk about the store's location amid the bright lights of the big city. When she arrived in the city last February, though, she was sent not to the mid-Manhattan store but to a store in Stamford, Conn., and then transferred to Staten Island, and then later sent to Brooklyn. For a young single woman, these places paled even in comparison to her hometown in Ohio.
If her job was disappointing, her apartment search was worse. Like Ms. Hildebrand, she used Roommate Finders, but wound up living in February with a woman of indeterminate nationality who claimed to be an investment banker but who turned out to be a con artist who fleeced newcomers to New York, renting out -- without leases -- the same space to several women at the same time.
"I was completely naive to how people are up here -- she was running a big scam," she said. "I was going to sue her, but I didn't want to see her again. I gave her $1,350 and I lived for there on a pull-out couch for three weeks with an illegal alien in a studio divided with a sheet and every day she threatened to throw my stuff out."
"I didn't go back to the Roommate Exchange," she added.
MS. BRAJE'S next stop was Stamford, where her boyfriend helped bail her out financially. They stayed at a Day's Inn for three weeks, until they ran out of money. She then broke up with her boyfriend and stayed for two weeks at the Y.M.C.A. in Stamford.
Then she was transferred to Staten Island, where she found a room in a house for $125 a week. She lived there only a day, though. "I realized," she said, "that the woman who lived in the house was a hooker."
Her boyfriend returned again, but all he managed to do was wreck her rental car. "I remember walking up to my personnel manager in tears," she said. "And I as trying so hard to make a good impression."
By Easter, her parents arrived in the city to help her out; she was staying with family friends on the Upper East Side at this time. They said they were willing to pay up to $1,500 a month for an apartment on a month-to-month lease until she found a roommate and could extend the lease. Unfortunately, she couldn't find an apartment on a short-term basis. "We couldn't find anything that was for less than six months," she said. And taking an apartment by herself was simply too expensive.
"I thought that $30,000 was a lot of money -- it is back in Ohio," she said of her salary. "But it's nothing here."
After that, Ms. Braje moved into temporary housing for women at the Webster Apartments, on 34th Street and 10th Avenue, and paid $155 a week. "It was like a dorm really, and I stayed there for a month and a half," she said. "It was safe, but really unfriendly."
In June, however, almost five months after her arrival, she found her current apartment in SoHo. By chance and through some friends at work, she met someone who needed a roommate.
"I have really grown up a lot," she said. "I am a lot tougher now than I was in suburban Cincinnati. All my friends can't believe I am still here."
Reflecting further upon her experience, Cheryl said she had learned not to be so trusting and that sharing an apartment and having compatible roommates was crucial for anyone young and moving to New York for the first time.
"I would say come with a friend or have someone in mind that you want to room with," she said.
Ms. Braje also has learned what is perhaps the paramount lesson for anyone moving to, or even visiting, Manhattan.
"Make sure you have enough money," she said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Specialized Buildings;
Filling Up Space With Like-Minded Tenants

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
LIKE many not-so-new and not-so-fancy Manhattan office buildings, 1040 Avenue of the Americas couldn't make a dent in its 25 percent vacancy rate. Its 39th Street location was not a great draw, and it had no particular amenities.
Then a couple years ago, the Winoker Realty brokers who manage the building started marketing it to textile companies. They stressed that the building was just one block from the garment district (albeit a very long one) and that by clustering in the building tenants could offer one-stop shopping for textile buyers. 
 "We persuaded tenants that they should be near the people they sell to," said Sidney Winoker, Winoker Realty's president.
The result: a once persistently vacant B-building with a mishmash of tenants is now a 95 percent-occupied building specializing in the textile industry and getting perfectly respectable rents in the low $20's per square foot.
Such success stories are being repeated a lot these days, as more landlords turn to industry specialization to distinguish their otherwise undistinguished buildings. They look enviously at the high rents and decent occupancy rates commanded by the Toy Center, at 200 Fifth Avenue at 23d Street, or by 579 and 589 Fifth Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets, the latest buildings to be incorporated into the diamond district. And the landlords want equally profitable niches for their buildings.
Examples abound. The office space atop A.& S. Plaza on 33d Street and Avenue of the Americas, the old Gimbels building, has become the Children's Wear Center; 425 East 61st Street is a medical building, as is 30 East 40th Street; 305 East 63d Street is a decorative arts center.
And new industry buildings are being conceived constantly. Safra Bank just bought 546 Fifth Avenue, near 46th Street, and will market the space it does not use to other banks.
CBS, meanwhile, fully expects the 10 floors it will not use at 1697 Broadway, the 14-story office building attached to the Ed Sullivan theater at 53d Street that CBS bought for David Letterman's show, to go entirely to television production companies. Industry scuttlebutt has it that the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting is already negotiating for space.
"We haven't even finished renovating, yet so many people have called about space that we're already turning away those who want less than half a floor," said Edward Grebow, a CBS senior vice president.
The benefits to tenants of being among others in their industry are legion. They can hold joint open houses for customers and chip in for cooperative advertising campaigns. They can agree on the type of security system their industry requires. And smaller tenants can often hope for a spillover in any traffic that larger tenants generate. Someone visiting Hasbro at the Toy Center, for example, might well make a quick stop at some smaller toy company.
In fact, landlords of some specialized buildings play on those synergies, chipping in for the cost of cocktail parties or seminars for tenants' customers, or placing handheld lists of tenants in lobbies that visitors can carry with them as they browse from showroom to showroom.
The benefit to landlords, meanwhile, is double: higher rents and more tenants.
"IF you establish a critical mass of related companies in a building, their competitors feel they have to be there," said Robert L. Freedman, a vice chairman of Williams Real Estate, which has managed several clustered-industry buildings. "And that enables you to charge monopolistic prices."
Of course, that approach is not without risks, particularly in a recession.
"The problem with specialized buildings is that in bad times their fixed costs get too high for the tenants to support," said Josh N. Kuriloff, a director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Time was that 305 Seventh Avenue, near 27th Street, was a fully rented fur industry building. Then the fur industry "fell off the face of the earth," recalled Barry Gosin, president of Newmark Real Estate, the building's leasing agent. The building, half empty a couple years ago, is now a condominium for not-for-profit agencies.
Perhaps the worse difficulties have befallen the Decoration and Design building, at 979 Third Avenue, near 58th Street. Before the recession took its toll, this residential furniture building had a waiting list. James S. Meiskin, a senior managing director at Wm. A. White/Grubb & Ellis, recalls one tenant who renewed a lease there in 1987 for $45 a foot.
"I told them I could get them even better space down the street for $30, but they wouldn't budge," Mr. Meiskin said.
NO one is paying those rents today. The building has not only lost more than 15 percent of its tenants, but has had to slash rents for so many others that it could not meet its debt payments. It went bankrupt two months ago. The Chicago Merchandise Mart, which operates a huge, successful furniture and housewares selling area in Chicago, has been retained to try to lease the building up again.
Still, in this real estate market a lot of landlords are more willing to bet on their tenants' health than on their prospects for leasing space in buildings that don't offer like-minded tenants.
Sometimes they have no choice.
For example, the developers needed at least $35 a square foot in rent to cover the costs of the four floors of office space atop A.& S. Plaza. The problem was, no office tenant would pay that amount for that location. So they marketed the space, which has separate entrances at 100 West 33d Street, as a Children's Wear Center, wooing tenants like Kahn-Lucas-Lancaster, Doe Spun and Hush Puppies from the two older children's-wear buildings at 112 West 34th Street and 131 West 33d. Others followed. Today the building is three-quarters full, all with companies that specialize in children's wear.
The owners of 568-578 Broadway, near Prince Street, are seeking similar success with art galleries. The type of affordable storefront space coveted by art galleries is pretty hard to find in SoHo these days, yet plenty of SoHo buildings, including 568-578, are languishing half empty. The owners split the floors on one side of the building into small spaces, suitable for start-up galleries, and the other into large spaces, for established ones. And they advertised heavily in guides and art magazines.
Already, four of the building's 12 floors are occupied by art galleries.
And Winoker Realty, the building's leasing agent, has started a temporary leasing program in which galleries or individual artists who need space for a show can rent a gallery by the month.
"We get the advantage of the advertising they do, and our permanent tenants get the advantage of the added traffic," said Fred I. Adlman, Winoker's executive director.
Even well-occupied buildings are going the specialized route these days, in hopes of commanding higher rents.
Five years ago, 37 West 39th Street was full of tiny tenants paying low rents. Its owners redid the lobby, put in new elevators and created showroom space, which they marketed to accessory manufacturers. Today nine of the 36 tenants are in accessory- related businesses; whenever a new one signs up, the building takes an ad in Women's Wear Daily announcing yet another arrival.
THAT sort of high-profile trumpeting is almost essential to marketing a specialized building, in that it is the pull of like-minded companies far more than the pull of the building itself that draws new tenants. In fact, many landlords will offer cut-rate deals to kick-start a new specialty building.
Kahn-Lucas was one of the first tenants at the new Children's Wear Center. Mr. Kuriloff, Kahn-Lucas's broker, said he was able to negotiate a lot more free rent and a high landlord contribution toward customizing the space because of that.
"The landlord knew that small and medium-sized businesses will follow the leader because they want the benefit of the traffic the larger businesses will generate, particularly during market week," Mr. Kuriloff said.
Turns out that is exactly what happened, but Kahn-Lucas hedged its bets: it got a clause that allowed it to cancel its lease if the building did not reach a critical mass of industry tenants within a couple of years.
"Being in a magnificent building with low rent but no other industry members would be suicidal," Mr. Kuriloff said.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Comprehensive Land-Use Bill Faces a Tough Fight

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE autonomous control of land use by planning and zoning commissions in Connecticut's 169 towns may be in for some momentous changes in the next few years, but not without a fight.
A bill by the General Assembly's Task Force on the State Plan of Conservation and Development, designed to set up a comprehensive land-use policy by region, will be introduced in the 1994 legislative session, convening the first week of February. 
 It would require each region to adopt land-use regulations consistent with a state plan and each town to adopt regulations consistent with the regional and state plans. A version presented in the 1993 session passed three legislative committees but died in a tie vote of the Judiciary Committee.
"Regional land use is a skill that we must learn," said Mary Mushinsky, Democratic Representative from Wallingford and chairwoman of the 30-member task force. "Individual decisions by so many towns in a small state are more and more disjointed and harmful to other towns."
As examples she noted that a town wanting a shopping mall to increase its tax base will bring one in, duplicating one in the next town and sacrificing regional agricultural and recreational land. Or developers seeking cheaper land will create residential outposts to which highways must be built, followed by businesses, schools and municipal services, increasing random sprawl.
One of the task force members is Gerald B. Lucas, First Selectman of Killingworth, a 36-square-mile community with 4,980 residents. "I favor the idea on a lukewarm basis," he said. "Changes in a town's right to control its land flies in the face of the New Englander's God-given right.
"But when one looks at the demographics and economy of the state and the problems of the cities, it's obvious that more and more mandates are going to come down to the small town level. I'd rather be in front of the cart than behind it, and I think it has a chance of passing this year."
Monitoring of the towns would be overseen by 15 existing regional planning agencies, established by the state as advisory bodies in 1959 after Connecticut abolished its eight county governments. The agencies would have legal clout that they do not enjoy now, but a perceived infringement on their bailiwicks has made them wary of the plan.
"I don't feel it's time to throw out the concept," said Mary Ellen Kowalewski, executive director of the Capitol Region Council of Governments, Hartford's regional planning agency. "But I'm concerned about the lack of specifics."
Richard Carpenter, executive director of the Southwestern Regional Planning Agency, covering Fairfield County, called the plan "complex and cumbersome."
"I attended task force meetings, and a lot of the coordination they seek already exists through normal channels," he said. "This seems like an added layer to regional planning agencies, with authority coming from the top down."
Sentiments ranging from tepid to combative are widespread. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities wants clearer definitions of costs and decision-making at the local level. The Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford takes no position on the bill, but encourages study of regional issues.
"I would oppose any measure that would impose on municipalities any regional or state control over land," said Senator William Nickerson, a Greenwich Republican. "I believe municipalities are best able to determine use of their own land. A town like Greenwich could be destroyed by outside factors. Full-time professional zoning officials have been in place here for decades, unlike some rural communities."
Representative Jefferson B. Davis, a Pomfret Democrat, heads the Planning and Development Committee that supports the bill. He calls it "one of the most important issues facing the state."
"WHEN businesses think about expanding," he said, "city taxes push them into the suburbs, which pushes the suburbs into the exurbs and rural areas, creating more sprawl, more single-occupancy vehicles driving to work."
Support from the Home Builders' Association of Connecticut comes from its task force representative, Robert Fusari, a Middletown builder.
"The plan would simplify things and shorten approval time by allowing builders to deal with one agency," he said, "knowing what the rules are for all 169 towns rather than facing 169 sets of rules."
According to Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association in Manhattan, "there are at least 10 states that have adopted a regional land use plan, and more are in the process."
"In New England," he added, "only Connecticut and New Hampshire have none."
Apart from the environmental and esthetic considerations, "they save money," he said.
"In this economy it's particularly appropriate to curtail the costs of new schools, buses and police and fire stations by concentrating development where it already exists," Mr. Yaro said.
In New Jersey, where a plan was implemented last year, the state expects to save $5 billion over 20 years. Herbert Simmens, director of the Office of State Planning in Trenton, said "we set it up because open space and agricultural land were disappearing, highways were overly congested and housing was less affordable."
PERSUADING each of New Jersey's 527 municipalities and 612 school districts "has been time-consuming," he said, "but all 21 counties have participated voluntarily to a greater or lesser degree."
Among the incentives in the New Jersey plan is a process by which the plan functions as a one-stop clearing house for proposals by towns. Approved projects then get funds from appropriate state agencies.
This past summer Michael J. Cacace, a Stamford lawyer, assembled a coalition that supports the Connecticut task force's efforts and is helping to write new legislation for presentation in February.
The task force includes Terry Tondro, professor of law at the University of Connecticut ; Dwight Merriam of the Hartford law firm of Robinson & Cole; William Raveis, a realtor; Donald Strait, executive director of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment; the Connecticut Housing Coalition; the Connecticut Audubon Society and the Connecticut Institutes of Architects and Landscape Architects.
"We are examining the best modalities of existing plans," said Mr. Cacace.
"In order to preserve local control, municipalities will have to work together," he continued, "or services will be sited arbitrarily as they have been for years -- cellular phone antennae, solid and hazardous waste, group homes for the retarded, weigh stations. If towns help fashion the system now they will have more control in future."

HEADLINE: Elvis Discovered in a New Jersey Basement!

BYLINE: By JESSE HOLLAND

 BODY:
ROB LEVY, a piano dealer from Elizabeth who collects records, is no stranger to basements, attics and old record shops, where he has found all sorts of minor treasures. But what he found in a basement in New Jersey took his breath away: believed to be a one-of-a-kind 1957 Elvis Presley Christmas album, pressed in red vinyl as a keepsake by an RCA engineer.
"We've found what is probably the rarest record in the world in mint, pristine condition," Mr. Levy said. "The black vinyl 1957 Elvis Presley Christmas Album is one of the most collectible albums on the market today, and we have the only one in red vinyl." 
 But will the discovery catapult Mr. Levy and his two partners into a prominent place in the world of Elvis mythology? He, his partners and others say that this album should be a valuable collectible to record dealers and die-hard Presley fans. They hope it's worth as much as $75,000, although four record dealers asked to estimate the record's worth for this article suggested values that ranged from $2,000 to $10,000. The black vinyl version of the album is worth $500 to $1,500, the dealers said.
Mr. Levy and two friends who helped purchase the album, Freddie Nurman and Gene Van Severen, are still somewhat shaken by their good luck.
"Every record collector dreams of finding something like this," said Mr. Nurman, an unemployed real estate salesman. "The odds of finding something like this are similar to the odds of winning the lottery."
These three friends were brought together by their passion for record collecting. Mr. Levy and Mr. Nurman met at a collectors' show in Cranford, while Mr. Levy and Mr. Van Severen met when Mr. Levy took him a stack of records to be appraised. In the stack was the cover to the 1957 Elvis Christmas album.
"I told him if he had that record along with the case, he'd have something valuable," said Mr. Van Severen, who also works for the New Jersey Department of Vocational Rehabilitation. "I didn't know he was actually going to go out and find one."
 
RCA Has Master Copy
 Bernadette Moore, the archivist at RCA Records, which released Presley's records, said the red disk might be valuable to collectors.
"We at RCA don't put a value on things like that, because we have the master copies," Mrs. Moore said. "However, Elvis collectors would probably consider something like a red vinyl Elvis record valuable."
Mr. Nurman said he and his partners had already received an offer of $20,000.
"This is one of a kind," Mr. Van Severen said. "The only other completely unique Elvis record known of at this point is the record he made for his mother."
The three collectors said Elvis fans from as far away as Japan, Brazil and Argentina had inquired about the album. But the three men said they disagreed on whether they are going to sell it. Mr. Nurman wants to keep it. Mr. Levy wants to sell it. Mr. Van Severen can't decide. So for now, they are keeping the record in a climate-controlled vault at a bank they declined to name.
They were extremely lucky to find the album, Mr. Levy said. A friend told him about a retired employee of an RCA record-pressing plant in Rockaway that had since closed; the man was selling his possessions to raise money for a move to Florida. Mr. Levy said that after the man sold him his collection of 2,000 records, he asked Mr. Levy if he wanted to see something special.
"That's when he pulled out the Presley record," Mr. Levy said. "He told me that he worked at the plant out in Rockaway back in 1957, when the regular record was being pressed. He decided to make a souvenir for himself and pressed out a red vinyl one from the wax used for the classical albums."
Thinking it was a fake, Mr. Levy left it with its owner, but soon changed his mind.
"After I talked to some of my friends about it, they told me I was crazy not to go back to the old man," Mr. Levy said. "I then called him back and started to negotiate for the record."
Mr. Levy said that the former RCA employee, who asked him not to reveal his name, knew what he had. That's when Mr. Nurman and Mr. Van Severen got into the act, they said.
"Rob found it, Gene appraised it and I negotiated for it," Mr. Nurman said.
The collectors won't say what they paid for the record, although Mr. Nurman said "it was a considerable sum."
They said they have verified the authenticity of the album. "This red vinyl record contains speckling, which shows that it was pressed with the same machine that the black vinyl records were pressed with," Mr. Van Severen said. "The machine was not cleaned out in between pressings of the black vinyl records and the red vinyl, and pieces of black wax got into the red vinyl. That's one of the factors that convinced us that the record was authentic."
They have not yet allowed other record appraisers to look at the album, however. Mr. Van Severen, who runs a record appraisal business from his home, said there would be nothing with which to compare the record. The three friends have not played the entire album. But what they did hear was the final test of authenticity. After about 30 or 40 seconds of "Santa Claus Is Back in Town," they were convinced, they said, and the record went straight to the vault.
"Right now, we're just going to bask in the glory of this record," Mr. Levy said, smiling. "Maybe the King himself will come back and ask to buy it."

HEADLINE: Worry Time for Wall Street?

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
Is it finally time to jump ship? On Wall Street, where awe over the longevity of the bull market has been giving way in some quarters to disbelief, many are worried that the answer could be yes.
Every widely watched indicator of stock market value has been flirting with historical danger levels, whether it be the dividend yield (too low) or the price of stocks divided by earnings (too high). Privately held companies, sensing that the window of opportunity to sell shares to a very willing public might abruptly close, are filing their going-public documents as fast as their lawyers can review them. Or even sooner. 
 What's more, the small investor, frequently ridiculed as the player who always buys just as it's time to make a hasty retreat, has been jumping in with both feet, helping to send the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high of 3,663.83 on Aug. 26.
Last week, the jitters turned to shivers for some when the Dow fell 37.45 points on Monday, the steepest one-day drop since early April, and another 38.56 points on Tuesday. The market regained its balance Wednesday, and the Dow closed Friday at 3,543.11, down 70.14 points for the week. Still, the losses earlier in the week were a reminder that stocks had barely corrected since October 1990, when the Dow was just under 2,400 and the bull market began its latest climb.
The shaky political situation in Russia contributed to last week's investor unease. But the jumpiness had more to do with fundamentals: lackluster earnings reports and a still sputtering economic recovery. Indeed, worrywarts say the Dow would have to drop to 2,200 before stocks would sell at a valuation more typical of the last 20 years.
If that isn't reason enough to worry, next Friday is the first day of October, the month of choice for stock market crashes.
So, is a big selloff just around the corner, or is the market simply catching its breath before continuing its climb? Notwithstanding the warning signals and the growing worries, the experts remain as divided as ever about the market's next twist and turn.
The bears can't take their eyes off the flashing red lights.
"The fundamentals are so bearish they offset everything," said Norman Fosback, who publishes the Market Logic newsletter. "With the dividend yield under 3 percent, there is no question the market is on borrowed time."
But the bulls see a continuing appetite for stocks from investors both large and small, at least if interest rates remain low.
"What we're seeing from all the ticker tape is good solid trades, not just stocks being bid up by dealers or other people taking advantage of the little guy," said Laszlo Birinyi, an analyst in Greenwich, Conn. "If you look at the size of the upticks, you see 10,000- and 20,000-share trades, which means the institutions are stepping up."
According to another bull, William M. LeFevre of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, a New York securities firm, "There's one crash in a person's lifetime, and I've already seen mine," he said in reference to the October 1987 collapse.
But with stock prices so high, the market needn't crash for investors to lose sizable chunks of money. Portfolios can implode industry by industry or company by company, a slow-torture process that Justin Mamis, a technical analyst, contends has already begun -- and will continue. Mr. Mamis said the market is in the midst of a dangerous "top," a period in which companies with "important names" are falling apart while market indexes levitate deceptively near their highs.
In fact, while the widely watched general market indexes were hitting record highs this summer, clients of Mike Stolper, a consultant who matches money managers with wealthy investors, were fit to be tied over the state of their portfolios.
"I talk to some of my clients who are down 5 percent this year because of Merck, and you'd think someone had kidnapped their children," he said. "When people lose 5 percent while the market is at new highs, they have this sense that money is falling from the sky -- and they don't have a bucket."
That's the kind of market in which money managers like Eddie Brown of Brown Capital Management do best: a stock picker's market, in which adept players can profit no matter what the market's overall trend. But even Mr. Brown, who says he's "still positive" on the market, throws a big caveat into his bullish stance: if interest rates rise, all bets are off.
Low interest rates have been the hypnotic mantra of Wall Street's bulls, providing a justification since early 1991 for armies of analysts to say "buy" and for legions of investors to respond, "Where do I mail my check?" For once, brokers had no need to twist the arms of customers to see the wisdom of stocks over safe parking spots like certificates of deposit and money market accounts.
A sharp rise in rates -- to 6.5 percent or 7 percent on 5-year Treasury notes, trading late Friday at a yield of 4.79 percent -- would work like a sobering bucket of cold water on the hot market, Mr. Brown said.
How sobering would depend in large part on the reaction of the ubiquitous individual investor. The $64 million question on Wall Street now: What's that relatively new player going to do when the market suffers a pullback, or worse, a "meltdown"?
So critical is the answer that analysts like Steve Leuthold of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis have taken to retooling their software, adding data about flows of money into mutual funds and levels of cash kept on hand by managers of those funds. It is those professionals who might have to quickly pay off investors should the public lose its cool.
But will they? Mr. LeFevre observed that small investors are both reluctant to change a new investment course and to take losses.
"It took them forever to get their money out of fixed-income parking places and into stocks," he said, "and now it's going to take forever for them to get it out of stocks."
Mr. Birinyi agreed, saying the data he tracks support the notion that small investors have made a long-term "secular" shift to stocks.
Bridget Macaskill, the president of Oppenheimer Capital Management, added that small investors have a good grasp of the risks of stocks, although they fall short of understanding the risks of some other investments, like Ginnie Mae funds.
Yet one popular Armageddon theory has it that the small investor will panic and inundate equity mutual funds with sell orders, resulting in a downward "cascading effect" on the market.
Given the market's traditional quirkiness, however, the very fact that everyone is focused on the weaknesses of funds probably means the impetus for a big correction, whenever it comes, will begin elsewhere.
Similarly, Wall Street's contrarians take heart whenever the crowd is in a cold sweat. It is at times when people are overly confident about markets that contrarians become most nervous about a selloff. Indeed, headlines -- like the one on this story -- that mention the word "worry" serve to comfort the bulls that the market is not in real danger.
What follows is a sampling of views from a half dozen veteran market watchers, representing bulls, bears and fence-sitters too.
 
 
 
SEEING BULLISH SIGNS EVERYWHERE
 LASZLO BIRINYI likes almost everything about the stock market right now, from bearish sentiment among investors and analysts (a good sign) to the fact that markets this year have rallied all around the world.
But the single most compelling reason to be bullish, according to Mr. Birinyi, who runs a financial consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn., is what he refers to as "positive money flow." What that means in non-Wall Streetese: on days when the overall market is weak, "investors take advantage of the weakness in stocks to buy stocks, which suggests they have faith in the future," he said.
Mr. Birinyi is also heartened to see that the individual investors who make trades of fewer than 100 shares each -- "odd-lotters" -- have undergone a sea change of enthusiasm over stocks. During the entire decade of the 1980's, there were only 18 trading days in which odd-lotters bought more shares than they sold.
So far in the 1990's, though, that trend has reversed. Odd-lot traders were net buyers on 10 trading days in 1990, followed by 95 trading days in 1991. By last year, the number had risen to 142, Mr. Birinyi said. "You're seeing a secular shift, where the individual has made a major change," he said. "These are not things that will be stopped by a couple of down days."
Asked about the bears' jitters over an historically low dividend yield on the S.& P. 500, Mr. Birinyi remained unflustered. "The dividend yield reached 3 percent in January 1992, so the red light has been on for some time," he said. Besides, he argued, the low yield is not so startling in periods during which inflation is as low as it is today.
 
 
UPBEAT, WITH A BUT

EDDIE C. BROWN of Baltimore's Brown Capital Management says he's positive on the stock market, but that almost doesn't matter considering his investment style.
Mr. Brown spends his time looking at individual stocks -- not the overall market. These days, he has his eye on some beaten-down growth stocks, particularly Home Depot, which fell from $46.625 on Aug. 16 to $37.75 on Friday. "We have not owned it before, because we thought it was too expensive," he said. "But we're beginning to warm up to it."
As for the overall market, much of Mr. Brown's bullishness rests on the assumption that interest rates will remain low; indeed, even his individual stock picks would be suspect if rates on five-year Treasury notes reached 6.5 percent to 7 percent.
But Mr. Brown is not particularly worried about the next 6 to 12 months. "Rates will creep up gradually as economic activity improves," he said. "But we don't expect a dramatic increase in rates or inflation."
He does say stock investors must begin to adjust their expectations. "The 17 to 18 percent compounded return of the last 10 years is not in the cards," he noted. "But you can stack up returns of 10 to 11 percent over the next 3-to-5 years."
"We're shopping," he added.
 
 
A BEAR'S ADVICE: GET HALF INTO CASH
 DURING the scariest of times for the stock market over the last 18 years, Norman Fosback has told investors to put as much as 50 percent of their money into "cash," or highly liquid money-market type instruments.
Mr. Fosback, whose Market Logic newsletter frequently outranks the competition in giving investors profitable advice, is saying to park half your money in cash now. "For us, that's quite bearish," he said.
Bothering him most of all about today's market is the dividend yield of the Standard & Poor's 500 index -- total dividends paid on the 500 stocks in that index divided by the value of the index. When dividend yields are high, as they were in August 1982 (at 6.69 percent), it frequently is a good time to buy stocks. But when they go below 3 percent, as they did in 1973 and just before the stock market crash of 1987, it frequently is a warning that it's time to exit the market.
The yield on the S.& P. 500 at Friday's close was 2.75 percent.
Dividend yield is by no means the only indicator Mr. Fosback watches, but it is one of the most reliable, he contends.
"Earnings can be massaged, but dividends show a corporation's willingness to pay cold hard cash out to shareholders," he explained.
But even the bearish Mr. Fosback admits that the market can charge on for some time at overvalued levels. The yield on the S.& P. 500 fell below 3 percent in January 1972, but the index rose another 16 percent after that before starting a 21-month bear market in October 1974.
 
 
 
THE PUBLIC IS GETTING SMARTER
 THE individual investor is bailing out of certificates of deposit and into stocks without the foggiest idea of the risk he or she is taking, right? Well, not quite, according to Bridget A. Macaskill, who spends a fair amount of her time on the road speaking to the investing public.
Ms. Macaskill, president of the Oppenheimer Management Corporation in New York, said investors who flock to her seminars don't need to be told that they're shifting into a less predictable investment. "They know the stock market is risky," she said.
Doomsayers are arguing that the small investors who are buying stock mutual funds in record numbers will be the first ones to pull the plug at the slightest sign of a market correction, sending stocks into a tailspin. But Ms. Macaskill said stock purchases may be the area where investors understand risks best of all.
The plunging of interest rates was actually a plus for investors' fortunes, said Ms. Macaskill, because it forced them to learn more about the benefits of asset allocation and a long-term strategy that includes stocks, which have tended to outperform other investments over time.
But investors' learning curves have further to go, she added. Now John Q. Public has to spend more time comparing one investment to another, and considering the effects of taxes and inflation.
 
 
HIS NUMBERS SAY 'BUY,' HIS GUT SAYS 'NO'
 TALK about a qualified opinion. Steve Leuthold, a Minneapolis analyst with a wide institutional following, told clients earlier this month that his proprietary "major trend" index surged in August, forcing him -- reluctantly -- to increase his allocation of stocks to 61 percent from last month's 33.5 percent.
But that's not what Mr. Leuthold's gut is telling him. "Because of the age of the bull market (1,058 days) and the high current valuation levels, the U.S. stock market comfort level here in the Leuthold Group is quite low," he wrote to his customers.
Still, the "discipline of the numbers" is usually more reliable than emotions, he added, so he's grinning, bearing it, and telling his customers to -- gulp -- buy.
The situation is uncomfortably familiar to Mr. Leuthold, who said his indicators turned from negative to positive in January 1987 -- another time that he thought, in his gut, that stocks had had it for the moment. But he told clients to buy nonetheless, guiding them to gains of 12 percent to 15 percent before his "major trend" index turned negative again in March 1987. In October, of course, the stock market crashed.
This time, he's figuring that investors can pick up as much as 10 percent by going into stocks now, but he expects that any rally will last less than six months. Even the stocks he's picking come from groups -- like oil and gold -- known to hold up better than others in down markets.
Mr. Leuthold concedes that it's certainly possible that stocks could move into what he calls "a new valuation era" in which such fundamental indicators as price-to-earnings ratios and dividend yields simply don't matter as much as they have historically. But he doubts that, saying, "I am a very edgy, reluctant bull."
 
 
PUTTING INVESTORS ON NOTICE: IT'S GETTING LATE IN THE GAME
DON'T be lulled by the stock market averages, advises Justin Mamis, technical analyst at Hancock Institutional Equity Services. He noted that beneath the averages are sick stocks that have dramatically hurt investors' performance. But, as investors increasingly convince themselves that every selloff is nothing more than a healthy correction in an interminable bull market, the bull market moves ever closer to an end, he said.
Mr. Mamis said the overall market is forming a "top" -- technical talk for the sometimes lengthy last-hurrah during which the averages meander near all-time highs before up markets turn down. "The ingredients of a top do things that eventually lull you," he said. A clue to spotting tops is that, in the end, investors interpret nearly every bad event as having a good side. "When corrections come, they say, 'Oh, that's nice -- it was overdue, and we needed that,' " Mr. Mamis said.
The small investor has particularly latched on to that "everything will be all right" way of thinking, Mr. Mamis said -- although the little guy isn't alone in being lulled by the top Mr. Mamis sees. "The public does not take losses," he said, referring to the small investor's tendency to hang on even after stocks have declined.
So he expects the small investor to stay in until it's too late. "Money magazine has told them it's a long bull market and don't worry about corrections," Mr. Mamis said.

Will Mayhem Maul Italy's Market?

BYLINE: By John Tagliabue

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
WITH all the turmoil, you would think Italy to have been a place to avoid. Yet investors did the opposite. From January of this year, even as criminal investigators jailed businessmen, politicians and mobsters, and as resignations crippled Consob, Italy's anemic stock market regulator, Milan's stock market index stubbornly climbed 42 percent, outpacing larger markets in Frankfurt, Paris and London.
Yet as summer turns to fall, the steam seems to be going out of Milan; trading has been sluggish since its August peak, and the Banca Commerciale Italiana's Comit index has fallen about 6 percent. 
 Have Italy's sins finally caught up with it? Probably not.
What fueled the enormous gains earlier this year appears to have had less to do with national turmoil than with the lure of low interest rates. Italian rates -- which were cut aggressively after Italy became the first European country to succumb to speculative pressure and pull out of Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism a year ago -- devalued the lira, making Italian shares a bargain for big international investors like American pension funds, which thought they had room to invest in Italy. Moreover, low rates, plus an export surge fueled by the cheap lira, revived prospects for corporate profits despite a stubborn domestic recession.
Now, with little room for further rate cuts, and with corporate profits clouded by the recession in the rest of Europe, there is a fly in the minestrone.
Despite the lira's collapse against the mark and the dollar, Italy has endured little inflationary pressure. That is partly because, with the recession, imports have remained sluggish. Mainly, though, it has been the effect of a decision made last year to abolish Italy's wage indexation, a costly link between wages and consumer prices that desperate politicians convinced the labor unions to surrender. "Over the last 10 years, indexation was accounting for 50 percent of our inflationary thrust," said Mario Noiera, the chief economist at Euromobiliare S.I.M., a Milan brokerage firm.
Still, economists like Mr. Noiera say there is little room for rates to fall further. Meanwhile, analysts in Milan counsel taking refuge in anti-cyclical stocks, those chunks of the economy that usually thrive when everything else is hurting.
"There are food businesses like Parmalat and clothing companies like Benetton," said Massimo Gaggiotti, an analyst at Intereuropa S.I.M. in Milan. He said he also favors such telecommunications companies as Stet, Sip and Italcable, as well as such utilities as Italgas.
Services present a paradox, however. "The curious thing," Mr. Noiera said, "is that for the first time in Italy the recession has hit the service sector -- shops, retail distributors, consulting and advisory services."
In fact, while such big insurers as Generali and Alleanza continue to look good, banking in particular poses problems. Several large banks, including Banco di Sicilia and Banco di Napoli, are groaning under excess debt, and their owners in the Italian treasury, which still holds the bulk of Italy's banking business, are casting about for ways to help. Corporate turmoil, like the collapse this summer of Ferruzzi, the big industrial holding company, has also put pressure on the banks -- and more may be in store.
While Italy's market surge earlier this year was fueled mainly by heavy buying from abroad, a shift in retail investing, mainly by provincial banks seeking better returns for local investors against sagging bond rates, is currently preventing an all-out slide.
"They are providing the lag support, to prevent this slump from expanding to a major downward rush," Mr. Noiera said. "The question is whether the market has the steam to be bullish again. I think it lacks the steam, because that's linked to a perception of interest rates, and the outlook for corporate profits."
When industrials will revive depends largely upon corporate profitability. Fausto Galeotti, the director of research at Pasfin Securities in Milan, said the companies to bear in mind when that happens are, in descending order: the Fiat auto group, the tire maker Pirelli, Olivetti in electronics, and Montedison in chemicals.
The biggest downside of the market is Italy's brittle political situation. The cabinet of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a former central bank chief, was installed last April essentially to govern without politicians. But elections early next year could signal a return to politics as usual, and with unemployment posing a big threat, particularly in southern Italy, a return to loose fiscal policies could revive inflation.
Closely linked to this is the privatization of Italy's nationalized industries, which account for roughly half its economy. Sluggish movement toward this action has dismayed the market, but fresh plans to privatize the Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano are encouraging.
By early winter, most large investors will probably have discounted uncertainties about Italy's Government, and if that coincides with increased corporate profitability, the market could bounce back.
Of course, there are risks that there will be more corporate trouble, similar to the collapse of Ferruzzi. Paradoxically, Ferruzzi appears to have had little net effect on the market. "The outlook for rates drove this market," Mr. Noiera said. "Ferruzzi's negative impact was overwhelmed by the macroeconomic picture."

Relief for Child-Care Workers

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
AMONG small-business employees, child-care workers may have much to celebrate if President Clinton's health care proposal survives in anything like its current form. Barely a third of them now have health benefits, and though many are young and healthy, the work they do puts them at the mercy of the microbial free-for-all that is the immature immune system. Colds and flus are endemic, as are back problems from hefting and carting young children all day. Under the Clinton plan, workers would get benefits from their employers, who would probably qualify for an expense cap of from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll. Self-employed family day-care providers would buy their own insurance but qualify for the 100 percent health insurance tax deduction. Making health care a fact of workers' lives would almost certainly improve quality by reducing turnover.
But child care is a peculiar economic institution. Technically, it is a small business, but one lacking many of the market options of other small businesses. "Over all, the change is going to be a good thing, but we have to pay attention to consequences for child care," said Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign in New York. 
 Whatever form it takes -- center-based care and family day care dominate -- child care is a labor-intensive business in which salaries may represent as much as 80 percent of a total budget; an additional $8,000 to $10,000, say, to cover health premiums will not go quietly into the balance sheet. Expenses are typically covered by fees, supplemented occasionally by grants or donations. The usual ways of cutting costs or improving productivity -- investing in technology, streamlining inventory, etc. -- don't apply, and the creative ones, like staggering hours and teachers, put children in a topsy-turvy environment.
Passing costs on to consumers is problematic, because many of them are low- and middle-income parents with little financial flexibility. "If parents don't have the money, they can't move the cost forward," said Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington. The only other place for extra expenses to come from is the salaries of workers, who make from about $5 to $9 an hour.
The new system may prove especially difficult for in-home day-care providers, who account for nearly a quarter of child-care arrangements for children under 3. As self-employed workers, typically making less than $10,000 a year, they would be eligible to buy care from one of the regional alliances for about $1,800 for individuals and $4,200 for families. Without subsidies and cost-reduction formulas apparently envisioned by the Clinton Administration, the upfront cost would probably put the policies out of reach.
Whatever worries and imponderables there may be, the child-care community is optimistic about the new plan. Its emphasis on preventive care, for example, would probably benefit an occupation that draws from low-income groups whose access to health care is limited. "Prevention is something you don't pay for if you don't have money," said Linda Tarr-Whelan, head of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Washington. "It's incredibly important to that group."
CHILD-care advocates agree with President Clinton's appeal to the public to accept responsibility for part of the cost of their health care, but point out that child-care workers come to the reform table with a pre-existing condition. "We have a child-care delivery system that's breaking at the seams. It's not inefficient. No one's getting rich off it," said Marcy Whitebook, executive director of the Child Care Employee Project in Oakland. Calif. "The child-care work force is already doing more than its part by subsidizing the system of low wages." Ms. Whitebook said she was wowed by the passion for reform President Clinton revealed in his speech to Congress last week. The child-care system, she says, could use the same impassioned approach.
 
Adventures in Baby Sitting
 Among the clear winners this year of various Clinton Administration initiatives, intended and unintended, would seem to be full-time, in-home baby sitters, usually in cities like New York and Washington. First, the infamous $500,000-a-year Attorney General candidate episode force-marched many members of the cultural elite onto the Social Security straight and narrow and presumably benefitted those household workers who were not sacked by potential appointees eager to cover their tracks.
And now comes health care reform, which would treat employers of baby sitters and other domestic workers as small businesses, with the attendant responsibilities. That will entitle baby sitters to health benefits, at a cost to employers of anywhere from a few hundred dollars to well above $1,000 a year over the $200 to $400 weekly salary that many pay now. The plight of families with baby sitters -- about 3 percent of child-care users and often affluent -- generates little sympathy. Asked about the impact on in-home care, one child-care advocate sniffed, "Oh, you mean for the Zoe Bairds of the world?"
 
 
VOLUNTEERS IN SERVICE TO CHILDREN
 IF it's structured properly, say child-care advocates, President Clinton's new national service program could give the low-wage child-care industry a boost. The $1.5 billion measure creates a domestic version of the Peace Corps, allowing young people to do community service while being paid by the Government for college or job training.
The plan is modeled on volunteer projects already working in several cities. Typically, young people are placed in short-term assignments and circulate through participating organizations. If the assignments were longer term, volunteers could in effect become entry-level child-care workers. That would free up salary money for more experienced workers and widen the gap between entry- and higher-level salaries, a feature of the occupation that discourages long-term commitment. An added benefit, child-care experts say, is the potential to the health of the nation's children: "If you have young people working in a child-care facility who get good training," said Barbara Reisman, of the Child Care Action Campaign, "they learn good parenting skills."

Pining for 80's-Style Takeover Battles? They're Back 

Everything comes around. One might think that after the 80's crash-landed, giddy billion-dollar takeover battles were extinct. No, just taking a breather. No sooner had Viacom offered $8 billion for Paramount (a bit less now, since Viacom stock has fallen) than QVC, headed by Barry Diller, jumped in with a $9.5 billion bid. And the arbitragers were off and running, sending the stocks on merry rides. Mr. Diller, who once headed Paramount, has apparently long ached to buy the studio and combine it with QVC's cable business to create a multimedia empire. And now, as Mr. Diller is quoted as saying, "It's there, it's up for sale, and I can buy it." There may also be a personal goal for Mr. Diller, who is said to be seeking revenge against Martin Davis, now Paramount's head, and Mr. Diller's former boss. But it gets messy: though Paramount said it saw no need to respond to QVC, Viacom filed suit to try to keep QVC away.
 
Primerica, by Another Name
 
It's always the same. Big, bigger, biggest. While some people try to create multimedia giants, others have visions of financial supermarkets. And Sanford I. Weill, head of Primerica, is well on his way to a financial-services company second to none. Having recently bought the Shearson brokerage business, Primerica agreed last week to pay $4 billion for Travelers -- the rest of it, that is; Primerica already owns 27 percent of the insurer. The deal would create one of the nation's largest companies that links securities, insurance and consumer loans. And its name? Brokerages often have names that read like family trees: Pick three from among Barney, Hutton, Lehman, Lynch, Merrill, Shearson, Smith and string 'em together. No, Primerica, whose name was cooked up in 1987 by a "corporate identity specialist," would take on the more down-to-earth "Travelers."
 
A Men's Magazine's New Man
 
Esquire's hair is thinning. Ad pages are down, and its main rival, GQ, just passed it in circulation. What's the problem? Maybe nothing more than that it's a men's magazine in an age, in Gay Talese's words, "when being a male is almost held against you." Hearst, which owns Esquire, could see it that way -- or it could comb a few strands over the bald spot and then blame the editor. That seems to be what it did last week, removing Terry McDonell as editor in chief and taking the unusual step of going outside for a successor, picking Edward Kosner of New York magazine. "The clock just ran out on Terry," said Roger Black, Esquire's design director. If you can't make the magazine "hot" in two or three years, he said, "they look for someone else." Real men don't dawdle.
 
Anheuser-Busch, Lighter
 
The same day Bill Clinton gave voice to his dream of a healthier health care system, Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, said it would get a bit smaller. Any connection? No, the company insists, it does not expect any "sin tax" on alcohol to pay for health care. It has convinced the Administration, it said, that too many jobs would be lost. Perhaps. But this much is sure: beer drinkers are more and more inclined to reach for the cheaper six-pack, so Anheuser, like so many companies these days, is tightening its belt. It plans to cut salaried workers in the United States by 10 percent. As Anheuser-Busch Light, it hopes, it will be in fighting trim.
 
At Empire, an Official Mea Culpa
 
Empire Blue Cross has come clean. When evidence mounted earlier this year that the insurer had falsified records, the new managers ordered an internal inquiry. Last week Empire said the inquiry had shown that, yes, it was all true. Empire had shifted losses from ledger to ledger, overstating losses on high-risk policies so it could argue to New York State officials that it had been forced to take too many bad risks. Was it worth it? Empire was losing plenty as it was -- $250 million in 1991 and 1992. It didn't have to juggle the numbers to show hardship.
 
The F.C.C. Redraws the Maps
 
Forget those familiar state outlines. They never made sense anyway -- the nation's largest city jammed between New Jersey and Connecticut; San Francisco and Los Angeles, worlds apart yet sharing a state. No, it is the age of portable phones, of computer data speeding through the air. The shapes that matter now are "major trading areas." The F.C.C. created these last week -- 51 of them -- as it set terms for a multibillion-dollar auction of the airwaves. The F.C.C. has set aside far more of the spectrum than is now used by cellular phones, with new licenses to be auctioned in each zone. What does it all mean? All sorts of new contraptions for "wireless communications," and competition that should lead to lower prices for consumers. And what of the dying art of letter-writing? Don't ask.
 
Merck's Loss, Marion's Gain
 
All the health care uncertainty may be churning things up for drug makers, under attack for high prices. Richard J. Markham was seen as the heir apparent at Merck, but resigned suddenly in July, citing "personal reasons." But last week Marion Merrell Dow named Mr. Markham as its new president.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Paying a Bill for Mideast Peace
 
On the theory that a neglected Palestinian is an angry Palestinian, Secretary of State Warren Christopher promised a quick $250 million last week to help make Mideast peace a reality. And he called on the rest of the world to come up with more at a conference that could begin this week. About 60 percent of the money would go to public projects in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The need for rebuilding is so desperate, though, that the P.L.O. called for far more -- $2.5 billion now and $11.6 billion by 2000. But whatever the sum, money must be made available immediately, Mr. Christopher said, to curb the unemployment that "fuels extremism."
 
In Japan, Lawyers Are Coming
 
Hard as it may be to believe, Japan became an economic powerhouse with practically no lawyers. Well, it does have 14,000 of them, but in the United States that would barely be enough to thrash out a couple of good-sized corporate mergers. Why, in America there are 850,000 lawyers, all busy, busy, busy swapping their reams of legal prose. So how does Japan do it? For one thing, it has kept most American lawyers out. After all, if American lawyers are scarce, they can't do much, but if there are a lot of them, they'll be sure to keep one another busy. But now, under growing international pressure, Japan is about to lift many restrictions on foreign lawyers, even allowing foreign law firms to form partnerships with Japanese.
 
Beijing: Close, but No Olympics
 
 
China's economy has stepped firmly onto the world stage, and its star turn would have been to win the 2000 Olympics for Beijing. China waged a huge campaign to get that seal of approval from its fellow nations, but it was not to be. In a sense, it came down to this: whether the Olympics should look back or ahead. Looking back, China's human-rights record just could not be forgotten, while Australia had proven with the '56 Melbourne Games that it could put on the show. Sydney "presented no problems," one Olympic Committee member said. But looking ahead, China, with a fifth of the world's population, is opening up. It is the future. And if Beijing won, it could help push China toward more openness, more tolerance. In the end, picking Sydney, the committee could not ignore the past.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
The Vision: Health Security
 
That commotion you heard last week was one hell of an idea being born. At a celebration in the health care "war room" in the Old Executive Office Building after President Clinton's speech to Congress, Hillary Rodham Clinton stood on a chair and announced that it would now be called the "delivery room." Now it's time to bring up baby, to make good on the vow to provide health security for all, but keeping it simple enough to work.
 
And that other roar you heard was practically every citizen in this vast nation -- awakened to the giddy, scary realization that things were really likely to change -- pleading in unison, "What's in it for me?" People wanted to know which doctors they'd go to, what would be covered, how much they'd pay. Doctors wanted to know who'd be looking over their shoulders. Insurance companies wanted to know where they fit in. Medical students wanted to know whether their chosen careers were in disarray. And on and on. And of course the lobbyists moved out in force, trying to put their stamp on the final plan.
 
Russia Spooks the Market
 
The stock market is still high, but it's nervous. Traders, deeper in the jungle than they've ever been, are casting their eyes warily about, ready to sprint to safety if a lion appears -- or even if they think another trader sees a lion. Well, last week they saw a lion -- the political upheaval in Russia -- and they jumped, with the Dow industrials off 70 points at one point on Tuesday. As the crisis played out, though, traders decided that this lion, though fierce, would probably not eat them, and the Dow steadied to close down just 38 for the day. And the rest of the week the market just bobbed up and down a few points.
 
Gold prices surged, too, the day the Russian crisis erupted. Though it's a market axiom that investors seek havens for their money when times are shaky, it's never quite clear what good a bunch of gold bars are going to do someone if the world falls apart.
 
The Fed Won't Raise Rates
 
If anyone thought rock-bottom interest rates were a short-lived phenomenon, that the Federal Reserve could jump in any time to nudge them up again, the Fed put such ideas to rest last week, surprising many economists. In releasing a report of its Aug. 17 meeting, it said that since "economic growth did not seem particularly robust," it was no longer poised to raise rates at a moment's notice.

HEADLINE: Profile: Louis Loss;
For the Father of Securities Law, Yet Another Milestone

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
THEY came to a corner room of the library at Harvard Law School where Oliver Wendell Holmes's Civil War sword and humongous lunch pail were on display for an unusual book party. The scholars and lawyers and friends were here to celebrate Louis Loss's latest opus.
It is an 11-volume treatise on securities law, an update co-authored by the 79-year-old Professor Loss of the seminal single volume he wrote 42 years ago that founded an entire field of study: the law that governs Wall Street. But to many of those who gathered on Sept. 17, the celebration was as much of a life as it was of a law book. 
 For most of the second half of this century, Louis Loss has been known as the intellectual father of securities law.
Working virtually alone in the early 1950's, he was the first to put together all the laws, regulations and court decisions involving modern finance and systematically analyze them. He even coined the phrase "securities regulation" and made it the title of the first book on the subject, published in 1951.
Since then, his writings have had a profound impact on the law as judges and Government officials have turned to them in preparing thousands of opinions and regulations. His works have been cited more than 50 times by the Supreme Court and more than 1,000 times by other state and Federal judges.
He helped develop the initial theories that enabled the Securities and Exchange Commission to use the broadly worded anti-fraud provision of the Federal securities law to prosecute illegal insider trading, and he is proud of the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition) credits him for the word "tippee," referring to the person who receives an inside tip about a stock and then illegally trades on it.
Professor Loss has also consulted for many state legislatures and foreign governments about their own emerging laws, and trained generations of practitioners, academics and judges. Indeed, he has taught more people about securities law than any other person alive today. Among the thousands who have taken his course are four justices on the Supreme Court (Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg). A fifth, Harry A. Blackmun, maintains a warm friendship.
His most ambitious effort was a decade-long attempt through the 1970's to rewrite all the existing securities laws, regulations and court decisions into one coherent statute, a kind of Napoleonic Code for Wall Street. The effort failed when the new Reagan Administration gave it a lukewarm reception and many of the project's strongest supporters on Capitol Hill retired.
But the 700-page measure is now widely regarded as the most successful bill ever to fail in Congress. It is routinely cited by courts searching to interpret existing laws, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has turned many of its ideas into regulations.
Professor Loss says the need for Congress to simplify and update many laws is greater than ever. Some have not been touched for a half century, and others were grafted on the books piecemeal without looking at how they relate to other provisions.
"Patch, patch, patch," Mr. Loss said, describing what he views as the biggest problem in securities regulation today. "Each statute is a little different, with a curlicue here and a curlicue there. It means there are a great many questions that are litigated that ought not to be."
As an example, he added: "The Supreme Court has considered what is a security 10 times. That is remarkable. It is also wasteful."
Professor Loss's philosophy is not easy to articulate and, indeed, his failure to identify with a particular theory of the law has given him greater credibility with the courts and other scholars.
"When I began work with him on the treatise I asked him, 'What is your philosophy?' " recalled Joel Seligman, a professor at the University of Michigan who co-authored the study, called "Securities Regulation" (Little, Brown & Company). "He said, 'I don't have a good philosophy other than use good judgment.' Almost in the manner of Justice Lewis Powell, he takes the law section by section, and most generalizations about the law he views as naive. It is the fact that he does not have some grand theory that has made him so persuasive."
Yet in his many writings, Professor Loss has strongly supported the position that the way to insure integrity of the markets and reduce fraud and self-dealing is through mandatory and complete disclosure. While that view is now widely accepted, during the early years of the S.E.C. it was still subject to intense debate. Some critics argued that rather than require disclosure, the Government should try to evaluate the merits of stock offerings.
But Professor Loss was also quick to recognize that disclosure was not enough and that the Government must do more to protect investors from the unscrupulous.
Many of the ideas that he once fought to establish are now standard rule or law. For instance, the "shingle theory," which holds that a stock dealer who hangs out his shingle implies that he will deal with his customers fairly, is now taken for granted. But when it was developed in 1939 it was quite controversial; a lot of people in the securities industry thought that the Government had no business interfering in the marketplace and that the rule should be "let the investor beware."
Professor Loss has now slowed down somewhat, speaking more softly and taking greater efforts to get out of his chair, and he now needs a cane to walk even a short distance. As he grows older, he has begun to look more like the movie version of a Harvard Law scholar better known to most Americans, John Houseman as Professor Kingsfield.
AND although Professor Loss no longer teaches, he still finds himself involved in a number of significant cases. He has been retained, for instance, in a long-running dispute between Unocal and T. Boone Pickens's Mesa Petroleum. The issue: whether Mesa violated a Federal law against concealing large stock purchases when it bought Unocal stock through Jefferies & Company from Ivan F. Boesky and Irwin Jacobs during a takeover contest.
"People have paid a lot of money over the years to use my name," Professor Loss said. But there are times when his recognition has not always been helpful. A Federal appeals panel in New York once asked during a case whether it should believe his interpretation of a particular provision as an advocate or the contrary analysis he had previously written in a treatise. Ultimately, the judges adopted the view from his scholarly work.
Louis Loss was born in 1914, the son of immigrants from Minsk, in Russia, and he grew up in Lancaster, Pa. By the time he was 11, he decided to become a lawyer, he said, because a brother-in-law to whom he had grown close had been one.
As a teen-ager he hung around the county courthouse dreaming of being a trial lawyer. In 1934 he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in pre-law. He attended Yale Law School during the depths of the Depression.
He went to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1937, three years after it was founded. He was lured to Washington, he said, because of the excitement of the New Deal and because the big Wall Street firms were closed to Jews. (He views it a delicious irony that although he would have been denied a job at Sullivan & Cromwell, he is now the Harvard Law School professor emeritus who holds the chair funded by that law firm in the name of its founder, William Nelson Cromwell.)
Although he never rose above the rank of deputy general counsel, Mr. Loss exerted enormous authority at the tiny commission, particularly in the early 1950's, when the new chairman was Harry McDonald. Mr. McDonald got the job, according to news accounts at the time, because President Truman was a close friend and very much enjoyed it when Mr. McDonald would visit him and sing a song called "Wagon Wheels."
At about the same time, Mr. Loss began teaching securities law part time at Yale and at the George Washington University School of Law. At first, recalled his former colleague Milton Kroll, there were only about eight or nine students each year. Now, of course, the subject is almost as popular as constitutional law and contracts.
After leaving the commission, he wound up at Harvard. He later turned down a Kennedy Administration offer to become chairman of the S.E.C.
Professor Loss, who lives in Cambridge, with his wife, Bernice, the keeper of the room where the law school's artwork and artifacts are kept, says his new project will be a book he has tentatively called "Anecdotes of a Securities Lawyer." It will cover his years in the courts, lobbying for legislation, at the S.E.C., and at Harvard. But he confesses that his first love has been writing treatises.
"There are people at this faculty who scorn treatise writing and liken legal treatises to battleships -- prime, prestigious stuff in their time, but not really worth their keep in the contemporary world," he said. "They prefer to write about the sex lives of caterpillars. But what they don't realize is that these books have shaped the law. They have made a field of law that didn't exist before."
 
NOT A MANUAL, A RICH HISTORY

THE new 11-volume treatise co-authored by Louis Loss, "Securities Regulation," is encyclopedic in its treatment of the laws governing every aspect of American finance, from stocks and bonds to insider trading and mutual funds.
It is more than just a technical legal manual. It is a rich history that begins in 1285 when a law of Edward I authorized the licensing of brokers in London and works its way through the speculative frenzy of 18th-century Europe known as the South Sea Bubble, the origins of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the crash of 1987, the last 10 years of leveraged buyouts and takeover contests, and the emergence of mutual funds, options and futures, and index-based financial products.
Typical of its approach is its examination of what one might think a dry subject -- short-selling, the practice of betting that a stock will fall by selling borrowed shares and later buying them back at a lower price.
The chapter on the subject begins with a look at how the Dutch first banned short-selling 300 years ago and then taxed it. It looks at Napoleon's views on the practice in 1802 and then moves swiftly to the decision by Congress to ban short sales of gold during the closing days of the Civil War and then reverse itself after gold dollars rose in value.
It later explores 200 years of British laws on the subject and the state laws in the United States that led ultimately to the Federal regulations beginning in 1938.

HEADLINE: The Performance Scale: What It Means, How It Was Done

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
IN NEW YORK CITY, the traditional measure of a school's effectiveness has been how well its students perform on standardized reading and math tests. But this measure omits a factor that educators consider a major influence on a child's school performance: the social and economic differences among students' families.
The school performance scale seeks to give parents more information to evaluate the effectiveness of individual public elementary and intermediate schools, by adjusting scores on math and reading tests to eliminate socioeconomic variations. The scale is based on data provided by the Board of Education and on the work of Dr. Robert Berne, an associate dean at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, who has been studying ways to judge New York City school performance for several years. Profiles of city's high schools were not available when the study was done. 
 The district superintendents who reviewed the new performance listings agreed that the schools that ranked high in their districts were, in general, more effective than the low-performing ones, even though they might not be the ones with the highest math or reading scores. Many of the superintendents, though, insisted that since each school was so singular, no statistical analysis could tell its entire story.
Indeed, the calculation includes assumptions that may not fit every school. Sometimes exceptional patterns -- a high concentration of gifted low-income students or of new immigrants with special problems -- may explain why a school scores significantly higher or lower than otherwise similar schools. The new scale should not be seen as the only tool for assessing the quality of public elementary and intermediate schools; many parents may still rely on traditional performance measures.
Educators and researchers have long known that the background of students -- the income, occupation and education of their parents, the parents' expectations for their children, the stability of a family -- has a strong bearing on academic achievement. A recent study of Scholastic Aptitude Test scores by the College Board showed that students from the poorest families, with incomes under $10,000, scored about 120 points lower than students from families with incomes over $70,000. The S.A.T. results are scored on a scale that runs from 200 to 800.
These differences are so well understood that researchers routinely make statistical adjustments to control for variations in student background when comparing schools. For example, in a study of public and parochial education ("Public and Private High Schools," Basic Books, 1987), Dr. James S. Coleman of the University of Chicago used the socioeconomic background of students to level the playing field when comparing the performance of public and parochial schools.
In the new performance scale, Board of Education data on family income were used as the indicator for the differences in student background, because of a strong relationship between income and other important factors, like family structure and parent education. For each school, the board reported the percentage of students above the eligibility limit for Federal education aid for the poor. In most cases, that is 130 percent of the Federal poverty level.
Using standard statistical techniques, the study identified a "predicted" reading score for the average school at each level of family income. Schools were then ranked by how much the actual test scores differed from the predicted values, and they were divided into five groups. Schools in the top categories performed better than predicted. Schools in the bottom categories performedbelow expectations. Schools in the middle performed as expected.
On the chart, each dot represents a school. The horizontal axis shows family income, the vertical axis shows test scores. The diagonal line shows the relationship between income and achievement -- how the typical school at each income level was predicted to perform on the tests. The difference between this line and a school's actual score is the measure of its performance.
The city's Board of Education has been working to develop a similar analysis of public-school performance. South Carolina also uses income as an important criterion in awarding $5,000 bonuses to high-achievement schools. It makes its awards after grouping schools by the poverty level of the students and the experience of its teachers -- factors beyond the control of a particular principal.
Dr. Berne of N.Y.U. said some educators and advocates for the poor worry that the statistical adjustments set lower standards for schools serving poor children -- in effect grading them on a curve. But he said that the performance measures test how well urban schools are able to overcome daily challenges. "Part of the notion of the American system of common schools is to overcome a strong relationship between a child's station in life and his ability," he said. "This measures how successful schools are at doing that. It should not be a substitute for high absolute standards."
But others object. Michael Meyers, the executive director of the New York Civil Rights Commission, called it a form of "educational snobbery."
"This sort of measure institutionalizes low expectations of low-income, low-status students," he said. "It doesn't set out a single standard of achievement for everybody. I think that all children can be held to a single standard of achievement."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Betting on Bonds of New Markets

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
THAT mutual fund investors are crazy for yield is an old story -- what is new is how far they will go to find it.
With yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue hovering around 6 percent, investors are fleeing the United States in droves, to the emerging markets of South America, Eastern Europe and Africa. 
 The first of the dozen or so closed-end and mutual funds to invest in the debt of emerging markets began in mid-1991, but most came to market this year. Their red-hot returns -- plus yields of 7 percent to 11 percent -- are quite seductive, but analysts say investors should not be blind to the risks of investing in developing countries.
The rush to emerging markets debt began in 1989 when investors embraced the "Brady bonds," conceived by Nicholas F. Brady, then the Treasury Secretary, to resolve the Latin America debt mess created when Mexico and other countries defaulted on their American bank loans. Mr. Brady crafted a plan under which some loans were forgiven and new, more solid debt was issued.
After that, "the funds jumped on the Brady bond bandwagon," said Catherine Gillis, editor of Morningstar Closed-End Funds, a Chicago newsletter. The Eurobond market that existed then was too small and illiquid to support huge foreign investment; but the Brady bond market took off, and has ballooned to more than $140 billion.
The appeal of Brady bonds is simple: Most principal is guaranteed by zero-coupon bonds issued by the United States Treasury, and a few interest payments are guaranteed as well. And because the bonds are denominated in dollars, the currency risk -- the bane of overseas investments -- is eliminated. Moreover, the interest-rate risk is reduced because many coupons are pegged to short-term rather than long-term rates.
The biggest risk in emerging markets debt is the credit risk. Investors are paid a hefty premium for buying the debt of countries with questionable economic and political track records over the past hundred years. While Mexico's debt is on the verge of being upgraded and Chile's already has been, the biggest share of emerging markets debt is still rated below investment grade.
Because of the risk, Kenneth E. Gregory, who edits the No-Load Fund Analyst, a newsletter based in San Francisco, would fill no more than 5 percent of a diversified portfolio with emerging markets debt. He would do so by reducing existing positions in United States stocks, junk bonds and emerging markets equities.
Besides the tiny $600,000 Megy Income mutual fund, in Palm Beach, Fla., started in May 1991, among the first to venture into Latin America was the Latin American Dollar Income Fund, a closed-end fund started by Scudder, Stevens & Clark in July 1992. The fund lost 2.5 percent in the last quarter of 1992 because of ripples from the European currency crisis but rebounded sharply this year, gaining 25.5 percent through August.
The second generation of closed-ends -- Alliance World Dollar Government and Salomon Brothers' Emerging Markets Income -- came to market in October. Unlike the Scudder fund, which is limited to Latin America, these invest in emerging markets worldwide, including Nigeria, Poland and Morocco.
Because of their double-digit yields, the funds have been very popular. This has prompted a second round of offerings this spring and summer from Salomon and Alliance and one from Morgan Stanley; the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund is in the works.
Not to be outdone, mutual funds that invest in emerging markets debt worldwide are also sprouting up quickly. First to invest worldwide was the GT Global High Income Fund, started last October. The fund, which has $175 million in assets so far, gained more than 30 percent in the first eight months of the year, partly because of the price appreciation created by falling interest rates.
Close to two-thirds of the fund is invested in Latin America, with 23 percent in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, mainly Morocco (11 percent). Another 6 percent is invested in the Philippines and Asia, with the balance in cash. The fund yields slightly more than 7 percent.
Two more funds followed in May: the $45 million Bear Stearns Emerging Markets Fund, the company's first mutual fund, and Fidelity Investments' $125 million New Markets Income Fund, the only no-load fund among the emerging markets debt group. Another no-load fund, from Dreyfus, should come to market shortly.
The Bear Stearns mutual fund is billed as the most conservative of its kind. The fund cannot use leverage; by contrast, GT can leverage up to 32 percent of its portfolio, although it has not done so yet.
Also, the Bear Stearns fund can own only bonds, of which at least 50 percent must be invested in Latin America. Today, 80 percent is invested there, with the balance in Asia and Africa. GT can invest up to 35 percent of its portfolio in stocks, although it has no money in stocks now and no plans to start, a company spokesman said. Fidelity can also own stocks.
Another way for a fund to reduce risk is to diversify. Look at how many issues a fund owns, and how geographically diverse it is. Evaluate interest-rate risk by looking at how much of the debt is tied to short-term rates.

Amid the Peep Shows, Discount Groceries

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
A new store has opened on Eighth Avenue at 43d Street, behind a bright orange front and huge spotlights. It is not a peep-show parlor or porno theater.
It is a discount food store, catering to families, although it gets its share of homeless people and residents of nearby single-room-occupancy hotels. 
 "It's a great location because there's lots of traffic -- tourists, commuters, late-shift workers and families from Ninth Avenue," said Janusz Sendowski, an owner of the store, Best Buy Foods. "And of course there are go-go girls, too, who eat lots of sweets for energy. We've already run out of Oreos."
Mr. Sendowski, who was born in Poland, and his Israeli-born partner, David Sarfati, started a fast-food restaurant on Fulton Street in lower Manhattan in 1982. When the economy began to falter, they went into the discount business, opening D.D.S., a department store on Eighth Avenue at 42d Street, as well as three food stores in the Bronx.
Neighborhood residents who have been shopping at the store in the month since it opened have noted that its prices are lower than those charged nearby. Among this week's best sellers are Adriatic jams, at $1.29 for a one-pound jar; a 6 1/2-ounce can of Bumble Bee tuna at 59 cents, and a 23-ounce bottle of Perrier for $1.29.
Although Best Buy Foods keeps long hours -- 6 A.M. to 2 A.M. -- security has not been a problem, Mr. Sarfati said. "The big lights and a permanent guard help." M. H.

Desperately Seeking Savior: New Hope for Lion's Head

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
As mounting tax debts threaten to close the Lion's Head, its owners say they may have found a savior for the watering hole, long popular with authors, entertainers and politicians.
Since declaring bankruptcy in 1991, the Lion's Head has continued operating -- and running up more bills. To recoup $250,000 in sales taxes, state tax collectors have begun legal action that could lead to liquidation. 
 But Judith E. and John Wesley Joice, the couple who own the bar, say they are negotiating with a prospective buyer, though they would not give a name. They hope to have an offer in place by their next court appearance, next month.
"Closing is the easy way out, but it's pointless, because there's no chance of repaying debts," said Ms. Joice. "We took the more painful route to try to pay up."
The Lion's Head, at 59 Christopher Street at Sheridan Square, has had memorable moments in its 27 years. Covers from about 100 books, all written by Lion's Head patrons, decorate the walls.
At the bar's round table, legend has it, the writer Pete Hamill talked Robert F. Kennedy into running for the Senate. Norman Mailer made the bar an ad hoc headquarters when he ran for Mayor in 1969. Mayor Edward I. Koch often stopped for lunch, and so has David Dinkins.
Before stardom, Jessica Lange was a waitress, and Rod Steiger used to get his mail there. Lanford Wilson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, wrote a drama on waiters' order pads.
The Clancy brothers strummed guitars there. Bill Murray, Linda Ellerbee, William Hurt and Jackie Mason wined and dined. For young people on the way up, said Ms. Joice, "we used to buy dinners and beers so they could survive."
At times when The New York Post and The Daily News nearly folded, staff members gathered, "not knowing if it was for a wake or a celebration," she said.
The Lion's Head's fortunes first went downhill in 1985 "when a lot of village businesses started to go down with the phenomenal fear of AIDS," Ms. Joice said. Revenue revived a bit in 1986, she said, "then -- boom -- the stock crash in 1987, then the recession."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Suzuki's Sidekick: Useful, Thrifty and Entertaining

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
YOU don't hear much about Suzuki these days, but Japan's No. 6 automaker just keeps on truckin'.
In fact, American sales for 1992 were up 15 percent from the year before, and the company expects '93 results to be 12 percent better than that. And while the numbers are not huge -- 25,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year -- any double-digit increase in today's market is worth noting. 
 Notable, too, is Suzuki's worldwide effort, with sales of more than 833,000 cars and trucks in 150 countries. The 73-year-old company also has assembly plants and joint ventures in 25 of those countries. In fact, it may be its partnership with General Motors that obscures its presence in the United States.
Not everyone knows, for example, that Suzuki makes Geo Metros and Geo Trackers for G.M. or the ways in which they differ from Suzuki's own versions of those cars and little sport-utilities, the Swift, Samurai and Sidekick.
But then, too, tiny vehicles do keep a naturally low profile.
All the same, the Sidekick, introduced in October 1990, feels fairly tall when you motor down the highway. It rides on fat 15-inch tires, and its traction, low gearing and price also make it one of the least expensive ways to have four-wheel fun in the boondocks.
The Sidekick, which comes in two- and four-door versions and with two- and four-wheel drive, offers three levels of trim, JS, JX and JLX, and stickers range from $11,449 to $16,369. All two-door versions have canvas tops, while the four-door models have steel roofs, and there are few options.
The four-door Sidekick, sold only in America, accounts for about half of Suzuki's total sales here, and the tester was one of those, a $15,779 JLX painted polar white, with blackout trim and chrome molded wheels.
For '94, it has been gussied up with a new security alarm and a tilt steering column. But, as in the past, there was also a long list of standard equipment, including antilock brakes at the rear, power buttons for the windows, side mirrors and door locks, cruise control, reclining front buckets and a split rear seat.
The full-size spare rode on the rear in a locking hard case with "Sidekick" splashed across it. And behind the door, which swings from left to right, there was plenty of cargo room -- expandable to a more-than-plenty 45 cubic feet when the rear seat is folded down.
That seat, incidentally, is reasonably comfortable, although legroom is tight when the buckets are scooted back to accommodate tall occupants up front. One wonderful thing about the rear compartment is that the windows go all the way down, something rarely found in today's vehicles.
All Sidekicks have two-tone gray vinyl and cloth interiors, and the driver and front passenger are treated to most of the usual creature comforts. The sound system is excellent and is prewired for a compact-disk player.
There is no air bag. But, mercifully, there are none of those dangerous and troublesome mechanical seatbelts either. The four-spoke wheel is wrapped in vinyl, and the dash beyond includes a tachometer, fuel and temperature gauges and a speedometer that tops out at 90 -- faster than one probably wants to go in the rather tall and narrow Sidekick.
Buttons for the front windows are in the armrests, where they should be, and there is a one-push down function for the driver's window. Buttons for the rear windows are in the console, along with the shifter -- either standard or automatic -- and a lever to lock the vehicle into four-wheel drive.
There are overhead grab handles for all but the driver, and the dark gray vinyl dash has a large bar in front of the passenger, one that can be held with both hands should the off-roading get to be too exuberant. A small but deep tray also is molded into the top of the dash, and the glovebox is bigger than some in much larger vehicles.
The locking glove compartment is also cleverly designed to hold the hood release, an antitheft feature that other manufacturers might want to copy. The hood itself must be lifted manually and propped with a rod. But it reveals a neat engine compartment with the tiny powerplant mounted front-to-rear and affording what would appear to be easy maintenance.
The engine is aluminum, a 1.6-liter four with 16 valves and multipoint fuel injection. It produces 95 horsepower and a somewhat anemic 98 foot-pounds of torque, but then the vehicle weighs only 2,763 pounds, and performance is sufficient if not exactly robust.
The most expensive Sidekick couples the engine to a four-speed automatic transmission with a selector to choose "normal" or "power" modes for better economy or more acceleration. The tester, however, was of the five-speed persuasion, and the stick needed constant stirring to keep the little engine from stumbling.
Even so, the gearing is low, which means engine revs are high, and there is generally a fair amount of Sturm und Drang under the hood.
Otherwise, though, the Sidekick is quiet and well-behaved on the highway. The body, mounted on a frame in the old style of construction, is tight and seems possessed of fewer creaks than I have heard in the past.
The suspension also is tight and a bit firm. Combined with the big tires, it yields a jouncy ride but one that compares favorably with most other sport-utilities.
Like performance, fuel economy is sufficient if not spectacular. It ranges from a low with the four-door automatic of 22 miles per gallon, city, and 26, highway, to a high of 25 and 27 for a two-door with the stick.
Add the fact that a Sidekick's four-wheel drive is there when you need it and you have a vehicle that deserves to be . . . well, your friend and helper. The name is just right.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plan Will Restrict Health Care Choice

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Clinton's claim in his speech to Congress that his proposed reform will broaden Americans' health care choices is deceptive. His plan would in effect obliterate private practice and other small-scale providers, leaving patients to choose from a menu offering only corporate care served up by insurance giants like Prudential and Aetna.
The President hopes to control costs through the rapid expansion of large, competing health maintenance organizations. But despite the Clinton assurances that other health insurance options will remain available, private practice cannot possibly coexist with a dominant H.M.O. sector. 
 Big health maintenance organizations skimp on doctors, employing about 1 physician for every 800 enrollees, often meaning long waits for hurried consultations. In contrast, for the country as a whole, the physician-to-population ratio is 1:400.
Hence, H.M.O. expansion would absorb many patients but few physicians. The result: a glut of doctors (mostly specialists) in private practice serving a shrinking pool of patients. Initially, doctors might increase fees to meet their overhead and maintain their incomes, but increasing fees would accelerate the movement of patients into health maintenance organizations.
The Princeton economist Uwe Reinhardt has noted that if half of Americans enrolled in health maintenance organizations with 1 doctor per 800 enrollees (and competitive pressures would drive health maintenance organizations to keep physician staffing to the minimum), each remaining private physician would serve an average of only 267 patients, too few to cover even office overhead.
At some point private practice would completely collapse, leaving tens of thousands of doctors scrambling. At the limit, if all Americans enrolled in health maintenance organizations, about 275,000 doctors, most of them specialists, would be stranded in a private practice sector devoid of patients. Competition for H.M.O. jobs would be fierce, the disruption of care massive.
The President's spin doctors portray his proposal as assuring a pluralistic health care system, with patients choosing the kind of care they want and doctors free of micro-management. But simple calculations belie this image. Instead, a few insurance giants would dictate care.
The Canadian alternative is far preferable. Everyone is covered, quality of care is high, patients can freely choose and change doctors, and physicians are free to choose from a variety of practice settings. Costs have been contained by streamlining bureaucracy (largely by evicting insurance companies from the system) and by a simple budgeting system, rather than the Rube Goldberg devices proposed by Mr. Clinton.
President Clinton's plan would sacrifice the health care of those who are now satisfied. It can't contain costs and hence won't extend coverage. But it will complete the corporate transformation of American medicine.

HEADLINE: The Health Plan;
Rising Expectations And Fear of the Bills Create an Opening

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was only a wallet-size piece of red, white and blue plastic with two gold stars that President Clinton flashed to millions of Americans. But this "health security card" would be enough, he assured the public, to to safeguard Americans from a recurring nightmare: losing not only their health, but their ability to afford a cure.
Nearly 50 years after President Harry S. Truman proposed national health insurance, a consensus has finally emerged among Republicans, Democrats, labor and business groups that the nation needs to change the system. The desperation is so great that the same public that often says that Government cannot do anything right is now accepting the idea that Washington can be trusted to create a system that will control the most important, intimate and expensive aspects of American life. 
 The history of this country's quest for national health care has been one of missed opportunities. Mr. Clinton's plan is a patchwork of proposals that have been offered over the years, in one form or another, by other leaders. Yet by seizing the moment, and by framing the debate as a simple "Should Americans have health security or should they not?" while leaving the details to be fought over in Congress, Mr. Clinton has managed to create a new starting point.
Yes, party discipline has fractured, and yes, lobbyists and the general cacophony of Washington makes the fate of his proposal more problematic. Large-scale social engineering has long since lost its luster. But the bipartisan applause and the recent polls suggest that, a consensus has emerged where once there were only complaints.
The catalyst for change was not the plight of the uninsured. There have always been people too poor to afford medical care -- and often charity wards to care for them. This time it was the anxieties of the middle class, caught in a convergence of economic, social and technological forces. They feared losing their coverage in an age when even a broken bone, a pregnancy or a simple operation can be frighteningly expensive. They may mistrust Government, but they see no other way out.
"I don't think compassion is what drives this," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a professor of political economy at Princeton University. "The middle class felt in the middle of the swamp named Uninsurance, and it is really that fear of losing insurance that the President is harvesting."
More and more people have friends or family who fall victim to "job lock" -- fear of changing jobs for fear of losing medical coverage.
"Baby boomers are moving out of the 'I'll never get sick and die' stages to a point where health care costs are of great personal concern," said Tom W. Smith, of the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center. "They're not old enough for Medicare and not poor enough for the poverty programs."
Only after decades of false starts is health care on the table. Immediately after World War II, most industrialized countries established universal coverage, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt toyed with the idea as part of his Social Security proposal. He backed off, though, for fear that opposition to it would sink the entire Social Security Act.
Truman, the first President to call for guaranteed medical care, complained in his memoirs of "all the fuss" over his doomed effort. "I usually find that those who are loudest in protesting against medical help by the Federal Government are those who do not need help," he wrote.
Even a Republican President, Richard M. Nixon, pushed for a program that closely resembles Mr. Clinton's. But neither Mr. Nixon, nor his health plan, survived Watergate.
As health care reform eluded the politicians, public expectations of medicine only grew. At the turn of the century, there was still a fatalistic approach: a person's health was in the hands of God or luck. A doctor could set a bone, prescribe a dicey tonic or recommend rest, but little more. Then the rush of scientific miracles -- vaccines, antibiotics, surgery with anesthesia, X-rays, chemotherapy -- raised people's hopes.
With the hope of cure came new bills. But Americans also became more comfortable with the idea that the Government, or big anonymous insurers, would pay.
"It's not just an economic argument, it's a technological one," said Senator Harris Wofford, a Pennsylvania Democrat whose election in 1991 demonstrated the salience of health care as a campaign issue. "With the incredible miracles of technology, a sense of possibility has arisen. For the first time in history, people believe in a radical form that life can be extended -- and the revolution of rising expectations is causing the cost increases."
The bills were becoming barriers to the miracles. Decades ago, a person who had a heart attack often simply rested, or died. Now treatment may start with a $1,500-a-day hospital room and a $1,000-a-dose anti-coagulant and even end with a $100,000 heart transplant.
As recently as the 1988 elections, the idea of national health insurance was little more than "Democratic window dressing," said David Blumenthal, chief of the health policy research and development unit of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Recalling his work on Michael S. Dukakis's Presidential campaign, he said, "We were jubilant if we could get the issue on the evening news. And we did only once, when Dukakis released his own health care plan."
A turning point was when Mr. Wofford, a hopeless underdog, defeated Dick Thornburgh, a former Attorney General. At the heart of Mr. Wofford's campaign was a potent television commercial in which he said: "If criminals have the right to a lawyer, I think working Americans should have the right to a doctor."
But while Mr. Wofford proved that this issue could turn a campaign around, Mr. Clinton still did not fully grasp the gravity of the issue. It was not he but Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska who championed the issue during the primaries; his plan was much more thought out than Mr. Clinton's hastily assembled proposal for managed competition.
Yet Mr. Clinton deserves credit for using his leadership to help catapult health care to the top of the national agenda; few believe it would have won much attention had President Bush been re-elected.
But what Mr. Clinton called the "magic moment" for introducing a bill comes with no magic formula for passing one. Under Mr. Clinton's plan, everyone would be guaranteed a generous basic package of coverage, negotiated separately in each state by alliances of consumers with insurance companies and medical groups.
While interest groups and Republicans, many of whom say the plan would lower the quality of care and put a new tax burden for businesses, do not want to be portrayed as obstructionists, opponents are battling the proposal at every turn.
As the lobbyists go into overdrive, the danger is that Mr. Clinton's plan, like those of the past, will fall victim to fear. Opponents raise the specter of medicine run with the efficiency of the Postal Service or the warmth of the I.R.S. "What's happened every time is that when we're just on the verge of a plan, people say to themselves, 'Maybe it could be worse,' " said Robert J. Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health policy at Harvard University.
But Mr. Clinton seems ready to fight fear with fear. Asked by Ted Koppel on "Nightline" about a poll showing people are worried that their future health costs won't be taken care of, the President was intentionally not reassuring. "They should worry," he said.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Every New President Gets a Rematch

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
"BRING them home!" Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia thundered on the Senate floor the other day, as he pondered aloud the mounting risks facing American troops hunting down warlords in Mogadishu. "I do not intend for the Senate just to roll over and play dead to this Administration!"
Well before a rocket-propelled grenade downed a U.S. Blackhawk missle in the Somali capital Saturday, killing three American soldiers, these words gave evidence of Congress's increasing restiveness over the Somalia mission in particular and and foreign affairs in general. 
 Lawmakers have taken the lead in recent months in pushing the Administration to suspend nuclear arms testing and to drop military aid for a losing war on cocaine in the Peruvian Andes. And they threaten the warming trend in relations with Mexico, with constant attacks on Mexican Government corruption and repression that could help defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But it is in Somalia and Bosnia where the new Democratic President and the Democratic Congress are trying to define a new foreign policy while continuing the almost ritualistic struggle over which one should have the ultimate power to put American forces in harm's way.
While the Constitution granted Congress the power to declare war, it appointed the President Commander in Chief. It was left it up to the two branches to work out the details. That difficult process was played out again last week when Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary Les Aspin and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake traveled to Capitol Hill for feedback on a possible peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
Like Congress, the Administration is deeply split on whether or not to send troops to Bosnia, and it's quite possible Mr. Clinton would welcome the cover that a reluctant Congress would provide. Still, the officials faced a barrage from Congressional leaders who took the opportunity to lay down markers and warn that Congressional authorization would be difficult to get should the Administration decide to send troops.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told the officials they should win assurances from the warring parties that they will drop their heavy arms and ease the delivery of relief supplies -- difficult conditions in a war characterized by fluid battle lines and loose command controls. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, publicly warned that they must come up with an exit strategy before even thinking about deploying troops.
 
Sparring Branches

 
 Congressional skepticism over new foreign interventions is likely to be on display again early this week when the House is expected to pass a resolution that will force the Administration to put limitations on its goals in Somalia or face the likelihood of a cutoff of funds. The Senate already approved the resolution by a 90-7 vote two weeks ago. President Bush won widespread Congressional support for dispatching troops on a humanitarian mission, but power brokers like Senators Byrd and Nunn are unhappy that the mission has changed from feeding to fighting.
Congress has argued with Presidents for more control over foreign policy ever since Thomas Jefferson, without legislative sanction, dispatched a naval squadron to the Mediterranean under secret orders to fight the Barbary pirates. With few exceptions, the legislative branch has lost this continuing turf fight.
But the balance shifted somewhat after Vietnam and Watergate. An emboldened Congress enacted the War Powers Act over President Nixon's veto, leading to a trend toward greater Congressional involvement in foreign policy. This led to the passage of economic sanctions on South Africa over President Reagan's objections. Congress curtailed and occasionally cut off military aid to the Nicaraguan contra guerrillas, setting the stage for the Iran-contra scandal, which underscored the willingness of senior Reagan Administration officials to circumvent the limits Congress had set on intervention in Central America.
For the most part, Congress deferred to President Bush on foreign affairs, although the Persian Gulf war resolution of 1991 was viewed as a victory for legislators demanding a tightening of Congressional controls over war powers after the unauthorized 1989 invasion of Panama.
Enter Bill Clinton. A foreign policy neophyte, he ran for President promising to concentrate on domestic policy. He sharply disagreed with Mr. Bush on China and Haitian immigration, but then reversed himself once elected and adopted stances similar to those of Mr. Bush.
The President's inexperience and indecisiveness gave Congressional foreign policy experts an opening. "When you have a President who is new in foreign affairs and a Secretary of State who is cautious," said Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, a ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, "Congress fills the vacuum."
Mr. Simon suggested that Mr. Clinton could eclipse Congress as he gains experience and luster from presiding over international events like the recent signing of the peace agreement by the Israelis and Palestinians.
But leading lawmakers predict that the end of the cold war opens new opportunities for Congress to project its powers overseas no matter who is in the White House. With the threat of nuclear war reduced, constituents are demanding that their representatives address issues like trade, drugs and immigration.
"Increasingly all foreign policy issues are becoming domestic issues," said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, a leading Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee. "As a reflection of public input, Congress is demanding and playing a greater role."

HEADLINE: SEPTEMBER 19-25: Mandela Seeks Investment;
South Africa's Blacks Get Their First Share of Power, And Sanctions Promptly Fall

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk began demobilizing their political forces last week, demonstrating their faith that South Africa's course of negotiated democracy is now all but irreversible.
First Mr. de Klerk assembled his docile Parliament to enact a law that will surrender some of the white Government's power to a multiparty council until the first universal elections next April. Mr. Mandela thereupon laid aside one of the last weapons of the liberation struggle. He urged his allies in the West to call off the remaining sanctions against trade and investment. The appeal at the United Nations was quickly heeded by states from New York to California and countries from Europe to New Zealand. 
 In coming weeks negotiators will fortify their consensus by adopting an interim Constitution, and by creating a peacekeeping force drawn from the police and anti-apartheid guerrillas. They will also try to consolidate their partnership of the center against the violent fringes on both sides. Only if these center-building measures succeed can Mr. Mandela expect the West to heed the other appeal he made in New York -- to help rejuvenate the economy by investing. BILL KELLER

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: VERBATIM;
A Call to Enlarge Democracy's Reach

 BODY:
EIGHT months into the Clinton Administration, debate continues to percolate in Washington about America's proper role in the post-Communist world. Top officials set out last week to define the Administration's vision, as President Clinton prepared to address the United Nations. On Tuesday, his national security adviser, Anthony Lake, offered his view of the nation's new foreign-policy goals. The speech, excerpted here, was delivered at Johns Hopkins University. 
 Throughout the cold war, we contained a global threat to market democracies; now we should seek to enlarge their reach. . . .
 First, we should strengthen the community of major market democracies -- including our own -- which constitutes the core from which enlargement is proceeding.
Second, we should help foster and consolidate new democracies and market economies, where possible, especially in states of special significance and opportunity.
Third, we must counter the aggression -- and support the liberalization -- of states hostile to democracy and markets.
Fourth, we need to pursue our humanitarian agenda not only by providing aid, but also by working to help democracy and market economics take root in regions of greatest humanitarian concern.
. . .
In this world of multiplying democracies . . . the rulers of backlash states face an unpleasant choice. They can seek to isolate their people from these liberating forces. If they do, however, they cut themselves off from the very forces that create wealth and social dynamism. Such states tend to rot from within, both economically and spiritually. But as they grow weaker, they also may become more desperate and dangerous.
Our policy toward such states . . . must seek to isolate them diplomatically, militarily, economically and technologically. It must stress intelligence, counterterrorism, and multilateral export controls. It also must apply global norms regarding weapons of mass destruction and ensure their enforcement.
. . .
 When the actions of such states directly threaten our people, our forces, or our vital interests, we clearly must be prepared to strike back decisively and unilaterally.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Malls Wrestle With the Blues

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM

 BODY:
THAT inalienable American right -- the freedom to shop -- has long been subject to the vagaries of Sunday blue laws. And though these barriers to consumerism have fallen in many states where churchgoing shares the day with trimming the hedges and driving to the mall, the battle between the soul and a sale is not over.
The debate is being rekindled in the mall country of northern New Jersey. On Election Day, voters in Bergen County will decide whether to overturn their 34-year-old ban on Sunday shopping. Although 10 of the state's 21 counties adopted blue laws in 1959, Bergen is the last to retain them. 
 Advocates of repeal -- the local newspaper, The Record, and a large shopping mall in Hackensack, Riverside Square -- say voters need and want that extra shopping day. The mall, which includes Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue, says Sunday openings will help the economy.
Opponents include the Garden State Plaza shopping center in neighboring Paramus, the epicenter of North Jersey consumerism and home to three other large malls and many free-standing highway stores. They argue that the county's tranquillity is at stake.
But even if the county law is repealed, a separate and more stringent Paramus law remains, and borough officials have vowed never to lift it. The result would place the Paramus plaza, which is home to Macy's, Nordstrom's and Penney's, and the other malls and businesess at a disadvantage.
The county law is certainly an anachronism. Perhaps fewer than a dozen states retain some vestige of a prohibition that has its roots in a decree by the Roman Emperor Constantine. In 321 A.D., trying to calm the political turbulence between Christians and the pagan majority, he proclaimed a weekly celebration, a day of the Sun, which placated both camps.
After they arrived in Massachusetts, the Puritans etched their Sunday decrees on blue paper, marking the commonwealth as the Mount Sinai of such blue laws in the New World. As such, worldly pursuits -- with some exceptions -- have been off-limits since 1645.
 
The Din of Machines

 
 As the country grew, church and temperance groups fought periodically with civil authorities to preserve Sunday as a day of rest and contemplation. When they succeeded, they succeeded with a vengeance: repeat violators in 17th century Virginia were executed.
After the Civil War, as factories operated around the clock and society's needs and expectations changed, the call for a quiet Sunday was often drowned out by the industrial revolution. With economics rolling over the work prohibition, only the temperance movement apear to be holding the fort, with many states restricting the Sunday sale of alcoholic beverages to restaurants or hotel dining rooms.
David Laband, an economist at Salisbury State University in Maryland, traces the decline of the Sunday ban in his book "Blue Laws" (Lexington Books, 1987). "You're talking to an economist," Mr. Laband said. "Maybe the reason the churches worked to shut businesses was to limit competition."
But Mr. Laband found no drop-off in church attendance or in per-capita contributions when the blue laws were repealed or nonexistent. Nor did he find anti-Sabbath bias in votes by state legislatures to lift the bans. The laws began to evaporate when society began looking for ways to stretch the rules.
Riddled with exceptions and arbitrary provisions for enforcement, many blue laws have have been abolished. In 1970, 25 states had statewide blue laws; by 1984, 12 had repealed them.
North Dakota's experience is typical. Its blue laws listed 37 types of businesses that could be open and 44 categories of merchandise that could not be sold.
"You could buy a greeting card in a drug store, which was allowed to be open, but not a card store, which couldn't be open," said David Huey, an assistant attorney general in Bismarck. "It got to be complicated."
Consumers got fed up. In 1991, the Legislature discarded the old law, allowing shops to open after noon on Sundays.
"It's not uncharacteristic of our legal system," Mr. Huey said. "It comes from an erosion of the law, not a full frontal assault. Pretty soon you've got so many exceptions, it doesn't make any sense to have the law at all."
 
Closed Liquor Stores

 
 In New York, restaurants may serve alcohol, and beer is available in supermarkets after noon, but liquor stores must be closed. In Texas, until a few years ago, consumers could buy beer but not diapers, a can of beans but not a can opener, a hammer but not nails.
Massachusetts has its own quirks. "Apparel stores are closed, but it's O.K. to sell souvenirs," said Ken Gear, a spokesman for the Retail Association of Massachusetts. "We like to say, 'You can't buy a T-shirt unless it says Cape Cod on it.' " Mr. Gear's organization is seeking to repeal the blue laws, which have come under increasing fire for being arbitrarily enforced.
In New Jersey, the arguments are less about quirky legal provisions than about the peace envisioned by Constantine: Should a free market take precedence over a day of rest from the turbulence and frustration caused by traffic and angry motorists?
Routes 4 and 17, the county's shopping crossroads, are jammed all week and especially on Saturday. Opponents of repeal fear that a seventh day of shopping would make ordinary life unbearable and put an extra burden on municipal services in Paramus and elsewhere. Opponents insist that the suburban quality of life is at stake.
For Texans, who struggled for 25 years with what was known as the item law, a quality of life debate would have been a relief.
"It got confusing at the checkout counter." said Mickey Moore of the Texas Retailers Association. "You'd have a cart full of groceries, hardware, pots and pans. You could buy some of it, but not all of it. But the real fallacy in the law was, if you went to a retail store and said it was an emergency, then you could buy it."
The exceptions drove people nuts. Merchants were hauled off to jail. Customers wondered if they would also be subject to arrest. The blue laws, enacted in 1853 and amended numerous times, were finally repealed in 1985.
"No one in the retail community wanted people arrested in their store," Mr. Moore said. "You can understand that."

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
IT was the ultimate tribute to the power of talk radio: Bill Clinton was taking questions.
Last week, as part of the media blitz surrounding the President's health care proposal, the Clinton Administration held the first-ever White House briefing for hosts of the nation's radio call-in programs. Roughly 200 hosts showed up. 
 Time was when all a President had to do by way of news management was call in a brace of influential Washington columnists for a serious lunch a day or two before the press conference for everyone else. Those days are clearly gone. The briefing for radio hosts was a White House acknowledgement of a phenomenon that was much remarked upon during the 1992 campaign -- the rise of the "new" news media.
It was also, by most accounts, one of the rowdier question-and-answer sessions ever to take place at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
"We were like the nouveaux riches who don't know what salad fork to use," Barry Farber, the New York City radio host, said. "There was a lot of classless behavior."
David Gergen, the White House counselor, described Tuesday's briefing less delicately: "They were yelling and screaming at each other," he said.
One host loudly advised another to drop dead. Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, had to scream for quiet. When Marshall McLuhan called radio a hot medium, he didn't know the half of it.
That the medium can also be a powerful -- though often unpredictable -- political force is something that few in Washington question these days. The consensus is that talk shows, either by galvanizing or simply giving vent to public frustrations, have helped doom several pieces of legislation, including the Congressional pay raise of 1989. More recently, they helped kill Zoe Baird's nomination as Attorney General and convinced many lawmakers to line up against the President's proposal to allow homosexuals in the military.
Whether talk shows can mobilize public opinion in support of a proposal like the President's health care plan, not just against it, is unclear. But the Administration apparently thought a little outreach to fans couldn't hurt. There are a lot of Americans listening; a recent poll by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press reported that 42 percent of all adults listen at least occasionally to talk radio programs, and 17 percent listen regularly.
"These people really have the time and the format where you can have a real exposition of different ideas," said Mr. Gergen. Besides, he said, "the President really loves radio."
Michael Harrison, the editor of Talkers, a magazine about talk radio, was one of those invited to the White House. (He has his own program on WNNZ in Springfield, Mass., and a nationally syndicated program on which -- in a sort of meta-talk-radio role -- he talks about what topics are hot on talk programs each week.) He agreed that Mr. Clinton had shown more affection for the format than most other national politicians. Unfortunately for the President, though, he said, the feeling is not reciprocated.
"The irony is," he said, "Bill Clinton is the most bashed person in the history of talk radio."
The Casey Kasem of talk radio, Mr. Harrison compiles a list each week of the ten most popular call-in topics; according to last week's survey, health care was No. 1 on the vox pop charts. (No. 2 was the media, and No. 3 was the economy, stupid.)
Mr. Harrison said he wasn't sure Mr. Clinton had swayed many hosts with his briefing, but said they had at least returned to their microphones with a few more facts. "If nothing else," he said, "it forced those people to focus on the issue for four hours." (Rush Limbaugh, the most talkative of all radio talk show hosts, did not attend, saying he couldn't work it into his schedule.)
Blanquita Cullum, a conservative talk show host on WLEE in Richmond, Va., called the briefing a clever piece of public relations. "The talk show hosts really love the idea that they were at the White House," she said. "We are now recognized." She had a complaint though: She was left hungry. "If we get more credibility," she said, "next time we'll get lunch."
The briefing was part of an air and print assault that included Presidential chats with the news magazines, an old-fashioned White House luncheon for Washington columnists and a seemingly endless series of network appearances by high-level officials.
On Thursday, a few dozen of the talk show hosts took up the President's invitation to broadcast from the White House lawn. Once again, the scene tended toward the chaotic. Wires snaked all over the grass and griping filled the air as hosts who are used to soundproof studios sat cheek-by-jowl at Government-issue tables, trying to connect with callers from back home. Administration officials roamed from table to table, answering questions that did not always center on health care. (One female talk show host, for example, flustered the White House communications director, Mark Gearan, by asking if he would care to continue their interview in her hot tub.)
It is, of course, too early to tell whether the Administration's multi-media strategy will work. If it does, expect the opinion jockeys to be invited back when the next major White House initiative is unveiled. And expect them to get a very nice lunch.

HEADLINE: 5 Families in Midwest Cheer Promise of Health Security

SERIES: The Clinton Prescription/First article of a series: The Impact on Families

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Sept. 24

 BODY:
For five families in the middle of America, President Clinton's promise of health care coverage "that can never be taken away" has hit home, addressing what is clearly a shared yearning.
In interviews this week and after the President's speech to Congress and the nation on Wednesday night, the families, including people who are insured and uninsured, employed and unemployed, healthy and sick, all said they welcomed the promise of secure health insurance for all. The New York Times first interviewed the families in May about their health and their needs. 
 The families welcomed the President's promises of Government-guaranteed care for all and the right to insurance even when they lose jobs. The elderly were especially pleased by his promise to preserve Medicare and, for the first time, to include prescription drugs in the program.
 
Fear About Paying More
 Some fear that under Mr. Clinton's proposals they might have to pay more from slim incomes for the insurance plans they already have. Some are skeptical -- about the President, about gridlock in Washington, about the financing of the plan and about the impact of the lobbyists representing doctors, drug companies and insurance companies. But to a person they are relieved that a President has finally taken on the health care tangle.
"I liked everything he said," said Debra O'Connor of Lisbon, Iowa, the single mother of three young boys. "I think it can work if everybody gives it a chance."
Ms. O'Connor said she took her job with an aerospace company not because she liked the work or the relatively low pay, but because she would pay only $7 a month for a comprehensive health plan. She expects to have to pay more if the Clinton plan succeeds, and so be it, she says -- at least her dread about the consequences for her children in the event of a pink slip, an ever-present threat in her industry, will be reduced.
Clifford McLaughlin of East Moline, Ill., has an even richer plan through Deere & Company. It suits him fine. But Deere does not cover his mother, his wife's mother or the McLaughlins' grown daughters, and they welcome the help the President would give to them.
An older couple, Bill and Gertrude Coen of Iowa City, are relieved that after all the questions that had been raised about preserving Medicare, it will survive and they can be relieved of their $2,000 annual bill for drugs.
But it is people like Leo and Elma Patten of Cedar Rapids, who are unemployed and largely uninsured, and Maria Weirather, who has been driven to poverty by bills for cancer surgery, who have the most to gain. "I'm not elated," Mrs. Patten said, "but at last I'm not discouraged."
 
The Pattens
Worry Over Access To Family Doctor
 Elma Patten brings out some big, meaty cookies, a stack of paper napkins to put under them, cups of coffee and takes her place at the dining room table. The mother of four grown daughters, Mrs. Patten, who is 58, looks fine.
"I had my one-year cancer physical in July, and I'm clean," she said. Her husband, Leo, 62, looks fine, too, although emphysema has cut his lung capacity to 40 percent of normal.
The Pattens, both unemployed because of their health -- she with no insurance, he partially insured -- feel heartened by Mr. Clinton's promise of secure coverage for everyone by 1997. It is something they desperately needed themselves in recent years. But as they watched the President on Wednesday night they worried that they could lose their access to the one person whom they credit for keeping them going: their family doctor, Jo Lynn Glanzer.
"She treats us so good," Mrs. Patten said. "She'll call and ask how we're doing."
The Pattens worked all their adult lives until their health forced them to stop. Mr. Patten says smoking -- he quit in 1975 -- and the foul air of the factories where he worked as a machinist brought on his emphysema.
He has Medicare because he has been disabled for more than two years, but because of his pre-existing condition he cannot get supplemental insurance to pay for doctors' and hospital charges that Medicare does not cover, or for any of his medicine. Mrs. Patten, a diabetic, cannot yet get any insurance that she can afford.
 
Huge Medical Expenses
 Working until a year ago, most recently marking prices on goods at a women's clothing store, she had insurance from employers that covered most of her huge medical expenses -- double bypass heart surgery, a mastectomy, a hysterectomy and two wrist operations for a repetitive motion injury related to her work.
Now, the Pattens' annual income is $23,460, entirely from the $1,374 Social Security disability check that Mr. Patten gets each month and $581 a month in disability compensation from his last employer.
They spend about $1,100 a year for medicine -- one expense they would largely avoid under the Clinton plan, which would extend prescription coverage to all. Dr. Glanzer now accepts Medicare's payment for Mr. Patten's visits and lets Mrs. Patten pay for hers in small installments. Mrs. Patten's disability will qualify her for Medicare next July, but she wonders what would give if she needed another operation before then.
Their one worry about Mr. Clinton's plan concerns Dr. Glanzer. She has joined a group of doctors who will compete to provide health care to businesses and their employees. In theory, under the structure the President has proposed, the Pattens should be able to choose that plan, or keep going to Dr. Glanzer under Medicare. But both the doctor and her patients feel uncertain about how the new system would really run, and they wonder whether things will work out as smoothly as promised.
"They will be better off with their medicine and their insurance," Dr. Glanzer said. "But in terms of whether they keep me as a physician, I don't know. You may get a choice, but maybe not the choice you want."
 
The O'Connors
Well Insured Now, But Vulnerable
 The President is relying on Debra O'Connor to help pay the medical bills of uninsured Americans. He would impose a $1 or 75 cent tax on the Merit 100's that she smokes at a rate of a pack a day. She pays $2.03 for her cigarettes now. "I would quit before I paid $2.75," she said. "Then they won't have any money."
While she is skeptical about the financing of the Clinton plan, its principal selling point -- guaranteed coverage regardless of job status or other factors -- has struck a deep chord. Although she is now well insured through her work, Ms. O'Connor knows how vulnerable she is to the layoffs that have been sweeping through American industry, and she worries about what could happen to her family.
Ms. O'Connor is a 30-year-old single mother of three boys, 5, 7 and 9 years of age. She lives with her parents in a farmhouse in Lisbon, Iowa, a village southeast of Cedar Rapids.
She considers herself lucky at the moment. The boys are in school. She no longer spends $120 a week for baby sitters, and everyone's health is stable for now.
She considers herself lucky with work, too. Two years ago she took a job at a Rockwell International plant in Coralville, near Lisbon. A few days ago Rockwell, a giant of the aerospace industry, announced a layoff of more than 100 workers at a nearby plant, but her own plant is humming.
There, she assembles ground radios for the armed services. She is paid $8.60 an hour, low for big industry. She works 54 hours a week and earns around $23,000 a year, but says the great attraction of Rockwell is the health plan the company worked out with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. She contributes just $7 a month to cover herself and the boys.
 
A Good Company Plan
 For now, at least, the company plan is better than the minimum that the Clinton proposals would require. Rockwell has enrolled most Cedar Rapids doctors in a preferred provider network, and keeps its own costs down by negotiating reduced fees with doctors and hospitals, something the Clinton plan wants to promote.
Ms. O'Connor pays $10 to visit any of the affiliated doctors, $25 to use the outpatient services of St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, and $100 for any hospital stay. She also pays $3 per prescription for generic drugs and $10 for brand-name drugs.
To start school, her youngest child, Kyle, needed a measles, mumps and rubella immunization shot. "My doctor charged $65," she said. "I paid 10. Our insurance company paid $37. So he got only $47 for that shot."
Still, she is worried. As the President put it, she is one of the millions of workers who are "just a pink slip away" from losing her health insurance. With only two years' seniority at Rockwell, she would be among the first to go if business slumps.
"I want to keep that plan even if I'm not there," Ms. O'Connor said, and the Mr. Clinton assured her she could. Even if Rockwell begins charging her more for her health coverage, she said, "that's O.K. as long as I know I always have insurance."
 
The Weirathers
New Plan Gets A Wary Response

Maria Weirather, who lives in an Iowa City trailer with flimsy, sheet-metal walls, would welcome the changes proposed by the President, but she is skeptical about how soon they will materialize.
Her living room is also the master bedroom, with a foot-high double bed taking up the center. Ms. Weirather, 26 and divorced, sips a Dr. Pepper in an easy chair that has a broken leg. Her daughters, Andrea, who is 3 and entering a Head Start program soon, is asleep in the back, and Beverly, 5, is attending kindergarten.
Ms. Weirather (pronounced WY-rather), is stuck in this place, living entirely on food stamps, a welfare check of $426 a month and a $895-per-semester Federal Pell grant to go to the University of Iowa here part time, all because of disastrous bouts with her health and the medical system.
She had once been insured under the policy of her former husband. But last year, on her own without medical coverage, she had to have a second cancerous ovary removed. She owns nothing to speak of anymore, having sold her Dodge Spirit and a small piece of land to pay the hospital bills, and she still owes $500. After finishing a temporary job as a laboratory aide in May, she became eligible for Medicaid.
She said she welcomes Mr. Clinton's promise of nearly free care for herself, but she does not intend to wait to see the promise fulfilled. She has her own health insurance plan -- marriage in December to a man who hopes to follow others in his family into the Army. The Army provides family health care. She would complete college, having a little more than a year to go, and become a respiratory therapist.
"I'm not getting married for the financial aspect of it," Ms. Weirather said, "but it sure is a nice bonus."
She believes the health care system will take ages to fix. "The Government's going to have to put price controls on what doctors charge," she said. "That's going to be a big controversy. And the bigger companies are going to have to absorb some costs. I have a hard time visualizing it happening, even in five to 10 years."
 
The Coens
'Things Happen' To the Elderly
 William Coen, 79, the retired postmaster of Iowa City, and his wife Gertrude, 77, had been skittish about what the Government might do to their health care coverage, but they liked everything they heard from the President. "He said he'd keep Medicare," Mrs. Coen said. "He said we'd have long-term care and mental health -- all those things. You know, when you're older, things happen."
Things happening with the Coens' health are as routine as turns in the weather, and they speak of their setbacks as though they were no more disruptive. During the summer Mrs. Coen had a long bout with bronchial asthma, requiring three series of antibiotic treatments.
In October she faces surgery to remove a cataract, the latest in a succession of serious eye ailments. Mrs. Coen is not allowed to drive because of her vision, and when she watches television she sees two images, but she speaks of her medical problems and her husband's with a touch of humor.
"Last week his hearing went," she said. "He just got up and said, 'I can't hear anything.' He said, 'When you get your eyes fixed, I'll get my hearing fixed.' "
 
Involved With the Community
 What would trouble the Coens more than their ailments would be anything that interfered with their freedom to go on living in their split-level house, in an Iowa City neighborhood where nearly all the other homeowners are young enough to be their children.
They want to stay involved with the community. Mr. Coen is a member of a county task force on aging, serves meals and washes pots and pans at a center for the elderly and delivers meals to invalids at home.
He and his wife were relieved to hear the President promise them help with long-term care. But he wants to see the details. If the proposed nursing home program would cover only $30,000 of the cost of a one-year stay in a nursing home, he said, "then I don't think that's too great a come-on."
Mr. Clinton's proposal to cover prescription drugs through Medicare came as a relief, too. Last year prescriptions cost them almost $2,000.
He said there is "a fear that Medicare premiums are going to be raised quite high," but added that those costs, after the cuts in spending for drugs, might not make a big difference in their annual pension and investment income of about $40,000.
 
The McLaughlins
Providing Care For 3 Generations
 Whether Valerie and Clifford McLaughlin would have to pay more out-of-pocket themselves under the Clinton plan is not clear. But the fortunes of three generations of their kin who are not so well covered would certainly brighten.
The McLaughlins, who live in a two-story house in East Moline, each have mothers living alone who are anxious about the cost of health care. From previous marriages, both Mr. McLaughlin and his wife have a daughter with a child living on welfare and Medicaid. And the McLaughlins, both 41, have two more daughters of their own -- Carrie, 12, and Amber, 8.
Mr. McLaughlin's job at Deere as a $40,000-a-year press operator gives him one of the nation's most generous and comprehensive health plans, one that was negotiated by his union, the United Automobile Workers. Except for the wage increases he might otherwise have received, nothing is deducted from his pay for the insurance.
Mrs. McLaughlin takes out a statement they received from Deere's health maintenance organization listing the charges for the family's surgery, medicine and visits to doctors from last January to June. The total was $16,360. Most covered surgery and other treatment for Amber, who has acutely diseased eyes and may lose her vision. But it also covered psychiatric care that Carrie needed because of Amber's condition. The McLaughlins did not pay a dime.
The minimum company payment and standard benefits package that the President has proposed would be less generous. But the Clinton plan does not forbid higher company payments, and for now the extra benefits are secure.
 
Helping Young and Old
 Still, the McLaughlins wonder if such generous benefits will last. "I'm hoping it's not going to hurt us," Mrs. McLaughlin said. "But I like it helping my mom and his mom.
Mr. McLaughlin's mother has taken a job caring for invalids at home. But it pays only a little more than the minimum wage, Mr. McLaughlin said, and she lives in fear for her own health because she is uninsured.
Mrs. McLaughlin's mother is better off financially but in worse health. She is 63 and has Parkinson's disease, emphysema and a heart ailment. Mrs. McLaughlin said her mother often talks of retiring from her job as the chief deputy recorder of deeds for Rock Island County, Ill.
But she has been reluctant to give up a county insurance plan that pays 80 percent of her medical costs, including drugs. She would get Medicare at 65, which would cover most of her treatment costs, and under the President's plan, Medicare would also pay for her prescriptions.
The younger generations are no less trapped. Mr. McLaughlin's 20-year-old daughter is separated and living with her year-old daughter. Mrs. McLaughlin's 23-year-old daughter, whose son is 3, has just completed a state-financed training program to become a licensed practical nurse and has found a hospital job that pays about twice the minimum wage, enough to get her off welfare.
"But that's put her in a bad spot," Mrs. McLaughlin said. Insurance does not come with the job, so she is now exposed to the high cost of health care, one big headache that the Clinton plan hopes to cure.

HEADLINE: New York Casts for Solutions to Gaping Holes in Juror Net

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
The office in the courthouse at 60 Centre Street in Manhattan was overflowing recently with people who would really love to do their jury service -- but some other year, O.K.?
Down the street, Justice Joan B. Carey, the administrative judge of the criminal branch of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, was raging. "I have eight judges absolutely ready, ready, ready to go to trial," she fumed. "But there are no jurors. So I have eight judges looking at the ceiling." 
 Nationwide, a lack of jurors is delaying proceedings, clogging court systems that are already groaning from overload and squandering countless dollars and hours for lawyers, judges, assembled witnesses and court officers. Many states have been grappling with the problem; earlier this month, a committee in New York State began looking for solutions.
The composition of jury pools is also worrisome: black and Hispanic people as well as many professionals are dramatically underrepresented, leaving the public as well as many legal observers with the perception that the system may be unfair.
 
Committee to Suggest Changes
 New York State's two top judges, Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye and the Chief Administrative Judge, E. Leo Milonas, last week appointed a committee to suggest changes that would improve potential juror turnout, make jury panels more representative and make the experience for jurors less of a duty and more of a service. A report is due by Jan. 1.
New York is not the only state reviewing its jury system. Across the nation, many states have concluded that their jury systems do not work and have instituted a host of changes, like shortening the required service and reducing occupational exemptions, which have begun to alleviate jury crises.
As New York's two top judges acknowledged, blame for low turnout does not rest entirely on moribund civic spirit. While jurors who do end up deliberating a verdict tend to give the system high marks, the general experience has a reputation so awful that it drives away many prospective jurors.
For the princely sum of $15 a day, New York City jurors often spend hours waiting in crowded hallways, then are ushered into rooms with harsh lighting and bad ventilation and are offered seats on hard benches or chairs with the springs poking out. "You put people into those conditions for seven hours to deliberate over whether X killed somebody?" asked Justice Carey, whose own office has a broken wall clock.
To get potential jurors in the courthouse, most states use one or two lists. New York uses three: registered voters, licensed drivers, and the state's mailing list of taxpayers. Demographers estimate that such efforts should reach 85 to 90 percent of the state's potential jurors.
But the combination of New Yorkers' own evasive tactics and the state's crater-sized exemptions drastically cut the number of jurors who eventually appear. In a 12-month period ending in March, only one in six jurors summoned in New York County -- the borough of Manhattan -- which has one of the busiest state court systems in the country, showed up for service.
 
Forms Frequently Ignored
 Using the three lists, jury commissioners send preliminary questionnaires to establish minimum qualifications for service, from which the jury rolls are compiled. But in Manhattan and the Bronx, where the State Office of Court Administration says returns are among the lowest in the state, 50 to 60 percent are never completed, usually because they were sent to a wrong address or were tossed by the recipient into the next morning's garbage.
The questionnaires list 20 occupations that are automatically exempt from jury service, one of the largest set of exemptions in the country. Lawyers, police, firefighters and clergy can take a slide. So can podiatrists, physical therapists and embalmers. While 25 states have eliminated all occupational exemptions -- and 9 more have eliminated some exemptions -- a New York proposal to eliminate all exemptions has failed to pass in the Legislature.
 
Occupational Exemptions
 Jury reform advocates maintain that doing away with occupational exemptions would be the cheapest and easiest method to expand the jury rolls. "We've been trying like hell to get those lists repealed," said Norman Goodman, the New York County Clerk since 1969. "In New York City we have more doctors and lawyers than anywhere in the world, not to mention embalmers! Those exemptions take a big chunk out of our jury population."
Some can see reasons to exempt a few occupations. Police and firefighters got exemptions because they were already seen as serving the public; as a practical matter, defense lawyers would be disinclined to include them on juries. And prosecutors, Justice Carey speculated, would probably strike clergy from a panel: "Clergy have a built-in impediment," she said. "Most theologies urge them to forgive."
The overwhelming majority of jurors summoned ignore the first few notices or use up as many postponements as their county allows; each county can design its own regulations. New York County, one of the most accommodating counties, grants three deferments to a potential juror automatically. The fourth and fifth require the potential juror to show up with documentation. "Most people wait till they get their 'must serve' notices. And then it's like, 'O.K., maybe,' " said Florence B. Troia, the chief clerk of New York County's juror division. The annual postage for the waves of notices, cajolings and threats comes to about $250,000.
 
Annual Emergencies
 Since 1989, when the Legislature said jury service need be only one week every four years, many counties in New York have annually declared emergencies, so that jurors can be summoned for two weeks every two years.
Around the country, the shoulder-shrugging drives jurists wild. In recent years, a Tennessee judge ordered the arrest of 66 people who twice failed to show up for jury service and a Colorado judge even sent deputy sheriffs to a local mall to subpoena shoppers. Ignoring a jury summons is usually a misdemeanor, and jury commissioners, strapped for the resources to pursue scofflaws, are trying to impose fines. Mr. Goodman sent letters to 181 people, threatening them with a $250 fine, and earlier this month about 100 of them actually showed up in court to respond.
But states and local jurisdictions have also streamlined their procedures, making it both harder for jurors to duck out and easier for them to serve. Saving on postage and time, many commissioners send a qualification notice along with a summons for service. Most jurisdictions in New York State now allow jurors to phone ahead to determine whether their presence is needed on a given day; jurors in Queens and Staten Island can use the system and in Brooklyn the system is in place on holidays and sometimes in the summer.
 
'One Day, One Trial'
 Local courts scattered throughout at least 30 states have adopted a "one day, one trial" system that encourages more people to serve for a shorter time. Jurors are generally allowed only one postponement and almost no exemptions, but they only have to serve for one day. If they are not picked for a trial, they can leave. The average jury trial lasts about three days.
But almost none of these suggestions directly address one of the gravest concerns that the New York committee must take up: the underrepresentation of impoverished minorities on panels, mostly in counties outside New York City. The law requires that jury pools represent a fair cross-section of the community; it does not require that jurors be peers of defendants.
A 1992 study of two upstate judicial districts that included Albany County by the Capital District Black Bar Association found that minorities were underrepresented in jury pools. Members of minority groups, the study said, particularly those in poor neighborhoods, tended to be more transitory and so harder to locate to receive jury notices than other segments of the population, and less inclined to participate in civic activities.
 
Minority Participation
 To increase the participation of minorities, the study recommended that jurors' names also be taken from unemployment and utility lists. The Legislature this year passed a proposal that prospective jurors' names be taken from welfare rolls. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo vetoed the bill, citing reservations about privacy guarantees.
"Underrepresentation makes people think the system is unfair," said Justice Lewis L. Douglass of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, chairman of a state commission to develop strategies to make the legal system more equitable to minorities.
A racially and ethnically balanced pool and, subsequently, jury panel may indeed affect verdicts, he said. "People say that black and Hispanic jurors don't believe cops. That shouldn't surprise anyone: they have a different experience with the police, and they bring that skepticism to court." Justice Douglass believes that the qualification questionnaires should ask for racial identity.
But the judge said that even for people willing to appear, jury service has become synonymous with ordeal. "The court building is filthy and crowded," he said. "It doesn't look like a place where an important event is taking place."
 
'They're Not Evil'
 Jurors stand in hallways for hours, perplexed and angry, because no one bothers to tell them what is going on. "We insiders tend to treat jurors as a necessary evil," said Colleen McMahon of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, who chairs the New York Jury Project, the committee appointed by Judges Kaye and Milonas. "They're not evil. They're necessary."
And particular burdens fall on small businesses. Though many people indicate a willingness to serve, they cannot afford to do so: employers are not compelled to pay salaries while a worker is on jury duty. Suggestions to improve the lot of jurors include increasing the per diem from $15 to $40, the fee for Federal jurors. On-site child care has also been proposed.
And many judges favor reducing the peremptory challenges that lawyers can use to slice through a hefty pool, dismissing juror after juror without explanation. Civil jury selection often creates its own roadblocks: In New York neither judges nor judicial hearing officers preside over the lawyers' questioning, which can become unduly intrusive, long-winded and rancorous. And now, when lawyers cannot resolve a dispute during jury selection, they have to find a judge to get a ruling, which delays matters further.
Small wonder that the mood in the juror deferments' office the other day at 60 Centre Street was nothing short of adversarial. The clerks wanted those bodies, and those bodies sure didn't want to be there.
The line moved forward, and an older woman with tubes running from her nostrils to a portable oxygen tank stepped up to the desk.
The jury clerk looked her straight in the eye. "Do you have a doctor's note?" she said.

HEADLINE: Russian Says Soviet Atom Arsenal Was Larger Than West Estimated

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
A top Russian official says Moscow's nuclear arsenal peaked seven years ago at 45,000 warheads -- 12,000 more than generally believed and twice the number held by the United States at the time. The totalexceeded all estimates save those of the most hawkish analysts.
The official, Viktor N. Mikhailov, head of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, also says the Russian stockpile of highly enriched uranium is more than twice as large as commonly believed. Uranium in this form is a principal component of most nuclear weapons. 
 The Russian inventory of bomb-grade uranium is now said to be more than 1,200 metric tons. President Bush a year ago announced a multi-billion-dollar deal in which the United States would buy 500 metric tons of the Russian material, apparently thinking that this was most of Moscow's supply. The Clinton Administration is now considering whether to expand that purchase.
 
Scattered Disclosures
 The new comments being made by Mr. Mikhailov are scattered among recent interviews, conferences and public statements, some of which have appeared in the Russian press.
Surprised analysts say the remarks could rewrite parts of the cold war's history, with one suggesting that the West's blindness to the arsenal's size was an intelligence failure that might have had disastrous consequences.
"The large numbers lead you to worry that some of the planners may have had a first strike in mind -- using large numbers of weapons and having large numbers in reserve," said Bobby Ray Inman, a retired admiral and former head of the National Security Agency.
 
Alternative Explanation
 A more benign explanation, Mr. Inman said, was that the arsenal's vast size reflected a bureaucracy run amok and was unconnected to military strategy. "You just produce any number you can," he said in an interview.
Experts agree that the existence of a much larger uranium stockpile gives new urgency to tracking Russian bomb materials and guarding them against accident and theft amid political turmoil, a job the West is trying to aid.
Moreover, some warn that a large surplus of unregulated bomb-grade uranium might thwart new East-West arms accords or darken the estimates of military threats to the West if an unfriendly government came to power.
The sheer size of the enriched uranium stockpile illuminates the origins of a major part of Russia's current ecological crisis, revealing the vast pressures for the production of nuclear material that underlie the calamities of radioactive pollution and poisoning, which now haunt large parts of the former Soviet state.
The large stocks of newly disclosed Russian weapons and bomb material never violated an East-West arms accord, all of which set limits on large and verifiable objects like delivery systems rather than warheads. The logic was that a foe's missiles, bombers and submarines could be monitored by satellites, while nuclear arms and their constituents were too small and easily hidden to be checked for treaty compliance.
Nonetheless, analysts are surprised by the new numbers since the West spent so much time, money, material and even lives trying to track the most dangerous of all armaments.
"It's alarming that we have this discrepancy, but in some ways, it parallels the problems we had with assessing Iraq," said Fred C. Ikle, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the Reagan Administration.
"These things don't take that much space," he said. "It's conceivable that we could have missed them, as we did many other things in Russia, like the big fissures in their economy."
Mr. Ikle added: "Some of these things just ran wild, the military production. It was like the sorcerer's apprentice -- it just kept going. It happened occasionally on our side, too."
 
Caution Advised On Russian Report
 In the West, Mr. Mikhailov's disclosures are now being reported by the nuclear industry and private research groups. Although Mr. Mikhailov is a top Russian official, several analysts suggest that his numbers should be treated cautiously until independently confirmed.
"The quantity of weapons-grade uranium accumulated is very great," Mr. Mikhailov is quoted as saying in a coming industry report. He added that Moscow's stockpile is larger than the combined totals held by the United States, China, France and Britain.
Mr. Mikhailov's comments are to appear in the October issue of the Nukem Market Report, a monthly published by Nukem Inc., which is based in Stamford, Conn., and is one of the world's leading suppliers of nuclear fuel. The company, in partnership with Babcock & Wilcox, is one of several in the West that are vying to help the Russians dilute their bomb-grade uranium into reactor fuel.
Analysts believe that Moscow could be angling for new uranium sales in a bid to slow or reverse its slide into poverty. The American purchase of 500 metric tons of this material, whose contractual fine points are being worked out, is valued at up to $12 billion. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds.
Bomb-grade uranium, Mr. Mikhailov told the industry publication, "is extremely important" to Moscow as a source of "hard currency over an extended period of time."
During the cold war Washington's effort to gauge the strength of Moscow's nuclear hand was a guessing game laced with espionage, analytical work and considerable luck. In 1989 the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group that monitors Russian nuclear affairs, published a summary of Washington's views in "Soviet Nuclear Weapons," a 443-page volume in its Nuclear Weapons Databook series.
The book's analysis of Federal estimates characterized three as credible and one as wildly inflated -- that of Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, who held that Moscow's arsenal peaked at 46,000 warheads. The research council's own estimate was 33,000 weapons, which was in line with many Washington views, apparently including those of the Central Intelligence Agency.
But in an update to its volume, published this month, the research council notes that Mr. Mikhailov has now said the arsenal crested in 1986 at 45,000 warheads, almost exactly as Mr. Weinberger had estimated. Mr. Mikhailov's remarks were originally made in private Washington briefings and, less precisely, in Russian press reports.
Surprisingly large, the 45,000 number rivals what Western analysts had previously thought to be the size of world's combined nuclear arsenals at their apex -- 50,000 weapons spread among the Soviet Union, the United States, France, Britain, China and Israel.
Western experts say they have no clear idea how the 12,000 added Russian weapons might have fit into Moscow's arsenal and military strategy, although some analysts believe that these arms may have been spares in deep storage.
 
Stockpile Down To 32,000 Weapons
 The research council reports that Moscow's actions after recent arms accords have now shrunk the total Russian stockpile to 32,000 weapons. But the spate of East-West agreements over the last few years have no provisions for the actual destruction of bomb material, which can be recycled for military or civilian purposes. The United States has 17,000 warheads, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Lurking in and around the Russian arsenal, apparently, is a huge quantity of weapon material -- the newly described 1,200 metric tons of uranium that is highly enriched. That amount is enough to make 75,000 atomic bombs of the power that destroyed Hiroshima, or to energize a host of hydrogen bombs that would be even more deadly.
Natural uranium ore is made up of a mix of isotopes, or different forms of the same element. Less than 1 percent of ore is uranium 235, the isotope best suited to being split apart in a burst of energy. Uranium for most American nuclear power reactors is enriched to a level of about 3 percent uranium 235, while fuel for bombs is enriched by more than 90 percent in a process that is costly and time-consuming.
As the cold war ended, many Western experts suggested that the United States buy Russia's bomb-grade uranium as a way to gingerly disarm Moscow, to bolster the shaky Russian economy and to reduce the risks of nuclear accidents and theft.
 
Earlier Hints Of Larger Supply

On Aug. 31, 1992, President Bush announced the outlines of a deal to buy 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium from Moscow over 20 years. Private experts who once considered 500 metric tons to be the total inventory immediately started raising their estimates because it seemed unlikely that Moscow would sell its entire supply.
More recently, American intelligence is said to have estimated that Moscow's stockpile of bomb-grade uranium is 800 metric tons.
In the interview with the Nukem Market Report, Mr. Mikhailov put the minimum total stockpile, including what is currently in warheads, at more than 1,200 metric tons, or 1.5 to 1.7 times greater than the combined stores of all other countries. The 500 metric tons of the current sale, Mr. Mikhailov emphasized, "represents somewhere around 30 to 40 percent of all reserves that we possess."
The research council, in its 209-page update, gives many new details of the formerly secret factories that enrich the uranium, revealing a vast enterprise at four widely separated sites. Each site has many thousands of gas centrifuges, the most modern type of technology for making enriched uranium.
In the Nukem interview, Mr. Mikhailov was asked about the possibility of theft from this sprawling enterprise. He replied that bomb-grade uranium was stolen on one occasion, but gave no other substantive details about the incident. Repeated attempts to reach Mr. Mikhailov in Moscow were unsuccessful.
"In the old days we used to worry about external bandits and smugglers," he said. "Now we worry about internal smuggling activity. We have to strengthen the procedures for accounting and control."
He added, "Many people in Russia live on the edge of poverty, and there is a great temptation to steal in these plants."
Thomas L. Neff, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview that he thought Mr. Mikhailov might be exaggerating the amount of uranium, perhaps to appease the Russian military. But Mr. Ikle, the former Under Secretary of Defense, said the military was too close to the situation to be fooled.
 
Security and Theft As Main Problem
 William G. Sutcliffe, a senior physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who works in arms control, said all newly disclosed uranium was more dangerous as a security problem than a military threat.
"The important lesson from the cold war was that large numbers of weapons were not necessary," he said, adding that a smaller arsenal that could survive a pre-emptive strike was better.
But the existence of more bomb-grade uranium, he added, "magnifies the problem" of preventing theft. "It makes materials-accountability and physical control even more important."
Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist at the research council and a co-author of the update, said the new reports were a bad omen for arms control since they would unnerve Western military planners. He said East-West data exchanges were needed to reassure both sides about the feasibility of future arms cuts.
"The uncertainty in these numbers," he said, referring to the gap between the intelligence estimate of 800 metric tons and the Russian assertion of 1,200 tons, "is as big as our entire stockpile."
"You cannot expect to achieve deep reductions in nuclear weapons and material reserves with these huge uncertainties," he said.

HEADLINE: Unusual Joint Effort Is Seeking to Reduce Sulfur in Diesel Fuel

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Beginning Friday, pedestrians in New York and other congested cities may begin to breathe easier, as may motorists sandwiched between trucks in the Lincoln Tunnel, on the Long Island Expressway and on the nation's interstate highways.
The black soot pouring out of the exhaust pipes of the 2.5 million trucks, buses and many other diesel-fueled vehicles in the United States should begin to be substantially reduced. Within 60 days, diesel-fueled vehicles that use the roads and highways must begin to use fuel that contains 90 percent less sulfur -- no more than 0.05 percent sulfur, compared with the current standard of 0.5 percent. 
 The change is a result of an unusual five-year effort involving the Environmental Protection Agency and the oil and trucking industries, one of the most ambitious collaborations yet between industry and the E.P.A.
The effort began in 1988, when the oil industry and the manufacturers of diesel engines, under the threat of stiffer regulations, submitted a joint proposal for meeting new environmental standards with low-sulfur fuel and modifications to diesel engines.
In 1990 the Clean Air Act was amended accordingly, and the oil industry -- with the support of the trucking industry -- began a multibillion-dollar effort to gear up to produce the lower-sulfur fuel.
"It makes sense to do our part," said Thomas Donohue, the president of the American Trucking Association, a trade group in Washington.
He said truckers would pay about 3 cents to 4 cents a gallon more for the cleaner fuel. But he said they would pay less for the new engines, which will require less complicated technology to reduce pollution than those now in use. The manufacturers of diesel engines must meet the lower emission standards in 1994.
The E.P.A. has estimated that the savings from the new engines will be $60 to $325 per vehicle.
Although the new fuel is supposed to be available on Friday at gas stations, truck stops and fueling centers, some trucking companies have not been able to get enough of it.
After the trucking association demonstrated that shortages existed, the E.P.A. granted a 60-day grace period for the industry to phase in the cleaner diesel at fuel stops.
 
Inspections are Planned
 E.P.A. inspectors will soon begin testing to make sure the fuel distribution centers are using the new fuel, but during the grace period trucking companies can continue to use the older fuel if they can show that they made a good-faith effort to get supplies.
Richard Ackerman, a station chief for the E.P.A. in Washington, said the grace period was not a blanket moratorium; rather, each company would have to prove it could not get the fuel. Companies that fail to do so could be fined $25,000 a day plus any economic benefit they might get from using the cheaper high-sulfur fuel.
Responding to the concern of the truckers that their rigs would be stopped for spot checks of fuel tanks, Mr. Ackerman said that would not happen unless the agency got a tip that a particular trucking company was using high-sulfur fuel. "We're not going to stop trucks on the road," he said. "That's not in our plan."
 
Reduced Emissions
 The E.P.A. has estimated that under the new regulations, by 1995, the emissions of particulates, or soot, will be reduced by up to 38 percent, and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain and is formed when sulfur is released into the air, will decrease by up to 80 percent.
Particulates are small carbon particles that are not broken down in the air and can lodge in the lungs. The particulates have been considered a possible cause of cancer, and high levels can cause respiratory infections and attacks of asthma and bronchitis.
Because of those dangers, some environmentalists contend that not enough is being done in congested urban areas to cut emissions from buses. Yet they are encouraged by the effort to reduce sulfur in diesel fuel. Eric Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group based in New York, said the oil and trucking industries had a financial motive for cooperating to help reduce pollution in urban areas.
"There are many people who believe that the way to address the urban diesel problem is to switch to cleaner fuels like natural gas," Mr. Goldstein said.
High-sulfur varieties will still be available for about half the users of diesel fuel -- railroads, ships and vehicles used primarily on farms.
The E.P.A. has estimated that it will cost the oil industry from $380 million to $910 million by 1995, and up to $1.3 billion by 2010, to make the upgrades to meet the demand for the new low-sulfur fuel.
The National Petroleum Council, a Federal advisory committee to the United States Secretary of Energy, who appoints its members, said in a recent study that the oil industry would have to invest about $37 billion over the next decade to upgrade its refineries to meet Federal and state environmental requirements.
Charles Walz, the vice president of refining for Texaco, estimated that the company had spent about $175 million to upgrade its four refineries to produce the new fuel.
"We're in a painstaking transition process," he said, "You have to flush out the old material at refineries, distribution centers and finally at service stations."
 
Falling Prices
 The prices of diesel fuel and gasoline have been falling, as has the price of crude oil, in the face of plentiful supplies and weak demand.
Indeed, the spot market for the new diesel fuel has been weak, leading some industry executives to predict that eventually it will command a premium of only a cent or two a gallon over high-sulfur fuel.
Such predictions come as a relief to trucking firms and hundreds of thousands of independent truckers, because on Oct. 1, they will be hit not only with higher-priced fuel, but also with an added tax of 4.3 cents a gallon passed by Congress as part of the deficit-reduction package.
The National Petroleum Council study has estimated that gasoline, jet fuel, home heating oil and diesel fuel could cost an average of 6 cents more a gallon by 1995 as a result of the various Government standards.

HEADLINE: Their Slice of the American Dream

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH AMITYVILLE, L.I., Sept. 24

 BODY:
Every day for months, Yasmin Saunders took a few minutes out of her frenetic schedule to drive to a building site on a residential street just off the Southern State Parkway and watch the workers frame, hammer and paint the town house she had never dreamed she would own.
It had been such an arduous journey to this juncture in the life of Ms. Saunders, a 37-year-old single mother who had worked at two and sometimes three jobs at a time, that she was drawn to the site each day, not just to savor the achievement of buying a town house, but also to remind herself of how far she had come. 
 "The feeling is just overwhelming," declared Ms. Saunders, who has two teen-age sons. "I had never entertained the thought of buying a home. That certainly was not for me. A single mother? I'm supposed to struggle."
Next month, the first occupants will be moving into the new town houses on Schleigel Boulevard built by a nonprofit housing group for low- and moderate-income home buyers. In design, size and cost, the development resembles many other affordable-housing projects on Long Island and elsewhere. But the buyers of Amity Villas are different in one important respect: Many, like Ms. Saunders, are single working mothers.
Officials of the Long Island Housing Partnership, which developed Amity Villas, say no other project they have built on Long Island has attracted so many single mothers as first-time buyers. Of the 72 units built on a nine-acre tract in this working-class, racially mixed community, 47 were bought by unmarried women, 28 of them mothers.
The single mothers moving to Amity Villas are mostly women in their 20's and 30's -- secretaries, hospital aides and administrative assistants living as close as a mile from the development and as far as Brooklyn and the Bronx. They are women from a variety of backgrounds and cultures who shared a goal, but, with salaries of $20,000 to $35,000 a year, lacked the wherewithal to achieve it. For many of them, the notion of being tied down by a mortgage was less a burden than a badge of distinction.
"It's to get something better," said Petal Sampson, a 27-year-old native of Guyana who works as a membership secretary at the Harvard Club in Manhattan. She will soon be moving out of the one-bedroom apartment in East Flatbush she shares with her 6-year-old daughter, Nikeda, for a two-bedroom town house 35 miles east. "When I first mention it, people say, 'Why are you going so far?' But I knew I wanted to do it. I wanted to do it even more because I have a child."
 
An Untapped Market
 Sociologists and housing experts say that Amity Villas has inadvertently tapped into a large market of working single women, many with children, who want to own homes but traditionally have been blocked or discouraged from doing so because of limited incomes or their belief that they cannot get a mortgage. They say Amity Villas is a potential model for the type of housing that would give more single mothers the stable environments they seek for their families.
Experts in single parenthood say that the women buying in Amity Villas represent the majority of single mothers in this country: working women often holding more than one low-paying job and struggling to stay off government assistance. Sara McLanahan, a sociology professor at Princeton University who studies the effects of single parenthood on children, said that while the popular perception of a single mother is that of a woman on welfare, fewer than half of all single mothers are on welfare at any time in a given year.
"The typical single mother is not on welfare and is certainly not Murphy Brown," Ms. McLanahan said, referring to the affluent television character whose decision to have a child out of wedlock came under a heated attack by former Vice President Dan Quayle. "The typical single mother is near the poverty line but is working, and I think one of the most important things to help her raise her children is to give her stable housing."
In her statistical analyses, Ms. McLanahan has found that after a lack of money, the biggest problem faced by single-parent families is the failure to find permanent housing. "It's another form of instability, and the research I've done shows the majority of the moves for these families are involuntary. They get evicted, or they can't afford to stay," she said.
James Morgo, the president of the partnership, a five-year-old group that has built hundreds of houses on Long Island, primarily in Suffolk County, said that the development's location in an economically depressed area and its lower-than-average ceiling on household income -- $39,680 for a family of three or more -- contributed to the large numbers of single mothers who applied.
 
More Willing to Lend
 In addition, commercial banks, required by a 1989 Federal law to report on the numbers of mortgages they give to members of minorities and disadvantaged groups, have become more willing to extend loans to single and minority women, Mr. Morgo said.
The 72 identical town houses each cost more than $83,500 to build, but with subsidies of $25,000 per unit from the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation, the cost to the buyers was brought down to $58,500, Mr. Morgo said. Government subsidies through the Federal Home Loan Bank also helped to make the mortgages affordable. The would-be homeowners, selected in a lottery from among more than 300 applicants, were required to be first-time buyers with good credit records and the ability to pay about $6,000 in down payments and closing costs.
When an acquaintance gave Esther Scott a flier announcing the lottery, she jumped at the opportunity. Ms. Scott, a therapy aide for a state institution for the mentally ill who juggled a second job as a newspaper deliverer while caring for her two young children, recognized it as one of the few chances she would get to move out and up. In fact, the mortgage and taxes on the Amity Villas town houses were lower than the $700 a month she pays for a basement apartment off Sunrise Highway in North Amityville.
"I took out a consolidation loan and paid off all my credit cards and my car payments," said Ms. Scott, who lives with her 3-year-old son, Tristan, and 20-month-old daughter, Jaimie. "I knew I would get my mortgage."
She did. Ms. Scott's confidence was not unusual among the women who had applied for the homes. "I think they're all going to want to head the homeowners association," said Dolores Murphy, a project coordinator.
 
Overcoming Delays
 The project itself, however, was beset by delays. Although the lottery was held in 1990, the partnership did not break ground until last winter. Plaguing the startup was a major problem: Dozens of those who had won the lottery, married people as well as single, were being denied mortgages because of poor credit histories or inadequate income. In the end, the partnership offered units to all 300 original applicants, and about two hundred others added later, to find 72 qualified buyers.
Ms. Saunders, an administrative assistant for an export company in Woodbury, had her first mortgage application rejected. But a second bank said yes. "I got the letter. I was jumping up and down in the rain," she recalled with a laugh.
She is thrilled at the prospect of the move, and pleased at the chance the partnership has given her. But even so, Ms. Saunders is angry at the lack of options for a struggling mother like her, who at one point was working days as a secretary, nights as a saleswoman and weekends as a receptionist in a beauty salon.
"It's a degrading process," she said of obtaining a house by lottery. "It's like having to beg for it." Sitting in a diner near her office, she recalled something she had once heard Gov. Mario M. Cuomo say about the lack of housing for lower-income families.
"He said he thought it was a disgrace that your owning a home depends on whether your name is picked out of a hat," she said. "I agree with him, 100 percent."
With the opening of Amity Villas imminent, some of the single mothers wondered whether they could take advantage of their numbers, perhaps by pooling resources for child care. Mr. Morgo said that the partnership might seek community development funds to build a playground.
 
Protect That Credit
 For now, the prospective homeowners are obsessed with the mechanics of the move. To guard against last-minute reversals of mortgage approvals, they have been advised not to make big-ticket purchases until after they take possession of their 980-square-foot domains.
But no one can prevent them from dreaming. The other day, Ms. Scott was permitted a first glimpse inside her town house. As Tristan and Jaimie wrestled on the blue carpet, the 30-year-old mother glanced around, making decorating plans. Among the priorities: an L-shaped banquette in the eat-in kitchen.
"I like it," Ms. Scott said, glancing around the room, almost in a daze. "I can't wait to get in."

HEADLINE: Amid Turmoil, Holtzman Is Top Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
In a period when her integrity was under near-constant fire, Elizabeth Holtzman managed to raise more campaign contributions than her rivals for city comptroller, Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi and Herman Badillo, campaign finance reports show.
Between Sept. 7 and last Monday, Ms. Holtzman received $266,100 in contributions while Mr. Hevesi received $229,494 and Mr. Badillo, $127,970, according to summaries of reports sent to the city's Campaign Finance Board yesterday. 
 Ms. Holtzman, the incumbent, and Mr. Hevesi will be in a runoff for the Democratic nomination on Tuesday.
Mr. Hevesi finished narrowly ahead of Ms. Holtzman in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary but failed to garner 40 percent of the vote, the minimum needed to avoid a runoff. Mr. Badillo, who will be on the November ballot as the Republican-Liberal candidate, finished third in the Democratic primary.
During the two weeks covered by the reports, Ms. Holtzman suffered a series of setbacks that severely eroded her once-formidable lead. In that time, the city released a critical report on a $450,000 campaign loan from 1992 and news organizations reported that the loan was the subject of a Federal bank-fraud inquiry.
 
Hevesi Gaining Faster
 Despite Ms. Holtzman's ability to raise money amid her travails, finance reports covering last Tuesday and Wednesday indicate that Mr. Hevesi may have gained momentum in the money-raising race. On those two days, Mr. Hevesi collected $44,250 in contributions to Ms. Holtzman's $27,750. And while Mr. Hevesi's contributions came from about 30 sources, Ms. Holtzman's came from 6 sources.
Among Mr. Hevesi's contributors last week were: John A. Zaccaro, husband of Geraldine A. Ferraro, $500; Vincent Tese, the State Commissioner for Economic Development, $2,500, and Lewis Rudin, the real-estate developer, $1,000. In addition, Mr. Hevesi received $5,000 from the Atlantic Bank of New York, $3,250 from the Sheet Metal Workers Local 28, and $3,250 from the New York State Laborers.
The bulk of Ms. Holtzman's contributions last week, $19,500, came from the Ratner family, including $6,500 from Bruce Ratner, who developed Metrotech Center in downtown Brooklyn, and $6,500 from one of Mr. Ratner's companies, First New York Partners.
Ms. Holtzman and Mr. Hevesi were scheduled to spend a full day on the stump today, focusing their efforts on black churches and on street fairs in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
Ms. Holtzman also picked up the measured support of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who said in an interview yesterday that he plans to vote for Ms. Holtzman in Tuesday's runoff because he does not like Mr. Hevesi and feels Ms. Holtzman has been unfairly attacked for receiving the $450,000 bank loan, which he called a "lapse in judgment."
Mr. Koch said his support had not been solicited from Ms. Holtzman's camp. "I thought somebody has to stand up for this person," he said.
But Mr. Koch said he plans to vote for Mr. Badillo in November.

HEADLINE: NICARAGUA STRIKE UNITES OLD FOES

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 25

 BODY:
As he unstacked the paving blocks of a huge barricade that had stopped traffic along the Pan-American Highway, Oscar Mejia, a 29-year-old electrician, appeared satisfied with the four-day transportation strike he had joined.
The strike this week led the Government on Friday to ease an increase in fuel prices and repeal new vehicle taxes, but Mr. Mejia disagreed with the way some Government officials characterized the strikers. 
 "The Government says the barricades were put up by the Sandinistas," he said. "Some people here are Sandinistas, but I never was. Now we are all just poor people fighting together."
The strike, which blocked much of the traffic in the country, was the fourth serious episode of political turmoil in two months. In late July former Sandinista soldiers attacked the city of Esteli. Last month, there were two political kidnappings of some 80 officials, soldiers and politicians, including Vice President Virgilio Godoy Reyes.
 
A Blurred Ideological Line
 But more vividly than the earlier events, the transportation strike showed how poverty and anger have blurred the ideological line that divided Nicaragua through its civil war in the 1980's.
Many of the unions and workers who began the strike were traditionally allied with the leftist Sandinistas. But many of the people who came out of their homes to defend the barricade of paving stones and tree trunks said they had supported the contras, the United States-backed rightist rebels who had fought the Sandinistas. On this barricade, as on others, people said the former adversaries were finding common cause.
At the barricade, Ernesto Guzman, 28, told a story typical of many Nicaraguans.
As a teen-ager in 1978 he joined the Sandinista Front in the revolution that overthrew the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Then as a soldier in the Sandinista People's Army he fought the contras. Now, laid off from his job in a mattress factory, he said he was selling chewing gum and trinkets at the same Managua street corner as a former contra.
"The contras are victims of this Government too," he said.
 
Family Worse Off Than Before
 Two days into the strike, Marta Ceballos, 37, the wife of a cabdriver, came out to join Mr. Mejia, Mr. Guzman and the other people blocking traffic. She was given a spiked metal object the size of her fist to throw in front of the tires of vehicles that tried to pass the blockade.
Mrs. Ceballos said that throughout the 1980's she opposed the Sandinistas because of their socialist ideology. She said, "My mother raised me, and I raised my children, to believe that you had to rely on yourself".
She expected that the election of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in 1990 would rebuild the country's economy. Instead, she said, her family is worse off than it has ever been.
"Chamorro is rich," she said. "The Sandinista leaders are rich. Those ministers in the Government are all rich. What do they care about us poor people?"
Last week a public opinion poll indicated that 50 percent of Nicaraguans surveyed thought life was better during the Somoza years.
Since Mrs. Chamorro took office, labor strife on the scale of this week's strike has typically involved the Sandinistas. But as the Sandinista Front has been weakened by internal divisions and its leaders have faced accusations of using their positions to enrich themselves, the front's power to bring people to the streets has diminished.
 
'This Isn't About Politics'
 After the barricades went up, the most prominent Sandinista leader, former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, harshly criticized Mrs. Chamorro for policies he said were worsening poverty.
But the comments by people at the barricade on the Pan-American Highway suggested that Mr. Ortega and the rest of the Sandinista leadership may not have been leading the protesters so much as trying to catch up with them.
One former Sandinista militant, Santiago Vargas, said he now regreted the years he spent following Mr. Ortega. Mr. Vargas, an unemployed hospital worker, said he used to think he shared a vision of social justice and economic equality with the Sandinista leaders, but now he felt deserted by them.
Mrs. Ceballos, never a Sandinista supporter, said: "This isn't about politics. This is about poor people. If these children here had something to eat, or a decent school to go to, they'd be home eating breakfast and getting ready for school. I'd be home with my family. We are all here because we are desperate."

HEADLINE: NO AID IS PLEDGED FOR MIDEAST PLAN

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's seven leading industrial democracies expressed support today for Russia and for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories, but the officials pledged no new aid for either.
The ministers also reached no new plan to stimulate the sluggish world economy. American officials said this week that they were especially interested in increasing global economic growth through lower interest rates in Europe and Japan and possibly lower taxes in Japan. So the absence of any such deal was another sign that these periodic meetings play a dwindling role in international monetary policy. 
 "It was very successful in line with the approach that we're taking," a senior Treasury Department official said after the meeting. "These aren't meetings where one country negotiates the policy of another country's independent central bank. These are meetings where areas of mutual concern are explored."
 
Russian Progress Reported
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, served as hosts to their counterparts from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The ministers are here for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Toward the end of their meeting today, the finance ministers invited Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov of Russia to join them. Mr. Bentsen said Mr. Fyodorov had described Russia's recent payments on its overdue foreign debts and outlined a schedule for monthly payments through 1993.
He also said Mr. Fyodorov had found the Russian central bank to be more cooperative. Russia's Finance Ministry and central bank have been disagreeing for months about the Government loans being made to large, struggling factories. The central bank has encouraged such loans to prevent the failure of factories and the loss of jobs. But Finance Ministry officials and Western economists have attributed the loans to high inflation and the plunging value of the ruble.
 
World Bank to Aid Palestinians
 In a joint statement issued at the end of the meeting, the ministers said Mr. Fyodorov also discussed plans for more sales of state-owned enterprises to private investors. The statement endorsed President Boris N. Yeltsin's free-market policies and reaffirmed previous Western aid commitments without offering more money.
Referring to support to aid Palestinians in their transition to autonomy in the occupied territories, Mr. Bentsen said, "We talked about that today and agreed resources must flow to the region, private investment is critical and assistance must be coordinated effectively." He also said the World Bank would "play a central role."
Mr. Bentsen said details would be worked out next week at a conference that he and Secretary of State Warren Christopher are to convene to muster financial support for the peace plan.

HEADLINE: Gifts Help N.A.A.C.P. Focus on Economic Agenda

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
A few days before his death last January, Reginald F. Lewis, one of the country's wealthiest businessmen, dictated instructions to his wife from his hospital bed about giving favorite charities a share of his sizable fortune, including $2 million for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
The gift, and the creation of the Reginald F. Lewis Memorial Endowment, were announced at the annual N.A.A.C.P. convention in July and inspired an unexpected pledge of $1 million a few weeks later from Alphonse Fletcher Jr., a 27-year-old investor who regarded Mr. Lewis as a role model, adviser and friend. 
 The gifts are significant, said Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the association's executive director, because they move the endowment toward its goal of raising $100 million to revitalize the 84-year-old N.A.A.C.P, the country's oldest civil rights organization.
The revitalization includes a newly aggressive focus on an economic agenda that has led the N.A.A.C.P. into clashes with aerospace contractors like Hughes and with the Denny's restaurant chain. On another front, the association wants to demonstrate that people like Mr. Fletcher from minority groups can and do achieve success as youthful entrepreneurs -- and help others follow that path.
 
'A New Generation'
 "The endowment will help the N.A.A.C.P. deliver on its promise to nurture a new generation of business leaders," said Dr. Chavis, outlining his plans during a joint interview with Mr. Fletcher, chief executive officer of Fletcher Capital Markets, at Mr. Fletcher's midtown business headquarters in Manhattan.
He said the endowment named after his longtime friend would not be limited to helping blacks but would also aid Asian-Americans, Hispanic people and American Indians.
Mr. Fletcher said his friendship with Mr. Lewis began with a telephone call of encouragement to him on a suit he had filed charging that racial bias affected his pay at Kidder Peabody, where he was then a manager of an investment group. Mr. Fletcher won an arbitration award of $1.26 million.
Over time, the two men met and also talked frequently. They shared a number of interests, one of them being Harvard. Mr. Lewis graduated from Harvard Law School and last year gave it $3 million. The law school named an international center for him -- the first building on campus named for a black man. Mr. Fletcher and two younger brothers graduated from Harvard College.
Like Mr. Lewis, who was chief executive of TLC Beatrice International Holdings, an international food conglomerate, Mr. Fletcher does not want the issue of race to dominate what he has accomplished or his performance to be measured exclusively as a black businessman.
 
'It Is All Too Little'
 In the notes dictated a few days before his death, Mr. Lewis said some progress clearly had been made in the civil rights cause. Nonetheless, he said, "It is all too little when we consider the day-to-day drama being inflicted upon many of our children who are of African or Hispanic descent and who are not yet fully included in the American dream.
"By working in this field in the future, I believe that I am working for all Americans because I truly believe that our society is highly vulnerable unless we join together in seeing this not as as a particular problem of any one ethnic group but as something that the nation must address as part of its own spirit of renewal."
Mr. Fletcher was with the Lewis family at the N.A.A.C.P. convention when the endowment was announced by Dr. Chavis. It was news that the family had kept to itself until then.
"As the announcement was made," Mr. Fletcher said, "I was sitting there thinking about what I could do to help others. I also believe challenging economic inequity is as important for the N.A.A.C.P. today as it was once to challenge segregation in restaurants and education. This was an appropriate way to honor Reginald Lewis. It all came together."

HEADLINE: Oil and Tourism Don't Mix, Inciting Amazon Battle

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador

 BODY:
Standing on a riverbank outside his Amazon tourist lodge, Pieter Jan Brouwer raised his rifle one day last year and shot out the tires, headlights and windshields of a dozen trucks and bulldozers that were dredging gravel for an American oil company road.
"I had the disaster of having the hotel full and 14 guests pounding on my door at 4 A.M. threatening to sue me," Mr. Brouwer recalled of the round-the-clock dredging operations by a subcontractor for Maxus Ecuador Inc., the oil company. "If you come to see the rain forest, to watch birds and to enjoy tranquillity, you can't imagine what it is like to wake up and see dump trucks and bulldozers." 
 Mr. Brouwer, a Dutch businessman who operates the Amazon Jungle Resort Village, may not exactly be Ecuador's environmental Minuteman, but his gunshots warn of a looming collision between two radically different views of Ecuador's Amazon.
Oil companies depict the area as a pool of underground wealth, two billion barrels of oil that could lift this nation out of chronic poverty. Organizers of "nature tourism" argue that the Amazon, one of the world's richest biological regions, should be preserved as it is for tourists, scientists and the region's 100,000 Indian inhabitants.
 
Conflicts Are Common
 Conflicts between preservation and development are common in the eight-nation Amazon region, but Ecuador's circumstances have thrown the debate into fast forward. With about one-third of this Colorado-size nation covered by Amazon rain forest, oil drillers and tourist operators increasingly say the area is too small for both industries.
On the scale of economic value, oil, Ecuador's largest export, currently outweighs tourism, Ecuador's fourth largest source of foreign exchange.
"Ecuadoreans need oil for development," Francisco Costa Coloma, Ecuador's Energy and Mines Minister, said in a recent interview here. According to Unicef, 79 percent of Ecuador's population is considered poor and 39 percent of the children under the age of 5 suffer from malnutrition.
Mr. Costa noted that this country of 11 million people relied on oil sales for half its export earnings and for 62 percent of its Government budget.
A map in his office shows that the country's 45,000-square-mile Amazon region is already largely carpeted by oil company exploration and production blocks. With most of Ecuador's proven reserves in the Amazon, the Government plans to put up for bids in January six more Amazon blocks, totaling 5,000 square miles.
In December Ecuador dropped out of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries after the cartel tried to impose a production quota that was 23 percent below the country's projected output for 1993.
During 25 years of oil production in Ecuador's Amazon region, oil companies traditionally ran roughshod over the land rights and health concerns of the region's Indians and peasant settlers.
"Hundreds of oil wells generate more than 4.3 million gallons of toxic wastes every day, virtually all of which are spilled or discharged into the environment without treatment, contaminating countless streams and rivers," Judith Kimerling, an environmental lawyer, wrote in 1990 in "Amazon Crude," a book that has become the "Silent Spring" of Ecuador's increasingly aggressive environmental movement.
 
Water Tests Conducted
 In October, the Institute for Economic and Social Rights, a nonprofit group based in New York, is to release results of drinking water tests conducted last spring in Amazon areas where a consortium set up by Petroecuador, Ecuador's state-owned oil company, and Texaco produced oil from 1967 to 1990.
Testing eight sources of drinking water for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, substances that cause cancer in humans, researchers found levels ranging from 2 to 500 times the maximum level accepted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Sarah Zaidi, a coordinator of the project, said that these high levels of hydrocarbons were byproducts of oil production.
In the battle to force oil companies to adopt cleaner practices, Amazon Indians are discovering a powerful ally in Ecuador's mushrooming nature tourism business. Only four hours by air from Miami, Ecuador expects to attract 30,000 American and European tourists to its Amazon region this year.
Amazon tourism has doubled over the last five years, giving influential business people in Quito an economic interest in preserving the jungle.
Last month, Ecuador's President, Sixto Duran Ballen, visited a Petroecuador oil exploration site in a park wetlands adjacent to Imuya Camp, a forest lodge operated by Metropolitan Touring, Ecuador's largest tourism operator. In addition to offering jungle walks in "remote, untouched forest," Imuya Camp takes tourists in canoes to paddle through forest lagoons, watching for freshwater dolphins, black caimans, monkeys and the bright plumage of parrots, macaws and toucans.
 
Hotel Owner Sues
 After the visit the President banned further oil exploration by Petroecuador in the area of the camp. But he upheld drilling in two other sections of the park, the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve.
After the President's daughter, Alicia, visited the Amazon Jungle Resort Village at the head of an official investigating team, Maxus agreed to move its gravel-dredging operation half a mile downriver. Before the move, a jeepload of workers for the American company's Brazilian subcontractor, Andrade Gutierrez, attacked one of the hotel employees, breaking his hand. The construction workers also warned Mr. Brouwer and another hotel director that "a price was offered" for their heads in a nearby town, Shushufindi, Mr. Brouwer said.
This month the hotel's owner, Mariana Almeida, filed a $4 million damage suit against Maxus in a court here alleging that bookings at the lodge had dropped by 70 percent and that a British bank canceled a $2 million loan because of the dredging operations
A Maxus official said in an interview that Mrs. Almeida had opened her hotel two years ago on a part of the Aguarico River where oil companies had traditionally dredged for gravel.
"Tourism and mining are not compatible, and, unfortunately, she located her hotel near a mine," said Boris P. Abad, manager of government affairs and environmental control for the American company.
 
Wider Conflicts Predicted
 With Amazon tourism growing by 12 percent a year, operators say, the disputes with oil companies are going to increase. . "Nature tourists don't want to see helicopters, pipelines and oil rigs," said Pedro Proano, a spokesman for the Ecuadorean Eco-Tourism Association, a newly formed group that represents 35 operators.
Mr. Proano is leading a fight to keep oil exploration out of the Cuyabeno Reserve. In an increasingly common alliance here, his company, Transturi, hires Cofan Indians to serve as forest guides. Last year a group of Cofan detained about 25 Petroecuador surveyors and escorted them out of the reserve. After President Duran Ballen authorized drilling at one Cuyabeno site, Zabalo, this month, Cofan Indians burned a Petroecuador heliport and placed obstacles on the landing pad, according to Accion Ecologica, a private environmental group here.
Last spring Quechua Indians in Capirona, a community with a fledgling business in nature tours, confronted workers for an American seismic company, who were protected by Ecuadorian Army soldiers. After a tense standoff, the Indians prevailed, forcing the oil workers and soldiers to leave.
With their budgets largely financed by oil revenue, Ecuador's armed forces traditionally side with oil workers. The country's air force maintains a monopoly on all scheduled commercial flights into the Amazon, a prerogative that allows it to limit tourism.
One of South America's last state-run airlines, Transportes Aereos Militares Ecuatorianos, known by the Spanish acronym TAME, does not accept individual reservations and changes schedules without notice. Travel agencies generally refuse to deal with the airline.
To fill the jungle lodges, big nature tour operators charter planes. The smaller ones bribe TAME personnel at Quito's airport to guarantee seats.
"The Government sees eco-tourism as something positive," Mr. Proano, the spokesman for the tourism alliance, said. "But oil is the No. 1 priority."

HEADLINE: IRAN TALKS OF BID FOR NEW ALLIANCES

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Facing political isolation and a wave of diplomatic pressure over its denunciation of the Israeli-Palestinian accord, Iran proclaimed this week that it was seeking a strategic alliance with China and India.
"One of Iran's most natural partners is India, and given our situation with the United States and some Western countries, China is another suitable partner," the Iranian President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said in an interview published in The Hindustan Times, an Indian daily. "We have tested their honesty. If we work together we can have the last word on international issues." 
 Although Iran may emerge one day as an import market for nuclear technology and textiles from Asia, analysts said Teheran's overtures seemed to be a bargaining chip for normalizing relations with the West.
 
Distrust from China
 China's view of Iran's Islamic fundamentalist politics appears to be one of distrust. And India is among the countries that have been pressing the Iranian Government to endorse peace efforts in the Middle East.
During an official visit to Teheran this week, India's Prime Minister, Narasimha Rao, emphasized "the great specter of change in the world" in a meeting with Mr. Rafsanjani, the newspaper Salam reported.
High-ranking French and British Foreign Ministry officials also arrived here this week to solicit Iranian support for the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, which Mr. Rafsajani bitterly condemned last week.
Japan's warning to Iran was especially blunt, diplomats said.
"It is in the interest of the Iranian state to endorse the Israeli-Palestinian accord," diplomats quoted Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister, Hiroshi Fukuda, as telling his Iranian counterpart last Sunday. "Rejection will be a sign that Teheran is not worthy of trust."
 
Diplomatic Isolation
 Mr. Fukuda warned Teheran that it faced increasing diplomatic isolation because of its stance on the agreement.
The Japanese envoy reminded Teheran that Tokyo had opposed the Clinton Administration's policy of containment for Iran earlier this year.
But in its official remarks, Teheran has said repeatedly that the peace pact had only increased its incentive to part ways with Europe and Japan.
Hussein Sheikholislam, a senior Iranian diplomat, traveled to Damascus, Syria, last weekend to meet with militant Palestinian groups. In a meeting with Ahmed Jabril, Secretary General of The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, he pledged "Iran's comprehensive support for the Palestinian cause," The Teheran Times reported.
"In response to the compromise of Arabs with Israel and the backing of the accord by Europe and Japan," the state-run Hamshahri newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, "the most rational counterattack is to build a strategic alliance between Iran, India, China and even Kazakhstan."
 
A Skeptical Reaction
 Though the editorial was interpreted as promoting a nuclear alliance, political analysts and business people reacted skeptically.
"The Iranian economy cannot suddenly change course from a Western-dependent economy," said Reza Dadmanesh, a real estate developer. "Every year, $1 billion worth of Iranian carpets are exported to Western Europe. There is practically no market for them in India. Mr. Rafsanjani apparently employs some very unqualified advisers."
Analysts say one motivation for denouncing the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord was to bring together competing blocs in the Iranian leadership. Agreement on one policy could pave the way for "bargaining on issues that divide them," said an economics professor at Teheran University who spoke on condition of anonymity.
In the interview with the Hindustan Times, President Rafsanjani said wide-ranging relations with the United States might be possible if Washington relinquished its "imperialistic attitude."
In a letter written in July that was excerpted in the state-run press, an unidentified Iranian lawmaker suggested that "much of Iran's existing disagreements with the West would be eliminated" if relations with Washington were restored and that "economic development plans will get a boost."
The letter was reportedly widely read in official circles.
"Better to solve our disputes with the U.S." now that Iran "has the time and opportunity to choose," the author said.

HEADLINE: Few Raves Greet Plan By Whitman

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
It was to have been the jolt that awakened a tax-weary electorate and bolstered her campaign for governor, but four days after Christine Todd Whitman delivered her bold promise to cut taxes by 30 percent, the plan's impact seems to have been dissipated in a campaign of Democratic scorn and largely unfavorable editorial responses.
Several Republican state senators and Assembly members, who would presumably be responsible for enacting the plan -- cutting taxes by $1.2 billion over three years -- expressed dismay that after revealing her long-awaited plan on Tuesday, the Whitman campaign seemed to let the subject drop. The plan faced a carefully orchestrated Democratic campaign to deflect attention from Gov. Jim Florio's own vulnerability on the tax issue. 
 The Republicans said they were not troubled by Governor Florio's focus on the lack of detail in the program. But they said they wished that Mrs. Whitman had continued to emphasize the plan, instead of resuming normal campaign visits to a wide variety of voter groups.
"I am not in charge of her campaign, but I would certainly have asked for a more vigorous follow-up," said Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a Republican lawmaker from Morristown who heads the Assembly Appropriations Committee.
 
Not the Hot Topic
 "To be perfectly honest, I don't think it has turned out to be the first thing people are talking about," said John W. Hartmann, a Republican Assemblyman from Lawrence Township who won his first term two years ago amid anger over Governor Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase.
Mrs. Whitman spent Wednesday, the day after announcing her plan, receiving a union endorsement and touring communities in Hudson County. On Thursday her speech advancing the plan before the Mercer County Chamber of Commerce was overshadowed by news coverage of Mrs. Whitman's statement that she might limit state aid to wealthy school districts to meet court-mandated increases in aid to poor districts.
Also on Thursday, former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne gleefully recalled that Mrs. Whitman's plan was released 16 years to the day after Mr. Byrne's 1977 re-election opponent, Raymond H. Bateman, shot himself in the foot by promising to end the state income tax that Mr. Byrne had helped establish. Many television programs and newspapers emphasized the wry parallel between Mr. Byrne's campaign and Mr. Florio's.
 
Critical Editorials
 On Friday, with the Democratic criticism of her plan unabated and as the state's papers weighed in with critical editorials, Mrs. Whitman visited a high school. It was not until Friday afternoon that her campaign announced that she would meet, on Monday, with small-business owners who would endorse her tax program.
Mrs. Whitman's spokesman, Carl Golden, said on Friday that it was too soon to say that the tax-cut plan had failed to generate much excitement.
"One thing it has done is it has succeeded in focusing the campaign debate where it ought to be focused," he said. "The Governor has tried to avoid engaging us in the debate over taxes and the economy, and we are hearing from people who call that they are delighted that the campaign between the two candidates is about what concerns them most."
In the days after Mrs. Whitman's announcement, many of the state's newspapers published editorials expressing various degrees of disappointment in Mrs. Whitman's plan.
 
Economic Menu Questioned
 "What happened?" The Atlantic City Press asked Mrs. Whitman in an editorial on Friday. "You were supposed to unveil the meat and potatoes of your campaign. Instead, it looks like dessert."
On the other hand, The Home News of New Brunswick and some other newspapers supported the Whitman program.
Mr. Golden said the Whitman campaign was not dismayed by the largely unfavorable editorials in local papers about Mrs. Whitman's economic centerpiece.
"I think we sort of expected it," he said. "There was no question that there would be criticism coming our way, because you can't win everybody over with a program that is as innovative as this, and as massive as this."

HEADLINE: Plan Helps Panhandlers With Vouchers, Not Quarters

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Sept. 23

 BODY:
"Junior" spends most of his days sitting near the sidewalk on York Street here, holding his baseball cap out and asking passersby for change. "How you doing? You got some coins?" he asks.
But now, mixed in with the dollar bills, quarters and dimes, he is getting 25-cent vouchers he can redeem for food, personal items, even bus fare. "I like the idea," said the unemployed panhandler, who would give only his nickname. "I'm happy when someone gives me a voucher because I can go over to Wawa and get me some food." 
 The vouchers are distributed by New Haven Cares, a nonprofit group created to reduce panhandling in downtown New Haven and to help the community support street people without supporting their alcohol or drug habits.
The idea emerged in 1992 when members of the Downtown Christian Ministries approached Yale University about supporting a voucher program modeled after one in Berkeley, Calif., which has sold about 240,000 25-cent vouchers in two years.
Matthew Lieberman, a third-year law student at Yale and the son of United States Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, led the effort, gathering the support of church and community leaders, merchants, Yale University officials and the New Haven police. The vouchers were first distributed early in September.
 
Food, but No Alcohol
 "People in New Haven do care about homeless people and about panhandlers," Matthew Lieberman said. "The overwhelming support of this program shows that. But getting all these groups together -- who knew we had a panhandling problem but were often at odds over what to do about it -- was exciting."
More than 45 New Haven merchants are participating in the program. About 35 sell vouchers and 15 redeem them, allowing street people to pick up a hot cup of soup, a pint of orange juice or a bottle of baby formula. Cigarettes and alcohol cannot be bought with the vouchers.
"We can't get the vouchers in fast enough, they're selling so quickly," said Richard Hibbard, the manager of Store 24, a convenience store on Broadway. "People are buying them at $3 and $4 a clip and giving them to panhandlers."
Lisa Lubasch, a Yale junior from Jericho, L.I., went into the Wawa food market on York Street to get a quart of milk and bought some vouchers, which she passed out on her way down the street. "You can't walk down the street without having someone come up to you asking for money and that can be intimidating," she said. "I like the idea of a voucher so much better. You know at least they'll be getting food."
 
Encouraging Generosity
 Mr. Lieberman says he thinks the vouchers will make people more generous. "The sum total of giving is going to increase a lot," he said, "because people know the vouchers will be used to meet a need."
Harry W. Berkowitz, the president of the Yale Co-op, a major department store for Yale students, applauded the effort. "I think it's a wonderful thing that Matt and his group, who are up to their eyeballs in studies at law school, have the time, the drive and inclination to become involved in the community's needs," he said. "This community needs to do more to solve its own problems. We have to reduce the intimidation, reduce the feeling of unsafeness. This is one step in that direction."
Mr. Lieberman and two fellow law students, George Miller and Don Moorehead, act as a kind of central bank. Merchants who sell vouchers pass on the money to the law students, who reimburse merchants who have redeemed vouchers. Most stores act as either selling or redeeming sites, although some convenience stores and restaurants do both. Those who sell vouchers do not make any profit on them.
Signs are up in the windows of all the cooperating stores, and Yale law students also spend time walking the streets telling indigent people about the program.
 
'America Cares' Program
 Besides New Haven Cares, there are voucher distribution programs in Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Ore., San Francisco, Berkeley and Santa Cruz, Calif., Boulder, Colo., Chicago, and Edmonton, Alberta. Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat from New Mexico, has proposed legislation to create an America Cares voucher system that would provide start-up money in more than 60 cities. Mr. Lieberman's father, a Democrat from Connnecticut, is a co-sponsor of the bill, which is in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
New Haven corporations are starting to sign on, buying up hundreds of vouchers to be given to the city's non-panhandling homeless at soup kitchens and social service agencies.
Mr. Lieberman, a lifelong New Haven resident, said he wanted to address the problem of panhandling ever since he was 13 and his parents let him take the bus alone into downtown New Haven. While there a panhandler asked him for money and he gave him three dollars.
When he got home he told his mother, Elizabeth Haas, a psychiatric social worker. She told him that many of the panhandlers spent their money on liquor and wound up at the front door of the mental health center.
"I became one of those people who never gave to panhandlers," he said. "I didn't want to contribute to a drinking problem and yet I never liked just walking by and not helping. This is a way to get people to help and to interact."

HEADLINE: Urban Cowboys Shouldn't Rule the Range

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Higher Grazing Fees Have Ranchers Running Scared" (Sept. 12), on the rangeland reforms proposed by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, points out that the "proposals would make it easier to terminate leases to ranchers who abuse the land." That may sound reasonable, but far more frightening is that the proposals would provide new, undefined reasons that a Federal employee could decide a rancher should lose his lease. "Shortening grazing seasons, curtailing use of pesticides," even micro managing from Washington to the extent of saying where salt can be placed, are part of this document that is obviously authored by people who know virtually nothing about resource management in the West or the diverse systems requiring local knowledge and input that abound. 
 Claiming improved environmental care, Mr. Babbitt threatens short-term leases instead of the stabilizing 10-year renewable preferential leases now owned by ranchers as part of their capital investment. Environmental care comes from people who are in long-term business dependent on a healthy environment. It does not come from short-term, questionable tenure.
It is an economic reality that most ranchers will quit or be bankrupted by the raise in fees alone. The rest of the uncalled-for "reform" will make it easy for the Government to remove the rest from the land. Congress must be called upon to stop this abuse of agencies' perceived regulatory powers.

HEADLINE: When in Rome . . .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While it may be encouraging that some companies are beginning to appreciate multilingual managers ("When a Deal Can Turn on a Turn of a Phrase," Sept. 12), I consider the more typical case to be that of a company that will send an English-speaking executive to another country without any preparation whatsoever. Several years ago I informally briefed a woman acquaintance, a high-level sales manager being sent by her multinational pharmaceutical company to Japan for the first time. Although well educated, she knew absolutely nothing about Japanese society or mores -- and neither she nor her company felt it worth her time to read even one general book on Japanese society before going off to participate in million-dollar transactions. Similarly, I recall a seatmate on a plane, a banker going off to Canada, who assumed Canada was no more than an extension of the United States. 
 I wondered then, and I wonder now: Who runs these Fortune 500 companies so stupidly? Why are they so deaf to our message that good manners, if not good business, requires that you know something about your hosts?

Clinton Looks for Help To Finance Mideast Peace

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

 BODY:
As the Israeli-Palestinian accord progressed last week -- with the Israeli Parliament ratifying it over less-than-expected right-wing opposition -- President Clinton designated himself as the global fund-raiser for Middle East peace. He has sent out invitations to more than two dozen leaders of the world's richest countries, asking them to send their representatives to Washington this week to pledge enough money to make the Palestinians' experiment with autonomy work.
The United States last week promised $250 million over the next two years -- less than half of what the World Bank estimates the Palestinians will need during that period and a fraction of the $5.1 billion in annual American aid for Israel and Egypt. Those two countries made their peace in the 1970's at Camp David; their American assistance has been linked by an unchanging formula ever since. 
This time, however, the United States cannot afford to secure a peace by agreeing to bankroll it as the Carter Administration did. And Israel and Egypt have won assurances that their coffers will not be less full as a result of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. ELAINE SCIOLINO

Building the Cardboard City of Tomorrow

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
In a crowded room on the ground floor of the New School, a team of urban planners is building an elaborate cardboard city meant to help create a consensus about new construction around Lincoln Center.
The model, with scale photographs of the real facades attached to cardboard buildings, reconstructs the character of the neighborhood -- from 59th to 70th Street and from Amsterdam Avenue to Central Park West -- in vivid detail. A thin camera lens "walks" through the model, projecting views of the area onto a screen. 
 "You will be able to come in and we can show you what it looks like from your window," said Michael Kwartler, the director of the Environmental Simulation Center at the New School.
For each of six sites considered prime for new development, there will be three different renditions of buildings -- one built under current zoning laws, one under a new proposal by the City Planning Department and one under a counter-proposal by neighborhood groups including Community Board 7 and Landmark West!
The zoning in the Lincoln Center area has come under review because of a 545-foot building under construction on the block between 67th and 68th Streets and Broadway and Columbus Avenues.
The building, which is being developed by Millennium Partners and Lincoln Square Partners, will include 10 movie theaters, a post office and an eight-story health club, in addition to condominiums intended primarily to cater to foreign businessmen.
What has attracted attention is that everything about the building, which inspired complaints from nearby residents and a lawsuit, is allowed under the zoning for the Special Lincoln Square District. The district was created in 1969 to foster the area's development.
As a result, the Planning Department acknowledged the need for new guidelines, which it presented in June.
The community board and Landmark West! would like to see stricter zoning than the city has proposed. They advocate height limits on new buildings and guidelines for facades to conform to neighboring buildings. In addition, they want planners to consider the impact each new development would have on an already-crowded area.
Landmark West! originally commissioned the detailed physical model and raised the money to finance it.
"I hope this alleviates some of the confusion in the community, because it is meant as an educational tool," said Arlene Simon, president of Landmark West!
"But I would also like to be able to have the Department of City Planning understand what the actual impact of these buildings is."
Mr. Kwartler of the New School said he is trying to convince the owners of the development sites in question to participate in the project, and the owners of the Mayflower Hotel site have already agreed. The Planning Department is also contributing designs, and plans to use the model in the public review process. EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

LENI RIEFENSTAHL
A Memoir.
By Leni Riefenstahl.
Illustrated. 669 pp. New York:
St. Martin's Press. $35. 
 LET'S get the hoary questions out of the way. Was Leni Riefenstahl Hitler's lover? No. Was she a Nazi? In the strict sense, no; otherwise, the Americans, the French and, finally, the Germans would not have eventually cleared her. Was she an asset to the Nazi cause? Yes. What she also is, certainly, is one of the supreme artists of the cinema, the greatest woman film maker ever. And her 669-page autobiography, "Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir," does not contain a single unspellbinding page. Some books are merely so exciting that you can't put them down. This one is so exciting that you often must put it down, lest you overdose on thrills.
Riefenstahl tells her story in a clean, well-lighted prose, interrupted by occasional purple passages, with here and there an intensely personal touch to remind us that this is a memoir, not just a set of memos. (The uncredited translation is fluent and generally satisfactory, but does not avoid some common errors.) How truthful is it? How does one assess the veracity of any memoir? Behind Hitler's well-guarded doors, or in the remote hills of the Sudan, whose corroborating voice can we expect? Save for the flourishes with which an elderly autobiographer (this Aug. 22 she turned 91) may bedeck some of her choice memories, this strikes me as a credible account of an extraordinary life out of which three or four more than sufficiently eventful ones could be fashioned. It's something like a 90-year hurdle race. The book must, in the main, be true; it is far too weird for fiction.
Still, says the captious reader of this review, wasn't she a screenwriter, too? Couldn't this be a scenario posing as a memoir? As a screenwriter, Riefenstahl was more Manichaean; hers was a passionately black-and-white world shot in bold blacks and whites -- a vision of extremes at one with the deep romanticism of 19th-century German culture. In this memoir, there are colors and shades; the skies are troublingly changeable; the characters more lifelike than movieish. I defy the most skeptical, even hostile, reader to emerge from a reading unaffected.
Part of the way Riefenstahl works on a reader's sympathies is by casting herself as both the master of her fate and its victim, a woman who knew what she wanted, had seemingly insurmountable obstacles thrown in her path and overcame them. Her first impediment was her father. Born into a middle-class Berlin family in 1902, a scrawny baby who improved with age, young Leni excelled at sports, studied painting, dreamed of becoming an actress, then a dancer. But Papa considered performing a one-way avenue to hell. Under strict supervision -- she was not allowed to date or even to go to the movies alone until she was 21 -- she had to become a bit devious. It was a lesson that served her throughout her life. If Papa threatened to beat you and lock you in your room, plead your case with Mutti. If Italian customs inspectors were officious, wire Il Duce. Goebbels stood in your way? Go to Hitler for support. If Hitler said no . . . but we'll come to that.
While taking dancing lessons on the sly, Leni turned down the occasional movie offer so as not to blow her cover. But doing so hurt as much as her father's beatings or watching him browbeat her mother; the girl vowed to become and remain independent.
NOTHING daunted her. Seemingly too old at 23 to start ballet, she nevertheless worked hard enough to succeed at it; she also won second prize in a beauty contest, setting another lifelong pattern. She's not ashamed, later, when her beloved film "The Blue Light" takes only a second in an international contest, or when she comes in second in a major ski race. And some of her greatest loves rejected her for other women. Well before Avis, our second-prize winner only tries harder.
And succeeds, or at least gets to meet the right people. Before she was 25, she tells us, Ferruccio Busoni composed a piece for her and predicted success as a dancer; the playwright Karl Vollmoeller tried to seduce her and prophesied failure without a sugar daddy. Otto Froitzheim, a German tennis ace, stared at her in the locker room and later, with a power play, netted her virginity. Men generally fell at her feet, she says. Are we to believe all this? The evidence is not unpersuasive. The great Mary Wigman, who taught only the best, put the final polish on Leni's dancing. She appeared in Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater and danced triumphantly in a huge Prague theater where only Pavlova had preceded her.
The fuel she drove on was obsession. Admirable or misguided, it subsumed all her strivings: as a dancer, as an actress, as a mountaineer and skier. And later as . . . but we'll come to that, too.
Obsession rescued her when a cracked kneecap threatened to end her dancing career. Waiting in the Berlin subway for a train to take her to a doctor, she spotted a poster: " 'Mountain of Destiny' -- a film about the Dolomites by Dr. Arnold Fanck." Instead of the physician, she saw the movie; enthralled, she set about becoming an actress. Luis Trenker, the leading mountain-movie star, patronizingly discouraged her. On her way to one of her periodic stays in the hospital for the ill health that plagued her throughout her life, she sent pictures and a letter to Fanck. Soon he was at her bedside with "The Holy Mountain," a script dedicated to her.
So the mountain had come to Mohammed. Presently Fanck was directing her in the film, with Luis Trenker as her co-star, and also showering her with unwelcome love letters, poems and gifts. When he discovered her in the arms of Trenker (a once-only fling), there was a terrible fight and Fanck tried to kill himself. But when he was recalled by UFA, the premier German company producing the movie, it was Riefenstahl who finished the film for him with great success. Trenker, all along, seethed with professional jealousy. Eventually, he would betray her.
As Riefenstahl tells it, jealousy and its handmaiden, betrayal, stalked her all her life, often at the hands of a spurned lover. Hans Schneeberger, for one, Fanck's cameraman and the man who taught her how to ski, had an intense affair with her and subsequently turned on her, first as a lover, later even as a friend.
By the time Leni met Hans, in the mid-1920's, she had become a strikingly handsome young woman, exuding strength, purposefulness, health (whether or not she actually had it) and a certain haughtiness. She could be both peremptory and charming. Alas, she was a workaholic and a perfectionist, both qualities that were roadblocks to romance. When not toiling unholy hours for days on end (one of the causes of her health problems), she was consumed by her latest project.
Such a person has no time for love affairs. Or, if so, only with co-workers. And she had a few, with cameramen, mountain guides, soundmen. Still, not for nothing was her fondest ambition (unrealized, like so many others) to play Kleist's Penthesilea, the virginal Amazon queen who dies for love. One of her greatest realized roles was the mountain girl in a film she persuaded the eminent G. W. Pabst to direct with Fanck, "The White Hell of Piz Palu," wherein she had to climb barefoot. Dancing gave her the feet for it; her character, the courage. Silent cinema did not go in for doubles; one did one's own perilous stunt work. At this point another leitmotif of her life appears: the hairbreadth escape.
It was in "White Hell" that, buried in the snow a long time, Riefenstahl developed the severe bladder problems that she could never quite shake. But here, too, Pabst discovered that she was a director at heart. When he told her to look to the left in a shot, she looked to the right, thinking in terms of the viewfinder, into which Fanck had repeatedly let her peer.
THE next director she impressed was Josef von Sternberg, who wanted to take her to Hollywood along with Marlene Dietrich and make her as big a star. Though tempted, she was still in love with Schneeberger, who had left her for another woman, and she refused. Meanwhile Fanck had taught her how to edit film, and it was she who, when the French found "White Hell" too long, successfully cut it down.
Her own favorite among her movies, "The Blue Light," was next. She oversaw the entire production from the beginning, and the story of its conception and execution is pure Riefenstahl. She got the distinguished Hungarian writer Bela Balazs to help her with the screenplay. For shooting "night" scenes outdoors in daylight, she prodded Agfa to develop a new film stock, and upon founding her own film company, turned to directing because it was cheaper than hiring someone else. For the same reason, she starred in the film as Junta, the mountain girl who climbs to the heights -- alone -- but dies of the impurity of the rest of the world. The master of fate becomes the victim of forces beyond her control. It is, for Riefenstahl, a familiar motif.
A book could easily be written about the filming of "S O S Iceberg," a German-American co-production shot in Greenland, where obstacles multiplied in glorious profusion: cracking ice floes, dangerous flights between icebergs with a flying ace, recalcitrant polar bears imported from the Berlin Zoo, starved Eskimo dogs that ate anything made of fur or leather; everything from ingrown toenails to more attacks of her now-chronic cystitis. But Riefenstahl, master of fate, surmounted them all. She had discovered the miracle of Greenland: "We see differently there, we feel differently," she writes. The "ballast of superfluous, unproductive things . . . seemed to vanish in the ocean."
If a yearning for extremes is part of the fascist spirit, then Riefenstahl was ripe for fascism. But suffice it to say here that this high-striving woman was eager to get away from the ordinary, the messiness of the mundane. Hence the urge to lose herself in solo dance, to scale or ski the highest mountains, to immerse herself in romantic-idealistic movies, to embrace the austerities of Greenland. Magnitude, altitude, solitude -- whatever removes you from the multitude.
Hearing Hitler address a crowd in 1932, she wrote him soliciting a meeting; she was fascinated by a man who could raise expectations to such orgasmic heights. The instant she heard his voice, she tells us, "I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget. It seemed as if the earth's surface were spreading out in front of me, like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth. I felt quite paralyzed."
It turned out the Fuhrer was a fan of hers, admired her as an artist and flattered her as a person. She soon became aware of what she saw as the split in his personality: showy rouser of primitive public yearnings, modest private person and, either way, endowed with a charisma as undefinable as Greenland's.
Though he once or twice made the merest hint of a pass at Riefenstahl, Hitler respected her lack of response; mostly he needed someone to talk to. Actually, talk at; never during their friendship did he show the slightest interest in her personal life. If self-obsession was what they both excelled at, she again came in second. Riefenstahl was never seriously attracted to strong, famous men, i.e., father figures; the many crude attempts by the notorious womanizer Goebbels to seduce her especially repelled her. Several such scenes in the book combine low farce with Grand Guignol. Rebuffed, Goebbels became her dogged enemy, strewing her path not with roses but with monkey wrenches.
As Minister of Propaganda he could make life difficult for her, even though the movie she agreed to make -- reluctantly, as she tells it -- was ordered by Hitler, who gave her complete artistic freedom. The masterpiece that resulted was "Triumph of the Will" (first shown in 1935). Hitler himself "knew little or nothing about art." Albert Speer, the architect of the Nuremberg party rally that she was to film, built her an elevator on a flagpole. (When Goebbels threatened interference, she went right to Hitler.)
Riefenstahl's training as a dancer and painter served her well, as she turned a Nazi rally into a picturesque and balletic spectacle. Her sound cinematic instincts let her come up with a variety of shots never before used in documentaries, such as those made by cameramen on roller skates. Most ingenious were the stratagems by which she kept Goebbels's henchmen out of her hair, and the Minister's hands out of her pants.
Even more remarkable is the account of her next masterwork, "Olympia" (1938), a two-part film about the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics. The technical difficulties to be overcome, given the primitive state of film and the peskiness of both sports officials and Goebbels's bloodhounds, make for breathless reading. Commissioned by the German Olympic Committee, the film was intended as a documentary; but, once again, Riefenstahl was interested primarily in art. The main financing came from UFA -- which wanted to add a love story! -- and none of it from the Nazi Party. Otherwise, Goebbels would have exercised stifling control.
THERE were other projects, notably attempts to fulfill the recurring dream of making "Penthesilea," for which she became an expert horsewoman. This time the enterprise foundered for lack of money. Meanwhile Hitler and his favorite director continued their intermittent conversations, with God and the Messiah among their topics. Whenever she alluded to his racist policies, she says, he simply cut her off. Later, during the war, Hitler confided his wish to yield the reins to others after the victory; he himself wanted to make movies with Riefenstahl, a prospect too shuddery for her to contemplate.
Her concern apparently was less political, or even ethical, than professional: she feared Hitler would be a nuisance. Riefenstahl protests that throughout most of the Hitler period she was a political ignoramus. Despite her sophistication and exposure to the world, she does seem to have spent her life a bit out of touch. When Mick Jagger, at the height of his fame in the 1970's, wished her to take his picture, she had to ask, "Who is Mick Jagger?"
But arriving in the United States in November 1938 to front-page news of Kristallnacht, she must have found it hard to dismiss the reports as American propaganda, as she says she did. Whether she lied to herself then and whether she is still doing so, one can't know. Certainly her moral compass set her a peculiar course.
On the other hand, her personal relationships, if we can trust her tale, seem to have been admirable. She was clearly devoted to Peter Jacob, an army officer whom she met on a train and who helped film some of her movies. Passionate but unfaithful, he was the only man she ever married. She also adored her mother, and the way these two women helped each other makes for one of the loveliest strands of this memoir.
Riefenstahl condemns herself for her failure to intervene to save her brother, who was assigned to a punishment battalion for making unflattering comments about the war. Fighting on the eastern front, he was blown to bits by a Russian grenade. Her remorse over his death is, in fact, more convincing than any expressed shame at submitting to the Fuhrer's demands.
To Hitler's delight, "Olympia" became a worldwide hit in 1938, winning (for once) first prize in Venice. Audiences in France, Belgium, Norway and the United States, among other countries, applauded not only the film but also Hitler's brief appearances in it. (She doesn't say if anyone booed.)
Like many Germans, Riefenstahl says, she began by believing Hitler could pull Germany out of its terrible economic woes in the 1930's. Though she says she had read "Mein Kampf" by 1932, she either missed or chose to ignore its racist message. Certainly she did not foresee its tragic consequences. She tells us she lost her faith in Hitler well before war's end. When in 1942 she returned from a trip to Italy and saw Jews forced to wear the yellow star, she was, she says, "indignant and ashamed." That year, at her last meeting with Hitler, she wanted to confront him, she confesses, but "held my tongue."
For most of the war years she worked on a movie version of "Tiefland," Eugen d'Albert's opera, but without the music. It gave her a chance to play a dancer, though had she known that it would take two decades to complete -- what with war, illness and the confiscation of her rushes, which lasted 10 years -- she might never have undertaken it.
After Germany fell, there commenced a series of unending misfortunes for her. The United States authorities investigated and denazified her promptly, but she did not follow American advice to avoid her mountain home in Austria's French zone. The French had her in and out of prisons, for a while even in an insane asylum, and treated her very roughly. She was to find out later that, having got hold of her films, various French groups fought for their possession and wanted their maker safely out of the way. Yet eventually the French, too, denazified her, only to expose her to endless troubles with her fellow Germans. They, finally, also cleared her, although libels against her were to embroil Riefenstahl in much grinding litigation, costly in time, money and energy, even though she says she won 50 libel cases.
After the war she was reunited happily with her refugee friends from the United States. She and Manfred George, the German Jewish journalist who became the editor of the newspaper Aufbau in New York, enjoyed a Berlin Film Festival together in 1965. And at the 1959 Venice Festival, which paid tribute to both of them, she and von Sternberg again rejoiced in each other's company. She quotes from letters to support her belief that her Jewish friends forgave her.
The greatest damage to her name in the postwar years was the publication in 1947 of the supposed diary of Eva Braun, which, though subsequently proved a hoax, accused her of a lurid affair with Hitler and eliminated forever her chances as a feature-film maker. The perpetrator was Luis Trenker, her erstwhile co-star, one-hour lover and virulent professional rival.
SHE was at least able to shoot some sports documentaries. Yet her most cherished project, "The Red Devils," an international ski film for which she was assured the collaboration of Vittorio De Sica and the celebrated scenarist Cesare Zavattini, collapsed because of an attack on her in Vienna's Communist newspaper, Der Abend, that, she says, scared the Austrian Government out of subsidizing it. During the 1950's and 60's, when Riefenstahl was persona non grata even in the United States, where her films were nonetheless taught and admired in university film schools, her marriage to Peter Jacob unraveled, in part from attrition caused by the poverty in which he, she and her mother lived.
If the famous spider whose repeated efforts to rebuild its web inspired Robert Bruce to chase the English out of Scotland had met with as many frustrations as Riefenstahl, it would surely have given up. After two attempts at making a film in Africa failed, and just as she was about to drop the Africa project altogether, one of her guardian angels (she believes in them) led her to a newspaper picture of the Nubas, a Sudanese tribe she fell in love with.
Scraping together what money she could, she traveled back to Africa, where she exhibited enormous skills in winning over various tribes, including the warrior Masai, as well as high and low government officials. But her happiest times were among the Nubas, whom she visited five times and who, in effect, adopted her. These adventures, during which she and Horst Kettner, her young assistant, made films and took photographs (many of them lost in thefts and accidents, or through the ineptitude of her German photo lab), could in themselves make a spectacular mini- or maxi-series. Two collections of her pictures brought her renewed prominence -- and criticism -- in the 1970's. Eventually, as she eloquently reports, the Nubas were ruined by the encroachments of tourism and the seduction of money. She never explains what part her own work played in the process.
At 72, shaving 20 years from her age, she enrolled in scuba-diving school and, with Horst's aid, passed the grueling test. To her photography books about the Nubas, she was now able to add a volume of underwater photographs.
A noted French writer has called Leni Riefenstahl "the Plato and Michelangelo of the Leica," and her films assure her an enduring place in cinematic history. That she put her art to the use of evil is an issue she never seriously addresses here. But can the self-deceptions of an obsessed esthete wipe out the fact of her greatness as an artist? A leading British film historian, John Grierson, publicly kissed her foot and paid her expenses in one of her libel suits. In the United States, frequent showings of her films, including a retrospective at the Telluride Festival in Colorado in 1974, did much to rehabilitate her as a genius. If there were still attacks accusing her not only of gleeful collaboration with the Nazis but also, among other things, of not influencing the course of cinema, the last charge, at least, is otiose. Successes generate demonstrable imitations; masterpieces subtly alter perception and create influences less easy to trace.
As for the life, perhaps we should look to the character with whom Riefenstahl most closely identifies herself: Junta, the mountain girl in "The Blue Light," who was willing to die for her aspirations. Riefenstahl, too, was ready to sacrifice all in pursuit of her obsessions. In the process she may have compromised her humanity. But her artistic integrity, never.
 
 
 
AT LUNCH WITH ADOLF HITLER
 In the last week of August 1933, I was invited to a luncheon at the Reich Chancellery. . . . After the meal, when the company broke up into small groups, Bruckner came over to me and said, "The Fuhrer would like to speak to you," and I was led to an adjacent room. There was no one else there except a servant . . . serving coffee, tea and mineral water. A short time later Hitler came in and greeted me, apparently in high good humor. His very first question however put me in a quandary.
"I invited you here today in order to find out how far you've got with your preparations for the film on the party rally, and whether you're getting enough support from the Ministry of Propaganda." I stared at him in amazement -- what was he talking about? Surprised at my reaction, he said: "Didn't the Propaganda Ministry inform you that I want you to make a film about the party rally in Nuremberg?" I shook my head and Hitler was clearly perplexed. "You know nothing about it?" he asked. . . . He summoned Bruckner and angrily asked him, ". . . Why wasn't Fraulein Riefenstahl informed?" As he spoke he clenched his fists, glaring with anger. . . .
I myself was by now very agitated, and I interrupted Hitler. "My Fuhrer, I cannot accept this -- I have never seen a party rally, I know nothing about what goes on there, and I have no experience in making documentaries. It would be better if such films were made by party members who know the material and are happy to be given such assignments." I talked to Hitler almost beseechingly, and slowly he relaxed and calmed down.
Looking at me, he said, "Fraulein Riefenstahl, don't let me down."
 From "Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir."
 
 
 
'WHY AM I GUILTY?'
 Leni Riefenstahl was angered by the many European reviews that characterized her memoir as a protracted defense of her involvement with the Nazi inner circle. "Writing the truth is not a defense, it is what happened," she said in a recent telephone interview from her home on Lake Starnberg, outside Munich. "To defend myself is not necessary." Rather, she explained, she published the book to save herself the trouble of repeatedly detailing her life to journalists.
"People can read the book and not bother me," she said. "Those who are not prejudiced will be satisfied with my book. Others will never be happy with what I say; they will always believe the old stories." She hopes that by setting the record straight she will be free to devote herself to her art. The 91-year-old director recently returned from making an undersea documentary film in the Maldives.
Miss Riefenstahl feels that the decades of criticism she endured for making "Triumph of the Will" were wholly unjustified. "In 1934, all the diplomats of Europe had met with Hitler and recognized Germany," she noted. "Why am I guilty for making a film that year that was not propaganda? I have always spoken the truth, and I have made no compromises, not even to Hitler."
Despite her contention that "Triumph" in no way glorified Hitler's cause, she didn't hesitate when asked whether she would have agreed to make the film if she had had any foreknowledge of his atrocities. "I would never have done it," she insisted. "I would not even have made 'Olympia.' "
She refuses to grant permission for "Triumph" to be screened in Germany today, even in schools and universities. "The film has a strong effect," she explained. "If young people see it, maybe they will get too enthusiastic about it in the wrong way and not understand the difference between art and history."
She said that there have been no reports of neo-Nazi groups using her films, and that she does not consider today's extreme nationalism to be a serious movement. "I don't think it is a real threat," she said. "It is a minority -- young, stupid people."
Miss Riefenstahl attributed her own failure to recognize the sinister nature of Hitler's rhetoric to her apolitical nature, and observed that an ambivalence toward politics was typical of German artists at the time. Even when she arrived in New York just days after Kristallnacht in 1938, she had no inkling of the Nazis' genocidal intentions. "Journalists came to the boat and asked me what I thought about Kristallnacht, and I told them that it couldn't be true, because in the American newspapers on the ship I had read so many lies about Germany," she recalled. "When months later I came back to Germany, I went to an adjutant of Hitler's and he told me what had happened, and at that moment I was nearly sick."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Westport Company Drops Curtain

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
STATE financial support, long delayed by red tape, was held up yet again and so the Fairfield County Stage Company of Westport announced last week that it was going out of business.
Actually it was not quite that simple. "I'm not going to blame it all on the state," said the company's artistic director, Burry Fredrik. "We were behind the eight ball from the beginning." 
 The beginning to which Ms. Fredrik referred was the move in 1990 of the Boston Post Road Stage Company, as it was then called, from the Mill Hill School in Fairfield to the Westport Playhouse. That was a mark of growth and a chance to play in a real theater with its own history -- and to get rid of the institutional image the company had from its opening in 1984 in the Grasmere School in Fairfield. "We were bursting at the seams and we tired of being in school buildings. And people couldn't find it," said the company's managing director, Marilyn Hersey.
Upward mobility apparently signaled the company's downfall. "It was a wonderful move, except in hindsight," said Ms. Hersey. "When people could find us, they didn't come. And we struggled ever since."
The cost of the move from Fairfield to Westport was $100,000. "We applied for and won bonding money from the Department of Economic Development in the amount of $60,000," Ms. Hersey recalled. "The Attorney General's office congratulated us upon winning it and we counted on it." What the company did not count on was the labyrinthine process, the misunderstandings, "back and forth through so many channels," Ms. Hersey said. "Would we have gone into the Playhouse without the promise of that money?" Ms. Hersey asked.
For three seasons the company expected to have the money in its operating budget but did not: "so we were always behind," Ms. Hersey said. And there were other setbacks, not just bureaucratic. "In January, the heating system broke down. And we were just hanging on. We weren't building audiences. The economy didn't help," she added.
Echoing Ms. Fredrik, Ms. Hersey went on: "I won't blame the theater folding on the state of Connecticut but it was the straw that broke us. We'd probably be opening if we had it." Ms. Hersey mentioned that a $75,000 grant from another source was contingent upon getting the state money. "And whatever potential we had for further fund raising," she added.
"Curiously," Ms. Hersey pointed out, "we had a stronger following in Fairfield. With 100 seats we played 88 to 89 percent capacity over a season." The Westport theater had 190 seats, a reconfiguration for the winter (designed by Ms. Fredrik) that was restored to the 707-seat capacity for summer stock. "But we were lucky if we sold 50 percent of the seats in Westport," Ms. Hersey added. "I don't think people in Westport really want a winter theater."
 
'One Hot Show, Hands Down'
 If the audience in Westport was a shrinking one, it was also quite conservative. The Fairfield County Stage Company, which has been known for an enterprising repertory, had but "one hot show, hands down, the best attended," Ms. Hersey said. That was "A Christmas Carol." A campy spoof of 1940's B movies (Charles Busch's "Lady in Question") was the worst attended. "People were put off by drag and by Nazi characters in Bavaria, even as cartoons," Ms. Hersey said. In the first season Christopher Durang's scathing look at the Roman Catholic Church ("Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You") drew "enormous amounts of hate mail."
"Westport audiences are offended more easily than Fairfield audiences" and Ms. Hersey wondered why: "It's only four miles away."
"We disappointed Westport and Westport disappointed us," Ms. Fredrik added. "If people want to see a show, they get there. Aren't there enough who care to support good effort? Maybe they thought we weren't good enough. I don't know. We just didn't sell enough tickets."

HEADLINE: Baseball Without Me

BYLINE: By Fay Vincent; Fay Vincent was baseball commissioner from 1989 to 1992. He is working on a book about those years.

 BODY:
It has been a year since I resigned under duress as commissioner of baseball. On the field, the game thrives -- as it always has. This September, there have been good pennant races in all four divisions. Attendance is soaring.
But off the field, the landscape is not so verdant. Owners are fighting owners; owners are fighting the players' union; the union is fighting everything. And all the while, there is no commissioner. Too many of those who steward the game still don't understand that they hold baseball in trust for the public and that baseball deserves better. 
 To be sure, many baseball clubs face a fiscal reckoning. They are not generating a decent return on investment, and the grim new deals that will sharply reduce television revenue will only increase pressure on the bottom line. It's true that no owner in recent times has lost money when it came time to sell a club, but that kind of economic madness must end someday: remember the tulip craze.
Yet for most of us the business of baseball is like the sun: we can't look at it too long without having to turn away.
Money is not the point. I leave that to the game's ample supply of accountants, marketing experts and tax wizards to analyze. My concern for baseball is that the business people who run it seem to be treating it as nothing more than a business. It isn't. The owners have talked all summer of establishing a partnership with the players as part of the current labor negotiations -- something I urged throughout my tenure. So far, we have been given little more than talk.
Was the union consulted before a television deal was struck with the networks? No. What about plans to realign the leagues? Not until the union objected. Why would the union accept management "wisdom" on economic matters, given the owners' failures over the years on this front? The fact is, the union will want a vote on major issues -- and is entitled to one. Some owners' idea of a partnership, I suspect, is one in which they're the senior partners.
For its part, the union must stop seeing everything as a matter of confrontation and must also realize that the players have a greater obligation to the game than showing up at the ballpark. It is a disgrace, for example, that Steve Howe is still pitching for the Yankees even though I banished him after his seventh violation of baseball's drug policies. Howe was reinstated by an arbitrator because the union -- misguidedly, I believe -- challenged my ruling. I can understand his desire to stay in the game and earn his million-dollar salary. But could not the union consider more than just his interests?
Yes, I very much understand that unions operate for the benefit of their members. That is a good thing. But if there is ever to be a strategic alliance between owners and players, the union will have to widen its vision of what policies serve the institution and not just the individual. Stubbornness and the status quo are not the exclusive franchises of management.
If baseball does not get its act together, Congress may try to "help." And that will be bad for almost everyone. In the long run, baseball deserves its immunity from the antitrust laws. But frustrated by the myopic conduct of owners, Congress is closer now to repealing that immunity than it has been in years. The best way for owners to show Congress they can clean up their act is to reinstate a strong, independent commissioner. They've had 384 days in which to do so.
I have been told many times that peace and prosperity in baseball were about as likely as seeing the Prime Minister of Israel and the leader of the P.L.O. shake hands. Could we all not hope for another miracle? Remember the '51 Giants!

HEADLINE: Viewpoints;
A Cartel More Durable Than Diamonds

BYLINE: By STEFAN KANFER; Stefan Kanfer is a journalist and author. His latest book, "The Last Empire," is a history of the De Beers company (Farrar, Straus & Giroux).

 BODY:
IN the pantheon of great advertising slogans, few have enjoyed more lasting power than "A diamond is forever." It is the signature line of De Beers, the huge South African cartel that controls 90 percent of the world's diamond supply.
On closer inspection, though, few slogans make less sense. A diamond is no more "forever" than a garnet, a ruby or the piece of rose quartz you picked up on the beach. A diamond may be the hardest natural substance on earth, yet if hit with a hammer it will shatter into worthless shards. 
 No, "forever" may better describe De Beers than its product. Ever since Cecil Rhodes created the cartel in 1887, no matter what the hammer blows of circumstance -- wars, financial crises, racial strife, hostile governments -- De Beers has managed to outlast or circumvent them all.
Late in World War II, for example, President Franklin D. Roosevelt demanded from De Beers 6.5 million carats of industrial diamonds for aircraft factories. De Beers largely refused, despite threats of Justice Department investigations. It knew, as Time magazine said in 1945, that Justice had "no more chance of denting the cartel than of cleaving a diamond with a butter knife."
How does De Beers do it? For one, it's a mammoth enterprise, with profits of $373 million in the first half of 1993 alone. But it's much more than that. While even the Coca-Cola Company must go head-to-head with Pepsi, De Beers has no real competition. It controls its product, a finite resource, much as OPEC controls oil. But, better than OPEC, De Beers has no dissension. It has been strictly ruled by its own royal family, the Oppenheimers, since the 1920's.
Nor does the company sit idle in this exalted position. For decades, it has spent millions to promote the romance of diamonds, turning into an article of faith the sentiments of Marilyn Monroe in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." ("Square-cut or pear-shape/These rocks don't lose their shape/ Diamonds are a girl's best friend!")
The marketing pays off well. In the 1940's, fewer than 5 percent of Japanese fiancees had diamond engagement rings. Now, after a relentless ad campaign by De Beers, 8 out of 10 brides wear sparklers on their way to the altar. And in the United States and Europe, the company is rapidly invading a market much richer than newlyweds -- couples married 10 years or more.
As it whips up desire for diamonds, though, De Beers cagily manipulates supply. Diamonds are not unduly rare in nature; besides the well-known mines in South Africa, there are rich deposits in countries to its north, as well as in Siberia and Australia. But diamonds show up in stores only when De Beers wants. Waiting out the current recession, the cartel has been holding back millions of excess carats, storing them in company vaults. Similarly, during the Depression, De Beers actually ran out of space to keep unwanted diamonds, even stuffing the stones in butter churns.
If time is of no consequence to De Beers, neither is politics. Take the former Soviet Union. All the years it was denouncing capitalism in general and South Africa in particular, it was dealing Siberian diamonds under the table -- to De Beers.
Or take the emerging black nations. They could hardly have been expected to trade with an apartheid state. So they dealt their unpolished jewels to companies licensed in Switzerland and Luxembourg. It was not their fault that the diamonds were then quietly channeled -- to De Beers.
Or take South Africa. After the elections next April, the country will empower its first black government. Dire forecasts are being made: civil strife, nationalization, white flight.
But the smart money remains on De Beers. For when Nelson Mandela was released from jail, one of the first white industrialists he wanted to see was Harry Oppenheimer, the top executive of De Beers. As Mr. Mandela knows, diamonds are sometimes, but De Beers just might be forever.

HEADLINE: Supporting Dinkins, Clinton Worries About Role of Race

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
President Clinton, his voice ringing in revival tones, told a packed fund-raiser last night that Mayor David N. Dinkins deserved re-election on his record, but was facing a tough campaign partly because "too many of us are still too unwilling to vote for people who are different than we are."
With such an overt reference to Mr. Dinkins's status as New York City's first black Mayor, the President unleashed perhaps the most explosive electoral weapon at the Mayor's command, and one that Mr. Dinkins has seldom, if ever, invoked in such strong terms. 
 "This is not as simple as overt racism," Mr. Clinton told 1,000 people at a $1,000-a-plate dinner at the New York Sheraton, speaking extemporaneously and choosing his words with apparent care as the crowd burst into cheers and ovations. "That is not anything I would charge to anybody who doesn't vote for David Dinkins or Bill Clinton or anybody else. It's not that simple. It's this deep-seated reluctance we have, against all our better judgment, to reach out across these lines."
At that, a voice in the crowd shouted out, "Tell 'em, Bubba!"
As he began this portion of his speech, flanked on the dais by such celebrated Democratic orators as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who had spoken earlier, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Clinton said, "I'm going to get in a lot of trouble."
But he said that on the flight from Washington with the Mayor on Air Force One, he had begun to wonder why Mr. Dinkins, having endured tough fiscal times, hired more police and seen crime decline, should face a competitive race against Rudolph W. Giuliani in a city like New York, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 5 to 1. He said part of the reason is "he doesn't give enough speeches like he gave here tonight," referring to the Mayor's own unusually emphatic broadside against Mr. Giuliani as a supporter of Republican policies that he says have hurt the city. He also called the Mayor a humble man in a society "that values self-promotion."
Then he went on to raise the race question, saying several times that he did not mean to suggest overt racism. Instead, he said: "It is this inability to take that sort of leap of faith, to believe that people who look different than we are really are more like us than some people who look just like us but don't share our values and our interests."
Black supporters of the Mayor have tried occasionally to voice such concerns, and have often faced stiff criticism. For a white Southern-born President to raise them was an altogether different order of political tactics, though mayoral aides insisted that the passage was unplanned.
Indeed, the tone of Mr. Clinton's speech was in marked contrast to the photo opportunities and other carefully scripted events in a day that began with the President giving the Mayor a lift on Air Force One from Washington, where Mr. Dinkins had gone Saturday night just for a morning meeting at the White House and airborne face time with his Commander in Chief.
 
Sticking to Clinton
 From the White House lawn to the Future Diner in Fresh Meadows, Queens (where the President conducted one of his trademark Oprah-esque seminars on health care, with Mr. Dinkins nodding solemnly in a front-row booth) to a private fund-raiser for big donors at the home of a whiskey magnate to the dinner, the Mayor stuck to the President like wallpaper sticks to the wall. Beaming broadly, he introduced him in Queens as "our fearless leader."
At the fund-raiser, Mr. Clinton said of his help for the Mayor, "This is a big deal to me," noting that he himself could never have been elected without broad interracial support. "This is a big deal, folks. This is not just New York, this is L.A., this is rural South. This is every place we are being tested. We are going through a time of profound change and we right now don't have the sense of personal security to make the changes we need to make."
He continued: "We need more confidence in our selves, and confidence that we can meet all these challenges that are out there and confidence that the 21st century will also be an American century. And in order to do it, we have to get our act together, so we can feel good about the people we elect."
Citing the treaty-signing ceremony between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, Mr. Clinton said: "Think about what it means for the future of the Middle East if we can keep it going. And then ask yourself, this man, who has a good record, who has a good plan, who has a good heart, has earned the right to your vote, and you ought to make sure he gets it and is returned to City Hall."
The Mayor wrapped Mr. Clinton in a bear hug and told the crowd, "For me, it does not get better than this."
In an interview later at the Carnegie Delicatessen, where he had repaired with aides for a bowl of chicken soup, the Mayor said he had had no idea that Mr. Clinton would make such comments. He had been moved, the Mayor said, but "in retrospect, I'm not surprised, given the man."
He added: "I think this: that one has to take his words in the total context of what he was saying, and get the nuances and subtleties that are there."
Noting that the President had explicitly said he was not talking about racism, Mr. Dinkins said that some would undoubtedly try to twist Mr. Clinton's words. "The point I would make is if others of us would attempt to make those subtle distinctions, we would not be able to. Given his stature, and the respect and esteem in which he's held, I think he's able to."
Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager, Bill Lynch, insisted of the remarks: "The President just went off and did that. There was no discussion. It was not the prepared text I saw. I think he formed a bond with the Mayor."
This election is likely to be decided by a range of local concerns and anxieties, like crime, the economy and race, which no Presidential visit can easily allay, and Mr. Clinton cannot deliver much in the way of tangible government aid. On the other hand, the contest figures to be close enough that a day of stumping and money-raising with the President qualifies -- in the spirit of the diner -- as chicken soup: It can't hurt, and it might help.
The President's remarks themselves may carry some risk, simply because of the sensitivity of the topic.
Ken Frydman, a Giuliani spokesman, said the campaign would have no comment on the President's remarks. Earlier, Richard Bryers, a another Giuliani spokesman,, measured his words in assessing the visit.
 
'Politics as Usual'
 "It's good that the President has come into town to see the problems of New York and meet with the people of New York, because New York needs all the help it can get," he said. "But this is politics as usual and we offer a different approach to government that goes beyond partisan politics."
In his 1989 race against Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani himself relied on the fund-raising power of George Bush, who came to town and managed to embarrass him a bit by mangling the pronunciation of his name. Mr. Clinton missed no chance to let the Mayor bask in his reflected glow, at the end of a week in which the President introduced his proposed health-care changes and was riding a crest of publicity much more favorable than the daily crises that dogged him a few months ago.
For the Mayor, it was a day to reap the rewards he hoped for early in his term when he sought to play host to the 1992 Democratic Convention, despite the early skepticism of some party leaders, including Mr. Clinton, that the Democrats had no business coming to a place that was such a symbol of urban problems.
It was also a day calculated to fulfill the Mayor's passion for ceremony.
 
Lots to Talk About
 "I think it's the only way to travel," Mr. Dinkins said in an interview between events, noting that the two had talked both politics and government on the trip. "It was a most rewarding, refreshing time. He's terrific. He's certainly knowledgeable."

HEADLINE: Mayoral Agenda: A periodic report on post-election issues facing the winner. -- 1. The Budget;
New York City Candidates Agree: Reduce Spending but Hold Details

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
When the winner of New York City's mayoral race takes the oath of office on Jan. 1, he will face an immediate challenge: preventing a budget crisis.
That is the consensus among experts on the city's fiscal affairs, who say that without major changes, there will be shortfalls of at least $2 billion a year in the next three budgets. 
 Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his Republican-Liberal challenger, agree that bold innovations will be needed. Both are committed, in principle, to balancing the budget in the long term by cutting back the city's rapidly growing spending to match its recession-ravaged revenues.
But neither Mr. Dinkins nor Mr. Giuliani has shown much willingness, in the heat of the mayoral race, to discuss precisely how he would scale back city government -- which services to curtail, which jobs to eliminate and which agencies to put out of business.
The Mayor, pressed hard by members of the State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city budget, committed himself last May to a significant shrinking of the size of local government and to fundamental changes in how the city does business.
He appointed a panel of three former government officials to recommend ways to trim $2 billion a year from the city's $31 billion annual budget. The panel's reporting date: Dec. 1, a month after the election.
Mr. Giuliani has also promised sharp cuts, but in his public remarks and in a 40-page position paper has not specified which city services he would sacrifice or from which agencies he would eliminate jobs.
It will not be easy for either candidate to cut such a huge chunk from the budget, particularly after four years in which Mr. Dinkins has drastically reduced the number of workers in several agencies. His cuts have meant fewer pickups from wire trash baskets on city streets, reduced maintenance in the parks and, until recently, shorter hours in public libraries. A vivid measure of the challenge is that $2 billion represents the combined budgets of the departments of Health, Aging, Cultural Affairs, Sanitation, Parks and Fire.
Mr. Giuliani released his own fiscal plan last month. He proposed eliminating more than 30,000 city jobs, a reduction of about 15 percent from the current 211,140. That would leave the work force with about 180,000, or the level of 1983, before the boom of the mid-1980's that fueled a huge increase in the size of city government under the Koch administration.
Mr. Giuliani promised to increase productivity by demanding changes in work rules from municipal unions, and he said he would contract out to private companies some city services, including several of the 11 municipal hospitals.
 
Takeovers, but Few Details
 Mr. Giuliani also called for the state to take over some city agencies, including the departments of Mental Health and Consumer Affairs, which he says duplicate the work of state agencies. And he proposed phasing out four city taxes, including the commercial rent tax and the unincorporated business tax.
He said at first that he would exempt some departments from budget cuts, including Parks, Fire and Police, and agencies which, in his words, involved children.
He recently modified his position, saying he would not exempt any agencies, but would simply try to avoid further job cuts in departments that have already been hit hardest. It is not clear what Mr. Giuliani, who has campaigned as a strong anticrime candidate, would do about the Police Department, which has grown more than any other city agency under Mr. Dinkins.
"As a realistic campaign document, this is about as specific as anybody has ever gotten," Mr. Giuliani said.
But many fiscal experts, including some who praised the scale of Mr. Giuliani's proposals and his willingness to experiment with ideas like incentive pay and privatization, criticized his plan for lacking details.
Many questioned, too, whether his proposed tax cuts and job cuts would, in effect, offset one another, with few long-term savings. But Mr. Giuliani insisted that he could simultaneously cut taxes, reduce jobs and achieve long-term balance.
The mayor will actually confront two budget crises in January, one short-term and the other long-term.
 
Budget to Unbalance Soon
 The budget for the current fiscal year, which began in July, is likely to come unbalanced after Election Day on Nov. 2, virtually all experts say. That will cause whoever is mayor to scramble to find as much as several hundred million dollars in savings or reductions to offset some questionable anticipated revenues in the current budget, which was proposed by Mr. Dinkins in May and passed by the City Council in June.
But the far greater challenge, the fiscal experts say, is in the city's long-term budget problems. The administration will be forced to heavily reduce the size of the city government.
"The situation is horrible, and the next mayor will face horribleness," said Alair A. Townsend, a former deputy mayor and budget director. "It won't be fun, unless you have a high taste for drama and change."
Since the long, deep recession began in the city in 1989, slow increases in tax revenues have not kept up with sharp increases in spending. Indeed, the rise in spending for welfare and Medicaid was caused in large part by the recession itself. Even when the city finally emerges from the recession, economists predict that growth will be slow until the end of the decade, and the gap between spending and revenues will remain.
 
In Line With Economy
 The experts contend that the city must either increase taxes or reduce spending to achieve what they call structural balance, in which the size of local government reaches a stable long-term balance with the size of the local economy on which it rests. Neither the politicians nor the economists favor tax increases, however -- the politicians fear the wrath of voters, and the economists fear higher taxes would inhibit a recovery.
Mr. Dinkins has struggled each year to balance the budget. He raised taxes in his first two years, and then cut jobs sharply in his third year. He has often used short-term strategies, like non-recurring revenues.
"They have continually compromised the future in the effort to balance the budget in a given year," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board. "What they have backed off from is making the balancing of each year's budget contribute to long-term structural balance."
In his standard stump speech, Mr. Dinkins often takes credit for balancing the budget four years in a row. But critics note the law that requires him to keep the budget balanced or lose authority over the city's finances to the State Financial Control Board.
 
Giving Dinkins Credit
 Some fiscal experts give Mr. Dinkins considerable credit, because he has faced the worst recession in New York since the Depression.
Still, fundamental problems persist. Most experts said that the Mayor began to make major strides two years ago against the structural imbalance. He pledged to eliminate more than 20,000 jobs and vowed to grant no new raises to city workers unless they were financed through productivity measures.
But the Mayor did not meet his goals, the experts say. Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said he "just backed down, in the face of the political obstacles and the service consequences of doing it."
One disappointment, Mr. Horton and other fiscal monitors say, was the Mayor's revision of his goals on job cuts. About 14,000 jobs are gone from the peak of 225,300 in November 1990, but most of the reductions took place by November 1991.
 
Cuts Called Not Enough
 The net reduction in city jobs since Mr. Dinkins took office in January 1990 is about 10,000 jobs, or about 5 percent. But the Mayor and his senior aides often note that they trimmed the overall work force while greatly expanding the Police Department and adding many new teachers.
Mr. Dinkins has promised to cut 8,000 more jobs by 1996. But Mr. Horton and many others say greater reductions are needed.
Another disappointment, most experts say, was the 39-month contract settlement last January with 19 municipal unions. The contract called for a total raise of 8.25 percent, which the fiscal experts applauded as modest. But it did not include any efficiency measures. Separate negotiations were to produce six work-rule changes by last June, but the talks are bogged down, city officials say.
"The city and the unions have not been able to produce the savings to pay for the contracts," said Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, who endorsed Mr. Dinkins last spring and who announced recently that he planned to step down.
 
Need for Incentives
 Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor, said the critics did not understand that it takes time to change work rules, even in private industry, and that incentives must be offered to gain labor's assent. "You can't do it through confrontation," he said.
He also said that Mr. Dinkins had done much to re-organize government. Mr. Steisel cited a thorough revision of the Probation Department, the consolidation of a half-dozen economic development agencies, experiments in managed care for Medicaid patients and the creation of new city primary-care health clinics.
Mr. Steisel added that the state failed to keep a major promise: a takeover of the crushing local costs of Medicaid, more than $2.3 billion a year. That proposal remains mired in the State Legislature.
Mr. Dinkins has left the tough budget plans for the future to his panel -- Donald D. Kummerfeld, a former Deputy Mayor and Budget Director; William H. Gray 3d, the former Congressman from Pennsylvania who was chairman of the House Budget Committee; and Dall W. Forsythe, former state Budget Director.
He insists that the panel's reporting date, Dec. 1, was not dictated by a desire to avoid scrutiny before the election. He said their report would be part of the city's four-year financial plan, which is due in January.
"I'm not hiding anything," the Mayor said in an interview. "But there is no compulsion to tell people when we have not completed the analysis yet. It would be irresponsible."
Mr. Giuliani has argued that the Mayor was just trying to avoid addressing potentially unpopular ideas before the election. "There doesn't seem to be any attempt to say to the public what they are going to do over the next four years," he said in an interview.
Mr. Dinkins has shown a similar disdain for Mr. Giuliani's fiscal proposals, often arguing that Mr. Giuliani's numbers do not add up. If Mr. Giuliani were to cut more than 30,000 jobs by attrition, and also exempted many agencies, then he would have to gut essential services like meals for the elderly, the Mayor argues.
In response, Mr. Giuliani said he would try to avoid job cuts in the Parks and Fire departments, but that few agencies would be exempt. He acknowledged that the job cuts he proposed "can't be done without pain."
Mr. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission, who for years has advocated many of the ideas now proposed by Mr. Giuliani, praised him for promising "that he would take a pretty big bite of the apple."
"The problem is that there was not enough detail," Mr. Horton said.
Which, some acknowledge, should come as no surprise. Said Mr. Rohatyn: "In an election year, it's unreasonable to expect either candidate to put down the ultimate in pain that he expects to impose on the citizens of the city over the next four years."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Coffee and Clinton: A Hard Sell on the Health Plan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Framed by boxes of breakfast cereal and refrigerated pies, President Clinton took a seat at the counter of a Queens diner yesterday and, like a neighborhood insurance agent trying to sign up his friends, listened to the customers' woes and tried to convince them that the one-size-fits-all Clinton health plan would meet their needs.
"What's your deductible?" the President asked Mark Fish, a diner in a booth a few feet from Mr. Clinton's counter stool. 
 "It's $1,000, spread out over two years," said Mr. Fish, who added that his family policy cost $8,500 a year.
The President pointed to a woman down the counter, who minutes earlier had said she was paying $12,747 a year for her and her son's health insurance coverage, "Your problem is similar to hers," he said, "since you are both self-employed and you both have family coverage for one child."
 
'Would Make a Big Difference'
 Then, like an insurance agent moving in for the sell, the President told them both about his plan: "Let me tell you, now, I've hesitated to say this in the past, but I think I can say roughly that a family package which would be the same price starting out for everybody, whether they were self-employed or not, would be about at least $4,000 cheaper than you're paying.
"In addition to that," added the salesman-in-chief, sensing he was about to close a deal, "if you're self-employed, today, as you know, your policy is only 25 percent deductible. Under our plan it would be 100 percent deductible for both you and your wife, which would make a big difference."
The other diners, sipping coffee and munching on rolls, all nodded in assent, but then the President was preaching to the converted. The 50 or so local residents packed into booths and along the counter of the Future Diner, on 190th Street off Utopia Parkway in Fresh Meadows, in Queens, had all been selected by the White House because they had written the President or his wife, Hillary, and urged health care measures to deal with their particular needs.
Mr. Clinton, in New York to attend a fund-raising event for Mayor David N. Dinkins last night and address the United Nations today, heard stories that had him and other participants teary eyed. Minutes after he left the diner, one woman, who had told the President of her troubles getting insurance as a kidney transplant patient, had a seizure and had to be rushed away by ambulance. She was released after treatment at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, officials there said.
The woman, Mary Jane Van Wick, had just told Mr. Clinton that she had no medical coverage other than Medicare, that she needed up to $1,000 a month in drugs to prevent rejection of her new kidney and that she had had to retire early to keep her Medicare eligibility. If she went back to work, she said, insurers would not cover her pre-existing illness, "so I have to stay at a poverty level with no insurance and keep my fingers crossed."
Mr. Clinton turned to the other people in the diner, and the bank of cameras packed in behind them, and said: "Now, there are literally tens of thousands, maybe more, people like Mary Jane in this country who can get health care only if they're on public assistance. Just think about that. This will also be fixed if you have universal coverage that moves from employment to unemployment to employment again, and which includes families as well as individual workers."
 
'Help People Like Me'
 Jean Townsend, who worked 20 years at Kennedy International Airport, read to the President her letter, which explained that as a result of the slowdown in the airline industry her working hours were reduced to part time and that as a result she lost her health insurance.
"Please help people like me get low-cost health care," Mrs. Townsend said. "I raised four children and have worked hard all my life. I don't want charity but I should be able to see a doctor when I am sick."
Mr. Clinton told her: "Under our plan, even part-time workers would be covered. But we would split the difference, so that if you're a part-time worker, your employer and the employee would have the responsibility of only paying a pro-rata share of what the premium would be. And the Government would pick up the rest as they do for unemployed people."
This approach, Mr. Clinton said, "would remove the incentive to hire part-time workers solely to avoid the health care costs."
Susan Berardo told the President of having suffered from metastatic breast cancer and requiring a bone marrow transplant. When she asked her insurer to pay, she said, the insurer said it did not cover that procedure. She said she was advised by her hospital to sue her insurer, which she did, settling out of court.
"I personally do not think that anyone fighting for their life should have to fight their health care system," Mrs. Berardo said.
Mr. Clinton used her case to highlight one of the bigger, but lesser known, problems with the current system: insurance policies cover certain illnesses, but they do not promise to pay for every procedure to cure them.
Under the current system, Mr. Clinton said, any insurer can say, "Well, if we think something is experimental, we don't have to let you do it." Under his plan, the President said, there would be less incentive for insurance companies to do that, because costs would be spread out in larger insurance pools.
As much as the people in the Future Diner seemed sold on the President's prescription, it almost sounded too good to be true. It was left to one unidentified customer to ask the question that seemed on the minds of many there, and in Congress, who are dubious about Mr. Clinton's assertion that health costs can be lowered and his plan financed largely by eliminating waste and stimulating competition.
Almost mocking Mr. Clinton's numbers, the woman said: "So once the hospitals see that they're getting covered by everybody, they're going to say, 'Oh, great, let's reduce costs because we're making enough profit?'
"I mean, will they? I've lived in this country 42 years, and I don't see things come down."

HEADLINE: United Nations Is Finding Its Plate Increasingly Full but Its Cupboard Is Bare

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The lights are going out early at the United Nations as this year's General Assembly gets under way.
Despite having 80,000 peacekeepers in the field and despite the brave predictions of a United Nations renaissance in the post-cold-war world, the organization is on the brink of bankruptcy and is torn by self-doubt. 
 To save money on overtime costs, the United Nations is requiring heads of state and foreign ministers to end their speeches promptly at 6 P.M. because many services are shut down at that hour. Each delegation is restricted to just two copies of official documents.
Only a $194 million peacekeeping payment by Japan last week enabled the United Nations to meet this month's payroll. But budget officials, frantically juggling funds between accounts to meet their most pressing bills, do not know where they will get money for paychecks for the next three months, until next year's contributions start coming in.
 
Members Won't Pay
 Despite ritualistic pledges of support for the ideals and goals of the United Nations Charter, member governments are reluctant to pay its bills.
Whatever pledges of support President Clinton might offer in his speech to the General Assembly on Monday, the fact remains that the United States will owe the United Nations $1 billion in peacekeeping and regular budget dues by the end of this month. That is half the total owed to the United Nations.
The penny-pinching reflects a deeper malaise. The international climate may seem more favorable to global governance than at any time in the past half century, but the United Nations is not yet looking like the world authority it hopes to be. In Bosnia, Somalia, Angola and other places, it seems in danger of falling down on the job.
Disillusionment has been building all summer. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has warned repeatedly that the organization is being asked to take on more than it can handle.
"Our renaissance remains in question," he said in a recent interview. "Demands made upon the United Nations are not being matched by resources to do the job."
Complaints about chaotic, ineffective and corrupt management abound. In June, Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative, accused the United Nations of sending "ill-equipped and often unprepared troops" into peacekeeping missions and attacked its "Byzantine and drawn-out budgetary decision-making process." Last week she said that if the United Nations had been charged with containing Communism, the Berlin wall would still be standing.
Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, nominated as the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, last week criticized the United Nations' efforts in Somalia, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee that "this operation does not have a clear articulation of its political and economic goals."
But as problems continue in peacekeeping operations and the money runs low, accusations of corruption and inefficiency are again swirling around the organization's top-heavy bureaucracy, which cannot even publish an up-to-date telephone directory.
After complaints from the United States and other countries, the United Nations is investigating accusations of corruption and embezzlement involving the $3.4 billion it is spending on peacekeeping this year. The accusations include charges that lucrative transport contracts were awarded unfairly and complaints of missing vehicles and supplies.
 
Peacekeepers Accused
 In Bosnia and Herzegovina, peacekeepers have been accused of selling fuel and food on the black market and of running prostitution rings. Last year, the commander of a Ukrainian battalion there was sent home after being presented with a white Mercedes by local Serbian leaders.
In a report on the United Nations bureaucracy issued before he stepped down as the United Nations' top management official earlier this year, former United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh acknowledged that "duplication is widespread, coordination is often minimal, bureaucratic battles aimed at monopolizing a particular subject are rife and organizational objectives are sometimes in conflict."
Shortly after taking over as Secretary General last year, Mr. Boutros-Ghali slashed the number of departments and seemed ready to make staff cuts. But a rebellion within the ranks forced him to back down.
Most important of all, the United Nations finds itself being criticized for some of its peacekeeping operations, traditionally the most visible and successful of its activities.
After notable successes in Central America, Namibia and most recently Cambodia, the United Nations has failed to prevent Bosnia, a member state, from being dismembered by force, despite innumerable Security Council resolutions calling for the reversal of "ethnic cleansing" and return of conquered lands.
In Somalia, controversy surrounds the United Nations' efforts to impose order on Mogadishu as casualties mount and the national contingents of peacekeepers bicker. Meanwhile, its success in ending starvation and restoring a semblance of normality to the rest of the country goes largely unnoticed. Elsewhere in Africa, an ill-conceived Angolan peace plan has collapsed into renewed civil war.
But it is not only in the political field that the United Nations is having difficulty living up to opportunities created by the end of the cold war.
The organization is now caring for 14 million refugees and delivering huge amounts of aid to those left destitute by famine or conflict. And a new department to coordinate its mushrooming relief activities has been created.
But a Scandinavian-led attempt to streamline the economic and social side was blocked by the developing countries last summer. And the General Assembly is likely to see equally strong third world resistance to the Clinton Administration's plan for a new human rights high commissioner, for fear the investigations would infringe on governments' sovereignty.
 
Dual Crises
 For Mr. Boutros-Ghali, the organization is in the grip of two simultaneous and self-reinforcing crises, one financial and the other military.
Lack of money constrains the United Nations ability to take on new responsibilities, especially in peacekeeping. As a result, he says, he is quite happy to see NATO take control of any force sent to carry out a peace plan in Bosnia. "We don't have the personnel or expertise to manage another 50,000 troops," he said recently.
The military crisis he defines as the unwillingness of public opinion to let the United Nations use military might to enforce peace and reverse aggression under the provisions of its Charter.
Member countries have also given the Secretary General little support in his efforts to strengthen peacemaking by giving the United Nations the kind of permanent enforcement ability the Charter foresees.
In "Agenda for Peace," the blueprint for United Nations reform that he issued last year, the Secretary General suggested creating heavily armed "peace enforcement units" and he asked members to assign armed forces for Security Council missions and to give the United Nations the means to command such forces by activating a Military Staff Committee. One result would have been to equip the United Nations with a kind of standby army.
But his suggestions have fallen on deaf ears.
The Clinton Administration is no exception. As a candidate, Mr. Clinton appeared to support giving the United Nations a "rapid deployment force," which could be called up from units of national armed forces earmarked and trained in advance.
Its duties, he suggested, could include "standing guard at the borders of countries threatened by aggression, preventing mass violence against civilian populations, providing humanitarian relief and combating terrorism."
Now under pressure from a skeptical Congress and doubters within its ranks, the Administration appears to be backing away from its original commitment. A draft Presidential directive that would have committed the United States to provide troops for peacekeeping operations under foreign commanders is still being revised as the Administration seeks to place limits and conditions on its commitment to multilateralism.
As he surveys his dominion, the 71-year-old Secretary General seems at once besieged and combative.
 
Hard Cash, on Time
 A third of the way through his five-year mandate, his talk these days is incessantly of money and the need for members to back the organization they say they believe in with hard cash, on time.
"Money, money, money -- that is the prerequisite for the United Nations playing the role it could play after the Cold War," he said.
Despite all the criticism and setbacks, he says that he is still determined to turn the United Nations sometimes creaking machinery into "the instrument for dealing with all the world's post-cold-war problems, the problems of ethnic conflict, of the environment, of poverty and development."
But to do this, he stressed, he needs "the support of member governments." And sometimes, he adds, "they seem reluctant."

HEADLINE: North Korea Won't Budge on Nuclear Stance

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Six months after Washington broke decades of cold-war silence with North Korea and opened talks, American, Japanese and South Korean officials say there is no evidence that the reclusive Government is backing away from its nuclear weapons project or that it will allow international inspectors into its most secret installations.
No one knows if the Government in Pyongyang has been able to use the time to further its bomb development, or whether such efforts have slowed under international pressure and a lack of technology. American negotiators insist that the talks have not been a failure, largely because they dissuaded North Korea from pulling out of the international treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. 
 But in the last week, Asian leaders have suggested that the situation is once again veering toward confrontation. In the last six months, international inspectors have gotten no closer to two secret sites near Yongbyon that may reveal how much bomb-grade plutonium North Korea has, and no one knows how close the North is to producing weapons.
 
Sanctions Are Predicted
 South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, told a Japanese newspaper that now he thought North Korea had enough material to make three bombs. "If the nuclear dispute remains unsettled, international sanctions against North Korea will be unavoidable," he said.
Japan's Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, told American reporters on Friday that North Korea's development of a missile that could hit virtually anywhere in the Japanese archipelago was "a threat to our country."
"When a missile is launched in North Korea, it will reach Japan in eight minutes," Mr. Hosokawa said, explaining why building a new anti-missile defense capability "is a matter of great interest to us." The United States has proposed joint work on such a defensive shield, although it would take years to build.
Curiously, after months of refraining from comment, the North Koreans themselves tacitly confirmed on Friday that they test-fired the new missile, the Rodong 1, over the Sea of Japan three months ago. In a statement carried by the state-controlled North Korean News Agency, a Foreign Ministry spokesman accused Japan of starting a campaign against his country in response to "a normal missile drill."
 
An Issue of Sovereignty
 "It is only too natural for us to increase our defense capabilities when the enemies' moves to isolate and stifle our Republic are intensifying, and Japan herself is joining force with them," the spokesman said. He said the missile test was "entirely a matter pertaining to our sovereignty."
Frustrated by the impasse on inspections and concerned that North Korea might be using the time to finish its weapons project, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that it would refer the issue to its governing board on Monday. The decision was widely interpreted as a signal that the agency is once again thinking about recommending sanctions.
A third round of talks between North Korea and the United States, which was supposed to have taken place this month, was indefinitely suspended a week ago after American officials said North Korea had made no progress on steps agreed upon in July. Among them was the renewal of discussions with South Korea on beginning mutual inspections of each other's nuclear sites, a step that was accepted in principle more than two years ago.
The Clinton Administration seems likely to face a particularly vexing question in the next several weeks: whether to continue negotiations or to resume the movement in United Nations toward economic sanctions against North Korea, which were halted to give the talks with the United States a chance.
 
Incentives From the U.S.
 The talks themselves were a change: For decades Washington refused to deal directly with North Korea, saying the Government of Kim Il Sung, now 81, was simply trying to drive a wedge between the United States and its ally South Korea. That policy was reversed after an announcement on March 15 that the North was preparing to exit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
The Clinton Administration's strategy has since been to engage North Korea in a dialogue that would end the country's isolation, dangling incentives of investment and aid if it reversed course on its nuclear weapons project. Failing that, the talks are a way of showing the world -- especially China -- that every reasonable effort at quiet persuasion has been exhausted in case sanctions are necessary.
"I don't think anyone really wants to go the U.N. because the North would react so strongly," one Japanese official familiar with the talks said.
American negotiators say the North Korean Government, already reported to be under pressure from food shortages and an industrial base that is literally running out of oil, seems to be facing difficult choices of its own.
"If they give the project up, they feel they have no card," said one official familiar with the talks. "If they hold on, they face total pressure, and a Security Council action."
Moreover, support for Pyongyang has been fading fast, confronting North Korea with the possibility that it is about to lose its last Asian ally, China.
But critics of Washington's approach say North Korea has gained time, both to work on developing its first operable weapons and to test the Rodong 1, which the Central Intelligence Agency suspects will soon be sold to Iran.
Some experts argue that the North Korean Government sees nuclear weapons as an insurance policy for an orderly transfer of power to Mr. Kim's son, 51-year old son, Kim Jong Il. None of the major powers surrounding North Korea would like to see such weapons under uncertain control during a struggle for leadership.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Set To Propose Health Plans

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
In the fourth major policy statement in a week, Mayor David N. Dinkins plans to announce a series of health-care initiatives today that range from expanding the number of neighborhood health centers to providing scholarships to medical students who agree to serve patients with AIDS after graduation.
Mr. Dinkins's health proposals are the latest in a series of policy statements intended to seize the attention of the public in an election season in which the Mayor has been plagued by bad news. The health proposals are also intended to counter the claims of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal mayoral candidate, that the Dinkins administration is without leadership on a number of fronts. Mr. Giuliani has faulted the Mayor in recent weeks for the city's management of public hospitals, some of which he said should be privatized. 
 In a speech scheduled for this afternoon at the Elmhurst Hospital Community Center in Queens, Mr. Dinkins will announce plans to increase the number of Communicare family health centers from the current 13 to 50 within four years. He will also announce the construction of a new Emergency Medical Services Center, expected to be completed by 1997, and the purchase of 200 new ambulances in the next four years.
Both Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani have been offering major policy statements and proposals in the last few weeks, but Mr. Dinkins has been especially prolific. Last Monday, the Mayor unveiled a series of proposals aimed at curbing crime. The next day, he delivered an address on ways to stimulate the city's economy. On Thursday, he offered several proposals on improving the city's schools.
As in the other policy speeches, many of the initiatives Mr. Dinkins plans to announce are either enhancements of proposals announced earlier or ideas that have been presented in previous speeches. For example, his plan to create a network of clinical health services was included in an earlier proposal for the consolidation of the city's clinical health services under the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
Cesar A. Perales, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services, defended the presentation of the report, saying that it offered a substantive look at the Mayor's overall vision for health care in New York.
"It's part of a strategy to lay out the Mayor's plan for the next four years," Mr. Perales said. "Obviously we are in an election, and the people want to know what the candidates are offering for the future."
Cristyne Lategano, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, said the Mayor has "presided over more hospitals losing their accreditation and more that face the risk of losing their accreditation than any other Mayor." She added that the proposals offered by the Mayor "can only be seen as a joke."
On the scholarship program for medical students, Mr. Perales said that the plan would involve about $7 million in Federal money and that a year of service would be required for every year a medical student received a scholarship.
In other proposals, Mr. Dinkins plans to announce the establishment of a $60 million venture capital fund that would provide money for companies to develop advanced medical technologies. The fund would be registered as a small business investment corporation and financed with $10 million in city funds, $10 million from corporations and $40 million from the Federal Small Business Administration.

HEADLINE: Farm Subsidies Still Threaten GATT Talks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
After seven years of negotiations, world trade talks are falling apart this autumn, which could hurt the world economy, damage confidence in the financial markets and provoke a crisis in the European Community.
President Clinton and leaders of the world's other large industrial democracies contended in Tokyo in July that the talks were back on track, after their trade ministers agreed to lower tariffs on many manufactured goods. But with less than three months until President Clinton's special negotiating authority effectively expires, the talks have slowed to a crawl because of renewed squabbling over farm subsidies. 
 France is trying to undo a deal to limit the subsidies. The French say the deal, reached in November by the Bush Administration and the European Community, may hurt French grain farmers. Administration officials refuse to renegotiate the deal, while Congressional Democrats and Republicans agree that the deal is doomed if the United States budges.
The French are trying to keep sections of the November deal that helped them, and renegotiate the rest. "We order bouillabaisse, and they're trying to serve it without the seafood," said Carol L. Brookins, an agriculture consultant here, referring to the French seafood stew.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's top trade official, will try to resolve the farm subsidy dispute in talks here on Monday with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. But trade officials are pessimistic.
"It's very difficult to conclude there is going to be an immediate conclusion," said Peter Sutherland, the Director General of the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT, a body of 116 nations, sets rules for international commerce.
To be sure, a crisis can sometimes break a deadlock in trade talks. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France took a less confrontational stand than usual today when he told members of Parliament, "We don't want a crisis, either in Europe or in international trade."
But a senior Administration official and a European official said this weekend that Mr. Kantor and Sir Leon were likely to emerge with optimistic words but little change.
The current round of world trade talks, which began in Uruguay on Sept. 20, 1986, is aimed at lowering tariffs and at applying GATT's free-trade rules to agriculture and to services like insurance and shipping. A deadline of Dec. 15 has been accepted by all member governments for completion of the Uruguay Round.
The rapid deterioration in the talks has grabbed headlines across Asia and Europe but not in the United States, where the public and politicians remain preoccupied with another trade issue, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Yet the consensus of economists is that the world trade talks are much more important than the North American pact in stimulating growth in the global economy and halting an international slide into protectionism.
Ross Perot has warned repeatedly that factories employing six million Americans could move to Mexico if the North American accord is approved by Congress this fall. Mr. Sutherland one-upped Mr. Perot during appearances here and in New York on Thursday and Friday, saying repeatedly that seven million American jobs in export industries would be at risk unless a global trade deal is quickly concluded.
Gene M. Grossman, a professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University, said, "The GATT is much more important to the U.S. because we don't trade that much with Mexico and because our existing barriers with Mexico aren't that high."
 
Political View Differs
 But politicians take a different view, reflecting public worries about the more easily understood consequence of possible American job losses to low-wage Mexican workers. "The issue in Nafta is how we see ourselves as a country; whether we want to do business abroad," said Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the Commerce Committee. "My own view is the Uruguay Round is not a matter of that great importance."
But the fate of the world trade talks has become increasingly intertwined with the North American Free Trade Agreement. One fear expressed by Mr. Sutherland and other international trade officials is that the Clinton Administration may try to persuade members of Congress to vote for the North American pact in exchange for avoiding concessions in the world trade talks that would expose companies in their districts to more international competition. Such deals could jeopardize the talks by limiting the flexibility of negotiators.
It is unclear what will happen in the world trade talks if the Dec. 15 deadline passes without a deal. Several previous deadlines have been missed, and the special Presidential authority for trade negotiations has been extended three times, in 1988, 1991 and this year. Yet more members of Congress have been urging that potentially trade-restricting legislation be attached to any further renewals, a step that could hurt trade relations with American allies.
 
France's Move to Renegotiate
 The current crisis in the world trade talks reflects a renewed effort by France to renegotiate part of the Blair House agreement on farm subsidies, named for the White House's guest quarters where the accord was concluded in November.
Blair House really involved two agreements. In the first, the European Community effectively froze subsidized soybean production at current levels while the Bush Administration withdrew a threat to impose 200 percent tariffs on European white wines. In the other, the United States and Europe agreed that the final Uruguay Round text should require countries to reduce their tonnage of subsidized grain exports by 21 percent.
The soybean agreement imposed little if any reduction on Europe's soybean production. But the Europeans had offered only an 18 percent cut in subsidized grain exports. So the 21 percent cut in the Blair House grain deal represented a concession.
France and other European Community nations endorsed the soybean deal last spring. But France is now trying to cancel the concession on subsidized grain.
French officials contend that they are not breaking an agreement because the common American-European position on subsidized grain exports does not become final until the Uruguay Round is completed.
The French demands have threatened a crisis in the European Community, whose rules clearly assign responsibility for trade negotiations to Sir Leon and the rest of the community's executive commission. Yet Paris has, in effect, refused to accept the results of these negotiations.
 
Compromises Possible
 International trade officials have been looking at a few possible compromises, like a deal on agricultural tariffs and quotas, which the Blair House pact did not address. The senior Administration official, who insisted on anonymity, said today that the United States might accept lower tariffs on processed foods, which would help European farm exporters as well as some American farmers.
European officials privately accuse the Clinton Administration of retreating from past American stands. For instance, Administration officials have called for changes in the so-called Dunkel draft, a proposed final Uruguay Round text set forth in December 1991 by Arthur Dunkel, who was Mr. Sutherland's predecessor as Director General of GATT. The Bush Administration never officially accepted the Dunkel draft, but did not criticize it.
In an interview Friday, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown rejected equating French efforts to change Blair House to the American move to revise the Dunkel draft. "On Blair House there was a concurrence, consensus," he said. "Folks sat around and negotiated something, and completed those negotiations. The Dunkel text was a text written by a person, that was then laid on the table. So they're not comparable."

HEADLINE: New York City Considers Exporting Trash

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
For the first time, New York City is looking to ship some of its household garbage to other states.
With the city's only landfill, Fresh Kills on Staten Island, filling up, and with plans to build incinerators and expand recycling moving slowly, sanitation officials are considering exporting some of the 14,000 tons of garbage produced each day by households and institutions. 
 The city hopes to take advantage of an unexpected decline in fees at out-of-state landfills and incinerators, officials say. Emily Lloyd, the Sanitation Commissioner, said in an interview that the city has learned "anecdotally" of a possible surplus capacity for trash at incinerators and landfills around the country.
But the city's search for places to send its trash will run against another trend, a growing fear of imported trash in communities around the country, and the threat of national legislation that would let states close their borders to trash.
 
Landfill Fees Falling
 The phenomenon that the city is trying to capitalize on is that tipping fees charged by landfills per cubic yard of trash have declined recently, some industry experts say, although the reasons for and likely duration of the trend are not completely clear.
James E. Kundell, a landfill expert and professor of environmental policy at the University of Georgia's Vinson Institute of Government, said that landfills are "going through a transition period" because of changes in Federal regulations. Many will be forced to close, he said, and the result has been the equivalent of a going-out-of-business sale as operators try to fill their landfills before closing them.
Some newly established private landfills have opened bidding wars, he said. Meanwhile, the volume of trash from households and businesses has fallen because of the recession, a slowdown in industrial activity and the growth of recycling.
An abstrusely worded two-sentence notice scheduled to appear next week in the city's official publication, the City Record, invites trash haulers and the operators of landfills and incinerators to an informational meeting on Oct. 19. Although the purpose is for the private companies to give the city information, not the other way around, Ms. Lloyd said that she hopes to solicit bids formally by the end of the year.
"We want to have a well-informed discussion of what the options are," said Ms. Lloyd in an interview on Friday. Trash could be shipped by train anywhere in the continental United States, she said.
New York City is looking for alternatives to disposing of its waste as Fresh Kills nears capacity and officials continue to have problems building incinerators and increasing recycling. Since 1960, the city has closed 11 landfills and 7 incinerators.
 
Would It Be Economical?
 An important issue is whether shipping garbage elsewhere would be economical. New York City pays between $15 and $20 to bury a cubic yard of trash at Fresh Kills, and until December 1988 it charged $18.50 to any business that wanted to dump there. But then it decided that beyond the cash outlay, the space itself had value, because it is irreplaceable, and it raised the fee for private haulers to $40, which drove nearly all of them to private landfills.
If the Sanitation Department has options to ship its trash outside the five boroughs, it would have to consider whether the increased operating costs are worth it to save capacity at Fresh Kills.
In the short term, the Sanitation Department faces a logistical problem beginning in the second half of 1995, when it plans to close a marine transfer station at Hunts Point in the Bronx for a three- to five-year rebuilding project. Each day, Bronx homes and institutions generate about 1,700 tons of trash, which is now loaded onto barges at Hunts Point and shipped to Staten Island.
Without the transfer station, the city could send garbage trucks to transfer stations in Queens and Manhattan. But from the Bronx, the only borough on the mainland and the only one with adequate freight rail service, it could also export the waste over land.
 
Minefield of Opposition
 In discussing a change in how trash is handled, officials are tiptoeing through a minefield laid by two sides: unionized city workers and private haulers. Both sides fear any effort that would upset the current system, in which private haulers take commercial trash and city workers take everything else. But Ms. Lloyd said that if there were any job losses at Fresh Kills or in the medium-sized navy of barges that the city maintains to move garbage around, they would be through attrition.
A major question for the city is whether it can depend on outside landfills over the long term. As Ms. Lloyd put it, "we cannot become too dependent on the kindness of strangers." The city will look for long-term contracts, she said, meaning 15 or 20 years at least, but Congress could pass a law that would allow states to annul such contracts.
Local governments and environmentalists already have an informal veto on trash imports in many cases, said Edward W. Repa, the director of technical and research programs at the National Solid Wastes Management Association, a trade association in Washington.
Mr. Repa said that it was not unusual for cities to export their household trash.
"Usually when you do those contracts," he said, "You do them in areas where they have the backing of the local community."
 
Community Backing Crucial
 Ms. Lloyd said the support of the community getting the trash would be a precondition of any contract. Some communities find that the taxes and jobs generated by operating landfills make importing trash desirable.
Environmentalists in New York might also object, although Eric Goldtstein, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that "it's probably a sound interim step as New York makes the transition to primarily relying on recycling and waste reduction."
"If it's done strategically, with willing recipients, it could make short-term sense," he said. "But it's certainly not the ultimate answer."

Seeing Today's Dreams Against Political Reality

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"WHEN people say dreams don't come true, tell them about Rudy."
Rudy who? That advertising slogan is promoting a new film, not a candidate for mayor. But the advertisement conjures up nostalgic Horatio Alger-type images of a young man who succeeded against the odds -- images that often seem to represent the underpinnings of Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoral campaign. For many New Yorkers, today's dreams seem to be less about what could be than about what might have been. 
 "Make it like it was," an anxious elderly woman once pleaded as she accosted Edward I. Koch on a Brooklyn boardwalk. Mr. Koch reassured her as best he could. But he later acknowledged privately that "it" never was as good as the woman remembered. Only that so much, for many people, seems to have gotten worse. Or, so different.
Belying rosy recollections, the proportion of poor elderly people is smaller today than a generation or two ago as a consequence of Social Security and, later, of tying benefit levels to the cost of living.
"The time is coming," New York City's Welfare Department declared hopefully in 1940, "when medical service will be regarded as a public utility which should be available to everyone regardless of his financial position." President Clinton's health care proposals (not coincidentally, he lobbied for them yesterday in a virtuoso performance at the Future diner in Queens) may finally deliver on that promise.
Still, factors like the recession, broader eligibility rules for public assistance, and deep-seated poverty that costs money to cure have conspired to make for a poorer city than the one Mr. Giuliani left for Long Island when he was 7 years old (and was stoically raised as a Yankee fan, an even greater burden in Brooklyn when the team was winning pennants).
Last month, the number of New Yorkers receiving public assistance reached the highest level since the Depression. More New Yorkers are receiving food stamps -- more than 1.3 million -- than ever before. And the number collecting public assistance (1,096,669) and Supplemental Security Income (324,909) last month was higher than in any year since 1936 when the comparable total was an average of only 7,448 more.
Last spring, when Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan evoked the seemingly simple New York of 1943, when two-parent families were not the exception and when a mere 44 people were killed by gunfire, David N. Dinkins irately reminded the Senator that 50 years ago was not the good old days for everybody. Blacks were still relegated to the back of buses in America and even a diligent young black man, like Mr. Dinkins, harbored no hope of becoming Mayor of New York.
Crime, by many measures, is also worse than when Mr. Giuliani left. Reports of some crimes have registered a statistical decrease and the city's police force is growing again. But the proliferation of guns and crack and the seeming decriminalization -- by police policy or by public acquiescence -- of whole categories of antisocial behavior may have rendered some of society's gains against crime illusory. That was one largely untold story buried in the state report on the Crown Heights violence.
During this year's mayoral campaign, overtime pay has been authorized "to immediately deploy as many police officers as possible in high-visibility assignments to ensure that the public is aware that their 'Safe Streets, Safe City' tax dollars have been put to good use."
On the eve of today's Mollen Commission hearings into police corruption, though, the police whistle-blower David Durk complains that cynicism is the worst corruption hazard -- cynicism fostered by a policy to maximize "visible presence" coupled with what he says have been unwritten orders to minimize arrests that would take officers away from their assigned posts.
The Dinkins campaign has accused Mr. Giuliani of "manipulating nostalgia." But, besides being different today, some aspects of life in the city are indisputably worse. Neither Mr. Dinkins nor Mr. Giuliani has demonstrated concern as effectively as Mr. Clinton did yesterday in a forum that was stunning in its simplicity. Ordinary people aired their average problems and a public official responded with compassion and in detail. Mr. Dinkins has tried to respond, but his agenda has been by curtailed by the recession. Mr. Giuliani is just generating a detailed agenda of his own.
Measured by demographics, Mr. Dinkins, who is black, represents the city's future as the proportion of non-Hispanic white people declines. Measured by political experience, Mr. Giuliani, who has never held elective office, is more emblematic of change. His challenge is still to prove that, this time, the change will be for the better.
"Coming in with a clean slate has the advantage over the incumbent of the absence of status quo," says Felix G. Rohatyn, the retiring (but not shy) chairman of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation. "But in order to be credible, you have to show you have the people and the sophistication, and that you can pursue your ideas in the context of political reality and history."
Dreams came true for "Rudy" in the film version, which is based on a true story. Defying predictions, he finally achieves his goal of playing for Notre Dame -- even if only for two plays in the season's final game. He sacks the Georgia Tech quarterback. Today, he sells real estate in South Bend. In other words, dreams alone -- either of what was, what might have been or what might be -- are not enough.

HEADLINE: Ford Sets Its Sights on a 'World Car'

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENK, Belgium

 BODY:
With their sleek contours and high-tech features, the cars rolling off the production line at the Ford plant here would never be mistaken for a Model T.
Yet they represent the most ambitious effort so far by the American auto industry to accomplish what Japanese auto makers -- and Volkswagen with the Beetle -- have done in the decades since the Ford Motor Company's Model T epitomized mass production: design a car that can be built and sold in pretty much the same form all over the world. 
 It is an expensive and risky effort for Ford, both in Europe and in the United States, where despite improving sales, the industry's overall performance remains lackluster. Ford has spent $6 billion developing the car, which is already on sale in Europe and parts of Asia as the Ford Mondeo and will be introduced in America next summer as the Ford Contour and the Mercury Mystique.
 
 
Savings of 25 Percent
 The investment is one of the biggest new-car investments ever. But Ford said it saved 25 percent over the more traditional way of developing new cars separately for the North American and European markets.
Just as important, by going for a single global design, Ford was able to justify spending on new technology and features, like better suspension and handling, that would make the car more competitive, company executives said.
"We could afford to invest far more in a product which would have sales in excess of 700,000 units globally than to invest in a product with a 300,000-unit potential in a single market," said William H. Fike, the president of Ford of Europe, referring to the annual sales targets for the new car.
So far, the car has received glowing reviews from the European automotive press, and sales are relatively strong in key Ford markets like Britain and Spain, despite a severe industrywide slump.
 
 
'Very Economical'
 "I like everything about the car," said Yolanda Rehuaz, a 23-year-old student from Madrid who recently purchased a Mondeo. "It is very economical, comfortable and smooth."
The program's ultimate success, however, will not be known until the car goes on sale in America, where it will replace the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz compacts, but with a higher sticker price, probably starting in the range of $16,000 to $17,000.
The program has already had to compromise some of its initial aims, most notably by restyling the body of the North American version to satisfy consumer tastes that are different from those in Europe, where the primary design and engineering work was done.
But Ford executives said that even if the European version looks somewhat different from the American version, the program had proved the validity of their "world car" approach. The basic design and all the major systems and components -- the engine, the transmission, the suspension, the body frame, the electronic systems, even the seats -- were identical, they said. So is the tooling at the plant here, 60 miles northeast of Brussels, and at the Ford plant near Kansas City, Mo., where production will begin next spring.
 "Mondeo is a single world car in all of the ways that count," Mr. Fike said in a speech to an industry group last month.
For years, the Japanese have designed cars like the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord, which have been produced and sold in nearly identical form in different parts of the world, relying on high quality as well as engineering and manufacturing innovations to sidestep variations in local tastes. They have increasingly used their worldwide manufacturing systems to help absorb upward and downward variations in demand from different regions.
But even the Japanese have recognized limits to the strategy. As automobile marketing has become even more competitive in recent years, Honda, Toyota and Nissan have been moving more toward customizing models for local tastes. Honda, for example, is reportedly considering differing versions of the Accord for Europe, North America and Japan.
"The direction is much more towards specialized and dedicated production to serve the needs of particular markets," said Karl E. Ludvigsen, a former Ford executive who is now a consultant in London.
Mr. Ludvigsen said Ford's strategy was not fundamentally flawed. He said the auto maker should have recognized, however, that the car's styling would have to be adapted to suit local tastes. Ford changed the North American version of the car only after market-testing the design. Consumers found the Ford Contour to be too conservatively styled and too small in some ways -- for example, in the trunk.
The auto maker had always planned for the Mercury Mystique version in the United States to be slightly different in exterior and interior styling from the Mondeo version in Europe, according to Rex Greenslade, a Ford spokesman. After the market-testing, though, the Ford Contour version was changed as well to make it slightly longer and sleeker.
"The idea of doing the core engineering of key platform components in one place is perfectly sound," Mr. Ludvigsen said. "But you need to accept from the beginning that the interiors and exteriors will have to be different in different markets."
In the beginning, there were doubts within Ford as to whether a global program would work at all. Ford had an embarrassing failure more than a decade ago when engineering teams from the United States and Europe were unable to settle on a unified approach for the Ford Escort and went their own ways, delivering cars with little more in common than a few parts.
 
 
Final Say
 The biggest problem with the Escort debacle, Ford said, was that neither the North American nor the European team had final say over the design. This time, Europe, with its expertise designing sporty-looking small cars, was given the lead role. Units in the United States were used in areas where they had greater expertise: in V-6 engines, automatic transmissions and air-conditioners, for example.
"Culturally, we recognized the concern and said that we were going to respect the principle that there could only be one lead engineering activity," said John A. Oldfield, Ford of Europe's vice president for product development.
Not only were the lines of responsibility made clear, but the corporation's top management, starting with the chief executive, Harold A. Poling, put its weight behind eradicating the old turf-protecting attitudes that had inhibited the 1981 Escort program.
"There were very clear signals from the top that the management team really wanted this to happen," said Mr. Oldfield, who as the executive in day-to-day charge of the program frequently shuttled to Ford's headquarters near Detroit to brief Mr. Poling and his lieutenants.
Mr. Oldfield said that Ford had also worked hard for several years previously to change its culture by throwing out its old discipline-oriented organizational structure -- engineering, production and marketing -- and creating product-oriented organizations that encouraged teamwork.
"If you look at the tough times the industry has been through, and the amount of restructuring necessary at Ford and among all the manufacturers, and at the Japanese threat we face in all markets, you can see that simply continuing to do business in the old ways was not good enough," Mr. Oldfield said.
The program was slowed by the need to develop common approaches in the United States and Europe to a host of issues -- getting information properly from engineers and designers to the manufacturing divisions, for example.
When the design work was finished last year, the company had to insure that it would not squander the savings from the global design work on manufacturing or quality problems -- and that it would be able to replicate in Kansas City next year the efficient manufacturing process it was seeking to develop for the European plant here in Genk.
Two years before production began here, Ford moved a "launch team" to the site. The team, comprising designers, manufacturing experts and suppliers, was given the job of making sure the manufacturing went smoothly, and given the authority to do the job quickly.
Instead of the normal 20 to 30 days it might have taken to get an engineering change made on a typical program, the launch team made the changes on the spot. During production planning, for example, engineers on the team determined that the interior door trim needed only three clips to hold it to the door frame instead of the six called for by the design. Making the change normally would have entailed a review process taking weeks or months; the team made the change in one day. Mr. Oldfield said 50 percent of all problems were dealt with within three days, and most of the rest soon after.
 
 
Quality Problems
 One of the goals was to avoid the quality problems that often accompany a new production program -- and that had severely plagued previous Ford of Europe programs, like the redesign of the Escort. The launch team's goal for the Mondeo was to have no more quality problems than there were at the end of the program it replaced in Europe.
Measured by quality audits in the factory, as well as customer returns, Ford met its goal, Mr. Oldfield said. After three months, more than 95 percent of Mondeo owners said they were completely or very satisfied with the car, compared with an average of about 85 percent for Ford over all, Mr. Oldfield said.
Members of the launch team have been moving to Kansas City to try to replicate the process there.

HEADLINE: Accord Is Near on a Mental Health Bill

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Negotiators for the Legislature and the Cuomo administration said today that they were near agreement on a mental health bill that would close five state psychiatric hospitals and earmark between $153 million and $180 million in new spending for community care over the next five years. An additional $30 million would be spent on programs for the homeless, with most of the money going to treatment for alcoholics and drug abusers who are mentally ill.
The negotiators have been working quietly since early July, when the Governor threatened to veto a mental health bill passed by the Legislature. That bill would direct money to community mental health programs each time a bed was closed in one of the state's 22 psychiatric hospitals. According to estimates, it would route between $208 million and $245 million to community care over five years. 
 Mr. Cuomo says he supports the continuing shift of the state's mental health system from its underused and expensive hospitals to community programs like group homes and day treatment centers. He concedes that the state has not funneled enough money to such programs.
 
Political Pressure
 But he originally objected to the plan to earmark future revenues for mental health, saying it would tie his hands in the budget-making process. As political pressure for a bill mounted, Mr. Cuomo said he could accept a compromise if the bill met three conditions. He said it would have to require the closing of psychiatric hospitals, allocate money specifically to programs for the homeless and include an escape mechanism in case the state's economy deteriorates.
Negotiators for the Governor, the Democratic-majority Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate said today that they were close to agreement on each of those conditions. "We are a hair away from getting it done," said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Yonkers Republican who is the mental health committee chairman.
Karen Carpenter Palumbo, assistant secretary to the Governor for human services, agreed. "Progress continues to be very positive," she said. "I'm generally optimistic that we are going to reach an agreement."
 
'Just a Matter of Time'
 The chairman of the Assembly mental health committee, Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat, said: "I believe we've passed the point of no return. I think this is now on a one-way track toward completion and it's just a matter of time."
The negotiators compromised recently on the amount of additional money to be spent. The bill would set aside $210 million over five years, with $30 million for homelessness programs. Of the remaining $180 million, at least 85 percent, or $153 million, would be spent on community programs. Up to 15 percent could be spent to improve staffing ratios at psychiatric hospitals.
New York currently spends $995 million in state tax dollars on mental health, with $594 million of that amount spent on community care, Ms. Palumbo said.
The schedule for closing psychiatric hospitals would begin with the Gowanda Psychiatric Center in southwestern New York, which has few patients remaining and would close almost immediately after the bill was signed. The Harlem Valley center in Dutchess County would close in February and the Central Islip center on Long Island would close in October 1995.
The timetable for closing the other two hospitals -- Willard in the Finger Lakes region and Kings Park on Long Island -- is still being negotiated. Legislators from those districts want the bill to promise that another use will be found for the hospitals, such as a prison or substance-abuse treatment center. The hospitals are major employers in their areas.
 
A Sticking Point
 The other remaining sticking point involves Mr. Cuomo's request for a so-called escape clause. In fact, Mr. Cuomo and the lawmakers concede that he already has the power to withhold scheduled spending if his fiscal analysts determine that the money is needed to keep the budget in balance.
But largely for political purposes, Mr. Cuomo wants the bill to make that point explicitly so that the Legislature is on record as acknowledging that the commitment to spend money on mental health can be revoked.
Some lawmakers have trouble with this, saying it sends a signal to the public that the state is making a promise that it expects to break.
Progress in the negotiations has been slow, largely because the Legislature has not set a date for returning to Albany for a special session. Without such a deadline, there is little pressure to reach a final agreement.
The Legislature is expected to reconvene sometime before the end of the year to deal with issues it did not address in its six-month regular session, including hospital financing, workers' compensation, storage of low-level radioactive waste and election of an interim attorney general to succeed Robert Abrams, who has announced his resignation. Mr. Cuomo has proposed an Oct. 19 date for the session to begin, but Senate Republican leaders have said they prefer to wait until after the Nov. 2 election.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools, considered a barometer of future industrial activity, fell 22 percent in August from the month before, the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a trade group said yesterday.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology said August orders totaled $177.5 million, down from $228.3 million in July. Orders came to $313.7 million in June, $315.8 million in May and $348.3 million in April. 
 August orders, however, improved 11 percent from $160.3 million in August 1992.
"August was the first month this year without unusually high auto-related orders," Albert W. Moore, president of the association, based in McLean, Va., said in a statement.
"Despite this, August orders are ahead of the same month a year ago, and year-to-date orders are one-third higher than 1992 levels," he said.
From January to August, machine tool orders were up 33 percent, to $2.17 billion, from $1.63 billion in the corresponding period last year.
Shipments in August were up 4 percent, to $220.6 million, from $212.8 million in July. Shipments increased 29 percent from $171.5 million in August 1992, and year-to-date shipments gained 34 percent, to $2.03 billion, from $1.51 billion.
Export orders for machine tools fell 58 percent in August, to $15.9 million, from $37.8 million in July. But export shipments more than doubled in August, to $27.6 million, from $12.3 million in July.
The backlog of machine tool orders in August stood at $1.47 billion, down from $1.51 billion in July. The year-ago backlog was $1.46 billion.
The monthly report, which covers shipments and orders for metal cutting and metal forming machine tools, represents a relatively small industry, and the monthly figures can fluctuate widely.
Nevertheless, orders for machine tools provide some insight into future industrial health, because the tools are needed to manufacture a broad range of products from dishwashers to aircraft engines.

HEADLINE: Communist Gains May Cool Investment in Poland

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Sept. 26

 BODY:
For companies experienced in emerging markets, Poland, with its 40 million people and a centrist Government, has proved a fertile field in the last four years. But with the success of former Communists in the elections Sept. 19, Western investor enthusiasm may cool and new commitments may be delayed, at least in the immediate future, investment bankers and company officials say.
"In the short term it will be wait and see, and if the business climate changes dramatically you'll see people reassess the risk," said John Simpson, a director of Wasserstein Perella & Company, the New York investment firm that was involved in purchases in Poland by the Gerber Products Company and the International Paper Company. 
 Three days before the election, Owens-Illinois Inc., the glass manufacturer, signed an agreement with the Polish Government to buy Poland's largest glass producer, Jaroslaw. The conclusion of the deal, the first investment by Owens-Illinois in Eastern Europe, is contingent on the American company's raising $25 million for improvements at the Jaroslaw factory, according to a John Hoff, an Owens-Illinois spokesman.
Asked if the election results would affect the borrowing, Mr. Hoff said, "We'll have to see."
Some companies are not concerned about the change in Parliament. Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. announced plans last month to invest 20 million ($30 million) to build a candy factory in western Poland. The company said the "consistent economic policies and substantial growth prospects in confectionary, particularly chocolate," had driven the decision to locate in Poland rather than elsewhere in Eastern Europe. And the election had not changed that view, said Chris Milburn, the company's director of communications in London.
Another estimated $1 billion has been committed by American companies for investment in Poland, including $500 million announced last month by Pepsico Inc. for its snack, beverage and restaurant businesses. Poland's largest foreign investor is Fiat S.p.A., the big Italian auto maker. Such large and experienced investors, who came to Poland before the 1989 collapse of the Communists, were unlikely to be affected by the latest change, analysts said.
The successor party to the Communists, the Democratic Left Alliance, which gained 20 percent of the vote, quickly made soothing noises about how it wants foreign investment in Poland to continue. About $2 billion has already been invested since 1989 in Poland by foreign companies.
The Alliance has been conducting talks recently with other political parties, particularly the Polish Peasants Party, which was allied with the Communist regime, in efforts to form a government. The most likely outcome appeared to be a leftist coalition between the Alliance and the Peasants Party, which favors heavy subsidies to farmers.
The most prominent and wealthiest Polish businessman, Zbigniew Niemczycki, the chairman of the Curtis Companies, a conglomerate of electronics, construction, aviation and health care concerns, seemed to set a cautionary tone Wednesday when he said in an interview that he was delaying a major new investment until the new government made clear its economic plans.
With election promises to raise pensions, and enormous pressure to satisfy other social demands, a new government might find it necessary to increase business taxes and customs duties and give greater protections to Polish workers, business executives said.
"We'd like to have more time to see whether the new government will increase taxes," Mr. Niemczycki said. "If they deliver what they promise in social services, they will have to get the money from some place. One of the choices could be to increase taxes, which would be a killer for the economy and bad for unemployment."
Construction on a planned $25 million industrial park in Warsaw, scheduled to start early next spring, would be postponed until midyear, he said.
Foreign investors familiar with the last three years of privatization said they believed the new government would slow the process. While the Alliance provided the crucial votes for passage of the privatization plan in Parliament this year, party leaders have said they want privatization of state companies to be done more selectively.
New people are sure to be placed at the head of the Privatization Ministry, and several investors say they are anxious to see and assess the new faces. More worker participation would probably be encouraged -- either by giving workers more say in whether a deal should be completed or allotting more shares to them.
Changes at the ministry were bound to affect purchases of state companies. "Our acquisition of a state enterprise will be affected," said Ian Murray, a director of Kouri Capital Group in New York. "The message is if nothing else changes, privatization will slow. As an investor that's bothersome. But as a small investment firm, we can stand the wait longer. We'll just wait if we have to."

Rally Is Over, an Economist Says

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond has been trading above 6 percent for seven days now, and to David C. Munro, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, it looks as if the rally is over. But Mr. Munro is not expecting any sharp jump in long-term interest rates to follow.
He does not arrive at this conclusion from a concern about inflation. Nor does he expect that the economy is about to break out of its sluggish path. 
 For the next year, he expects the economy, after adjustment for inflation, to grow at around 2.75 percent, no great shakes by any standard except the 1.3 percent pace in the first half of this year.
On inflation, he is even a little more optimistic than some forecasters, thinking that it can fall toward 2.5 percent, below the 2.9 percent annual rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index during the first eight months of the year.
So why does he think the rally at the long end of the bond market is over? One reason is that yields have fallen so far already, touching 25-year lows of 5.86 percent on the 30-year bond and 5.22 percent on the 10-year note before they slipped into their current trading range two weeks ago.
The other reason is that Mr. Munro believes long-term real interest rates, which are interest rates minus inflation or expected inflation, have now reached the 2 percent to 3 percent level that he says are the historical norm.
The real inflation rate, he said, "is a benchmark to which you should expect interest rates to gravitate to." And once they get there, he adds, they will stop falling.
For Mr. Munro, the real interest rate is around 2 percent for the 10-year note and around 3 percent for longer issues, like the 30-year bond. With inflation so far this year at about 3 percent, that equals a 5 percent to 5.25 percent level for the 10-year note and a 6 percent level for the 30-year bond.
"We are there, and we ought not to expect to move beyond this," he said.
But his view of the impact of real interest rates also means that long-term interest rates should not move much higher, because they would still gravitate back to the 6 percent level on the 30-year bond and 5.25 percent level on the 10-year note.
 
 
Accord on Rates
 It is not known yet what the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided at its meeting last week, but the minutes from the previous meeting in August resolved one question: the Fed has switched back to a neutral stance on short-term interest rates from its previous bias, set in May. That was a bias toward raising the Fed's short-term interest-rate target, which has been 3 percent for just over a year.
Going into last week's meeting, all the debate centered on whether the Fed would switch back to a neutral stand. Well, it was a moot point: they had already made the move.
Reading the signals from the Clinton Administration, it is also clearer that the President's economic policy makers are pleased with the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, although various governors of the central bank have indicated recently that they have no intention of cutting the Fed's short-term interest-rate target in an effort to stimulate the sluggish economy. That means that despite a weak economy, the Administration is not pressing for lower interest rates.
"We're pretty much in agreement," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said when asked about the Fed's interest-rate policy in an interview last week. "He feels and I feel that the economic underpinnings are good," Mr. Bentsen said, referring to Mr. Greenspan.
Mr. Bentsen added that the economy "is not coming out as fast as we want, but we still think that the second half will get to 2 to 3 percent."
 
 
Hospital Ratings
 The Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit rating agency, says it does not think that the Clinton Administration's health care plan will lead to widespread downgradings of the ratings of nonprofit hospitals around the country.
The S.& P. analysis reached this conclusion because the Clinton plan "adopts and accelerates health care trends that have been developing since the mid-1980's," and these factors have already been incorporated into credit ratings.
But this does not mean the plan would have no impact. What it probably would do, S.& P. said in the report to be released today, is broaden the gap between the nonprofit hospitals with top credit ratings and those at the bottom of the ratings ladder. The report said the trend "has been occurring since the mid-1980's and has resulted in increased numbers of credits at both ends of the rating spectrum."
The $67 billion of hospital debt now rated by S.& P. is dominated by issues with single-A ratings. But in 1992, the number of double-A rated issues and the number of speculative or junk issues both increased to 7 percent of the total, from 6 percent the year before.
The report said that one overlooked but critical point was the impact of cost cutting and, if they are employed, revenue caps on the bonds sold by nonprofit hospitals. Over time, the report said, the reduction in revenue would impair credit quality by lowering the ratio of total revenue to the interest owed by a hospital on its existing bonds.

Beyond the Tinkering at Time Inc.

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
On the theory that if it ain't broke, you don't fix it, Time Inc.'s overhaul of its management structure last week has raised an inevitable question about the health of its magazines.
The company's moves were quick and, in some ways, drastic: it shuffled executives, gave more financial responsibility to individual magazines and returned to a more traditional advertising sales structure. One goal was to reverse declines in ad sales at its seven core magazines. 
 Indeed, the number of advertising pages at each of those magazines, all based in New York, has fallen during the first eight months of 1993, compared with the corresponding period last year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. The magazines are Sports Illustrated, with a 16.6 percent decline; Life, 14.5 percent; Time, 11.9 percent; Money, 7.2 percent; People, 5.1 percent; Fortune, 3 percent, and Entertainment Weekly, 1.5 percent.
The declines compare with an overall 1.2 percent increase in advertising pages at the 180 magazines tracked by the bureau.
 
Increases in Circulation
 Circulation, however, is another story. With the exception of Life, each of the core Time Inc. magazines showed circulation gains for the first six months of 1993, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. And at Life, the circulation cutback was intentional, as part of a broad overhaul to make the magazine's operations more efficient.
As Time Inc. officials are quick to point out, advertising accounts for only a third of the company's more than $3 billion in annual revenue. The remainder is split almost evenly between circulation of its 32 magazines and its book operations.
Another sign of health is the bottom line. The company reported a 19.3 percent increase in earnings for the first half of 1993, compared with the year-earlier period, and has announced a goal of continued double-digit growth.
Although Time Inc. officials generally decline to give information about specific magazines, executives within the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Time, Fortune, People, Money and Sports Illustrated were all making money. Executives said Entertainment Weekly, which began in 1990, has not yet broken into the black but is on track, while Life, which had been struggling for years, seems to be back on its feet.
 
A Leaner Life
 Don Logan, president and chief operating officer of Time Inc., called this a transition year for Life, which was redesigned in February. Costs were cut by trimming the size of the magazine, reducing staff, slashing ad rates and lowering circulation to 1.5 million from 1.7 million. "On an operating basis, month to month, Life is certainly profitable," Mr. Logan said.
But visible as the New York-based magazines are, they represent only a small part of the company. Many of its other magazines, so-called niche publications that are aimed at specific audiences, have generally fared better in the advertising recession.
In 1985, Time Inc. acquired the Southern Progress Corporation and its magazines, including Southern Living and Southern Accents, two profitable publications. Cooking Light, started in 1987 amid the trend toward healthier cooking, has also been a success.
Other successful start-ups and purchases include Parenting, acquired in 1990, and Martha Stewart Living, started in 1991. It is too early to gauge the performance of Vibe, a hip-hop magazine that started last year.
Still, questions remain about why the core magazines have fared so badly in advertising.
In the case of Time magazine, part of the problem could be the continuing struggle of news weeklies to define themselves in the 1990's. Over all, however, Time Inc. seems to have more fundamental problems.
Many media directors at advertising agencies say the company became out of touch with the needs of advertisers by starting an ad sales structure in 1991 that took power from individual publishers and placed it in the hands of regional managers. The policy was reversed in last week's restructuring.
"It was an error of judgment," Emily Swartzentruber, senior vice president and New York media director at J. Walter Thompson, said of the regional structure. "And if it had gone on much longer it would have begun to seriously erode equities."
Reginald K. Brack Jr., chairman and chief executive of Time Inc., stressed that a main point of the reorganization was to put publishers more directly in touch with the advertising community. Each publisher will be responsible for at least one ad account, including sales calls.
The restructuring, however, may not be enough to fix the problem, said Gene DeWitt, president of DeWitt Media, an independent magazine consulting firm. He said the difficulties went beyond the regional setup and that "something in their sales mix isn't working."
"What I sense missing is an entrepreneurial focus, drive and energy that any successful sales organization needs," he said.
David Lehmkuhl, president of David Lehmkuhl Media, a magazine consulting firm, said that Time Inc. management and its sales force "are pretty much out of touch with what's going on in the media planning and buying community."
"I think all of those books are out of touch both in editorial and sales," he said. "Media planners who are 23 and 24 see them as an old man's read."
Mr. Logan, Time Inc.'s president, said many of its publications were not geared to younger readers, citing Fortune and Money. "They are just not young magazines," he said, although he noted how publications like People continued to have a strong following among younger readers.
"It's just a very complex environment out there still," he said. "But we feel very confident about the future."

HEADLINE: 2 Autumn Festivals in Europe

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Both the Warsaw Autumn, which ended its 36th installment on Saturday night, and Paris's 22d Autumn Festival, which got under way last week and continues until December, were intended to open their cities to the best the world had to offer. Both remain at full strength, attracting audiences from far beyond their local borders. Yet both festivals are facing a new order, forced by circumstances to reconsider their roles.
In the late 1950's and 60's, the Warsaw Autumn provided Poland and the entire Soviet bloc with its only comprehensive look at contemporary classical music. But it has had to readjust as the shock of the new wore off and the modernist passions of its founders were diluted by today's musical eclecticism. 
 "The first performance in Poland of Webern's Op. 10 "Orchesterstucke' was encored, the whole piece," the composer Witold Lutoslawski recalled in an interview on Friday. "There was tremendous enthusiasm for everything. That can't sustain itself for decades. Now the halls aren't always filled, but we can't complain: it's still a major event."
 
Nostalgia for Dissent
 The fall of Communism only underscored that sense of youthful loss. Throughout Eastern Europe intellectuals feel nostalgic for their days as dissidents, when culture had a passionate purpose that transcended mere esthetic pleasure or even moral elevation.
"It was a place of confrontation," recalled Antoni Wit, who is the music director of the Polish Radio National Symphony in Katowice. "In 10 days you could hear what had happened in music all over the world in the last year."
Today, the Warsaw Autumn is just one music festival among many, East and West, and hardly the richest. But it remains one of the best: open, engaged and full of judiciously chosen scores and remarkably accomplished performances.
At the Autumn Festival in Paris, the change has been personal, not political. Founded in 1972 by Michel Guy, it reflected his passion for American avant-garde performing arts, so much so that it was for a time perceived (stigmatized, in some quarters) as an American agent. With the fading of the extraordinary outburst of performing-arts creativity in New York after the 1970's, however, the Autumn Festival became what Guy had always conceived it as being: a window on the whole world of the performing arts, including the third world, and to some extent a showcase for the best in experimental activity in France.
 
One Man's Taste
 The Autumn Festival was always a reflection of the subjective tastes of Guy, who took a three-year sabbatical from the festival in the mid-70's to be French Minister of Culture. "I openly acknowledge my enthusiasms, my prejudices, my friendships, even my stubbornness," he once wrote. "Let no one imagine that the Festival d'Automne could exist without passion!" But Guy died in 1990, and the question is how well the festival can carry on without him.
The festival was founded by Guy and his old friend Georges Pompidou in what the festival's current general director, Alain Crombecque, called a "princely act," bypassing normal bureaucratic channels. Pompidou was the President of France at that time, and Guy once said that the Pompidou Center was the "concrete result" of their effort to revitalize contemporary arts in Paris, his festival being the "active result."
"This activity emerged from the silent vacuum reigning over the capital in the 70's," Guy continued. Except for New Wave film and a few playwrights, he added, "there was no audience in Paris for new creations, no money and no vitality." Mr. Crombecque agreed with that assessment. "Paris had been a little provincial," he said. "They wanted to open it up to the world."
Their success has been spectacular, so much so, said Josephine Markowits, the festival's longtime music director, that when she regards the current competition all over the city, she is "proud or depressed, depending on the day."
 
Resonance in Brooklyn
 Much of what the Autumn Festival presented has always been anticipated or echoed by the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Harvey Lichtenstein, the academy's president, openly recognized the Paris festival as a "formidable influence" on his decision to start his own fall Next Wave Festival. Paris has staged far more events than Brooklyn, and the reason is money. This year, the Paris budget is more than $3 million, with $1.3 million from the state and the rest from the city, sponsors and the box office.
The Autumn Festival opened this year with Robert Wilson's French-language version of his and Darryl Pinckney's monologue based on Virginia Woolf's "Orlando," starring Isabelle Huppert and seen already this spring in Lausanne, Switzerland. That recalled one longtime festival tradition, its support of American artists in general and Mr. Wilson in particular.
Also on the first-week docket was a charming if trivial hourlong music-theater piece by Mauricio Kagel, the Argentine-born, German-based vanguard composer. He wrote the music in 1977, but this version, staged by Werner Herzog and offering a sequence of acts recalling a small-town traveling circus of yesteryear, was new in Germany last year. That suggested the festival's more recent history: increasing reliance on European artists and on European co-productions.
 
Built-In Continuity
 Fortunately, continuity was always built into this compact organization. The festival's founding president, Janine Alexandre-Debray, is still on board. So are the two women who have long done the bulk of the work of lining up festival presentations: Marie Collin, for theater and dance, and Miss Markowits for music. Mr. Crombecque, the new general director, worked for Guy off and on for years and was brought by him to run the Avignon Festival in the 1980's.
Still, for a festival in which Guy himself put so much weight on personal taste, one has to worry. On the other hand, this year's festival, planned without him, offers a feast of interesting possibilities in the coming months. On the schedule are John Cage's gigantic "103" for orchestra on Tuesday night, Steve Reich's "Cave," yet another Goldoni play from Giorgio Strehler and his Piccolo Teatro of Milan, Peter Sellars's English-language version of Aeschylus' "Persians," dance from Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, Lucinda Childs and Bill T. Jones, and much more from European artists less well known to Americans.
Events at the Paris festival, in theaters all over the city, attract a trendily youthful audience but also, for the openings especially, a predictably well-coiffed Parisian crowd. The audiences for the Warsaw Autumn are likewise handsome and even elegant, and also young, given the festival's policy of providing free tickets for students.
 
Getting Around the Budget
 The Warsaw audiences do not look well heeled, however, which reflects the still-shaky economic circumstances of this festival and its public. The subsidies have not declined, but their value in hard currency has. According to Olgierd Pisarenko, who as head of the festival's repertory committee counts as its artistic director, the official budget, provided by the Government, is still only slightly more than $300,000. That is supplemented, however, by various in-kind arrangements (hotel rooms, air tickets, etc.) and foreign-government grants.
Phyllis Bryn-Julson, the American soprano who was here for two concerts, said her fee was paid in German marks, and Mr. Pisarenko added that the appearance of the Schoenberg Ensemble of Amsterdam was underwritten by the Dutch. "They've been very generous with my stay," Ms. Bryn-Julson said. "And it's so cheap. I can't ever eat more than $4 worth on the menu."
Budget limitations generally preclude inviting Western orchestras and opera companies, as happened during the Communist past. But the level of performances, with Polish ensembles and artists supplemented by visiting chamber groups and soloists, is impressive.
Mr. Wit's Katowice orchestra revealed itself as one of the best in Europe with its performances of Messiaen's "Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela" and a Polish program that ended with two scores by the chart-topping Henryk Mikolaj Gorecki. The Wilanow String Quartet accompanied Ms. Bryn-Julson handsomely, the National Philharmonic played well for Lutoslawski and the 18-year-old Aleksandra Krzanowska revealed a real pianistic talent as well as a sweet theatrical flair in her late-night recital on Friday at the Chopin Music Academy.
 
The Big Three
 Young Polish composers seem as eclectically diffuse now as the rest of the world. But the Warsaw Autumn still offers innovative programming, including a clutch of Chinese composers and a mini-retrospective of Cage and his New York School. And Poland still has its big three: Krzysztof Penderecki, who conducted the opening concert on Sept. 17, ending with two of his works; Mr. Lutoslawski, whose recent, finely wrought Fourth Symphony ended the festival's closing concert on Saturday, and Mr. Gorecki. He had four works in the festival's final days, including the hushed and compelling Concerto-Cantata, with Carol Wincenc of New York as its impeccable flute soloist.
Still, an aura of apprehension hangs over the festival, a sense of drift that parallels fears for the future of the Autumn Festival in Paris. Everyone agrees that Warsaw had an enormous impact on Eastern bloc music and on the developing new Polish school of composers. And while no one knows quite why the Polish Communists permitted all this musical freedom, some now miss the excitement of staging a festival under the constant threat of repression.
"We can only guess, but I would think the authorities realized that music was not very important as a means of public propaganda," Mr. Lutoslawski said. "They censored literature, film, theater, television, but not music. They were proud of the festival. They could show other countries, especially Russia, that they could present things like that."
Now the thrill of battling a common enemy is gone. "Maybe the festival hasn't changed, but its role has changed," said Mr. Wit of the Katowice orchestra. "It has lost its political aspect, and now people don't wait for it all year long."

America's Dream on a Slide Into the Third World

 BODY:

The Endangered American Dream
How to Stop the United States From Becoming a Third-World Country and How to Win the Geo-Economic Struggle for Industrial Supremacy
By Edward N. Luttwak
365 pages. Simon & Schuster. $24.
Much will seem familiar about Edward N. Luttwak's cumbersomely subtitled but important economic jeremiad, "The Endangered American Dream." 
 Scarcely another book is required to tell us that the American economy is declining relative to other first-world industrial powers; that the country increasingly lacks patient capital investment and a highly skilled work force; that its middle class is shrinking while the gap between the super-rich and the poor grows apace; that one of the causes of these problems has been the economic growth of Japan, not so much through its people's superior diligence, but more because of unfair trade practices; that America must now fight back by paying off its huge debts, revamping its deteriorating public-school system and adopting an industrial policy of its own to contend with those of Europe and Japan. All this has been written before in recent books too numerous to list.
Indeed, Mr. Luttwak has said much of it himself. A director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies of Washington and the author of half a dozen previous books, among them "The Pentagon and the Art of War" and "Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace," he has repeatedly testified before Congress.
What is new here is the detail he supplies to illustrate his points: details ranging from a description of urban crime as "America's permanent intifadah," to a survey of the sort of product-liability suits that increasingly impede American commerce, to a review of the ill-defined ethnic and racial categories to which teachers in the San Diego Unified School District must now be sensitive. (For instance, as he quotes the official directive, a Hmong is "a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Laos or Cambodia and are of the Hmong culture or origin.")
And what is newly compelling in this book is Mr. Luttwak's thesis that whereas the nations of the world once competed geopolitically, with the end of the Cold War they now compete geo-economically, a point he first developed publicly in the pre-Gulf war hearings of the United States Senate. In this view, it is no longer by territory that countries measure their strength, but by industrial productivity. Using that measure, he sees the United States as fated to become a third-world economy by the third decade of the next millennium, or a nation of low-wage, assembly-line workers or poorly paid hamburger-flippers.
What is to be done? (as he titles his chapter of proposed solutions). For one thing, he insists, the public educational system must be overhauled by giving extra Federal pay to teachers who can pass uniform, nationwide, written qualification exams, by rewarding students with Federal diplomas for tested educational achievement and by strengthening vocational training and work-study programs.
For another thing, he writes, the country should promote capital investment by doing away with what he characterizes as productivity-inhibiting social security and corporate taxes, and introducing value-added taxes, which, he says, cut down on consumption and encourage savings. Finally, America should renounce its mindless faith in free-market ideology (as damaging, he believes, as Marxist-Leninist dogma) and adopt an industrial-policy apparatus to compete with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan and comparable bureaucracies elsewhere in the world.
After all, if Japan isn't proof enough that industrial policy works, then the nation can look to "the very 'Japanese' semiconductor policy pursued by the very same Reagan administration that issued long perorations on the evils of industrial policy," or to the United States Advanced Battery Consortium, or, most recently, to America's "flat panel" consortium for computer display screens. These, he argues, are some of the most dramatic proofs that industrial policy is viable for this country.
None of these arguments are likely to sweep opponents of Mr. Luttwak's views off their feet. The organization of his book is somewhat haphazard, his arguments frequently lurching uneasily from broad generalization to near-obsessive detail. While his views are often trenchant, they sometimes become mired in pages of mind-numbing statistics. Nor is his non numerical prose always winning, tainted as it sometimes is by overly harsh ridicule of the proponents of multiculturalism or by the crude sense of humor apparent in his suggestion that in the hypothetical event of a wave of capital-rich Swiss immigration, "Americans would be content enough with their rising wages to tolerate a fair amount of noisy yodeling."
More seriously, Mr. Luttwak does not trouble to rebut the theoretical basis of a belief in international free trade. He merely waves it away with an unfavorable example or two. In any case, as his argument turns out, his point is not really that free-market ideology is false, but rather that, like unilateral nuclear disarmament, it may not be entirely practical in a world that embraces the opposite view.
Finally, what he argues most effectively is that as long as the nations of the world wage geo-economic warfare, Americans must be willing to arm themselves appropriately, just as they did when geopolitics was the game. As he concludes: "The choice that remains for the United States is between the successful negotiation of a sweeping geo-economic disarmament, and the waging of the geo-economic struggle in full force. The looming presence of expansionist international corporations, activist bureaucracies, and economically ambitious governments -- none of which is to be found on Main Street, USA, or in economics textbooks -- requires that the choice be made and acted upon. Not to choose is to lose."

Savings Associations and Commercial Banks

 BODY:
After peaking in 1988, the number of commercial banks in the region has plummeted, in large part reflecting the effects of the recession. The trend in New York has been driven by mergers like the one between Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover, and by moves by many large New York City-based banks to merge their upstate subsidiaries into the parent banks. In Connecticut, the FDIC closed 10 institutions in 1992 alone; only one of the state's banks was closed in the 1980s. In New Jersey, a slow down in commercial real estate and construction took a toll on commercial banks, but they resumed profitable operations in 1992, after three years of setbacks. The thrift industry in all three states has also contracted, afflicted by the same troubles that beset many of the country's savings and loan associations.

HEADLINE: Nafta and the Environment

 BODY:
Environmentalists, accustomed to unified struggles against common enemies like air pollution and Ronald Reagan, have fallen to fighting among themselves over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Grass-roots organizations like Friends of the Earth say it will create a polluters' paradise in Mexico and degrade America. Mainstream groups like the National Wildlife Federation say it all but guarantees a cleaner hemisphere.
Nafta's critics are even more jittery now that a Federal appeals court has ruled that the White House can forward the agreement to Congress without an environmental impact statement. A careful reading of Nafta should ease their worries. 
 No previous trade agreement tackles as many pollution issues as Nafta does. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the basic document governing international commerce -- doesn't even mention the word "environment." Nafta, by contrast, includes numerous environmental protections; a side agreement makes them even stronger. Mexico is more likely to become a cleaner nation with Nafta than without.
Critics raise three complaints, all overstated.
Nafta Undermines Laws. Critics say the agreement threatens global environmental treaties as well as stiff U.S. laws that, they fear, could be challenged by either Canada or Mexico as unfair barriers to free trade. But Nafta explicitly protects the international pact prohibiting illegal trade in wildlife, the Basel Convention against shipment of hazardous waste, and the Montreal Protocol phasing out production of ozone-destroying chemicals.
Nafta also protects the right of each country to set any standards it wants as long as they seek a "legitimate" environmental objective, are based on scientific data and apply to foreign and domestic products alike. Given this language, it seems highly unlikely that Mexico could, for example, successfully challenge a U.S. decision to prevent the import of fruits sprayed with pesticides banned by U.S. law.
Nafta Won't Clean the Border. The boundary between Mexico and the U.S. is undeniably a cesspool. "Dirty" U.S. industries like petrochemicals have flocked to the border zone because, under Mexican law, the goods they manufacture can be shipped back to the U.S. duty-free.
Nafta addresses the border problem in two ways. First, the side agreement promises $8 billion for water and sewage treatment, although the money has yet to be appropriated. More important, all of Mexico will become a duty-free zone under Nafta, thus removing any incentive to concentrate industry on the border.
Nafta Will Ruin Mexico. Although Mexico has strong environmental laws, it rarely enforces them. Thus, critics say, America's dirtiest industries -- tempted not only by Mexico's lower wages but by its regulatory indifference -- will now infest every nook and cranny of Mexico, adding greatly to Mexico's existing pollution overload.
However, Nafta explicitly bars all three parties to the agreement from creating "pollution havens" by waiving or ignoring environmental laws for the purpose of seeking investment. The trick is to insure that this pledge is honored. To that end, the side agreement sets up a three-nation mechanism, the Commission on Environmental Cooperation. Any country (or private group like the Sierra Club), believing that a nation is not enforcing its laws, can complain. If the commission finds a pattern of violations, it can impose fines of up to $20 million on the offending country and, if that doesn't work, invoke trade sanctions.
The procedure is cumbersome and it is hardly foolproof. But at least it would bring to bear international pressures that do not now exist and would give Mexico an incentive to obey laws that it routinely ignores.
Nafta will not turn Mexico, Canada or the U.S. into a preindustrial paradise. It simply seeks to protect the environment against the economic explosion that Nafta is supposed to let loose. Those who claim otherwise haven't done their reading.

The Fifth Person

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Within a few years, health insurance will be universal and irrevocable; that's a given.
Reality #1: The four out of five Americans who are presently covered will have to pay for the fifth person's insurance: that is logically inescapable. Four must pay for five. 
 Let us not be misled by phrases like "employer mandates"; that means only that the cost of a payroll will rise and be paid by the consumer. In the same way, "government subsidies" to small business, and to the unemployed, mean that the cost of insurance will be paid by the taxpayer. The consumer and the taxpayer are the same person.
The huge new benefit -- the social justice of changing charity to an entitlement -- will have a price. President Clinton would have us believe that the cost of insuring the fifth person will be made up by eliminating paperwork, by rejiggering present Federal programs for the elderly and poor, and by extracting $365 a year from the pack-a-day smoker. (About time the poor paid their fair share.) That cost concealment is a fraud that betrays the promise of health insurance reform.
Reality #2: Republicans huddling in secret conclave have decided not to be out-compassioned by anybody. The party line is to embrace the President's goals, to remember Nixon's plan and declare health to be "above politics," and to suggest that minor differences in the details of approaches will be ironed out in Congressional hearings. That concealment of principled opposition is also a fraud; we should not be fearful of constructively opposing the wrong means to a good end.
Reality #3: The Clinton plan imposes price controls. Its chokepoint on a free economy is the insurance premium: Put that in Washington's hands, and the Feds dictate everything from the price of bypasses to the price of aspirin. Most people like the idea of price controls until they are faced with the shortages and black markets and rationing -- and wage controls -- that always follow.
Clinton's proposed price control dares to be aboveboard on new drugs. By putting researchers on notice that a supreme court of health will determine the price of newly developed medicines, the Clintons have chosen to inhibit private investment in potential cures for AIDS, brain diseases, cancer or the common cold. If there is no big profit payoff, there will be no corporate roll of the dice; that's capitalism. The last thing reform should do is reduce the current investment in new drugs that may curtail expensive hospital stays.
Reality #4: Buyers' cooperatives usually contribute to competition, realizing savings by buying in bulk; but the Clinton co-ops -- called "alliances" -- are to be state monopolies, not subject to competition from other co-ops. Government-directed monopolies are inherently bureaucratic, and no government operation is purified by failure; the person who loaded the wrong speech into Mr. Clinton's teleprompter was not fired for incompetence. To claim that the cost of the fifth person's coverage will come out of "bureaucratic savings" or paperwork reduction is to hypnotize yourself.
Reality #5: Notwithstanding the previous realities, the Clintons have touched the nation's guilty conscience: The poor should not have to choose between food and medicine. "Pre-existing condition" are dirty words. Emergency-room care is wasteful. Forms can be standardized. Malpractice threats that trigger expensive tests and doctors' insurance costs should be curbed.
Reality #6: The heat is on conservatives not to merely tinker with a statist plan, but to come up with one that protects individual choice. Senator John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, has a voucher-based plan on the table whose costs are more readily accountable and where the quality of today's care is less diluted.
Who will espouse the alternative that emerges? Dr. Bernadine Healy left liberal Senator Jay Rockefeller an expostulating wreck on yesterday's ABC Brinkley show; before any of us decide on health care, we should be educated by a formal two-hour televised debate between Dr. Healy and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Remember: Nothing is for nothing. The generous four will pay to cover the fifth person with higher taxes, higher prices and higher premiums. Let's not also pay in our personal freedom by lurching toward a command economy.

HEADLINE: Accord Is Near on a Mental Health Bill

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Negotiators for the Legislature and the Cuomo administration said today that they were near agreement on a mental health bill that would close five state psychiatric hospitals and earmark between $153 million and $180 million in new spending for community care over the next five years. An additional $30 million would be spent on programs for the homeless, with most of the money going to treatment for alcoholics and drug abusers who are mentally ill.
The negotiators have been working quietly since early July, when the Governor threatened to veto a mental health bill passed by the Legislature. That bill would direct money to community mental health programs each time a bed was closed in one of the state's 22 psychiatric hospitals. According to estimates, it would route between $208 million and $245 million to community care over five years. 
 Mr. Cuomo says he supports the continuing shift of the state's mental health system from its underused and expensive hospitals to community programs like group homes and day treatment centers. He concedes that the state has not funneled enough money to such programs.
 
Political Pressure
 But he originally objected to the plan to earmark future revenues for mental health, saying it would tie his hands in the budget-making process. As political pressure for a bill mounted, Mr. Cuomo said he could accept a compromise if the bill met three conditions. He said it would have to require the closing of psychiatric hospitals, allocate money specifically to programs for the homeless and include an escape mechanism in case the state's economy deteriorates.
Negotiators for the Governor, the Democratic-majority Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate said today that they were close to agreement on each of those conditions. "We are a hair away from getting it done," said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Yonkers Republican who is the mental health committee chairman.
Karen Carpenter Palumbo, assistant secretary to the Governor for human services, agreed. "Progress continues to be very positive," she said. "I'm generally optimistic that we are going to reach an agreement."
 
'Just a Matter of Time'
 The chairman of the Assembly mental health committee, Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat, said: "I believe we've passed the point of no return. I think this is now on a one-way track toward completion and it's just a matter of time."
The negotiators compromised recently on the amount of additional money to be spent. The bill would set aside $210 million over five years, with $30 million for homelessness programs. Of the remaining $180 million, at least 85 percent, or $153 million, would be spent on community programs. Up to 15 percent could be spent to improve staffing ratios at psychiatric hospitals.
New York currently spends $995 million in state tax dollars on mental health, with $594 million of that amount spent on community care, Ms. Palumbo said.
The schedule for closing psychiatric hospitals would begin with the Gowanda Psychiatric Center in southwestern New York, which has few patients remaining and would close almost immediately after the bill was signed. The Harlem Valley center in Dutchess County would close in February and the Central Islip center on Long Island would close in October 1995.
The timetable for closing the other two hospitals -- Willard in the Finger Lakes region and Kings Park on Long Island -- is still being negotiated. Legislators from those districts want the bill to promise that another use will be found for the hospitals, such as a prison or substance-abuse treatment center. The hospitals are major employers in their areas.
 
A Sticking Point
 The other remaining sticking point involves Mr. Cuomo's request for a so-called escape clause. In fact, Mr. Cuomo and the lawmakers concede that he already has the power to withhold scheduled spending if his fiscal analysts determine that the money is needed to keep the budget in balance.
But largely for political purposes, Mr. Cuomo wants the bill to make that point explicitly so that the Legislature is on record as acknowledging that the commitment to spend money on mental health can be revoked.
Some lawmakers have trouble with this, saying it sends a signal to the public that the state is making a promise that it expects to break.
Progress in the negotiations has been slow, largely because the Legislature has not set a date for returning to Albany for a special session. Without such a deadline, there is little pressure to reach a final agreement.
The Legislature is expected to reconvene sometime before the end of the year to deal with issues it did not address in its six-month regular session, including hospital financing, workers' compensation, storage of low-level radioactive waste and election of an interim attorney general to succeed Robert Abrams, who has announced his resignation. Mr. Cuomo has proposed an Oct. 19 date for the session to begin, but Senate Republican leaders have said they prefer to wait until after the Nov. 2 election.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 2, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about a New York State mental-health bill referred incorrectly to the position of state legislators on Long Island who are concerned about the proposed closing of Kings Park Psychiatric Center. They want assurances from the state that local planning officials will have a significant voice in determining the future use of the site, rather than wanting another state use, like a prison or a substance-abuse center.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A flurry in the chemical industry confirms analysts' suspicions.

BYLINE: By Kathryn Jones

 BODY:
THE rapid-fire succession of spinoffs, acquisitions or restructurings last week in the chemical industry reinforced what many Wall Street analysts had already concluded: Chemicals are having another bad year, and will probably endure several more before the business pulls out of a prolonged slump.
Texaco Inc. kicked off the flurry by disclosing plans to sell its Texaco Chemical Company to Jon M. Huntsman, a chemical entrepreneur from Utah, and the Australian billionaire Kerry Packer, for $1.06 billion. Then the American Cyanamid Company and the Ethyl Corporation each announced that they planned to spin off their chemical businesses to shareholders. And E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company said it would lay off 4,500 employees in its domestic chemicals business. 
 The announcements barely moved the chemical stocks as a group, indicating the pessimistic attitude about the outlook for the depressed industry.
"There's disillusionment about the industry's prospects," said George J. Krug, an industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. "It will be a number of years before we see any significant recovery, and then there will be a lot of competition from new players. It's going to be a long, hard battle."
The reshuffling of assets, which has been taking place gradually during the four- to five-year industry downturn, probably spurted last week as a result of uncanny timing, analysts said. But they said the activity also represented a trend they saw continuing during the next year to 18 months as companies shed operations in depressed industries like chemicals, focused on core businesses and tried to enhance shareholder value.
"We'll see ongoing rifle-shooting at businesses that will be divested and pruned over the next year," said Robert S. Reitzes, a chemical industry analyst with C. J. Lawrence Inc.
Speculation has persisted about when or whether Du Pont would split off from its Conoco petroleum subsidiary, which is largely independent of its chemical business. And some analysts also said it would make sense for some diversified energy companies, like the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, to spin off their chemical businesses.
But analysts cautioned investors about takeover plays in the chemical industry. The opportunities, and the stocks that analysts recommend, are in companies that are either highly specialized, diversified or have already revamped.
"I would suggest that investors look at the stronger companies that are likely to survive, rather than speculate on who is a takeover candidate," said Leonard Bogner, a chemical industry analyst with Prudential Securities. "Companies that have gotten this far probably see the light at the end of the tunnel."
The chemical industry, like metals and forest products, is tied to the ups and down of business cycles. Traditionally, the industry has cycled up and down every 7 to 10 years. Analysts and industry executives said the current cycle will be longer than expected because of the slow economy in the United States and depressed economies abroad.
Mr. Huntsman said in a telephone interview that the current slump had been difficult to predict and was "one of the worst down rides" he had seen in the chemical industry. His strategy is to keep the chemical companies he acquires privately held. "The chemical industry does not lend itself to having companies go public," he said. "The cycles are just too vicious."
Analysts said Mr. Huntsman's investment could be a gold mine for him if the industry finally moves to boom from bust. But as Mr. Krug of Oppenheimer put it, "I hope he lives that long."

HEADLINE: THE U.N. ASSEMBLY;
In Clinton's Words: U.N. Become Engaged in Every World Conflict

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's address to the United Nations today:
I have made nonproliferation one of our nation's highest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply into the fabric of all of our relationships with the world's nations and institutions. We seek to build a world of increasing pressure for nonproliferation, but increasingly open trade and technology for those states that live by accepted international rules. Today, let me describe several new policies that our Government will pursue to stem proliferation. 
 We will pursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear weapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and highly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear terrorism for all nations. We will press for an international agreement that would ban production of these materials for weapons forever.
As we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States has also begun negotiations toward a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitate these negotiations our nation would suspend our testing if all other nuclear states would do the same. Today in the face of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear states to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop nuclear testing for all time.
 
Controlling Biological Weapons
 I am also proposing new efforts to fight the proliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today only a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weapons convention. I call on all nations, including my own, to ratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by January 13th, 1995.
We will also seek to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention by making every nation's biological activities and facilities open to more international scrutiny. I am proposing as well new steps to thwart the proliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently, working with Russia, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa, we have made significant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek to strengthen the principles of the Missile Technology Control Regime by transforming it from an agreement on technology transfer among just 23 nations to a set of rules that can command universal adherence.
We will also reform our own system of export controls in the United States to reflect the realities of the post-cold-war world. Where we seek to enlist the support of our former adversaries in the battle against proliferation at the same time that we stop deadly technologies from falling into the wrong hands, we will work with our partners to remove outdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerce and unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over the world.
As we work to keep the world's most destructive weapons out of conflicts, we must also strengthen the international community's ability to address those conflicts themselves. For, as we all now know so painfully, the end of the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace. Indeed, it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons of ethnic, religious and territorial animosity. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	The United Nations simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world's conflicts. If the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say no. The United Nations must also have the technical means to run a modern world-class peacekeeping operation. We support the creation of a genuine U.N. peacekeeping headquarters with a planning staff, with access to timely intelligence, with a logistics unit that can be deployed on a moment's notice, and a modern operations center with global communications.
And the U.N.'s operations must not only be adequately funded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks, the United States will be current in our peacekeeping bill. I have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. I believe the United States should lead the way in being timely in its payments and I will work to continue to see that we pay our bills in full. But I am also committed to work with the United Nations to reduce our nation's assessment for these missions. The assessment system has not been changed since 1973, and everyone in our country knows that our percentage of the world's economic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I believe our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of other nations that can now bear more of the financial burden. That will make it easier for me as President to make sure we pay in a timely and full fashion. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	As we dream new dreams in this age when miracles now seem possible, let us focus on the lives of those people, and especially on the children who will inherit this world. Let us work with a new urgency and imagine what kind of world we could create for them over the coming generation. Let us work with new energy to protect the world's people from torture and repression. As Secretary of State Christopher stressed at the recent Vienna conference, human rights are not something conditional, bounded by culture, but rather something universal granted by God. This general assembly should create at long last a high commissioner for human rights. I hope you will do it soon and with vigor and energy and conviction.
Let us also work far more ambitiously to fulfill our obligations as custodians of this planet not only to improve the quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air and water and the earth itself, but also because the roots of conflict are so often entangled with the roots of environmental neglect and the calamities of famine and disease.
During the course of our campaign in the United States last year Vice President Gore and I promised the American people major changes in our nation's policy toward the global environment. Those were promises to keep, and today the United States is doing so.
Today we are working with other nations to build on the promising work of the U.N.'s Commission of Sustainable Development. We are working to make sure that all nations meet their commitments under the Global Climate convention. We are seeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent the world's deserts from further expansion. And we seek to strengthen the World Health Organization's efforts to combat the plague of AIDS, which is not only killing millions, but also exhausting the resources of nations that can least afford it. And let us make a new commitment to the world's children.
It is tragic enough that one and a half million children died as a result of wars over the past decade. But it is far more unforgivable that during that same period, 40 million children died from diseases completely preventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day -- this day, as we meet here -- over 30,000 of the world's children will die of malnutrition and disease.
Our Unicef director, Jim Grant, has reminded me that each of those children had a name and a nationality, a family, a personality, and a potential. We are compelled to do better by the world's children. Just as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensure that every child has adequate health care, we must do more to get basic vaccines and other treatments for curable diseases to children all over the world. It's the best investment we'll ever make. We can find new ways to ensure that every child grows up with clean, drinkable water, that most precious commodity of life itself. And the U.N. can work even harder to ensure that each child has at least a full primary education, and I mean that opportunity for girls as well as boys.
And to ensure a healthier and more abundant world, we simply must slow the world's explosive growth in population. We cannot afford to see the human race double by the middle of the next century. Our nation has at last renewed its commitment to work with the United Nations to expand the availability of the world's family planning education and services.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Peru at Odds Over Death of Airman

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The attack on a United States military transport plane by two Peruvian jet fighters in April 1992, in which an American airman was killed, has come back to haunt the Government of President Alberto K. Fujimori and strain relations with the United States.
A foreign aid appropriations bill passed by the Senate on Thursday included an amendment prohibiting the United States from disbursing $100 million in aid planned for the Peruvian Government in the 1994 fiscal year, until Peru settles damage claims with the family of Sgt. Joseph Beard. 
 Sergeant Beard was sucked out of the American C-130 military transport at 20,000 feet off the northern coast of Peru when strafing by Peruvian fighters blew a hole in the fuselage on April 24, 1992. His body has never been found.
The amendment, sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, has the support of some Democratic senators, and seems to reflect a desire by some in Congress to use foreign aid to Peru to improve the Fujimori Government's record on human rights and respect for international codes of conduct.
"The desire is not to be punitive with Peru, but there hasn't been any movement on compensating the Beard family for months," a member of Senator Helms's staff said in a telephone interview. "This is a very sensitive issue in the Congress because the death of a United States serviceman is involved, and responsible nations, when this kind of thing happens, do what they can to compensate the families."
The amendment also instructs the United States to urge international lending organizations to withhold loans to Peru until a settlement on the Beard issue is reached.
The case presents thorny issues for Mr. Fujimori and Peru. The Beard family is seeking payment of about $900,000, which an Air Force analysis calculated would be the present value of the sergeant's earning power over his expected lifetime. Peru is offering to pay between $100,000 and $150,000.
In a country with so much poverty, a deep recession and average monthly wages of about $60, a payment of almost $1 million to the family would unleash criticism. There is also fear that if Mr. Fujimori agreed to such a payment, it would cause deep resentment in the armed forces, which still assert that they were justified in shooting at the plane.
Mr. Fujimori repeated the Government's claim that Peru was not responsible for the incident, and that the shooting was provoked by the pilots of the American plane, who refused to communicate with the Peruvian pilots or obey their signals to land. Peru says its pilots feared that the large transport was carrying drugs.
Yet, if the Helms amendment is approved over the next few days by a House-Senate conference committee, Mr. Fujimori will have little choice if Peru is to get the much-needed aid.
Members of Senator Helms's office said Washington attorneys hired by Peru were working hard, and could succeeed, in getting the amendment struck from the bill in a conference committee. But one staff member added that if Peru's lawyers were successful, "You can be sure Senator Helms will put this provision on every bill possible in the future, ad infinitum, until Peru settles with Mrs. Beard."
Peruvian officials say the cooling of tensions between Peru and the United States is important for Mr. Fujimori, since he will attend the United Nations General Assembly to present his case for seizing almost dictatorial powers on April 5, 1992. He shut down the Congress and the courts in an effort to combat corruption and the leftist guerrilla group called the Shining Path.
Though strongly supported by Peruvians, he became almost an international pariah and has been struggling since then to convince Western nations that his actions were his only recourse to prevent the Shining Path from toppling the Government.
In the wake of what is called the Fujimori coup, the United States stopped all but relief aid. When less than three weeks later the Peruvian jets strafed the American C-130, it only added to the acrimony.

HEADLINE: Israel and P.L.O. Have 'a Lot to Do' in Little Time

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Two weeks after the handshake that stunned the world, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are only just beginning to put together the political machinery needed to transform Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied territories from a principle on paper into a reality.
Given the emotional power of the White House signing ceremony on Sept. 13 and the handshake between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the P.L.O., the subsequent lack of visible movement has caused a letdown among some people on both sides. It is almost as though they had got all dressed up, only to discover they had no place to go. 
 In fact, a period of suspended animation was built into the agreement.
It will not go into effect until Oct. 13, a month after the signing. Then, the two sides will begin negotiating the critical details of their coexistence and the transfer of authority from Israel to the Palestinians, starting in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, on the West Bank.
 
Dec. 13 Deadline Set
 Those negotiations are supposed to last two months, tops -- in other words until no later than Dec. 13, when not only are Israeli troops supposed to begin withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho but also the Israeli military government is to transfer power to Palestinians elsewhere in the West Bank in education and culture, social welfare, health, taxation and tourism.
What is dawning on both sides is the realization that, as one Israeli official put it, "we have a lot to do and not much time to do it in."
And even if the timetables are met, it does not necessarily mean that all authority will shift suddenly from Israel to Palestinians.
"I would not expect any miraculous overnight change," said Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the formal Middle East talks. "They're not just going to hand over the keys. I think there will be a period of transition."
 
Site Is Uncertain
 It is not even clear where the negotiations on the details will be held.
Mr. Rabin told his Cabinet on Sunday that he wanted the Gaza-Jericho plan to be negotiated in one of two Egyptian towns in Sinai: El Arish on the Mediterranean or Taba on the Gulf of Aqaba. Both are near the Israeli border, and both were in Israeli hands, as was all of Sinai, from the 1967 war until the 1980's, when Egypt regained control under its 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
At the same time, talks would continue in Washington on less immediate issues -- though no less important ones -- like preparations for the election of a Palestinian council that will supervise the self-rule throughout Gaza and the West Bank. Those elections are to be held no later than next July 13.
Israel and Palestinian officials say specific sites have yet to be decided.
According to Mrs. Ashrawi, the two sides have had quiet contacts since the White House ceremony -- "but nothing official," she added, and nothing that had produced solid agreements.
Two Israeli publications reported in recent days that Israel was preparing to meet a central P.L.O. demand by freeing most of the roughly 11,000 Palestinians held for offenses stemming from the six-year-old anti-Israel uprising. Only some 2,000 prisoners judged to be the most dangerous would still be held, transferred from jails in the occupied territories to prisons inside Israel, The Jerusalem Report magazine said.
On this issue as well, Government spokesmen say no decision has been reached, although they do not reject the idea of a possible prisoner release.
For the rest of the many issues that the negotiators face, nothing is any more clear than it was two weeks ago. Here are a few prominent examples:
*What is Jericho -- the town of 10 square miles, or a much broader district of 146 square miles as defined by Jordanian law before 1967? A compromise seems likely, Palestinians say, perhaps one that gives them control of refugee camps near Jericho but not strategic mountains to the west or the Allenby Bridge to Jordan, to the east.
*How big a police force, and how heavily armed, should the Palestinians have in the territories? Israel's Police Minister, Moshe Shahal, says a 10,000-member force sounds right, but the Palestinians are talking about 20,000 or 30,000. At the start, Mrs. Ashrawi says, there will probably be only "a few thousand."
*How close will economic links be between the territories and far wealthier Israel? Palestinian and Israeli economists say solid ties are necessary to keep Gaza and the West Bank from collapsing, but they add that nationalist considerations may come into play. Mrs. Ashrawi also suggests that may be so, saying the Palestinians do not want to become an appendage to Israel and prefer "to look east and not west."
*When will Mr. Arafat move from Tunis to Gaza or Jericho? A widely circulating rumor is that Mr. Arafat wants to arrive in Jericho by Jan. 1. That raises questions about how he will be protected from Israeli and Palestinian extremists who want him dead.
Whatever happens, it is clear that both sides recognize that they need each other. One sign is an attempt suddenly by senior Israeli officials to portray the once-reviled P.L.O. as a partner that keeps its word. They have pointed out that since The Handshake, any anti-Israel violence has been carried out not by P.L.O. loyalists but the militant Islamic group Hamas.

HEADLINE: THE U.N. ASSEMBLY;
Clinton, at U.N., Lists Stiff Terms For Sending U.S. Force to Bosnia

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton today laid down a long list of American conditions for sending peacekeeping troops to Bosnia and called on the United Nations to be much more selective about where it sends such troops in the future, saying the United States could not afford to go on subsidizing open-ended missions.
In his first address to the United Nations General Assembly, which has just begun its annual fall session, Mr. Clinton also proposed a worldwide treaty that would ban production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. But the thrust of his remarks was an appeal to overhaul the peacekeeping machinery of the United Nations and to define more clearly its mission in the post-cold-war world. [Excerpts, page A16.] 
Mr. Clinton made only scant reference to Bosnia in the speech, but at a news conference later he spelled out the terms for American troops' participation in a peacekeeping force there. The President's lengthy list of conditions is likely to fuel questions about whether his Administration will ever actually commit the 25,000 troops it has earmarked for peacekeeping in the Balkans.
Mr. Clinton assured the United Nations that the United States would pay its long overdue $400 million bill for peacekeeping operations and another $400 million in unpaid dues. That money is about to be approved by Congress.
But the President, mindful of Congressional concern about rising United Nations costs, emphasized that the United States would no longer continue supporting peacekeeping operations if the world body did not become more discriminating in the jobs it undertakes and did not lower American dues to reflect the United States' diminished economic status relative to Germany, Japan and other industrial states.
The United States, as a permanent member of the Security Council, has a veto over peacekeeping operations, and it has given its blessing to the 17 such missions now going on. In effect, Mr. Clinton's comments were a warning that the United States would increasingly weigh fiscal considerations among others in deciding whether to support a new operation. This would presumably go some way toward meeting Congressional concerns.
When asked at his news conference about his terms for peacekeeping in Bosnia, Mr. Clinton said:
"I would want a clear understanding what the command and control was. I would want the NATO commander in charge of the operation. I would want a clear timetable for the first review and ultimately for the right to terminate American involvement. I would want a clear political strategy along with a military strategy. After all, there will be more than soldiers involved in this. And I would want a clear expression of support from the United States Congress. Now, there are 20 other operational things I would want, but those are the big policy issues."
The President added that he would also want to know "exactly what our financial responsibilities were."
"We have to know how we are going to fund it," he said, "and then we would have to know that others were going to do their part as well."
Mr. Clinton suggested that such tough criteria should also be adopted by the United Nations.
"The United Nations simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world's conflicts," he said. "If the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say no."
 
U.N. 'Not a Magic Wand'
 After Mr. Clinton's speech, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, did not sound pleased.
"It must be understood that there will be failures as well as successes," he said at a news conference. "The U.N. is not a magic wand. The problems before us cannot be solved quickly. Staying power is crucial. If the forces of chaos and confusion conclude that the U.N. is short of breath, they will prevail simply by waiting for the world to turn its attention elsewhere."
Mr. Clinton also said he was "committed to work with the U.N." to reduce the United States' share of its budget.
"The assessment system has not been changed since 1973," he said. "And everyone in our country knows that our percentage of the world's economic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I believe our rates should be reduced to reflect the rise of other nations that can now bear more of the financial burden. That will make it easier for me as President to make sure we pay in a timely and full fashion."
America currently pays a 30.4 percent share of the United Nations budget and wants to go down to 25 percent.
 
Speech's Delivery Subdued
 Mr. Clinton's speech seemed to capture his ambivalent impulses on foreign policy. It began with soaring language about Washington's commitment to continued world leadership and ended with a discussion of overdue bills and a warning that the will of the United Nations had begun to outpace the United States wallet.
For anyone who watched Mr. Clinton deliver his speech on health care before a joint session of Congress last Wednesday, today's address from the marble podium of the United Nations sounded flat, with a subdued delivery, few memorable phrases and only one interruption for applause in 45 minutes. Mr. Clinton was clearly much more animated talking about health care at a Queens diner on Sunday than he was today talking to heads of state, foreign ministers and United Nations ambassadors about arms control.
"Domestic renewal is an overdue tonic," Mr. Clinton said. "But isolationism and protectionism are still poison. We must inspire our people to look beyond their immediate fears toward a broader horizon."
"I know many people ask whether the United States plans to retreat or remain active in the world, and if active, to what end," he continued. "Many people are asking that in our own country as well. Let me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I can. The United States plans to remain engaged and to lead."
The major new proposals in the President's speech revolved around what needed to be done to enlarge the family of free-market democracies and protect them from three major post-cold-war threats: weapons proliferation, regional ethnic conflicts and environmental degradation.
 
The Treaty Clinton Wants
 "We will pursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear weapons," Mr. Clinton said. "Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and highly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear terrorism for all nations. We will press for an international agreement that would ban production of these materials for weapons forever."
Aides said that the President envisions a treaty that prohibits the production of highly enriched uranium or plutonium for nuclear explosives purposes outside of international safeguards.
In addition, Mr. Clinton said, "as we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States has also begun negotiations toward a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing."
"This summer I declared that to facilitate these negotiations, our nation would suspend our testing if all other nuclear states would do the same."
Then, in what Presidential aides said was a clear warning to China, which intelligence reports suggest is preparing a nuclear test, Mr. Clinton added, "Today, in the face of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear states to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop nuclear testing for all time."
 
U.N. Overhaul Is Asked
 To confront the threat of regional conflicts, Mr. Clinton called for an overhaul of the United Nations, including the establishment of a command and control center at the United Nations to keep track of its 80,000 peacekeeping troops now spread out in 17 operations on four continents and a general rethinking of the United Nations' peacekeeping role.
"In recent weeks in the Security Council," he said, "our nation has begun asking harder questions about proposals for new peacekeeping missions. Is there a real threat to international peace? Does the proposed mission have clear objectives? Can an exit point be identified for those who will be asked to participate? How much will the mission cost? From now on, the United Nations should address these and other hard questions for every proposed mission before we vote and before the mission begins."
At a news conference after his private talks with Japan's new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, Mr. Clinton was asked to be more specific about what United Nations operations he would oppose.
"I wouldn't say that any of the peacekeeping operations here are ill-founded," Mr. Clinton said. "But there are limits to how many things we can do. There are going to be a lot of chaotic situations. We had another development in Georgia today. And we may or may not be able to see the U.N. go into every one of these circumstances. That's the only point I wanted to make.
"In Somalia, I think we did go in with our eyes open. I think we did essentially what we meant to do. I just think we may have underestimated the difficulty of setting in motion a political transition."
On reforming the United Nations, Mr. Clinton said he fully endorsed efforts by Mr. Boutros-Ghali to reduce the organization's bureaucracy.
"Now we must all do even more to root out waste," the President said. "Before this General Assembly is over, let us establish a strong mandate for an Office of Inspector General so that it can attain a reputation for toughness, for integrity, for effectiveness. Let us build new confidence among our people that the United Nations is changing with the needs of our times."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Job Losses in Health Plan Are Denied

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Recognizing that in this day and age the econometric study is mightier than the sword, the Clinton Administration has begun fighting back against reports concluding that its health care plan will cause huge job losses.
One study, largely financed by companies that do not provide health insurance for their employees, asserts that requiring employers to pay for health coverage would wipe out 3.1 million jobs. Another study, sponsored by the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobbying group, estimates that such costs would put 12.7 million jobs at risk and cause one million layoffs. 
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview that the studies were "incorrect," adding, "They're based on questionable assumptions and they didn't factor in our subsidies for small business."
Gene Sperling, an assistant to the President for economic policy, called the studies "bogus" and "inaccurate."
 
Research Called Sloppy
 And in a letter to the study estimating 3.1 million lost jobs, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, sounded like the economics professor she used to be as she chided the authors for what she viewed as sloppy research. She said, for example, that the study ignored how the plan would hold down health costs for companies large and small, enabling them to expand.
These officials also said the studies overlooked how President Clinton's plan might create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in certain areas by, for example, expanding home-based health care.
"There are some things in the plan we think will increase employment," Ms. Tyson said in an interview. "There are some factors that will reduce employment, and there are things that would change the composition of employment. When we weigh all these things, we believe the net effect on the total of jobs will be small."
 
'Dr. Kevorkian Prescription'
 Republicans have seized on the studies as Exhibit No. 1 to oppose that part of Mr. Clinton's plan to require all businesses to pay part of the cost of insurance for their employees.
"We're likely to lose 3.1 million jobs because of this plan," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, chairman of the House Republican Conference. "The plan is really a Dr. Kevorkian prescription for the jobs of American working men and women."
As so often happens when Government proposes a new burden on employers, business lobbyists are howling -- not that the mandate will eat into their profits (that wins little sympathy), but that it will force them to lay off their workers.
Small-business opponents of the plan requiring employers to buy health coverage make a straightforward economics argument: it would increase the cost of labor. And when labor becomes more expensive, employers are not able to afford as much of it. The result: layoffs and fewer new hirings, especially among low-wage workers.
"From what I'm hearing from businesses, my anecdotal instincts tell me that the estimate of three million job losses is a low number," said Richard Berman, executive director of the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed research organization that sponsored the study estimating 3.1 million jobs would be lost. "There are over 700,000 restaurants in the U.S.; if each restaurant cuts back one job on average, that gives you almost 25 percent of the total."
 
Small-Business Subsidies
 The Administration's biggest complaint with the studies is that they ignore the subsidies to help small businesses afford insurance premiums. When two professors from Baruch College, June and Dave O'Neill, did the study for the Employment Policies Institute, they estimated that small, low-wage companies like restaurants and retailers that do not now offer insurance would have to spend more than $4,000 per worker in health care premiums for many low-wage workers, equal to more than 30 percent of their wages.
Administration officials note that the President's plan would place a ceiling on what businesses pay. Under the plan, many small businesses with low-wage workers would receive Federal subsidies, so they would pay no more than 3.5 percent of their payrolls.
"For a worker earning the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, our cap would cost just 15 cents an hour more," Secretary Reich said. "That shouldn't cause much in the way of layoffs."
Ms. O'Neill and Wilbur Steger, an author of the study estimating a loss of one million jobs, conceded that the figures they used differed from those in the plan announced by the President. But they said they made the best estimates they could with the information available.
The two economists contended that the Clinton plan would cause far greater job losses among small businesses than the Administration predicts. They said the Administration would have problems finding money to pay for the tens of billions of dollars in subsidies planned for small businesses.
In early versions of the Clinton plan, before the subsidies were added, Administration officials estimated that the requirement that employers buy health coverage might cause small businesses to lay off 200,000 to 700,000 workers. But with the subsidies, one official estimated it would cost about 150,000 jobs at small businesses that do not now provide health insurance.
"That represents one month's worth of job creation," one Administration economist said. "Isn't that worth it when what we gain in return is health security for all Americans and an end to spiraling health care costs?"

Squeezing Models' Fees
Picking on models is like shooting fish in a barrel. Few want to drum up sympathy for people who are beautiful, are fodder for gossip columnists, travel to exotic places and can earn $10,000 a day until they retire to marry rock stars. 
 Of course, $10,000 a day is outrageous. Absurd.
Until someone pays it. Then it is the fair market price.
Now, American designers are trying to tinker with that market. Women's Wear Daily, the trade newspaper, reported last week on secret meetings on model pay scales held by the Seventh on Sixth Corporation, the group formed to organize a showing of New York collections in Bryant Park from Oct. 31 to Nov. 6. The meetings were attended by Fern Mallis, executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, as well as by modeling agency representatives and designers like Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Isaac Mizrahi and Nicole Miller.
The designers, complaining that models are the single biggest cost they incur in staging runway extravaganzas, want to force agencies to cut fees from $750 an hour to $250.
"It's not a restraint-of-trade issue," Ms. Mallis said. "We're working closely with attorneys. Seventh on Sixth is an organization for this purpose."
Ms. Mallis said costs for all runway-show services, from electricity to tent design, are negotiated. The difference is that with models, fees are based on a combination of the client's ability to pay and the status of the model. So the designers most affected by model costs aren't the young upstarts, who often barter clothes for fees, but the big names.
Some in the design industry say there are plenty more pertinent issues for Seventh on Sixth to take on.
"It takes you an hour to cross Sixth Avenue now," said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller. "Imagine crossing by Bryant Park with 2,000 cars trying to make a show on time."
Mr. Konheim said of the show organizers: "Everything they're doing is great, but they're trying to handle too many things. As far as I'm concerned you pay models what they ask or you don't use them. If a model asks us for $10,000, we have to pass because we can't afford it."
Bethann Hardison, a former model and owner of the Bethann Management Company, said: "There are young women you represent that work for $150 an hour and some that are $750 an hour. It goes the gamut. Runway costs don't begin and end with the cost of models. You can have a show and do it all kinds of ways."
Ms. Karan said in Women's Wear Daily: "I have a problem giving young people that kind of money. It's immoral."
Some people feel the same way about paying $2,000 for a dress. What do they do about it? They don't buy it.
There is something unsettling about an industry trying to save money through monopoly tactics.
Why should some models get $10,000 for a day's work? Because in a free market economy they sometimes can. Just as some designers get $2,000 for a dress because they can.
 
Hollywood Deconstruction
 Designers can only dream about models who illustrate their vision as convincingly as the leading lady of the new film by Tim Burton, who also directed "Batman Returns." Sally, the female lead of the new film, "Nightmare Before Christmas," is so deconstructed that her hands and legs detach with the yank of a thread. Her dress is the rough-sewn patchwork sort that has been appearing regularly on runways, a trapezoid of tweed here, a swatch of stripe there.
Three years in the making, "Nightmare Before Christmas" is an elaborate stop-action animation movie, and the beguiling Sally is a 15-inch painted puppet molded from latex.
"Tim Burton, let's face it, he's into stitches," said Kelly Asbury, an assistant art director who worked on the Sally character. "You saw it on Catwoman in 'Batman Returns.' Sally was a rag doll-slash-cadaver, and the stitching goes along with that. She sews her own clothes, and she's made her wardrobe from scraps of cloth. The idea was, since she's scraps of flesh, why not make her clothes from scraps?"
"Maybe Sally will help that deconstruction movement go forward," Mr. Asbury said. "She's actually the epitome of grunge, because she's made of nothing but scrap inside and out."
 
African Silhouette
 The Nigerian-born Lola Faturoti doesn't have just her name on the label of her clothes in Charivari. Outlined like a thrown shadow is her elegant silhouette. "I wanted it to be clear that this is an African woman who designed this line," she said.
Like another rising African star, Lamine Kouyate, Ms. Faturoti has strong memories of childhood: "My granny designed for the village, and she would make me pick out panels of fabric to stitch together to add to something she was making. As a kid, I hated doing it, but it gave me a real knowledge of fabric." Her collection in Charivari is a mix of muted, dour shades, and fabrics shiny enough to draw a magpie.
Ms. Faturoti is a Charivari saleswoman being nurtured, like Marc Jacobs once was, by the store while she sews clothes in her apartment. A regular customer, Holly Solomon, is giving her gallery to Ms. Faturoti for her first runway show, on Oct. 28.
 
Pinning Down Punk
 Gianni Versace is putting his stamp on the return of punk, right down to the safety pins, which he's designed with his signature Medusa's head.
"There is plenty that is classic Versace, very safe and very nice," he said, calling from Milan, where he is preparing the collection for its show next Sunday. "But there will be little punk details. When it's punk, it's very colorful punk, never black like it used to be when kids started it in London." In honor of the subtle touches, Mr. Versace's sister and muse, Donatella, will give a punk party after the show. The invitation calls for black leather, which is experiencing its own revival.
"Punk was a revolution when it started," Mr. Versace said. "Today, you can't talk of revolution. You talk of attitude. This is a mixture between royalty and punk everyone can wear, like a black pullover with a Medusa pin, very designer."
He added: "This is a fresh summer punk. Nothing to do with old punk."

HEADLINE: Bahrain Group Wins Battle With Gucci for Full Control

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Maurizio Gucci, renowned through the world for loafers and lawsuits, agreed today to surrender his remaining share in the fashion goods company his grandfather founded to an investment bank that has sought full control of the company.
The announcement, in a joint statement by Mr. Gucci and Investcorp, a Bahrain-based merchant bank, ends a drawn-out feud for control of Gucci, whose horse-bit shoe buckles and double-G logo provided the original paradigm for designer labels. For Italians, depressed by a web of political and business scandals, the surrender of Gucci appeared to signal the loss of one of the nation's crown jewels. 
 Mr. Gucci and Investcorp said they had reached a "friendly and amicable solution" for the bank to acquire Mr. Gucci's 50 percent share in the business. But the pact brought to an end a tangled legal drama, with suits and countersuits, charges of mismanagement and breach of trust that wore down Gucci executives and brought repeated pressures on the company's financial state.
Neither Mr. Gucci nor Investcorp, which is owned by investors throughout the Arab world, would say how much money would change hands. The Financial Times reported that Investcorp paid $170 million, about what it paid in 1988 and 1989 for an initial 50 percent stake in Gucci, but the figure could not be confirmed.
Gucci, with headquarters in Milan, Italy, was founded in Florence in 1922 by Maurizio Gucci's grandfather, Guccio Gucci. It sells apparel, leather goods and accessories that it manufactures in its own workshops or under licensing and marketing agreements.
In recent months, with the recession biting into sales of the company's luxury items, and legal struggles crimping its management, the bloom has been off Gucci's rose. To stanch the losses, Mr. Gucci brought in fresh faces, like Dawn Mello, the former president and driving fashion force at Bergdorf Goodman in New York. The company also set up a new design team around Richard Lambertson, a New Yorker and formerly an assistant to Geoffrey Beene. At a news conference this summer, Gucci announced it had trimmed its net loss in 1992 to the equivalent of $17 million, from $25 million a year earlier.
Analysts who took a closer look at the agreement today concluded that the Guccis had behaved like many other Italian family-owned concerns. The efforts to clean up the business came after decades of dithering, complicated by refusals to take the company public, and bitter Gucci family quarreling that included a 1988 Milan court conviction of Maurizio Gucci for attempted tax fraud.
In the end, Investcorp, which also owns stakes in Chaumet of Paris and Saks Fifth Avenue, lost patience with Mr. Gucci. In July, it filed suits in New York State Supreme Court charging that Mr. Gucci violated shareholder agreements by running the business as though he alone owned it, and by pledging his own shares in collateral for millions of dollars in personal loans.
Besides the suits with Investcorp, Mr. Gucci has been entangled in legal proceedings with Gucci America, the United States unit, which accounts for roughly half the group's business.
Today's announcement said Mr. Gucci would surrender all management and supervisory functions within the group, though he would be retained as a "senior adviser" to Investcorp's chairman and chief executive, Nemir Kirdar, a former Chase Manhattan banker. That move may have sweetened the pill financially for Mr. Gucci by providing annual consultancy fees.
The announcement also said that legal disputes between Gucci America and the Gucci group in Italy "will also be resolved promptly."
Investcorp said it planned to inject fresh capital into Gucci and to reorganize the group into a "cohesive worldwide organization."
In August, cash flow problems related to the legal battles forced Gucci to delay by up to a week pay to its 800 Italian employees.

HEADLINE: Administration Plans New Export Initiative

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton is about to introduce an aggressive national export policy aimed at using 19 Federal agencies to help manufacturers compete in foreign markets, Administration officials said today.
The new policy calls for a quick lifting of controls on some high-technology exports, the opening of Federal export assistance offices and more overseas lobbying by the President and Cabinet officials on behalf of American companies. 
 The policy calls for a redirection of Federal export credits toward manufacturers, but not until the 1995 fiscal year. Ronald H. Brown, Commerce Secretary, said that the money for industry would not necessarily come from Agriculture Department export programs. But he acknowledged, "About 80 percent of our export promotion dollars have been spent on agricultural products, which represent 10 percent of our exports."
Shifting export finance money to manufacturing would require Congressional approval, something that has stymied past efforts by legislators from industrial states. Large sums of export assistance money, mostly for American farm products, could be freed up if a world trade agreement is reached this year.
And if the White House gives its assent in the next two days, the export policy will also include the creation of a new lending program to help American exporters with low-interest, long-term loans.
President Clinton is scheduled to announce the plan, dubbed the National Export Strategy, at a White House ceremony on Wednesday.
The plan will especially benefit small-business owners and Californians, two groups in which the Administration wants to rebuild political support. Small businesses have led criticisms of the President's health plan, while Mr. Clinton's public approval ratings have plunged in California as the economy there remains more sluggish than that of the nation.
California companies account for 40 percent of all requests to the Commerce Department for permission to export computers and other high-technology products that may have military applications. They have been among the leaders in an corporate lobbying effort this summer for a relaxation of export controls.
To help small and medium-sized businesses, the Administration also plans to set up at least four export assistance offices outside Washington, most likely in state capitals, and hopes to expand to as many as 60 offices within a year. The Commerce Department, the Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Small Business Administration will provide information and process applications for export financing at the offices, which will be intended to help businesses without staffs in Washington.
Large corporations currently account for two-thirds of American exports. With the export initiative, Mr. Brown said, "this Administration has demonstrated beyond any doubt that it will stand shoulder to shoulder with American business."
The President alluded to one element of the plan in his speech at the United Nations today, when he indicated that the United States would eliminate many controls on American high-technology exports to former Eastern bloc countries.
An interagency committee has recommended that as part of the National Export Strategy, the White House should create a new lending program at the Ex-Im Bank that would provide long-term, low-interest loans to American exporters, matching similar programs overseas. But the recommendation was not unanimous, and the White House has not yet made a decision, said Kenneth Brody, the president of the Ex-Im Bank, which is a Federal agency.
 
Controversy on Financing
 The lending program is a contentious issue because several Administrations have sought to limit similar programs abroad, contending that they amount to government subsidies that distort international markets. Mr. Brody said this afternoon that by creating such a program in the United States, the Clinton Administration would have more influence in seeking international limits on such lending.
The Bush Administration negotiated a 24-nation pact two years ago that set broad limits on subsidized export finance programs. Mr. Brody and Mr. Brown said that the new American program, if instituted, would comply with the pact.
Most loans by the Export-Import Bank are now made at market interest rates with short maturities.
With the exception of the possible lending program, much of the initiative represents a continuation and expansion of Bush Administration efforts. For example, the number of export shipments subject to Commerce Department controls has already fallen by three-quarters in the last seven years, as a succession of Commerce Secretaries have decided that many exports no longer pose a national security risk with the end of the cold war.
But many American companies and trade experts have contended for years that the United States is less effective than its trading rivals in promoting exports, costing American jobs in the process. Mr. Brody said that the National Export Strategy was too broad to be considered a continuation of the Bush Administration's less coordinated efforts.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Make New Gains

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices shot higher yesterday and yields fell as traders and investors seemed to focus on the positive story for the bond market: continued slow growth and low inflation.
The mood swing was enough to push the yield on the 30-year bond below 6 percent again, just four trading days after selling had pushed the yield up to 6.12 percent. 
 But just as the selloff last Tuesday was not enough to convince analysts to declare an end to the bond rally that pushed yields to 25-year lows, yesterday's buying was not enough to make anyone conclude that the market was back on track.
 
Long Bond Yielding 5.94%
 "For the whole first half of the year, and through Sept. 15, we have has a market with interest rates trending down," said John Costas, managing director for government trading and sales at the First Boston Corporation. "Now it is a trendless market. And you will have these ebbs and flows." Sept. 15 was the day after the bond market was jolted by an unexpected three-tenths of a percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for August.
The price of the 30-year bond was up 18/32 point as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.94 percent, from 6.03 percent on Friday. The yield on the 10-year note dropped to 5.28 percent from 5.38 percent, and the yield on the two-year note fell to 3.78 percent from 3.88 percent.
The yield on the 30-year bond is now within easy striking distance of the 25-year closing low of 5.86 percent that it touched on Sept. 8. A rise of just 15/32 point in the price of the bond would bring the yield back to that low. That is less than the price jumped yesterday.
The yields of Treasury notes are also now near their recent lows. The 25-year low of 5.22 percent on the 10-year note was reached on Sept. 8. And the recent low on the two-year note, of 3.69 percent, was hit on Sept. 3.
But Mr. Costas thinks that once these levels are neared, the market will sell off again, while investors wait for the September employment report, due on Oct. 8, and the September consumer inflation data, due on Oct. 15. Those reports will indicate whether the low-inflation, slow-growth pattern that propelled the rally is still a good bet.
The positive mood yesterday was, in part, a result of a report on Friday that the Federal Reserve had shifted in its August policy-making meeting to a neutral stand on short-term interest rates from its bias toward raising short-term rates that it established in May. The shift was disclosed in minutes, released on Friday, of the August meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
The shift especially helped short-term Treasury notes, as it removed any lingering concern that the Fed might move soon to raise short-term interest rates. It also signaled that the Fed was comfortable again with the inflation outlook. The Fed's short-term interest rate target of 3 percent has been unchanged for more than a year.
The policy shift also seemed to help the weekly Treasury auction of three-and six-month bills. The average discount rate of 2.90 percent for the three-month bill and 3.02 percent for the six-month bill were both the lowest since the May 10 auction.
But while this policy shift could help shorter maturities, it was a little more difficult for some analysts to explain why prices were up so much in the long end of the market. "I am a little surprised that the long end of the market took such a leap today," said Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
 
Speculation About Brazil
 Some traders attributed the rally to speculation that Brazil was buying 30-year bonds to turn them into zero-coupon bonds to be used as collateral in a debt deal with commercial banks. But the Finance Minister of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said in Washington that the country would not be buying these bonds in the secondary market but would get them in a special private deal from the United States Treasury.
Mr. Costas of First Boston noted that the Brazilians, if they were buying the bonds in the secondary market, would be unlikely to say so publicly, effectively raising the price they would have to pay.
Further buttressing the long bond was a decline in the Commodity Research Bureau index of commodities, a barometer of inflationary pressures. It fell as much as two points during the day.
Still, at least one forecaster, Mr. Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin, was unwilling to conclude that inflation has been tamed. He is predicting that when the report is released on Friday, the index of leading economic indicators for August will spike nine-tenths of a percent, the largest monthly increase since December. This kind of jump could prompt selling because the buying today seemed to be based on an assumption that the economy is still moving sluggishly ahead and inflation is sticking around 3 percent.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
A Road to Pure Water Paved With Anxieties

BYLINE: By George Judson

DATELINE: MARGARETVILLE, N.Y.

 BODY:
LEONARD UTTER has a fat scrapbook of photographs to remind him of his hometown and of the way life used to be. But lately he doesn't need the pictures. With drought lowering reservoirs throughout the Catskills, all he has to do is drive to the end of his road and walk through the woods and look down on the flat, dry bottom of the upper Pepacton Reservoir.
There he can see the foundations of houses that once made up Arena, the village where Utters lived for generations until New York City came and destroyed the community to build the reservoir. Some images never fade. He and his wife, Betty, still see the smoke billowing out of the valley of the East Branch of the Delaware River in 1953, as Arena's bulldozed homes were burned. 
 "I'm very bitter," Mr. Utter said. "The land under the reservoir was the very best land, the bottom land. When the Pepacton was filled, and then the Cannondale, they cut the heart right out of Delaware County."
New York City is much on the minds of people in the Catskills these days as it moves to adopt new regulations to protect the water that drains into its reservoirs. The regulations also will affect large areas east of the Hudson, but it is here that the memories are strongest, the anxieties greatest, the opposition loudest.
It is here, in a sparsely populated mountain region where New York shades into Appalachia, that people can imagine what is inconceivable in the settled suburbs of Westchester: that the city, in its pursuit of pure water, could break their tenuous grip on the land.
"A lot of those people were never seen again," Mr. Utter said of Arena's residents. "The older people, undoubtedly, suffered the worst. Sure they were compensated for their homes, but they had no reason to move. They didn't want to move. A lot of them didn't live too much longer."
This time, New York City is not seeking to displace anyone. To avoid a Federal order to build a filtration plant costing billions, it needs to insure that people within its vast watersheds do not pollute the source of the drinking water for nine million people in the city and neighboring communities.
Sewage treatment plants and septic systems must work properly. Manure and fertilizer can't wash off farms into rivers. When it rains, parking lots shouldn't flush their debris into streams.
No one here is opposed to clean water. "It's our water first," said Michael Finberg, who owns the bowling alley on Route 28 in tiny Arkville. "We drink it. We wash in it."
But it requires almost an act of imagination, in addition to a three-hour drive, to go from the city to the source of its water and to understand how the people here live. David Taylor invited the city's Environmental Commissioner, Albert F. Appleton, to his dairy farm to show him what one rule would mean.
The rule called for farm fields to end 200 feet from the nearest stream. On hillside farms like the Taylors's, brooks run down many fields. Mr. Appleton could see what removing 400-foot swaths would do to a farm, and his department threw out its farm rules and began working with farmers on a new approach.
"They thought we were shoveling our manure directly into streams, but most farmers today are pretty good environmentalists," Mr. Taylor said.
Mr. Appleton is generally considered sympathetic, for someone from the city. But people worry that the New Yorkers he answers to, the budget officials and the Brooklyn politicians and the world-famous man on the street, don't know or care what a sewage treatment plant could cost a village like Fleischmanns, a village of 351 whose Main Street hangs over the Bushkill.
The city says it will help pay for what needs to be done. In Delaware County, where 47,000 people are spread over 1,460 square miles (imagine Manhattan if it had only 800 people), the city said it would pay for improvements to the plant in nearby Hobart, but not the extra $20,000 a year needed to operate the plant. What is $20,000 to the city? What is it to a village of 400?
"That got across the county in half a day," Mr. Taylor said.
Nearly 30 percent of the county receives some form of public assistance. Property taxes can be high. Residents doubt that the profligate city understands how thinly they are stretched, how small a margin keeps them on their land.
Mr. Finberg is the designated optimist for Middletown, which includes Margaretville and Fleischmanns. He leads a committee drafting a plan for the town, with the city's financial help, to protect both its water and its economic life.
He says the city and the watershed towns must work together. It may help that he is not a native, that he never saw the lost villages. He finds it hard to believe that one community, today, could destroy another.
"Fleischmanns is right there on the stream," he said. "What are we going to do, shut Fleischmanns down? That's ridiculous."

HEADLINE: Bonds Help to Lift Stocks; Dow Rises 24.59

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
After a trading week in which the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst loss in more than seven months, stocks were pushed higher yesterday by a sharp increase in bond prices.
The Dow closed at 3,567.70, up 24.59, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index closed at 461.80, up 4.17. For the third day in a row, the Nasdaq composite index hit a record high, closing at 759.95, up 5.30. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange eased to 244.9 million shares, from 248.3 million shares on Friday. Advancing stocks topped decliners, 13 to 7.
Analysts said that the surge in stock prices followed the rise in the price of bonds and the corresponding fall in bond yields. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped yesterday to 5.94 percent from 6.03 percent Friday. These advances came, moreover, despite the uncertainty over the political battle in Russia between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Parliament.
"The catalyst was the announcement by the Federal Reserve that it was pursuing a neutral monetary policy," said John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president of Advest, Inc. "There had been a fear that the Fed might tighten up."
Mr. Shaughnessy said that "if short-term rates stay at around 3 percent, it will be positive for equities," adding, "So the market breathed a sigh of relief yesterday."
Oil stocks enjoyed one of the day's strongest rallies, after reports that OPEC had agreed to an oil production ceiling in the fourth quarter of 24.5 million barrels a day. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are currently producing at a level of 24.7 million barrels a day.
Among the big oil companies showing gains were Chevron, up 2 1/8, to 93 1/4; Amoco, up 1, to 55; Royal Dutch Petroleum, up 1 3/8, to 100 1/4, and British Petroleum, up 1 1/2, to 57 5/8.
Many stocks in other groups that benefit from low-interest rates also advanced yesterday. For example, prices of regional banking companies increased, including Shawmut, up 1, to 26; Signet, up1/4, to 33 1/2; Keycorp, up 1/2, to 38 1/8, and PNC, up 7/8, to 30 1/2.
Similarly, some of the multiline insurance companies were higher. Among them were American International Group, which rose 2 1/4, to 99 1/2, and Cigna, up 1, to 64 1/4.
Another gainer was Motorola, which closed at 102 1/2, up 3. In conjunction with two other companies, the big semiconductor manufacturer announced a new product and a new development system
But the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company moved against the tide, falling 1 to 26 3/4. The supermarket chain's earnings for its fiscal second quarter dropped to 15 cents a share from 20 cents a share in the period a year ago -- and below the median analyst forecast of 25 cents a share.
Also declining were the Mead Corporation and Alco Standard after Merrill Lynch downgraded its investment rating on the two companies. Mead dropped 1/2, to 42 1/8, while Alco Standard fell 3, to 43 1/4.

HEADLINE: Missing Millions -- Kuwait's Bad Bet -- A special report.;
Big Wallets and Little Supervision

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
During the late 1980's, when Spain was booming, Kuwait came shopping for corporations and investments, got a little carried away and plowed $5 billion into paper, chemical and fertilizer companies, as well as two leaning office towers whose bizarre silhouette dominates the Madrid skyline.
But now Spain's boom has turned to bust, the Kuwaiti corporate flagship here is in receivership, many of its businesses have closed, more than 20,000 jobs have been lost and the office towers are not even completed much less occupied. As for the investment, it has become the object of countless lawsuits disputing how the money disappeared. 
 Kuwaiti authorities contend that between $500 million and $1 billion was stolen, and the balance of the $5 billion squandered through egregious mismanagement, in what amounts to Europe's biggest financial scandal since the collapse of Robert Maxwell's media empire in 1991.
Much fog still surrounds what has become known in Spain as the KIO scandal (pronounced KEY-oh), after the Kuwait Investment Office.
At the center of the scandal is a sprawling Spanish conglomerate called Grupo Torras managed by a maverick Spanish financier with a dubious record named Javier De la Rosa. Over a six-year period, from 1986 to 1992, the London-based KIO put about $5 billion of Kuwait's oil wealth into building Torras.
Now, Grupo Torras has filed for protection from its creditors and is being run by court-appointed administrators. Its main holdings -- the largest Spanish chemical group, Ercros, the biggest paper producer, Torras-Papel, and the real estate group Prima -- lie in ruins.
A lawsuit filed on April 14 in London by the law firm of Baker & McKenzie, America's largest, on behalf of the new Kuwaiti management of Grupo Torras, was made available to The New York Times. The suit contends that through the use of various shell companies, fictitious loans, fraud and embezzlement, the former Torras management conspired to steal at least $500 million between May 1988 and May 1992.
The main targets of the suit are the former chairman of KIO, Sheik Fahad Mohammed al-Sabah, who is a cousin of the Emir of Kuwait and is now living in the Bahamas; Fouad Khaled Jaffar, the former general manager of the investment office, who is in London, and Mr. De La Rosa, a director of Torras and the mastermind of its investments.
"There is enormous anger here at this scandal and a feeling that money was just stolen," said Abdallah al-Nobari, an opposition leader of the Kuwaiti Parliament. "It seems that some members of the Kuwaiti royal family just helped themselves in a financial grab equivalent to Saddam Hussein's invasion."
 
The Damage
Unfinished Towers Become a Symbol
 The havoc wreaked on the Spanish economy is enormous. From his 11th-floor office at the Economy Ministry, where he oversees foreign transactions, Fernando Eguidazu looks out on the two immense, unfinished office towers hovering over the Paseo de la Castellana, the Park Avenue of Madrid. Named "the gateway of Europe," and conceived as showpieces of Spain's boom, the towers now stand as symbols of the Spanish bust.
"Even if the towers were rebuilt," Mr. Eguidazu said, with a moroseness that has become uniform in Spain as the economy has dived, "what the hell would you do with them?"
In a city full of shuttered restaurants and "For Rent" signs on office blocks, there is no ready answer. But for the Kuwaiti officials and their lawyers seeking to discover just what became of their multibillion-dollar Spanish investments, the fate of the $283 million towers is a mere detail in a mind-boggling disaster.
What these officials want is justice and, if possible, a few billion dollars back.
Unlike the Kuwait Investment Office's previous conservative investments in blue-chip companies like Daimler-Benz of Germany, its Spanish operation was restlessly aggressive. Starting as a troubled paper company, Torras quickly grew into one of Spain's largest industrial conglomerates and an active player in the country's surging stock market. At the same time, KIO made heavy investments in British Petroleum in London that have now placed the organization at the center of a separate tax-fraud scandal.
 
Plaintiff's Version
 Two opposing versions of Kuwait's Spanish debacle exist. The first -- whose essence is that Kuwait was heavily defrauded over several years in a Spanish scam coordinated between KIO in London and Mr. De La Rosa in Spain -- is outlined in the London lawsuit.
"We intend to follow the London suit with other suits in Spain," said Sara Blazquez, a spokeswoman for the new Kuwaiti management of Grupo Torras. "Our best estimate is that about $950 million was simply stolen and is in the pocket of somebody. The balance of the $5 billion investment was lost through colossal mismanagement. Kuwait was robbed by its people at the KIO working with Mr. De La Rosa."
 
Defendant's View
Kuwaiti Politics Gets the Blame
 That account of events is vigorously contested by the 45-year-old Mr. De la Rosa, who left Torras in May 1992 to resume his financial activities in the Barcelona area.
Sitting on a salmon-colored sofa in his luxurious Madrid apartment, Mr. De la Rosa insisted between meditative puffs on a soggy Havana clutched in his tremulous hand that he was an innocent victim in a political plot.
He said that opposition figures in Kuwait, bolstered by their electoral gains last year, grew determined to attack the Kuwaiti royal family by implicating them in the Spanish disaster. Chief among their targets were the former KIO chairman, Sheik Fahad, and the Finance Minister during the gulf war, Sheik Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, who then oversaw KIO's activities. The two men, who are first cousins, are members of the royal family.
"I am just one way for these people to attack the Emir and his cousins," Mr. De la Rosa declared.
 
Making $40 Million
 He added that he had acted throughout on instructions from KIO in London and had done nothing illegal. His personal profits from his dealings with the Kuwaitis amounted to $40 million over six years -- "not bad, I agree," -- earned legitimately, he insisted, through commissions paid to his personal investment group, Quail Espana, for investment advice to Grupo Torras.
Mr. De la Rosa's case has gained some support in Spain. Three attempts by lawyers hired by Kuwait to bring criminal charges for embezzlement, falsification of accounts and other crimes against the Spanish financier and the former London-based management of KIO have been rejected by a Barcelona judge. An appeal is pending.
 
Official View
Madrid Says, 'We Told You So'
 An investigation into the Kuwaiti disaster by the Spanish Government has also disclosed no irregularities, although stock exchange authorities are still investigating.
Almost all the Kuwaiti investments in Spain were made through two Amsterdam-registered companies, Koolmes Holdings B.V. and Kokmeeuw Holdings B.V., owned by the Kuwait Investment Office through other companies registered in the Dutch Antilles. Because the Netherlands, like Spain, is a member of the European Community, there were no restrictions on investments by these two Dutch companies.
"Opposition politicians here have tried to blame the Socialist Government for the fiasco," said Mr. Eguidazu, the Economy Ministry official, "but there was no official means to control these investments. Moreover, the Spanish Government warned the Kuwait Investment Office early on that Mr. De la Rosa was not reliable. The KIO replied that how they invested was up to them and nothing to do with the Spanish Government. So when the Kuwaitis claimed they were cheated, we had every reason to say, 'We told you so.' "
Certainly, Mr. De la Rosa's record was not without blemishes. In 1986, a Catalan bank, Banco Garriga Nogues, which he had propelled into a heady expansion in agricultural projects, collapsed with bad loans of $800 million. Mr. De la Rosa's apparently reckless management was widely criticized.
None of this appeared to matter to the Kuwaitis, and particularly to the former chairman of KIO, Sheik Fahad, when they started to invest heavily in Spain in 1986.
 
Good Old Days
The Boom Country Of the 1980's
 The country, newly admitted to the European Community, was starting to boom, attracting much American investment, and the charming, garrulous Mr. De la Rosa had won the confidence of the Kuwaitis.
According to Finance Ministry records, Kuwait poured at least $2.5 billion into Spain between 1986 and 1988. With this money, and some borrowings, a struggling paper company called Torras Hostench was converted by 1988 into the publicly traded Grupo Torras, with holdings in chemicals, fertilizer, real estate, food and paper. The group was the largest in Spain not owned either by the Government or a bank.
Its holdings, with the exception of the Ebro food group, were, however, dubious.
"Chemicals, fertilizer and paper were all sectors that were not very competitive," Mr. Eguidazu said. But as the Spanish economy boomed, and stock prices climbed, few people paid much attention. Mr. De la Rosa estimates that Kuwait took about $1.5 billion in profits from its Spanish investments between 1986 and 1989.
But, from the outset, it appeared that Grupo Torras was managed more to produce quick financial gains than to become an industrially viable company.
 
Intermediaries
Numerous Links To Tax Havens
 Koolmes and Kokmeeuw, the Dutch companies controlled by KIO, were just 2 of about 200 companies registered in tax havens like Jersey, Gibraltar, the Cayman Islands, Switzerland and the Isle of Man that became heavily involved in Grupo Torras's frenetic web of transactions. The sheer number and inaccessibility of these companies, and the fact that many have since closed, have made investigations difficult.
More often than not, when a transaction occurred, one of these companies would be an intermediary, generally reaping a big profit that lawyers for Kuwait now contend ultimately went to the private accounts of Sheik Fahad, Mr. De la Rosa, Fouad Jaffar and their associates.
For example, in 1987, a Swiss-registered company called GSM Securities bought 119,498 shares of the Ebro food group on the open market for $9.8 million. A few weeks later, after rumors of Kuwaiti interest in Ebro had driven the share price up, these shares were sold to Torras for $19 million. The $9.2 million spread was personal profit for the former management of KIO, Kuwait's lawyers say.
Other operations were bolder. The London lawsuit gives a detailed account of complex dealings in 1989 under which, the suit states, Mr. De la Rosa and a former director of Grupo Torras's London subsidiary Torras Hostench London Ltd., Walid Edmond Moukarzel, arranged two "loans" for a total of $105 million to a Jersey-based company, Oakthorn Ltd, for marketing services that Oakthorn was in fact incapable of performing.
The money disappeared and was, the lawsuit contends, pocketed by the former management of KIO and Grupo Torras.
One supposed loan for $50 million, was arranged this way: According to the lawsuit in London, on June 12, 1990, the peseta equivalent of $50 million was transferred from Grupo Torras's account at the Sumitomo Bank, Barcelona, to the Barclays bank account in London of its subsidiary Torras Hostench. From there, on the same day, it was transferred to an Oakthorn account at the St. Helier, Jersey, branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
 
Spending Is Challenged
 To justify the loan, a Jersey-based accountant named Michael Russell, who was a director of Oakthorn and is a defendant in the London lawsuit, drew up an agreement on July 9, 1990, with Mr. Moukarzel of Torras Hostench London.
This stated that Oakthorn -- in fact a shell company -- had received the money to help it find potential clients to buy some Grupo Torras assets.
The loan was later extended and finally written off in Grupo Torras's accounts. There is no evidence, the plaintiff's lawyers say, that Oakthorn ever performed any of the services it was supposed to.
"There is a pattern of payments and loans from Grupo Torras to shell companies that were never capable of performing the services for which they were allegedly receiving the money," Ms. Blazquez, the spokeswoman for the new Kuwaiti management of Grupo Torras, said. "In all cases, these funds disappeared."
 
The Unraveling
Economy Sours, And Then a War
 By 1990, the rot had set in. The Spanish economy's long boom was beginning to turn to bust. The chemical, paper and real estate industries were particularly hard hit. Grupo Torras, which had been taken private in December 1989, began to crumble. Then, with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, an all-out plundering of the Spanish group appears to have begun.
Certainly, the group's accounts appear to have veered totally out of control.
Kuwaiti money continued to pour into Spain -- close to $2 billion was invested after 1990 -- but quickly disappeared. Jim Roberts, a spokesman for KPMG Peat Marwick, KIO's auditors in London, said that "from 1990 we were unable to sign off on an audit because we were in a total quandary as to the state of KIO's rapidly disintegrating Spanish investments."
Some Torras money, it seems, went to buy political support around the world for Kuwait. "During the gulf war, I am aware of the transfer of about $300 million that was made from the Torras Group in order to make political payments to gain support for the war effort," Mr. De la Rosa said. "But again, I was merely acting on instructions from London."
Not until June 2 of this year, six months after filing for receivership, was Grupo Torras able to sift through the wreckage and send a balance sheet for 1991 and 1992 to the Spanish securities regulators.
The balance sheet showed net losses of $1.6 billion for the two-year period; a plunge in reserves from $1.1 billion in 1990 to a negative $80 million in 1992; a bad-debt provision of $433 million for loans made to shell companies like Oakthorn in 1991 and 1992; and debts of more than $1.5 billion, mainly to KIO, which has had to reimburse international banks that lent to Grupo Torras.
 
Seeking Causes
Few Controls Over Big Sums
 For many who have studied the case closely, the disaster appears attributable essentially to gross mismanagement and corruption. Only after Sheik Fahad was replaced in February 1992 as chairman of KIO by Ali Rashid al-Bader, and Mr. De la Rosa departed three months later, did Kuwait begin a serious attempt to track its huge investments.
"The extraordinary thing in all this is the absence of controls," said Mr. Eguidazu, the Finance Ministry offical. "A dozen Kuwaitis were managing over $70 billion in London with virtually no control. In the end, the people of Kuwait were robbed. In Spain, their money was used chiefly to produce commissions and profits for a few insiders."
Any resolution of the scandal appears a long way off. A final judgment in the London civil suit is probably a year away. Spanish lawyers are still struggling to get judicial approval for their criminal suits.
Mr. De la Rosa has responded with several suits of his own, contending libel and defamation. Investigations by the Kuwaiti Parliament and attorney general are also being pursued.
Anger, both in Kuwait and Spain, is running high. "The Government must take action to bring people to justice," said Mr. Nobari, the Kuwaiti opposition member of Parliament. "What took place was a robbery of the citizens of Kuwait."
As for Mr. De la Rosa, his latest project is a large Disney-style theme park in the Barcelona area, being developed by a company called Gran Peninsula. His minority partner this time is Anheuser-Busch, the gaint American brewer that makes Budweiser beer; Anheuser has a 20 percent stake in Gran Peninsula.
Asked if the company had any qualms about this association, a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch in the United States, Fred Jacob, said he could not comment on Mr. De la Rosa's record.
Mr. De la Rosa, whose left eye is given to a disarming twitch, would say only:
"Look, what happened with KIO was a disaster and a pity. But I have always done my best and tried to give good advice. I am confident the theme park will be a success."
 
KUWAIT'S SPANISH MISADVENTURE
 The sequence of events that bled $5 billion from Kuwait through bungled investments in Spain.
 
1986
A TOEHOLD
The Kuwait Investment Office buys control of Torras Hostench, a troubled Spanish paper maker.
 
1987-1988
A BUYING SPREE
Torras Hostench goes on a buying spree, eventually gaining control of Ebro, a food group, and Ercros, a chemical group formerly called Explosives Rio Tinto, among others.
PAYING FOR IT ALL
A rights issue in June 1987 raises $500 millilon, and the group goes public as Grupo Torras in June 1988, but an attempt to raise capital in December fails. So far, KIO has poured in about $2.5 billion.
 
1989-1990
THE TROUBLE STARTS
KIO takes Grupo Torras in December as a prelude to selling some assets. But Spain's economic boom evaporates and Torras's debts mount.
A GULF WAR CASUALTY
Iraq annexes Kuwait in August 1990, destroying confidence in Grupo Torras. KIO begins pumping in a further $1.8 billion to shore it up.
 
1991-1992
LOSSES AND OUSTERS
Grupo Torras loses $1.6 billion, including more than $400 million in apparent "loans" to shell companies. The chairman of KIO, Sheik Fahad Mohammed al-Sabah, is removed in February 1992; Javier DE la Rosa, the Spanish financier behind grupo Torras's growth, leaves in May.
 
Dec. 1992
$5 BILLION GONE
Grupo Torras files for protection from creditors. Kuwait acknowledges its $5 billion Spanish investment has vanished.
 
1993
SIFTING THE DEBRIS IN THE COURTS
A criminal action is filed in Spain against former Torras management. A judge rejects it, but the order is appealed. The new Kuwait management of Grupo Torras sues the former management in London in May, seeking recovery of over $500 million. The Kuwaiti Parliament's Finance Committee finds eveidence of corruption and gross mismanagement in KIO's handling of Kuwait's Spanish investments and calls for legal action against former managers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up a Bit Against Yen And Falls in Other Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced slightly against the Japanese yen and fell against most European currencies in light trading yesterday. Traders were awaiting the results of President Clinton's meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan and watching the political situation in Russia.
"The market is consolidating and digesting its recent move, awaiting further news," said David Durst, assistant vice president at Credit Lyonnais in New York. 
 The move he referred to was the dollar's rise against the German mark last week after Boris N. Yeltsin seized power in Russia. Investors fear the German economy could suffer if upheaval in Russia means the country can't repay its debts to Germany.
Traders were also awaiting the outcome of President Clinton's meeting with Mr. Hosokawa in New York. It stretched beyond the end of the trading day yesterday.
Jack Griffin, a vice president at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York, said traders were anxious to see the United States reaction to Japanese efforts to reduce the trade imbalance.
The yen's rise in recent months was partly because of a perception that the United States was encouraging a strong yen to shrink its trade deficit. A strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive and imports there cheaper.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 106.27 yen, up 0.22 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, it fell to 105.90 yen, from 106.05 on Friday. In New York, the dollar finished at 106.20 yen, up from 106.00 on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5123, from $1.5035 late Friday. In New York, the pound was trading at $1.5135, more expensive than $1.5082 on Friday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday, were: 1.6290 German marks, down from 1.6395; 1.4220 Swiss francs, down from 1.4285; 5.6730 French francs, down from 5.7108; 1,575.00 Italian lire, down from 1,583.00, and 1.3259 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3196.
Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday, were: 1.6305 German marks, down from 1.6475; 1.4250 Swiss francs, down from 1.4365; 5.6862 French francs, down from 5.7450; 1.8305 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8505; 1,577.50 Italian lire, down from 1,593.50, and 1.3240 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3193.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Down Sharply As Worries on Russia Ease

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices fell sharply yesterday on signs of a calming in the Russian political situation and a lack of inflation signals. Other precious metals also declined.
On other commodity markets, crude oil futures rose, and the coffee, grain and livestock markets all declined. 
 Gold for October delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York fell $3.70, to $353.80 an ounce; September silver dropped 7.1 cents, to $4.045 an ounce.
Precious metals prices have been volatile since last Tuesday, when President Boris N. Yeltsin dissolved the Russian Parliament. Gold finished yesterday at exactly the price it settled at on the previous Monday, before the Russian turmoil began.
"The Russian premium is slowly but surely going out of the metals," said James Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
He said gold was resuming its long-running affair with one of the market's traditional influences, the inflation outlook. Investors tend to buy gold as a defense against rising prices, but the inflation rates in major industrialized nations remain low.
Crude oil futures ended moderately higher after giving up most of the strong gains posted early in the session on news that OPEC had set an overall production cap.
Ministers of the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said they would limit oil production to 24.5 million barrels a day over the next three months. That would hold output to current levels.
Light crude for November delivery finished 16 cents higher at $17.73 a barrel.
December coffee futures tumbled 3.6 cents, to 77.50 cents, a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in reaction to the United States' announcement that it was withdrawing from the International Coffee Organization, a group that major coffee producing and consuming countries established in the 1960's to stabilize coffee prices by imposing export quotas.
Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade, leading grain prices lower as harvest pressure came to bear.
Livestock and meat futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting slackening demand for beef and expectations for large numbers of slaughter-ready animals in the weeks ahead.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Mexican truck manufacturer could be a nifty Nafta play.

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
ADVICE for buying Mexican stocks to play the North American Free Trade Agreement is developing a familiar ring: If you can't handle the risk that the accord will not be approved, which is certain to spark a drop based on emotion rather underlying economics, steer clear. But if you're a long-term investor, then Mexico presents some decent bets.
Stocks often mentioned in the same breath include Telefonos de Mexico, the phone company, and Cementos Mexicanos, the large cement maker. Of course, many others have realized that such stocks have a bright future, considering the need for infrastructure to support Mexico's expanding economy, and have already bid those stocks up. 
 A lesser-known Mexican company among American investors is Consorcio G Grupo Dina, the country's biggest truck and bus manufacturer. Its American depository shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange in the spring, and investors are trading but a fraction of Dina's stock daily compared with the action surrounding Telmex. American depository shares of foreign companies like Dina are receipts for foreign companies' stock that are held in the United States and trade on American exchanges. In Dina's case, one A.D.R. is equivalent to four shares of the stock.
Dina analysts give the company the same rather rosy billing as many of the Mexican stocks trading on the Big Board. Regardless of the free trade accord, they expect Mexico's economy to grow quickly, making the stocks and their relatively low multiples attractive. "The Mexican story is built on structural reforms," Lawrence Krohn, chief Latin economist at Lehman Brothers, said. "And all that will be intact if Nafta fails."
Some industry analysts see an opportunity in Dina (pronouned DEE-na), whose A.D.R.'s traded within a narrow range around $16 from April through August, only to climb quickly through August to their high of $21.875. With growing doubts over the fate of the free trade agreement, they have settled somewhat, closing at $19.125 yesterday, unchanged.
The case for Dina includes the fact that the country's expanding economy will create a need to move more goods and workers, and that there are few alternatives to the road. Dina's truck sales could jump by 16 percent in 1994, and bus sales are expected to grow 10 percent, Steven J. Colbert, an analyst for Prudential Securities, said.
Replacement demand is also working in Dina's favor. The average age of Mexico's truck fleet is about 12 years, compared with roughly 8 years in the United States. Dina's double-digit operating margins far exceed those of other publicly held truck manufacturers, like American companies Navistar International and Paccar.
The Mexican Government is also pitching in. With trade barriers expected to fall -- quickly with the free trade deal, slowly without it -- Mexican truckers will likely feel the need to upgrade their equipment to compete against counterparts in the United States and Canada. The Government also said it would help Dina's truck division by providing up to $250 million to help smaller truck companies get low-rate loans.
The stock is trading at 8.9 times the 1994 earnings estimate -- roughly equal to the Mexican market index, and far below the 14 times that the 500 largest American companies are expected to fetch next year. Dina is expected to remain attractive as it expands with Mexico's economy, which grew at a real annual rate of 3.5 percent from 1989 through 1992. Over the same period, Dina's revenues grew by 27.3 percent annually.
All this opportunity in the Mexican truck market has not been lost on competitors, and Dina will be fighting for market share increasingly with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. If the free trade measure is ratified, the current 20 percent tariff that Mexico imposes on European and other foreign heavy-duty trucks would also begin to fall.
But Mr. Colbert believes Dina will stave off many of these new threats to its market share of close to 40 percent because of its brand name, breadth of products and dealer network.

HEADLINE: Existing-Home Sales Drop

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes slipped 1.3 percent in August, the first decline in five months despite the lowest mortgage rates on record, a real estate trade group said today.
Sales fell in both the Midwest and South but posted gains in the Northeast and West. Still, the National Association of Realtors report showed sales remaining brisk by historical standards and well above the pace a year earlier. 
 The group said sales totaled 3.81 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from 3.86 million in July. July's revised advance of 4.9 percent was slower than the initial estimate of 5.4 percent.
The decline in August was the first since sales fell in each month of the January-March quarter, when severe winter weather curbed buying. But sales rebounded in April and had risen each month since.
Despite the August pause, the association noted that sales were still 14.1 percent above those of a year ago. It predicted sales would total 3.675 million this year, up from 3.52 million in 1992 and 3.22 million in 1991, when the housing industry emerged from recession.
The median price of a previously owned home edged up six-tenths of 1 percent from July, to $109,200, and 4 percent from August 1992. The median price means half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
Regionally, sales shot up 9.1 percent in the Northeast, to an annual rate of 600,000. Sales rose 1.2 percent in the West, to an 820,000 rate, despite the poor economy in California. But they dropped 8.6 percent in the Midwest, to a 960,000 rate. They also fell in the South, down 2.1 percent, to a rate of 1.42 million.

HEADLINE: Stop Subsidizing the Arms Race

BYLINE: By Jeff Bingaman; Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At the United Nations yesterday, President Clinton called on the world to halt nuclear testing and ban the production of fuels for nuclear weapons. But while the Administration is saying that attacking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an urgent priority, the Senate has sent a different signal by approving subsidies for arms exports. The House has rejected this approach and a conference committee can soon put the matter to rest.
A provision of the 1994 Defense Department Authorization Act, passed Sept. 14, provides $1 billion in loan guarantees for the export of weapons to NATO members, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Israel. 
 At a time when Yasir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin are shaking hands, such subsidies for foreign arms sales are a mistake. They may encourage other countries to promote the proliferation of weapons and destabilize developing countries.
Instead of encouraging defense manufacturers to try to adapt to the post-cold-war world and to restructure our defense-oriented industrial base, Congress is using taxpayers' dollars to subsidize companies that are willing to put off the inevitable.
Supporters of the provision say there are no proliferation concerns, that only our close allies are covered under the program. Wrong. When we subsidize sales to our allies, and other countries subsidize sales to their own allies, weapons proliferate exponentially: the close allies of Russia and China include North Korea and Syria.
It would be a mistake to believe that more sales to our allies will not contribute to increased arms sales around the world. The U.S. controls the world market for arms sales and other arms-exporting countries will follow our lead. They face the same challenges we do to preserve jobs and maintain declining defense industries.
The new U.S. export guarantee would lead to increased subsidies by foreign governments to defense industries in their countries to keep sales competitive, and would put increased pressure on those governments to sell where the market is largest: the Middle East and the third world.
Arms exports do not help conversion. The impact of defense downsizing will be felt for years, and Congress and the Administration will be under pressure from companies, workers and communities to do something to prevent the inevitable transition.
If Congress gives in to pressure to maintain the status quo, the U.S. will lose an opportunity to help move defense companies into sustainable commercial development.
Besides, we will lose an opportunity to help move Russia and the other Soviet successor states away from defense economies and into commercial development when they see that the U.S. considers arms exports a form of defense conversion.
And we will misuse scarce Federal dollars in trying to hold on to a rapidly declining world market for arms -- dollars that could be used to support conversion, work-force training and community development. Or even to reduce the Federal budget.
Wisely, Congress has established a $1.6 billion conversion program to help companies adjust. The Administration has pledged to spend $20 billion in conversion over the next five years for technology and manufacturing programs, worker training and economic development programs.
A robust conversion program and increased Federal support for commercial exports -- even an export loan-guarantee program for defense companies seeking to develop markets for civilian goods -- makes sense. What makes no sense is the prospect that arms proliferation will detour developing countries worldwide, especially when old adversaries in the Middle East are finally on the uphill path to peace.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
So Where's the Catch?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
First, take the three foreign affairs speeches made in the past week by President Clinton, his national security adviser and his U.N. delegate. Then squeeze them good and hard to get rid of the inevitable pulp of jargon, pieties and diplomatic roundabouts.
What is left is the juice of some important policies, and an unusual question.
1. When military action is needed, the U.S. will ask the U.N. for help and permission -- when it is in American best interests to do so. 
 Otherwise, the U.S. will rely on regional alliances like NATO or on pickup groups united by common interests in the crisis of the moment, or go it alone. American forces will not be committed to a permanent U.N. standing reserve, despite past hints. And now the U.S. will ask questions about getting out before it gets in.
All fine, and pretty much what the U.N. was created to be -- a place where nations could work together in a crisis when they wished without surrendering the right to self-defense or collective action outside the U.N. when they didn't wish.
The Clinton U.N. policy is the result of some rethinking, encouraged by a political pounding that convinced the policy makers that the American public would not stand for U.N. commitments in any crisis beyond the one at hand -- if that.
That does leave a problem. American journalists and politicians will have to give up talking of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali as if he were plotting to command U.S. troops in a mad charge from U.N. headquarters to the sea and across. He is simply an experienced diplomat who suffers from having ideas of his own -- which member nations can accept or reject.
2. The U.S., now the U.N.'s champion deadbeat, will pay its $1 billion in past dues and peacekeeping assessments. Now American Presidents can lecture the U.N. without embarrassment.
Repayment should not immediately be loaded with conditions about dues reductions and "reinventing" the U.N. That would be like walking into a bank and saying you will pay back the automobile loan provided you get a better deal and six vice presidents are fired.
3. The U.S. will work for a treaty to end world production of highly enriched uranium and reprocessed plutonium, used for nuclear bombs.
Now, the question: Where is the catch? There must be one lurking in this interesting thinking. But I can't put my finger on it; very upsetting.
The speeches of Mr. Clinton, his national security adviser, Anthony Lake, and the U.N. representative, Madeleine Albright, are connected to realities -- and strengthened by a healthy dollop of idealistic optimism about expanding democracy.
Sorry, no catch found. But what is missing is a strong track record on handling crises. "Solving" Bosnia was impossible, certainly not without the commitment of U.S. combat troops. Even in fierce American hawks, the thought turned their brown eyes blue.
But the Administration never told us exactly what it would do in Bosnia. It still hasn't. How long would U.S. troops serve there as peacekeepers? And why 25,000, almost half the total?
On Somalia too the President does not give us the answer to the question he says he will always demand of the U.N.: How do we get the hell out of here? Will Americans agree to keeping troops in both places?
So we have to hold judgment on how the Clintonians will handle new foreign crises. The way things are, we won't have to wait long.
As for treaties, they are lovely, when observed. But only wishfulness is behind the hope that China, North Korea, Iran and Iraq will obey nuclear treaties unless their current leaders are good and gone.
And how about a look in our own mirror? Nuclear weapons have been a death threat since Hiroshima. But death reality -- in a dozen wars since Hiroshima -- has come from the tanks, bombs, short-range missiles and long-range guns on sale in the arms bazaar. China and the former Soviet republics are big death salesmen, but right up there with them is the West, including the U.S.
Maybe one day an American President will say, Enough -- from now on we supply arms only to friends in peril and will use economic power against countries that keep the death bazaar open.
Could Bill Clinton be that President some day? After all, it is the one true universal health plan.

HEADLINE: Global Warming's Doomsday Nowhere in Sight

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Scientists Confront Renewed Backlash on Global Warming" (Science Times, Sept. 14) well documents the absence of any scientific consensus on the existence of enhanced greenhouse warming, on the magnitude of any future temperature increase, and on whether any such climate change would be harmful or beneficial. It is important to emphasize this uncertainty in order to counteract unsupported claims that "all scientists agree." 
 Such claims are being used to justify economically harmful policies to limit energy use by imposing special taxes or other restrictions. In his 1992 best seller, "Earth in the Balance," then-Senator Al Gore wrote that 98 percent of all experts agreed with his cataclysmic view of future global warming. As your article shows, this is clearly not the case.
Your article requires some elaboration. Climatologists no longer believe carbon dioxide, the most important man-made greenhouse gas, stays in the atmosphere "for centuries"; better data have reduced this "lifetime" to about 40 years. This means policy steps can be safely delayed pending better evidence.
At last year's Earth Summit in Rio, politicians were led to believe that carbon dioxide concentrations would double by as early as 2025. You report a revised date of 2100, an estimate more in line with the shorter lifetime. In fact, carbon dioxide may never double, partly because of the limited availability of fossil fuels.
You also report that today's greenhouse gas concentration has already moved halfway toward a doubling over the pre-industrial value. According to the "best" computer models, one would expect global temperatures to be increasing at the rate of 0.5 degree Fahrenheit per decade, an easily detectable amount. The best available data, however, taken with globe-circling satellite instruments since 1979, show no increase at all.
As observations and theory diverge more strongly with each passing year, it becomes more certain there is something very wrong with the computer models that have been used to scare the world public and their governments into considering drastic, hasty actions.

HEADLINE: Kerala Raises Living Standard Democratically

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your front-page article Sept. 7 raises the question of whether or not there is a link between repression and improvements in the quality of life in China. While China may not be democratic, you point out, life there is better for millions than in the more democratic country of India. 
 But India is a varied country and statistics for the whole nation do not hold for all the individual states. Kerala, in the extreme southwest corner of India, has the lowest per capita gross national product of any Indian state, yet its quality-of-life indicators compare very favorably to China's.
For example, life expectancy is 68; infant mortality, 27 per 1,000; the literacy rate is 90 percent, and there is virtually no female infanticide, which is not the case in China. These impressive facts are the result of far-reaching reforms that have occurred in Kerala, achieved through the organized efforts of its people.
While these successes did not come easily, there was no sacrifice of democracy. Kerala shows that popular participation, the essence of democracy, is a major part of improving life.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Florio's Tax Increase Winning Approval in Retrospect

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, whose political career seemed all but finished three years ago, has taken advantage of a lackluster Republican challenge to revive his reputation as a leader and has even won a surprising degree of acceptance of his 1990 decision to raise taxes sharply, according to a New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll.
With the Nov. 2 vote five weeks from today, the poll indicates that more New Jersey voters approve of Mr. Florio's performance in office than disapprove of it. Forty-nine percent now even say that Mr. Florio, in the poll's words, "did the right thing" in raising taxes by $2.8 billion in 1990. That action was once thought to have fatally wounded his governorship and was the hook on which his Republican challenger, Christine Todd Whitman, has ever since lashed her ambition to unseat him. Voters also tell the polls that the best thing he has done has been instituting stricter gun control. 
 Mr. Florio has seized a lead of 51 percent to 30 percent over Mrs. Whitman among registered voters, the widest Florio lead yet in four recent state-wide polls, three done by other news groups. The results are based on telephone interviews with 804 registered voters conducted Sept. 20 through 26 throughout New Jersey. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
 
Worst Act, but Also Best
 Over all, the picture that emerges from the survey shows a Governor who has come to dominate the terms of the campaign while Mrs. Whitman is still seeking firm footing, and who has been much more effective is sinking his political barbs into her than she has been in hitting him back.
The poll shows that Mrs. Whitman has suffered from each principal charge Mr. Florio has made against her: that she is rich and out of touch with ordinary voters, that she is too close to the gun lobby and that she lacks the experience and judgment to govern.
Mr. Florio, in contrast, shows relatively little weakness on the tax issue that has been the centerpiece of Mrs. Whitman's campaign. While voters said that raising their taxes was the worst thing the Governor did during his first term, they also said that using high taxes to balance the budget was one of the best things he did, just after instituting stricter gun controls.
When viewed with other recent polls, the Times/WCBS-TV News survey showed a swath of soft or undecided opinion that is gradually and perhaps grudgingly hardening in Mr. Florio's favor. Several respondents who spoke during follow-up interviews after the survey was taken said that they had been interested in Mrs. Whitman's views, but had decided to overlook disappointments with Mr. Florio and to stay with the Governor because they felt they knew him, and trusted him to manage the state's economy.
Carol DeGramont of Englewood said she once favored Mrs. Whitman. But, reflecting the movement of public opinion away from the Republican challenger to the Governor, she has all but changed her mind.
"I was going to go for Whitman but I began to read the articles about her and I started to waver," Ms. DeGramont said. "I don't particularly like Florio but I also don't know how responsible Mrs. Whitman is -- I don't really know why she is running."
Mrs. Whitman greeted the results with a vow that her campaign was going to change, and by questioning the accuracy of the Times/WCBS-TV News poll.
"Polls, as I have said constantly, are snapshot in time," she said at a news conference yesterday morning. "Like we said last week, we are going to change things. I don't know how any more accurate that is than the other three polls we've had that saw we are neck and neck."
 
Not All Bad for Whitman
 Indeed, the news in the survey is not all bad for Mrs. Whitman. The results suggest that she could yet improve her prospects by filling in the blanks on questions of her character and program among the 54 percent of voters who said they were either undecided between the two candidates, or might change their minds before Election Day.
Thus, while Mrs. Whitman received no bounce in the popularity rating from her proposal to cut income taxes by 30 percent over three years, a proposal that was released last Tuesday while the poll was being taken, the number of people who regarded her as a person with specific proposals increased by 12 percentage points after the program was announced.
Public opinion in New Jersey, with one of the country's richest and best-educated electorates, is notoriously volatile. Mr. Florio himself learned this lesson during his first race for governor in 1981, when his months-long lead over Thomas H. Kean faded in the final weeks of a campaign that Mr. Kean went on to win.
In the questions of candidate qualities that help reveal a voter's reasons for going one way or another, Mr. Florio consistently outscored Mrs. Whitman on favorable attributes: 59 percent said they believed that the Governor understood the needs and problems of people like them, against 30 percent for Mrs. Whitman. To the question, whether the candidate has offered specific proposals about how to solve New Jersey's problems, 56 percent said Mr. Florio had, versus 33 percent for Mrs. Whitman.
Mrs. Whitman faltered badly on the question of her experience to lead and in the voters' view of her understanding of their lives. In the poll, 48 percent saying she lacked the experience to serve effectively as governor.
Even on the question of whether the candidate can be trusted to keep his word, Mr. Florio, who campaigned in 1989 saying he saw no need for new taxes and then raised them steeply once in office, won the matchup with 48 percent saying they trusted him, against 34 percent for Mrs. Whitman.
Voters were asked: "Looking back on Jim Florio's decision to raise taxes, do you think he did the right thing or the wrong thing for New Jersey?" Forty-nine percent said he did the right thing, while 42 percent said he did the wrong thing. The question was preceded by a statement of Mr. Florio's motives: to eliminate the deficit and to provide school aid. It is unclear how the response would have differed without that preamble.
The most favorable reaction to Mr. Florio came on a character issue the Republicans are particularly hoping to catch him on: honesty. In May, Mr. Florio's chief of staff was forced to resign because of questions involving the letting of state bond underwriting contracts. Although the Governor and his staff have protested that no one in the administration had done anything wrong, state Republicans have made every effort to remind voters that a Federal investigation is under way on the bond issue.
Yet to the question of whether the candidate has the honesty and integrity they would like to see in a candidate, 61 percent of respondents said Mr. Florio did and 35 said the same of Mrs. Whitman.
 
No High From the Tax Plan
 Several commentators said the poll results may have been colored by the events of last week, when Mrs. Whitman presented her tax plan. Although the plan was intended to create a high point in the Republican effort, the generally unfavorable editorial reaction to it, coupled with relative silence from Mrs. Whitman for several days and howls of criticism from the Florio side, turned what might have been an up week into a bad one for her.
"She needed to fill the airwaves with support for her plan, but she didn't," said Janice Ballou, polling director at the Eagleton Institute of Polics at Rutgers University said yesterday. "So there was nothing to fill the void but all the negative reaction to it, with the result that so far, it may have turned out to be more of a minus than a plus for her."
The polling data suggest that Mrs. Whitman has successfully identified herself as an anti-tax candidate without persuading many voters that she could make her tax views stick. In the poll, 36 percent said their taxes would go up in a Whitman administration and 38 percent said they would stay the same, but only 10 percent said they believed their taxes would go down under her.
Steve Oravets, a tugboat captain from Bayonne, explained in a follow-up interview that taxes had faded in his mind as worries over the economy moved to the fore.
"I didn't like the way Florio handled the tax increase and I don't care too much for his blanket policy on guns," he said. "But if Whitman cuts the income tax, isn't the money just going to come out of another pocket, or end up with more deficit that will hurt the economy? Right now we need more people going to work and I don't think her ideas help that."
Mr. Oravets is one of the tens of thousands who voted for Mrs. Whitman as an anti-Florio tax protest in her near upset of Senator Bill Bradley in 1990. This time, he said, he will probably support the Governor.
 
Areas of Weakness
 On the question of overall opinions of the candidates, the poll respondents gave Mr. Florio the best scores, while at the same time revealing areas of weakness that Mrs. Whitman could yet exploit.
Thus, 50 percent of registered voters said they approved of the way Mr. Florio is handling his job as Governor, and 37 disapproved, while 38 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the governor and 32 percent said their opinion was unfavorable.
For Mrs. Whitman, only 15 percent said they had a favorable opinion of her and twice as many, 30 percent, said their opinion of her was unfavorable. But fully 54 percent said they were either undecided or had not yet heard enough about her to form an opinion when the poll was taken.
Throughout the race, both campaigns have been watching for clues to the relative firmness of each candidate's support. The Whitman campaign was buoyed by the last Star Ledger/Eagleton poll, conducted from Sept. 10 through 15, which showed Mr. Florio's support was not as firm among his partisans as Mrs. Whitman's was among hers.
The Times/WCBS-TV News poll, however, found a statistically indistinguishable difference between the solidity of each candidate's support: 59 percent of Mrs. Whitman's backers said their minds were made up, and 57 percent of Mr. Florio's supporters said the same.
 
 
 
HOW PHONE POLL WAS CONDUCTED
 The latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 20 to 26 with 1,010 adults throughout New Jersey. Of these, 804 said they were registered voters.
 The telephone exchanged called were sleected by a computer from a complete list of New Jersey exchanged, with each area of the state represented in proportion of its population. The numbers for each exchange were chosed randomly, thus generating both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated at random to be the respondent for the survey.
 The results have been weighted to account for household size and number of telephone lines at a residence, and to adjust for variations relating to race, sex, age and region of the state.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples should differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Jersey residents.
 The potential sampling error is larger for smaller subgroups. For example, for registerd voters it is 4 percentage points.
 Besides sampling error, the practical difficulties of poinion surveys may introduce other errors. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for example, can cause results to vary.

HEADLINE: YELTSIN TIGHTENING CORDON OF TROOPS AT THE PARLIAMENT

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Wednesday, Sept. 29

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin severely tightened the cordon around the headquarters of the hostile legislature Tuesday, deploying hundreds of troops with concertina wire and water trucks, and even mounted police, at all approaches to the building.
From a yellow armored personnel carrier across the street from barricades erected by defenders of Parliament, police officers with a loudspeaker demanded that those inside surrender their arms today. 
 Although the gathering of forces and the demand to surrender seemed to suggest an assault on the building might be imminent, none had occurred by 8:30 A.M. (1:30 A.M. Wednesday, Eastern time).
The police ultimatum was not confirmed by the Kremlin or the Interior Ministry, nor was it accompanied by the threat of any specific retaliation, suggesting that the demand might be only another twist in the weeklong war of nerves intended to pry out remaining deputies and their supporters peaceably.
 
Warning About 'Extremists'
 The buildup of force was by far the largest since Mr. Yeltsin dissolved the obstructive legislature a week ago and called for new elections. But Kremlin officials maintained they had no intention of storming the Parliament building, known as the White House.
Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr. Yeltsin's press spokesman, issued a statement saying any talk of storming the White House was "misinformation" from "a handful of extremists who found themselves politically isolated."
The cordon drew crowds of angry demonstrators, and in the evening one band of several hundred protesters tried to breach the line from a side street. Riot police drove them back, batons swinging, but several thousand more supporters of Parliament joined the fray, building barricades, hijacking two trolley buses to block traffic and pelting the police with debris.
 
And Still More Troops Arrive
 The street skirmishes were over by midnight (5 P.M. Tuesday, Eastern time), but rumbling trucks and buses filled with police officers and Interior Ministry troops lined side streets in all directions. The heaviest concentration was across from the main entrance to the United States Embassy, which faces Parliament.
Witnesses said they heard bursts of gunfire about 1 A.M. No further shots or violence followed. As heavy rain changed to wet snow, the police presence diminished and those on duty eased enforcement, allowing onlookers and the press a closer look at the Parliament.
Interior Ministry officials said the cordon had been tightened because there were still large stockpiles of arms in the building and because about 600 men defending Parliament included some "with evident psychological disorders."
Moscow's Mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, said there were no more than 230 deputies inside the building, of about 650 who converged there last week. The deputies are holed up with several hundred hard-core Communists and nationalists. In an effort to put pressure on the legislators, the Government has cut electricity, heat and water supplies.
Mr. Yeltsin has declared that he was "categorically" opposed to any compromise that included early joint elections for President and Parliament, a proposal that has gained considerable currency.
 
No Choice Is Offered
 The tightened cordon and the police ultimatum marked a distinct intensification of the war of nerves that the President has waged against the defiant occupants of the White House.
Though talk of compromise continued to swirl, the Kremlin gave no sign it was offering anything except surrender to the deputies and their leaders -- the Chairman, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, and Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, whom Parliament has appointed acting president.
The police ultimatum early Tuesday came abruptly as a large force of police officers and commandos moved in, sealing all approaches to the White House. Deputies, staff members and reporters were all turned back.
A bright yellow armored personnel carrier with a large loudspeaker was moved into position facing the White House, and at 11 A.M. (4 A.M. Eastern time), the police advised the defenders they had 24 hours to surrender their arms.
The rain drenched the security forces and the protesters. Clusters of people gathered, including deputies demanding to be let in. None were.
Despite the blockade, Mr. Khasbulatov gave a news conference Tuesday to reporters who camped inside the White House or who managed to get in. He denounced the security measures.
"They are trying to turn us into a concentration camp," he said. "It is sheer fascism."
 
Just a Few Words Get Out
 His words reached Muscovites largely through CNN or Western radio stations because Mr. Yeltsin had closed the Parliament's newspaper.
The information blockade has not been total. Conservative newspapers like Pravda and Sovetskaya Rossiya have continued to publish, and other newspapers and independent news outlets have carried coverage from inside the White House. But the blatantly pro-Yeltsin television reports, with a tone reminiscent of Soviet propaganda, have irritated even many of Mr. Yeltsin's supporters.
Outside the two warring camps, calls continued for a compromise. Valery D. Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court, said leaders of several regions had asked to use the Court for a conference on Thursday.
The announcement was notable because the 88 regions of the Russian Federation have become an increasingly assertive political force. The feud in Moscow has spawned a growing number of parallel feuds in the provinces, and local leaders have shown an inclination to take advantage of the crisis to expand their own powers.
The Kremlin's alarm at the restiveness in the regions was evident in a strong statement issued by the spokesman, Mr. Kostikov, opposing a meeting of the Federation Council, an assembly of regional leaders that President Yeltsin proposes transforming into the upper house of a new Parliament.
Taking advantage of the political crisis, Mr. Kostikov said, "some regional leaders are making attempts to channel power away from the center and to the regions. The Federation Council, which allegedly should 'take the situation under its control,' is being used as an instrument for exerting pressure."
While Mr. Zorkin, the Court chairman, has been among the most active in pressing for joint elections, his potential as a mediator weakened Tuesday when 4 of the 13 members of his Court stopped participating in its work to protest his position. If two more justices step aside, the Court would lose a quorum.
The Deputy Chairman of the Court, Nikolai Vitruk, said Mr. Zorkin was seeking to make the Court "an active political force supporting one of the parties to the conflict."
Criticism of Mr. Yeltsin has come not only from the right. An ever louder critic has been Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a reform economist who is the first Russian politician to declare his candidacy for President. He has repeatedly urged Mr. Yeltsin to lift his siege and to call joint elections, and has warned that intransigence could end in violence.
"If August 1991 was described as a tragedy that ended in farce, then it looks like the events of September 1993, beginning as a comedy, could end in tragedy," he said at a news conference.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
A Warning From the U.S.
 UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 28 (AP) -- The Clinton Administration urged President Yeltsin today to respect human rights in his showdown with opponents in Parliament.
"We've let them know of our concern about respect for human rights," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said at a news conference, a change from his detached public stance.
A senior official, reinforcing the message, said Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering had been instructed to inform the Yeltsin Government that "we are concerned obviously about the prospect of violence."
 
Dispute in Russia: Seven Days of Turmoil
Russia: Seven Days of Turmoil
 
Sept. 21 President Boris N. Yeltsin suspends Parliament and announces parliamentary elections for Dec. 11 and 12. Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi immediately denounces the move as a "coup d'etat" and says he is taking power. Defiant deputies meet and name Mr. Rutskoi acting president. The Parliament Chairman, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, calls on soldiers to disobey Mr. Yeltsin.
 
Sept. 22 Parliament votes to strip Mr. Yeltsin of his presidential powers. The Constitutional Court rules that Mr. Yeltsin has violated the constitution and can be impeached. Mr. Yeltsin says he will not use force to resolve the crisis, though the Defense Minister, Pavel S. Grachev, says Mr. Yeltsin can count on full support from the armed forces. Mr. Yeltsin appoints Yegor T. Gaidar acting economics minister in addition to his new job as First Deputy Prime Minister.
 
Sept. 23 Mr. Yeltsin announces early presidential elections for June 12, 1994 and indicates he will run for a third term. Unidentified armed men try to break into the Moscow headquarters of the Commonwealth of Independent States armed forces, but the attack is thwarted by guards and police. The Congress of People's Deputies, Russia's supreme legislature, convenes in the Parliament building.
 
Sept. 24 Mr. Yeltsin orders defense and interior ministries to disarm Parliament guards. The Congress of People's Deputies votes to call simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections by March 1994.
 
Sept. 25 Mr. Yeltsin says Parliament's resistance to his decree is dissolving and it is "at its last gasp." Mr. Khasbulatov says Parliament will set up new base outside Moscow if Mr. Yeltsin drives the members from the capital. Vladislav Achalov, appointed "defense minister" by Parliament, tells deputies two military units are being formed to defend the legislature. Moscow authorities cut off electricity to Parliament, which restores partial supplies with an emergency generator.
 
Sept. 26 About 15,000 supporters of Mr. Yeltsin rally in central Moscow, while several thousand Parliament supporters stage a rival demonstration. Mr. Rutskoi says he will fight to the death if troops loyal to Mr. Yeltsin try to storm the White House, where the Parliament meets. Leaders of about 40 regional councils and nine administration chiefs call for simultaneous elections to the presidency and Parliament.
 
Sept. 27 Mr. Yeltsin rules out simultaneous elections, saying they would leave a dangerous power vacuum and trigger even greater chaos. Parliament is on full alert, convinced government troops are about to storm building.
 
Sept. 28 The Interior Ministry announces it is sealing off Parliament to maintain law and order in the district. The building is surrounded by barricades and razor wire.

HEADLINE: Vague Mexico Wage Pledge Clouds Free Trade Accord

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 28

 BODY:
As they try to make the case for Congressional approval of a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, President Clinton and other supporters repeatedly say the pact will raise minimum wages in Mexico and reduce the country's ability to undercut businesses north of the border with cheap labor.
But by focusing on how minimum wages might rise, the Clinton Administration has put itself in a somewhat awkward position because that particular pledge is not found anywhere in the 2,000-page North American Free Trade Agreement it is meant to support. Nor is it in the special side agreements to the pact, or in Mexican labor law.
 
A Promise by Salinas
 Rather it is a personal promise made by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico that this country's minimum wage -- which can go as low as $4 a day, depending on the type of work -- will be increased in tandem with increases in worker productivity. 
Mr. Salinas's pledge, announced publicly in August on the same day the side accords were announced, was seen as crucial to getting the pact past a worried United States Congress.
But the pledge was so vague, and the issue of measuring productivity so potentially troublesome, that Mr. Salinas is now under pressure to come forward with a concrete plan for lifting the incomes of Mexico's poorest workers.
Mexican officials have said only that their Departments of Labor and Economic Development are working with their National Commission of Minimum Salaries to devise a formula for the increases.
Labor unions say they have reached an agreement with the Government to give bonuses to productive workers in specific industries, but that does not seem to meet the letter of Mr. Salinas's pledge. Beyond that, little is known on either side of the border about what Mexico will actually do.
"Nobody really has a good understanding of what they're going to do," said Mauricio Gonzalez, a partner at a Mexico City consulting company.
If an accurate and reliable format could be worked out, linking productivity to wage increases could go far toward returning the Mexican work force to the standard of living it had before the debt crisis of 1982 brought soaring inflation and a deep national recession. But the average American factory worker is 4.6 times more productive than the average Mexican factory worker, although in some new Mexican plants the rates can be roughly comparable. Still, few believe that Mexico can close the gap quickly.
It is also not clear how Mexico would manage productivity-based increases, or when they would become effective. Mexican officials say it is doubtful that anything could be in place by the beginning of January, when they hope the trade agreement will be signed and in force.
The Mexican negotiators of the pact were careful not to commit themselves to wage parity with the United States. Mexico is going to try only to make up for some of the losses suffered by workers over the last decade, when the buying power of the minimum wage dropped 60 percent.
There is even uncertainty about what Mr. Salinas's pledge actually means. "We will be assured of an effective and permanent improvement of minimum wages now and for the future," Mr. Salinas said in a speech in which he outlined the plan.
Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said, "As a statement of intent it is a preamble, but the devil is in the details, and this has no details."
A United States Labor Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Clinton Administration was using Mr. Salinas's pledge because of the "symbolic value" it represented. The official said a new system would have a practical, though limited, effect on shrinking the gap between wages in the United States and Mexico.
 
Clinton Stresses Pledge
 Despite that, the pledge has become a key part of Mr. Clinton's efforts to sell the pact. In a speech in New Orleans this month, the President praised the trade agreement and the side accords -- one on the environment, the other on labor -- that are intended to toughen parts of the original pact, which lowers or eliminates tariffs on most goods traded between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
The side agreement on labor, Mr. Clinton said, "commits the Mexican Government to enforce its own labor laws, and you should know what that really means."
"It means that for the first time in history a government has committed itself to raise the minimum wage as its economy grows, thereby raising the wage structure throughout the country," he said.
But Mr. Salinas's pledge was not enough to quell all complaint. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said Mr. Salinas's promise fell short because so few Mexican workers receive just the minimum wage. Last week he said he would vote against the agreement.
 
10 Percent Get Minimum
 According to the Bank of Mexico, the minimum wage now applies to only about 10 percent of Mexican workers, and the Mexican Social Security system reports that only 16 percent of its 8.8 million enrollees receive the minimum wage. But the practice has developed in Mexico of using increases in the minimum wage as the basis for negotiation involving salaries higher than the minimum. Some higher-paid workers, mostly Government employees, would be directly affected because their salaries are calculated as multiples of the minimum wage.
But as in the United States, increases in the minimum wage do not necessarily result in across-the-board increases. In the United States, the minimum wage has been increasing while average wages have fallen.
In Mexico, there are actually 264 minimum wages; each of 88 different occupations has three minimums that vary according to where the jobs are performed. In general, wages are highest in Mexico City and other urban areas, and lowest in rural states.
Minimum wages are set by the National Commission of Minimum Salaries, which is made up of representatives from business, labor unions and the Government. From 1986 to last January, the commission changed the levels 16 times.
 
Government Deeply Involved
 The Government's involvement is an essential part of Mr. Salinas's efforts to tame inflation and keep investors interested in Mexico. Under a set of wage and price controls in effect since 1987, just before Mr. Salinas took office, businesses and unions have kept negotiated wage increases below the level of inflation, while the Government agreed to keep down gasoline and electricity prices while also pumping money into a public works programs called Solidarity.
The program has worked. Inflation is below 10 percent for the first time in 25 years. Despite a slowing of Mexico's economic growth, investment has continued strong. There has even been some recovery in real wages over the last few years. But it has not been enough to compensate for staggering losses of the 1980's. Real wages today are 68 percent of what they were in 1980.
All that has worsened the gap between wages in the United States and Mexico, even though Mexican productivity has been increasing by 4 percent or more each year since 1989. Mexican compensation was 22 percent of United States wages in 1980. It dropped to 7 percent in 1987 and since has risen to 15 percent, according to a report by the Democratic Study Center, a nonprofit academic foundation in Washington.
"We don't expect that in three, four or five years we will have the same minimum salaries as the United States," said Juan S. Millan Lizarraga, secretary of education for the Confederation of Mexican Workers, the largest labor syndicate in Mexico. "But we expect to cut the gap."
Mr. Salinas's pledge, announced publicly in August on the same day the side accords were announced, was seen as crucial to getting the pact past a worried United States Congress. But the pledge was so vague, and the issue of measuring productivity so potentially troublesome, that Mr. Salinas is now under pressure to come forward with a concrete plan for lifting the incomes of Mexico's poorest workers.
Mexican officials have said only that their Departments of Labor and Economic Development are working with their National Commission of Minimum Salaries to devise a formula for the increases.
Labor unions say they have reached an agreement with the Government to give bonuses to productive workers in specific industries, but that does not seem to meet the letter of Mr. Salinas's pledge. Beyond that, little is known on either side of the border about what Mexico will actually do.
"Nobody really has a good understanding of what they're going to do," said Mauricio Gonzalez, a partner at a Mexico City consulting company.
If an accurate and reliable format could be worked out, linking productivity to wage increases could go far toward returning the Mexican work force to the standard of living it had before the debt crisis of 1982 brought soaring inflation and a deep national recession. But the average American factory worker is 4.6 times more productive than the average Mexican factory worker, although in some new Mexican plants the rates can be roughly comparable. Still, few believe that Mexico can close the gap quickly.
It is also not clear how Mexico would manage productivity-based increases, or when they would become effective. Mexican officials say it is doubtful that anything could be in place by the beginning of January, when they hope the trade agreement will be signed and in force.
The Mexican negotiators of the pact were careful not to commit themselves to wage parity with the United States. Mexico is going to try only to make up for some of the losses suffered by workers over the last decade, when the buying power of the minimum wage dropped 60 percent.
There is even uncertainty about what Mr. Salinas's pledge actually means. "We will be assured of an effective and permanent improvement of minimum wages now and for the future," Mr. Salinas said in a speech in which he outlined the plan.
Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said, "As a statement of intent it is a preamble, but the devil is in the details, and this has no details."
A United States Labor Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Clinton Administration was using Mr. Salinas's pledge because of the "symbolic value" it represented. The official said a new system would have a practical, though limited, effect on shrinking the gap between wages in the United States and Mexico.
 
Clinton Stresses Pledge
 Despite that, the pledge has become a key part of Mr. Clinton's efforts to sell the pact. In a speech in New Orleans this month, the President praised the trade agreement and the side accords -- one on the environment, the other on labor -- that are intended to toughen parts of the original pact, which lowers or eliminates tariffs on most goods traded between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
The side agreement on labor, Mr. Clinton said, "commits the Mexican Government to enforce its own labor laws, and you should know what that really means."
"It means that for the first time in history a government has committed itself to raise the minimum wage as its economy grows, thereby raising the wage structure throughout the country," he said.
But Mr. Salinas's pledge was not enough to quell all complaint. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said Mr. Salinas's promise fell short because so few Mexican workers receive just the minimum wage. Last week he said he would vote against the agreement.
 
10 Percent Get Minimum
 According to the Bank of Mexico, the minimum wage now applies to only about 10 percent of Mexican workers, and the Mexican Social Security system reports that only 16 percent of its 8.8 million enrollees receive the minimum wage. But the practice has developed in Mexico of using increases in the minimum wage as the basis for negotiation involving salaries higher than the minimum. Some higher-paid workers, mostly Government employees, would be directly affected because their salaries are calculated as multiples of the minimum wage.
But as in the United States, increases in the minimum wage do not necessarily result in across-the-board increases. In the United States, the minimum wage has been increasing while average wages have fallen.
In Mexico, there are actually 264 minimum wages; each of 88 different occupations has three minimums that vary according to where the jobs are performed. In general, wages are highest in Mexico City and other urban areas, and lowest in rural states.

Table: "Working for the Minimum"
 In Mexico, minimum wages are set by the National Commission on Minimum Salaries, which is made up of representatives from labor, business and government. Since 1986, the commission has raised minimum wages 16 times.
 There are 264 different minimum wages in Mexico. The commission recognizes 88 different categories of work, and there are three levels of minimun wages for each depending on where the jobs are. Urban areas have the highest levels; rural areas the lowest.
 These are current minimum wages for an eight-hour day, in United States dollars; the exchange rate is 3.1 pesos per $1. In the United States, the Federal minimum wage is $34 for an eight-hour day, although some states set it higher.

Parts Production Debated in Chrysler Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Facing a strike deadline of 11:59 P.M. Thursday, negotiators for the Chrysler Corporation are trying to fend off demands by the United Automobile Workers union that the company keep making the same proportion of its vehicle parts in-house, thus preserving and possibly creating jobs.
The U.A.W. imposed the deadline on Monday, as a way to focus Chrysler's attention and speed up the talks, union officials said. Both sides said negotiators were likely to agree on a new contract without a strike. 
 In Canada, where the Canadian Automobile Workers are negotiating a separate labor agreement with the General Motors Corporation against a deadline of 11:59 P.M. Wednesday, talks seemed to be progressing after G.M. agreed late Monday to set aside $440 million to support laid-off workers. But G.M. had still not agreed to the basic pattern contract the union negotiated with Chrysler two weeks ago. G.M. also had not formally proposed a wage and benefits package.
"It's unusual for them not to have tabled an economic proposal this late in the bargaining," said Buzz Hargrove, the president of the C.A.W., in a telephone interview from Toronto this evening. Despite the many remaining differences, he added, "It could be done in a very short time."
While Mr. Hargrove said he would negotiate straight through to the deadline, his union, unlike the U.A.W., has a strict policy not to grant extensions. "We either have a settlement or a strike," he said.
At Chrysler, the U.A.W. seeks to replicate an accord it won at the Ford Motor Company two weeks ago. That contract keeps company-paid medical coverage, raises pension benefits for retirees and increases job security funds that pay 95 percent of the wages of laid-off workers.
The pension increases are more of a burden for Chrysler than Ford, since Chrysler has reported an unfunded pension liability of more than $3 billion. But the other provisions are not likely to cause serious increases in the company's labor costs. General Motors, however, is hoping for more relief and is likely to press the union for concessions that will help it streamline its work force.
Rather than call a strike at the deadline, the union negotiators could choose to continue their bargaining, as they did for almost 24 hours past the deadline at Ford. Already, the bargainers' days have begun to lengthen. They stayed at the tables in Chrysler's Highland Park headquarters until about 9 P.M. Monday .
About 54,000 U.A.W. members work for Chrysler, compared with 96,000 at Ford and 265,000 at G.M. The contracts also set benefits for 390,000 retirees and surviving spouses.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Glen Ellen Wines Sold To Heublein

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
Just as many wine drinkers have grown to recognize the taste and value of Glen Ellen products, so has Heublein Inc., a unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. of Britain.
In a deal announced late yesterday, Heublein agreed to buy the Glen Ellen and M. G. Vallejo brands from the Benziger family. Neither side would disclose the purchase price nor the terms of the acquisition. 
 The family will retain its 100-acre ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif., as well as its Benziger brand wines, which accounted for fewer than 150,000 cases sold last year, when the Benziger wineries were ranked 12th in the United States. The leading Benziger wines were Glen Ellen, with about 3.5 million cases sold, and M. G. Vallejo, with another 450,000 cases.
The Glen Ellen and M. G. Vallejo wines, combined with Heublein's products, including Inglenook, Almaden and Blossom Hill, will make Heublein the second-leading wine maker in the country, with about 12 percent of the market, said Jack Shea, a Heublein spokesman. Gallo retains a commanding lead, with about a 38 percent share.
 
Succeeded With Pricing
 The Benzigers built their business through the 1980's by selling varietal wines at reasonable prices while wineries with comparable products were selling for more. When Glen Ellen products were first offered, consumers could buy two bottles for as little as $7.
"In the mid 1980's, that was not the place to be," said Marvin R. Shankin, publisher and editor of The Wine Spectator. "They could have gotten squeezed out. But as the economy shifted, wine drinkers began looking in the $5 to $8 range and found for that moderate amount, they could get wines of outstanding quality."
In that price range, Glen Ellen's varieties of chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, white zinfandel and merlot, among others, helped make the segment the fastest-growing in the industry.
But the competition with Gallo, Robert Mondavi and other wineries continued, pushing the Benzigers into a search for needed cash despite their growth.
For Heublein, the purchase was like drawing to an inside straight. With strong sales in table wines and other liquor products, the company was lacking a visible presence among the more prominent California wines. The Benziger lines, said Robert M. Furek, president and chief executive of Heublein, "fill an important gap in our portfolio."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Hospitals, Hoping for Simplicity, Generally Welcome President's Proposals

SERIES: The Clinton Prescription: The Impact on Hospitals -- Fourth article in a series

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., Sept. 28

 BODY:
To find the heart of Huntington Memorial Hospital today, go upstairs from the gleaming efficient emergency room, past the pharmacy and around the corridor to the business office.
There, in cramped cubicles, 75 workers push the mountains of paper that are today more a part of hospital care than surgical gloves. Two of them do nothing but copy medical records all day for insurance companies. Others dun insurers and patients for payment in the hospital's ceaseless battle against red ink -- $10 million in losses last year alone because of indigent and uninsured patients. 
 If for no other reason, hospitals generally welcome President Clinton's proposal to overhaul the health system because nearly everybody would carry basic coverage and hospitals could rely on a regular stream of income. Moreover, hospital administrators hope that the Clinton plan to draft a single uniform insurance claim form would reduce the mounds of paperwork.
"From the hospital's standpoint, everyone would have access to the front door of the hospital instead of just the emergency room," said Dr. Allen W. Mathias, president of Huntington Memorial, a nonprofit private hospital with 535 beds.
But the plan would mean a difficult transition as hospitals deal with a 180-degree turn in economic incentives. As part of large alliances of health providers, hospitals would be under pressure to keep patients out rather than in. This is expected to force mergers of hospitals and many closings.
The effects would vary enormously depending on the type of hospital. The main beneficiaries would be large urban private hospitals with the financial muscle to absorb smaller community hospitals and form alliances with doctors and other providers.
The outlook is less certain for public and teaching hospitals. They have cared for the bulk of indigent patients who would now have insurance that they could take elsewhere for care. But these hospitals would still be obliged to provide emergency and pregnancy care for illegal aliens, who are not included under the Clinton plan.
And specialized hospitals like psychiatric hospitals, already in deep financial trouble nationally, would face still more stress because the plan would allow only 30 days of hospitalization a year. Least affected, at first, would be rural hospitals, because the areas they serve often lack the critical mass of population, doctors and medical services to fit into the structure of "managed competition" envisioned by President Clinton.
 
Plan Would Speed Industry Changes
 But if passed, the Clinton plan would accelerate trends already under way in many parts of the country, trends forced by the widespread adoption of "managed care" by employers to reduce medical costs and by new technology that has reduced the need for hospitalization. To remain competitive, hospitals have begun to merge and to form alliances with other health care providers.
In short, hospitals are accepting a new reality in which they will take a lesser role in the medical world, as no longer the main centers of care but rather as the places where the most extreme illnesses and accidents are treated.
Probably nowhere have the ills of hospitals been more acute than here in Southern California, where nearly one in three people are without medical or hospital insurance, where hospitals are the main source of care for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens and where there is such an oversupply of hospitals that the typical hospital fills fewer than half its beds on any given day.
Already this year, 18 hospitals in California have shut. And C. Duane Dauner, president of the California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, predicts that by the year 2000, another 150 of the state's 550 hospitals will be gone, eliminating a third of all hospital beds.
"The Clinton plan will bring that about sooner because it creates greater competition among health plans," he said. "The in-patient census will continue to drop. We do not advocate that every hospital should remain open. There will be closures, conversions, mergers, sharing of equipment."
But Mr. Dauner and other hospital leaders remain concerned about other aspects of the Clinton plan, mainly the proposal to reduce growth in Medicare and Medicaid by $238 billion by the year 2000 to help finance the universal access. "We do not believe that is possible," he said.
Also, they worry about the plan's omission of coverage for illegal aliens apart from emergency and pregnancy care, and about whether teaching hospitals, which receive added reimbursements from the Government for their associations with medical schools, will be able to maintain their teaching function with reduced patient subsidies. Moreover, there is concern about the fate of public hospitals when every person has a health card and can buy insurance that might use private hospitals and doctors.
But the current system is so onerous for most hospitals that almost any change would be relief. "We are in full agreement with 75 percent of the Clinton proposal," said David Langness, spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, representing 240 hospitals in six counties. "Hospitals have been the most vocal of providers seeking reform, because they are in big trouble, losing money hand over fist."
Consider a major urban hospital like Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif., which serves a wide area of South-Central Los Angeles and adjoining communities, an area mostly inhabited by low-income people. During last year's riots, it treated 372 injured people, including Reginald O. Denny, the truck driver pulled from his cab and beaten in front of television cameras. Only one fifth of the riot patients had insurance, and the hospital absorbed a $500,000 loss.
"It's great to know everyone will be covered," said Peter F. Bastone, administrator of the 365-bed hospital, which is operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, a Roman Catholic order based in St. Louis.
Daniel Freeman underscores the distorted reality of urban medicine today: that most people in poor neighborhoods get nearly all their medical care in the most costly and inefficient way -- in the emergency room. Nearly 100 patients a day stream through the hospital's emergency room. A majority need primary, not emergency, care but, lacking insurance, have no other source of care, said Dr. Bayliss B. Yarnell, director of emergency medicine.
Universal health insurance, he said, would permit patients to see doctors before illness turns into emergency. "The emergency room is a very expensive way to deliver primary health care," Dr. Yarnell said. "A lot of these people would not be here if they had a primary care physician."
But just how the new system will be financed is a source of deep worry, particularly since two-thirds of Daniel Freeman's patients are covered by Medicare or Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program for the indigent.
"Access to the health care system is very laudable," said Daniel P. McLean, president of Daniel Freeman Hospitals Inc., which oversees the Inglewood unit and another smaller hospital in Marina Del Rey. "But how it's going to be paid for, who's going to pay for it and how much providers will get is unclear."
Even before President Clinton made his proposal, the Daniel Freeman hospitals were negotiating affiliations with 11 other Los Angeles-area hospitals. Eventually each hospital would specialize and share equipment and staff, eliminating duplication in cardiac surgery, obstetrics and the like.
"We're going to be paid less tomorrow, and if we don't find a way to do it for less money, we're going to die," Mr. McLean said.
 
Economic Incentives Are Changing
 A few miles away here in Pasadena, a suburb just north of downtown Los Angeles, much the same calculus has been made at the century-old Huntington Memorial, a teaching hospital with ties to the University of Southern California and the University of California at Los Angeles.
Beneath the serene Mediterranean exterior, with its wisteria-covered trellises, the old hospital has been preparing for 21st century realities. Its practices have changed radically with the growing popularity in California of health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, the kind of group health plans that President Clinton seeks to expand.
The H.M.O.'s pay the hospital a fixed fee annually for every member, not for every visit to the hospital. That makes it is more profitable for the hospital to do as much work on an out-patient basis and to discharge patients quickly.
"The economic incentives have changed for hospitals; no longer does more mean better," said Stephen A. Ralph, executive vice president of Huntington Memorial. "Hospitals have done a poor job of understanding our costs. Now we must, or we will go out of business."
The hospital has already taken steps to reduce costs, including establishing a primary care clinic to divert minor complaints from the emergency room to a nurse practitioner, operating nursing homes, setting up a home-health program and affiliating with a nearby hospital, the Methodist Hospital of Southern California, in Arcadia.
In anticipation of the Clinton changes, it is also forming a new entity to be called the Huntington Medical Foundation to compete against Kaiser-Permanente, one of the original H.M.O.'s, and other major plans, at least in its local territory. The foundation would buy up the practices of primary-care doctors and then market the combined doctor and hospital services to employers, insurers and, presumably, the new purchasing cooperatives to be established under the Clinton plan.
Thus, the hospital would be just one part of a network of providers, putting more emphasis on prevention of disease than on acute treatment. "The stand-alone hospital is in great danger of seeing its patients go elsewhere," said Dr. Mathias, the president of Huntington Memorial.
The hospital hopes that the Clinton plan will reduce the paperwork. In the business office, Jim Farrar, director of patient accounts, supervises a paper empire built of more than 100 different forms, and Carol Bradley, vice president for nursing, estimates that from 30 to 40 percent of nurses' time is spent filling out forms.
A couple of years ago, the hospital spent $2 million for a so-called paperless computer accounting system, but it made only more paper than ever.
 
Optimism About Plan Is Not Universal
 But not all at the hospital are optimistic about the eventual impact of the Clinton plan. Dr. Glenn Littenberg, an internist who is former chief of staff at Huntington, said that while it would help solve the access problem, he worried that medical care would suffer under a system in which networks of doctors and hospitals constantly had to compete for pools of patients.
"When something is driven chiefly by bottom-line considerations, I've got to be very skeptical it will bring the results promised," he said.
The outlook for public hospitals is unclear. For decades, the main burden of treating the indigent and illegal aliens in Southern California has fallen on the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, which runs six hospitals. Its Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center is not only one of the nation's premier teaching hospitals but also the largest medical complex in the United States, delivering 40,000 babies a year (110 a day) and serving more than four million out-patients annually. It is well known to television viewers as the locale for the soap opera "General Hospital."
It is difficult to assess the effect of the Clinton plan on such a huge system, said Irene E. Riley, chief of governmental relations for the department. On the one hand, the system stands to lose a certain number of subsidized Medi-Cal patients as they are given health cards and permitted to join regular health plans.
On the other hand, the county system is so overtaxed that it cannot now adequately serve its clients. It is unclear to what extent the Federal Government will continue to reimburse the county for treating illegal aliens, who will presumably continue to use its services since they are not eligible for health cards but are entitled, by law, to emergency and pregnancy care.
Still, the county has volunteered to serve as pilot project for the Clinton Administration. "We are guardedly optimistic," Ms. Riley said. "We want to get the Clinton plan to work for us. If it can work in L.A., it can work anywhere."

Washington Joins Big 3 Auto Venture

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The White House and the Big Three auto companies will announce today a radical new approach to car technology and Government-industry relations, under which Washington will give Detroit technology that originated in weapons programs, and Detroit will strive to build a car that goes three times farther than current models on the same amount of fuel.
Washington is already working with the auto makers on various technologies, but the new agreement, to be announced at a White House ceremony with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and the chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, will set a unifying 10-year goal: very high fuel economy that far exceeds the regulatory requirements.
 
'Rewriting the Book'
 "We think it's an enormous breakthrough," Mr. Gore said of the partnership in a telephone interview last night. "The goal has been consciously set at a point that lies beyond what we know how to do with current systems." 
 He added: "Advances like this, a threefold increase in performance, are taken for granted over a 10-year period in the computer industry. Up until now there has been an assumption that only incremental change is possible in an industry like the auto industry. These three C.E.O.'s are rewriting the book."
The chief executives are John F. Smith Jr. of General Motors, Harold A. Poling of Ford and Robert J. Eaton of Chrysler.
A spokesman for the companies, Larry D. Weis, who represents a research consortium of the Big Three called Uscar, said "we have worked together before in bits and pieces," but the new agreement "commits the Government and the companies to sit down in a coordinated effort; it becomes more of a moon-shot kind of program."
Mr. Gore, in language reminiscent of the early days of the space program, painted the latest effort in patriotic colors. "We have a strategic interest as a nation in meeting the goal we've set in this program," he said. "It's an act of patriotism but also an act of good business sense, because I predict this will result in breakthroughs that are likely to position our American auto industry to dominate the growing world market in the next century."
Meeting the goal would also reduce pollution and fuel imports. It is also a way for the Government to try to salvage huge assets threatened with obsolescence by the end of the cold war: weapons laboratories and technologies. It is, in effect, an effort to beat swords into automobile fenders.
A draft summary of the agreement, prepared by the White House, said the technologies that Washington would bring to the table included "super-strong, lightweight materials developed for advanced weapons systems," and advanced capacitors, devices that store electricity, which were built for the Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars.
The Advanced Research Projects Agency will provide designs for super-efficient motors and fuel cells, and the Army Tank Command will provide "virtual design and prototyping," which are computer-aided systems for moving ideas into factory production faster, the draft said.
 
'Radical Changes'
 Financing for the projects will be split, the summary said, with Washington taking the larger share of the "riskier long-term projects," and the car companies paying for the "projects with near-term marketplace applications."
The long-term goal is to produce cars in about 10 years that are practical and affordable and go three times asfar on a given quantity of fuel as comparable cars do today. But the draft said the "Government and industry engineers recognize that this ambitious goal will require radical changes in the way automobiles operate and that the results are risky and uncertain."
The idea, according to the draft, is to use Federal resources -- including scientists and laboratories that are idle because the development of weapons has been scaled back -- for research in the areas "where risks are so high and rewards so delayed that the U.S. industry could not afford the investment." But the work is not supposed to increase the Government's total research spending.
 
An Electric Component?
 The partnership does not say even broadly how the mileage goal would be accomplished. The mention of capacitors implies that the car would be powered by electricity, at least in part.
The agreement also mentions fuel cells, which are devices first developed for the space program, that combine oxygen from the air and hydrogen from natural gas or other fuels, and produce electricity and water.
There are also short-term goals, including building cars with lightweight materials, which would improve fuel economy without changes in the engines, and the use of materials that can be recycled.

HEADLINE: Country Music Boom Has Nashville Dancing

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Seven months ago Chas Sandford packed up 29,000 pounds of recording gear and moved his studio from Los Angeles to Nashville. But it wasn't country music that drew him here.
"Between crime, riots, gangs, earthquakes, and fires, it's like 'Blade Runner' out there," said Mr. Sandford, comparing Los Angeles to the 1982 film's nightmarish view of urban decay. "I'd say 25 percent of the people I know have moved and a lot of them have come to Nashville, where you don't see graffiti every time you open your eyes, and you don't hear helicopters over your house all the time." 
 The talk of Nashville today was the annual Country Music Association Awards, which in 27 years have grown from a cultural footnote to the three-hour, prime-time network extravaganza that will be broadcast Wednesday. And much like country music's phenomenal growth, Nashville, from its booming health-care industry to the new office towers and L.A. hipsters sprouting along Music Row, is a revealing window on a nation that culturally and demographically continues to move South and West.
 
Big Hair and Health Care, Too
 "I lived in Manhattan for a long time, but ultimately you want to live in a place where life is a little saner," said Evelyn Shriver, a music-industry publicist who moved here eight years ago. "You hear a lot about people going back to churches. People are having kids. Country music reflects their life. As a society, people are grasping for something that's safer because everything else is so nuts."
Nashville, as its boosters tirelessly point out, is more than big hats, big hair and the Country Music Wax Museum & Mall. Its economy is heavily dependent on the nearby auto plants in Smyrna and Spring Hill, state government, education, transportation and a health-care industry that includes 240 companies and controls half the for-profit hospital beds in America. The consolidated city and county has a population of 511,000; the metropolitan area, which one recent study projects will grow by 22 percent this decade, has just over a million residents.
One of the most remarkable things about the country boom is that it has finally won over Nashville, whose staid establishment has historically regarded those in the country music community as benighted hillbilly bumpkins.
But with dollars comes respect, and Nashville is now embracing country music as never before.
Country record sales have increased from $425 million in 1988 to $1.5 billion in 1992. Country became the nation's leading radio format a few years back, growing from fewer than 100 stations 30 years ago to more than 2,200 now.
"Everybody in the music industry here is working at warp 12," said Robert Oermann, a writer and radio personality long active with the music scene. "Every week there's someone new from Los Angeles looking to open an office."
At Americana Records on Music Row near downtown, where record companies are slapping up new office buildings next to offices in converted cottages on streets with names like Chet Atkins Place and Roy Acuff Place, President Tom Kawai has come a good deal further.
"I love country music, but Nashville isn't just about country music," said Mr. Kawai, who grew up in Japan listening to Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, and whose Japanese-based company puts together recording and licensing deals in Nashville. "That's why I have a plan to do other categories of music here, like Spanish crossover music or traditional-Japanese-meets-country music."
The Spanish crossover has yet to reach critical mass, but the country boom is being felt throughout Nashville.
"You go into a restaurant or any kind of event of political or social importance, and you will see an awful lot of people that you don't know, that you didn't know existed," said John Egerton, an author and longtime resident. "And you've got to know that these people are mainly New York and Hollywood folk who have joined the ant colony."
 
Discord Amid the Harmony
 In truth, Nashville is hardly exempt from the nation's social ills. Last year, the beating of a black undercover police officer at the hands of city police officers stirred racial tension that lingers. Just this month, in a crime that shook Nashville to its core, a 16-year-old girl, Elysia Coughlan, was robbed and shot to death in a trendy neighborhood near Vanderbilt University after withdrawing $20 from an automatic teller machine.
And some newcomers find culture in Nashville, where gathering places tend to be more like the Pancake Pantry than Spago, a bit bland.
Aside from Music Row, the main impact of the boom is being felt downtown. Once the music industry's home, later all-but abandoned, the southeast part of downtown near the Cumberland River is now seeing a flood of activity as old warehouses are rebuilt into trendy shops, restaurants and a huge country dance emporium.
Since the Opry moved to its suburban digs at Opryland in 1974, its longtime downtown home at 101-year-old Ryman Auditorium has been a rather forlorn museum. Tourists can still gaze at Roy Acuff's elephant-hide shoes and autographed baseball collection and view aged photographs of stars like Jim Reeves, Ernest Tubb and Stonewall Jackson, who, as the saying goes, were country when country wasn't cool.
Now it is being renovated with plans to reopen as a concert hall next June. The City Council in June approved plans for a $100 million downtown arena and hopes to lure an N.B.A. or N.H.L. franchise there. Gaylord Entertainment, which owns both Opryland U.S.A. and the Ryman, plans to link them with 57-foot-long water taxis in an unlikely blend of Venice and Garth Brooks.
 
Gentrifying the Hillbillies
 On Broadway, the ragged strip of ancient record stores, pawn shops, cheesy clubs and music shops that was once the industry's heart, not everyone is thrilled with the big plans.
"I think it's going to get too upscale and kill all the history," said Toby Carr, amid the fringed white boots, oversized beaverskin hats, banjos and guitars he sells at his Toby Carr Music, next to Tootsie's Orchid Lounge downtown. "Nashville hates the old Hee Haw Hillbilly image. When they talk about history they don't care about the music that made Nashville; all they want to preserve is the bricks. It could be wall-to-wall sushi bars for all they care."
But more common is a sense that country's suddenly mainstream image has an indelible demographic logic: people are listening to the suburban country of heartthrobs like Garth Brooks and Alan Jackson for pretty much the same reasons they're moving to Nashville and Charlotte.
"When people think of the good life they don't think about being on Wall Street in Manhattan; they think of having a home and raising a family in a place that's a decent place to do it," said Phil Bredesen, a Harvard-educated, health-care entrepreneur who became Nashville's mayor in 1991. "I think the culture that people admire is no longer the culture of the big cities of the Northeast. It's the culture of places like Nashville."
 
The South Rises
 In fact, there is no shortage of comparably sized metropolitan areas in the South like Charlotte, the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area of North Carolina or the Greenville-Spartanburg corridor in South Carolina that are doing quite well without the Music City moniker and music industry jobs.
According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, almost a third of the new jobs added in the first quarter of 1993 came in the eight-state Southern region that includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Using a slightly different definition of the Southeast, Charlotte's First Union bank recently reported that the Northeast and West Coast have lost more than 450,000 manufacturing jobs over the past two years while the Southeast has gained 23,000.
Here in Nashville, some worry that country may soon wear out its formula of hunky young male singers or that developers will repeat the real estate speculation that boomed in the early 80's and crashed a few years later.
But for now, most signals continue to flash green. One newcomer here is the novelist Jay McInerney, whose "Bright Lights, Big City" captured the cultural and pharmacological currents of New York in the 80's. He has since married a woman from Nashville, divides his time between New York and Nashville and is sniffing out the cultural aromas here.
"The zeitgeist," he said quoting the old country music aphorism, "seems to be heading in that direction."

HEADLINE: Salinas to Delay Nomination

BYLINE: Reuters)

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, in power since 1929, will postpone the ritual unveiling of its presidential candidate until after the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement has been decided, party officials said today.
The officials declined to discuss any link between the two events, but said the nomination would be announced early next year and not around November as it has been in the past. 
 The unveiling of the ruling party candidate is viewed by most Mexicans as the naming of the next President by the incumbent because such candidates have won every presidential election for more than 60 years.
"The party's timetable is for the early part of next year, and all the comments we'll make will be after the new year," Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the party's national executive committee, said in an interview faxed by the party to news agencies. There had been speculation that the unveiling would not take place before the new year as the choice of candidate might be affected by the success or failure of Nafta, which is viewed as the key to increasing Mexico's economic growth.
The trade pact, signed last December by the leaders of Canada, Mexico and the United States, is due to go into effect on Jan. 1 but has yet to be ratified by the United States Congress, where it faces strong opposition.
Thew three men believed to lead the list of candidates being considered by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari are Finance Minister Pedro Aspe Armella, Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis of Mexico City and Social Development Minister Luis Donaldo Colosio.

HEADLINE: South African Deal Made By Food Processor Pillsbury

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Moving quickly after Nelson Mandela, head of the African National Congress, called Friday for an end to trade sanctions against South Africa, Pillsbury said today that it would create a joint venture with a leading South African food company to make and market Pillsbury products there.
Groups that have monitored American trade ties with South Africa said that Pillsbury's move was the first significant investment by an American company in South Africa since the plea by Mr. Mandela. They expect many other deals for marketing ventures and investments. 
 Pillsbury, which is based in Minneapolis and owned by Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. of Britain, said it would make a substantial investment in the factories of its partner, the Table Top division of Foodcorp. It will also transfer the technology necessary for the production of such foods as its Green Giant frozen and canned vegetables and Pillsbury frozen pizzas and cookie dough. The venture, to be known as Pillsbury Africa Ltd., plans to export to neighboring countries from the Table Top plants.
 
'An Exceptional Opportunity'
 "This joint venture provides us with an exceptional opportunity to build our Pillsbury brands in an area with outstanding growth potential," Paul Walsh, Pillsbury's chief executive, said in an official statement.
Pillsbury officials said that the deal had been negotiated in recent months by John R. Spiers, head of Pillsbury's international division, and Dirk Jacobs, chief executive of Foodcorp, but that the decision to go ahead would not have been made before Mr. Mandela's speech.
American depository receipts for shares of Grand Metropolitan closed up 37.5 cents yesterday at $25.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The African National Congress's campaign for international sanctions to force the end of apartheid in South Africa led many state and local governments in the United States to shun business with companies involved in South Africa. That in turn pressured more than 200 American companies to divest themselves of operations there during the 1980's.
"We have a lot of calls from companies expressing interest and asking about what state and local sanctions remain in place," said William Moses, senior policy analyst for the Investor Responsibility Research Center Inc., a Washington-based policy research firm.
Mr. Moses said the sanctions had had little impact on many consumer-goods companies that do not have large sales to publicly run institutions like schools and hospitals. Computer products are also widely available in South Africa, he said.
 
Moves Made in Anticipation
 Mr. Moses said his firm's research showed that there had already been a rapid increase in business relationships between American and South African companies this year as South Africa moved toward majority rule. The number of companies that have not directly invested in South Africa but have arrangements to sell their products there jumped to 420 this month from 349 in April, according to the center. The number with actual investments rose to 135 from 120 in the same period.
The figures do not include companies like Pillsbury that are not American-owned. Other Grand Met businesses have continued operating in South Africa throughout the international sanctions, and Grand Met now has more than 1,700 employees there, according to the center. One legal question is whether Pillsbury will be required to make sure that its joint venture follows employment practices specified by the American Government for United States companies doing business in South Africa.
Many of the new investments, like Pillsbury's, are likely to be partnerships, in part because American companies want to see the transition to a majority-rule government completed with some sign that the economy will not be undermined by racial violence.
"We've had teams down there investigating for a year and a half," said Edward Smyth, a spokesman for the H. J. Heinz Company. "The biggest hurdle is finding the right partner." Heinz's main effort at the moment has been in raising money for the South African Free Election Fund, a New York-based charity supporting voter registration for the planned elections in South Africa.
Pillsbury said that its venture, if successful, would lead to more employment in the South African cities of George and Port Elizabeth over a three-year period but declined to estimate how many jobs might result.
"Pillsbury's move will be seen as welcome, but what South Africa really wants is companies to build factories that weren't there before or to reopen those that have closed," Mr. Moses said.

Dollar Down as Hopes Fade On Cutting the Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen and most other currencies yesterday after a meeting of United States and Japanese leaders yielded few concrete signs of progress toward cutting the American trade deficit.
Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $355.40 an ounce, up $1.70 from Monday; gold for October delivery rose $1.60, to $355.40 an ounce. 
 Currency traders said the markets were disappointed that no new initiatives on cutting the trade deficit emerged from a meeting Monday between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan.
The yen has climbed about 15 percent against the dollar this year, in part on the perception that the United States Government wanted a stronger yen to help close the trade gap. A stronger yen makes Japanese imports in the United States more expensive, and American exports to that country cheaper.
Adding to the market's disappointment was a Washington Post report saying that Secretary of State Warren Christopher had told Mr. Hosokawa that the Government was not satisfied with the measures Japan has taken thus far, traders said.
"The market mostly thinks U.S.-Japanese relations are kind of sour again," said Win Thin, an economist at MCM Currencywatch, an analytic service. He added that he thought the market was too pessimistic.
The dollar also fell against the German mark, as worry about political upheaval in Russia abated. Investors had abandoned the mark last week on fears that Germany's economy could be vulnerable because of the country's trade and investment ties to Russia.
"Behind everything, point-blank, there was profit taking," he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar settled at 105.72 yen, down 0.55 yen from late Monday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 105.20 yen, down from 105.90 on Monday. In New York, the dollar finished at 105.00 yen, down from 106.20.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5135, from $1.5123 late Monday. In New York, the pound finished at $1.5130, slightly cheaper than $1.5135 on Monday.

HEADLINE: Go Personal, Whitman Is Implored

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Top advisers to Christine Todd Whitman said today that the Republican gubernatorial candidate needed to shift her campaign strategy to an all-out attack on Gov. Jim Florio in response to a poll showing the New Jersey Governor with an unexpectedly large lead.
"Negative campaigns work; it's one of the tragedies of American politics," said Ed Rollins, chief political adviser to the Whitman campaign and a veteran of national campaigns. "Obviously, Florio has been running a very negative campaign and we have to do something about it. I think it is safe to say that if New Jersey voters have forgotten what Jim Florio did to them over the last four years, we are going to remind them." 
 Mrs. Whitman has avoided directly personal attacks against Mr. Florio, hammering away at the $2.8 billion tax increase he pushed through the Legislature in 1990 and attributing the state's sour economy to that. But a New York Times/WCBS-TV poll published today found a surprising degree of acceptance of the tax increases, as well as showing Mr. Florio with a lead of 51 percent to 30 percent over Mrs. Whitman among registered voters.
That sent the Whitman campaign scrambling to reassess its approach five weeks before Election Day.
"There has been a growing body of opinion that you have got to go out and very graphically and very forcibly attack those vulnerable spots," Carl Golden, spokesman for the Whitman campaign, said today. "You really have to go and do it. It isn't necessarily negative campaigning." It's a discussion, he said of "stuff that is already out there, and I think you will see some of that."
 
Plenty of People Undecided
 The poll also indicated great volatility among New Jersey voters, showing that just 46 percent of registered voters said that their minds were "made up," while the rest said they were undecided or might change their minds before the election.
Since the onset of the general-election campaign in June, Mr. Florio has run a hard-edged effort that has kept Mrs. Whitman on the defensive. The Governor, a Democrat, has depicted her as out of touch with voters because of her wealth, assailing her over two tax-sheltered farms she owns, and also as soft on crime.
James Carville, chief political strategist for Mr. Florio's campaign, remarked: "I think the mood around this joint for the next five weeks is going to continue to be as aggressive as it has been in the last five months. If anything, we are going trying to accelerate the pace. But we also expect the intensity of the political blows of Mrs. Whitman to increase."
The New York Times/WCBS-TV News showed that Mr. Florio's personal criticism of Mrs. Whitman had taken root among a majority of voters who gave the Governor much higher marks on questions of honesty and integrity, leadership and trust, despite their lingering anger over the tax increase.
Mrs. Whitman, in spite of what her advisers were saying, gave no indication today that she had shifted her strategy. Ending a visit to Washington, where she attended a fund-raiser on Monday night and toured the Holocaust Museum today, she told reporters that she and her advisers would keep the campaign on its current track despite the poll showing her trailing Mr. Florio.
 
Insisting on the Road Taken
 "What people have to remember are what his policies have done to the state, how badly they're hurt," she said. "They know what they're going to get with him -- more of the same. They have a choice."
Mrs. Whitman said she was not rattled by the poll results or the initial negative reception the public had given to her promise to cut the state budget by nearly $1.5 billion in three years if she is elected Governor. "It is very broad and bold," she said of the tax-cut plan, announced a week ago. "I expect people to be a little bit skeptical."
People close to Mrs. Whitman's campaign said that in private sessions, advisers had told her she must launch a nonstop negative campaign against Mr. Florio in the closing weeks in order to have any chance of winning.
"Christie does not like to be involved in a negative campaign and that's the big question," one informant, a senior Republican official, said. "Everybody knows what needs to be done; the question is will she sign off on it."
A chorus of Republican leaders, shaken by the poll results, urged Mrs. Whitman today to step up the level and intensity of attacks on Mr. Florio.
"You can't get shot at and not shoot back," said Jay Severin, a Republican consultant. "Her current campaign strategy is like an army that has run out of bullets.
"In order to win, this campaign must fundamentally change the way it has operated in virtually every aspect, and it will have to do it overnight," Mr. Severin said. "It's not just that she is behind at this point. That's the easy part. It's why she is behind."

Bell Canada to Reduce Its Work Force by 10%

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Bell Canada, the largest telecommunications company in Canada, today announced its first big retrenchment in recent years, the result of intensified global competition and the rejection by Canadian regulators of proposed rate increases.
The company, which is based in Montreal and provides telephone and other communications services to 6.5 million business and residential customers in Ontario, Quebec and the eastern Arctic, said it planned to cut its work force by 10 percent, or 5,000 people, in the next few months. 
 For the moment, no layoffs are planned, Robert Kearney, the president of Bell Canada, said in a videotaped address to employees. Cutbacks will be through measures like reduced workweeks, leave-of-absence extensions, voluntary part-time programs and early retirements.
Analysts said they welcomed the move. "They needed to make some drastic decisions in order to achieve any semblance of a reasonable rate of return," said Robert J. Hastings, who follows telecommunications for Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. in Toronto.
 
'Huge Labor Charges'
 "This is what everyone else is doing," added John Ing, the president of Maison Placements Canada, another investment firm based in Toronto. "Bell's labor charges are huge. They have a huge bureaucracy."
Bell Canada had managed to insulate itself from the recession that has overwhelmed much of Canadian industry in recent years and produced unemployment that is 50 percent higher than that in the United States. The unemployment rate in Canada is more than 11 percent.
The move today comes after the recent downgrading of Bell Canada's credit rating and a decision by credit agencies to put the company on a credit watch. "Our nonnegotiable priority must be to effect this reversal in the decline in earnings, or the negative effects will snowball," Mr. Kearney said.
Bell Canada and other provincial telephone companies lost their century-old monopoly in long-distance service last year, a factor that has intensified the competitive pressures on the Canadian giant that once was linked to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
 
A Common Founder
 Both companies were founded by Alexander Graham Bell, who was raised in Brantford, Ontario, about an hour's drive west of Toronto, but lived much of his life in Washington. A.T.& T. at one time owned as much as 49 percent of the stock of Bell Canada. A.T.& T. sold its entire stake in 1975.
Bell Canada is now fully owned by BCE Inc., a holding company based in Montreal, but the indirect pressure from A.T.& T. is behind some of the stepped-up competition faced by Bell Canada.
A.T.& T. owns 20 percent of Unitel Communications Inc., which is based in Toronto and competes with Bell Canada in the long-distance market.
So far unsuccessfully, Bell Canada has asked the regulators to raise the local telephone rates. It had sought a 40 percent increase to offset the revenue losses from the increased competition in long-distance service. As in the United States, long-distance subsidizes local service in Canada.
 
Local Service Compromised
 The new restraint program, Mr. Kearney said, would compromise some local phone service in Ontario and Quebec. "We will do the very best we can with the resources we have," he said.
Bell Canada earned $1 billion Canadian (about $750 million) last year on revenues of $7.8 billion (about $5.8 billion). Earnings have shown little growth over the last 6 or 7 years. In the first half of this year net income was $327 million (about $245 million), compared with $453 million (about $340 million) in the comparable period of 1992.
Bell Canada consulted with its unions before making today's announcement, and the response was restrained. The Canadian Telephone Employees Association, which represents 18,000 clerical and sales employees at Bell Canada, said "the majority of measures announced today are no surprise."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
California Bonds Well Received

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The hunger for yields while interest rates remain low made for a nice deal for California yesterday.
The state, which has yet to put its fiscal problems behind it, sold $800 million in general obligation bonds in a competitive sale won by Merrill Lynch & Company. 
 One measure of the demand was that Merrill Lynch lowered the yield it was planning to bid on the bonds, which run from one year to 30 years, by about 10 basis points between when it began talking to potential customers and the bidding deadline, according to Paul Kuhns, the director of municiapl markets.
Another sign was a comparison of a general obligation deal by California on March 31 and yesterday's offering. In March, the spread between the yield on the California 30-year bonds -- rated Aa by Moody's and A+ by S.& P. -- and triple A bonds tracked by Bloomberg Business News was 29 basis points. For yesterday's offering, that spread had narrowed to about 20 basis points, reflecting the willingness of portfolio managers and others to pay a higher price. Prices and yield move in the opposite direction.
Still, there was one sign that Merrill might have been more aggressive than it had to be. The other bid, from Goldman, Sachs & Company, was for a combined interest rate for all securities of 4.90 percent, a rate enough above Merrill's 4.835 percent to raise questions.
But Mr. Kuhns argued that Merrill could be more aggressive because it would have an easier job selling the California bonds. "We have such a strong distribution system" and many more firms in the entire syndicate that bid with Merrill on the bonds, he said.
But David Johnson, manager of tax-exempt mutual funds at Van Kampen Investment Advisory Group in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., said the yields on the California issues were too low. He offered to buy some of the bonds from the Merrill lead syndicate, but the lower price he was willing to pay made the yields about 8 basis points higher then the Merrill bid.
David Andersen, the other director of municipal markets at Merrill, said that by late yesterday there was still about $390 million of the bonds in the syndicate. He said that about $150 million of that was in one- to five-year maturities, which some money managers were reluctant to buy because they had very high coupon interest rates, pushing the price unusually high above par, or face value.
For example, the bonds due in 1996 pay a coupon interest rate of 11 percent on the face value of the bond. But the actual yield, after factoring in a price of over $120 for a face value of $100, is 3.40 percent. He said that many funds can not buy bonds when the premium over par is that high.
Mr. Kuhns said that the tone of the market yesterday, with long-term yields down in the morning bidding, and the fact that other deals yesterday offered even lower yields made money managers willing to pay a little more for the California offering. The sharp drop in interest rates on Monday, when the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dropped below 6 percent again, also pulled down yields.
He said that as the talks with customers for the California deal went on, the yields were also being lowered for a separate competitive issue, a $316.6 million refunding of general obligation bonds from Mecklenburg County, N.C., which are rated triple A. Merrill also won that issue.
As the yields on this sale fell, he said, people looked at California, Although the offering might have been a little more expensive than they wanted, they were willing to pay a little more because the yield was higher.
He said it was the pressure for higher returns, which has already helped drive the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond below 6 percent, rather than an improvement in the fiscal condition of California that apparently accounted for California's getting a better interest on yesterday's deal than the one in March.
Mr. Kuhns also noted that some of the demand for the California issue came from buyers, like large investment firms, which get no advantage from the tax-exempt status of the municipal bonds. They are called cross-over buyers.
They want the bonds for their potential price performance not the yield. They are betting that the price on a municipal bond will rise faster than the price on a comparable Treasury security.
This has been a popular bet this year, but it has not worked very well because so far yields on Treasury securities have come down faster than those on tax-exempt securities, which means Treasury prices have risen more.
But if a buyer thinks that interest rates are now moving higher, then the cross-over buy might work. If rates do rise, it is expected that the prices of Treasury securities will fall faster than those of municipal bonds.
In the California deal, the bonds were priced to yield from 2.50 percent in 1994 to 5.00 percent for the bond due in 2010 through 2013. The 30-year bond due in 2023 was priced to yield 5.24 percent.
 
Treasury Market
 The prices of Treasury bonds and yields bobbed around yesterday but there was little change on the day. The price of the 30-year bond rose 3/32 as the yield held at 5.94 percent. the yield on the 10-year note ended at 5.29 percent, up from 5.28 percent, and the yield on the two-year note rose to 3.79 percent from 3.78 percent.

HEADLINE: How Demand Surged for Prostate Test

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
DR. JOSEPH E. OESTERLING, a urologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., recently polled practicing doctors in his state to ask whether they were using a widely promoted screening test for prostate cancer. Ninety-two percent said they routinely used it on men over 50.
But the blood test, which costs $50 to $80 per patient, has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a screening test and no data yet exist to show that it has an effect on long-term medical outcome. 
 The test, known as the P.S.A. test, for prostate specific antigen, also has a high rate of false positive results, meaning that a positive result leads to other, more expensive follow-up tests and treatments to confirm it. Almost 1 in 5 people with high P.S.A. levels does not have cancer, and nearly 1 in 4 with prostate cancer has normal P.S.A. levels.
Some economists estimate it would cost the nation $28 billion a year if all men 50 and over have the test, along with subsequent tests and treatments for those with positive results.
 
Effectiveness of Test
 A study reported this summer in The Journal of the American Medical Association found the test to be twice as effective as a physical examination in finding early cancer, and many doctors and patients are convinced of its usefulness.
But the question remains, in this time of national agony over health care costs, how did an unapproved test with potentially astronomical costs become entrenched as part of the nation's medical system? Despite the lack of F.D.A. approval, the test is recommended for screening by the American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association. But it has not been endorsed for that purpose by the National Cancer Institute or the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a federally sponsored but independent group that draws up medical guidelines.
Doctors and health care analysts say the story of the P.S.A. test's rise to prominence and acceptance shows the power of the pharmaceutical and device industry to create and increase demand for a product. Even doctors who say they are convinced that the test is saving lives say it would never be so popular today were it not for aggressive promotions.
For example, proponents and opponents of the test agree that much of the public demand was elicited by the enthusiastic advertising of the annual Prostate Cancer Awareness Week, paid for by the makers of drugs to treat the cancer and by makers of the P.S.A. test. The ubiquitous public service advertisements featuring celebrities like the baseball star Stan Musial are paid for by TAP Pharmaceuticals of Deerfield, Ill., a maker of a prostate cancer treatment.
The companies also support a patient group, Us Too, which sent a representative to a recent meeting held by the National Cancer Institute to discuss the merits of the test and to an F.D.A. advisory committee meeting last spring to discuss an application by Hybritech of San Diego, a division of Eli Lilly & Company, to market the P.S.A. test as a screening test. The committee asked for more data than the company had supplied and said that if the test received approval, it should be used to screen only men at high risk.
 
Drumming Up Demand
 "To me, the whole issue of P.S.A. testing is, in a microcosm, what's wrong with our health care system," said Dr. Peter Albertson, a urologist at the University of Connecticut in Farmington. "Industry is pumping a lot of money into this and creating a demand for a product."
Urologists benefit because the test has made the prostate "the biggest money-maker for urologists, a large part of a urology business," he said. Hospitals benefit because prostate patients fill many beds. So, he said, even though the test has limitations, "sometimes people don't want to look too hard at a gift horse."
Dr. John Wasson, director of the Center for Aging at Dartmouth College, agreed. Now that the test is so widely accepted, he added, "the scary thing is, this will happen with other tests in the future."
Dr. Oesterling, a proponent of the test who is nevertheless critical of the marketing tactics, explained how the test's makers persuaded doctors to use it. "They marketed the heck out of it," he said. "They went around the country saying, 'Doctor, you need to get a P.S.A. on your patients. Start using it, start using it.' The next thing, patients started coming in and saying, 'Doctor, check my P.S.A.' "
The test detects a protein, P.S.A., that leaks into the blood from the prostate, a walnut-size gland that produces fluid that nourishes sperm. Prostate cancers can lead to high levels of the protein, but so can innocuous enlargements of the gland. Sometimes men have high P.S.A. levels with no apparent cause. The F.D.A. approved the test in 1986 as a way of following the progress of cancer in men in whom the cancer had already been diagnosed. But once a test is on the market, doctors can use it for other purposes, at their own discretion.
Prostate cancer is the leading cancer among men and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men. After the cancer spreads outside the prostate there is little that doctors can do to treat it. Proponents of the test say that it can find prostate cancers while they are still small and potentially curable.
Opponents say that it has never been shown that P.S.A. screening has an effect on the ultimate outcome of the disease for most men. As many as 70 percent of all men in their 80's have early prostate cancer, but in a vast majority these cancers remain undetected and unthreatening. No one knows which cancers will turn out to be deadly and no one can say whether early treatment with surgery or radiation cures them. And the treatment has its own risks, often resulting in impotence and incontinence.
The P.S.A. test, as Dr. Albertson recalls it, came to prominence in the late 1980's, spurred by several developments. Reports in medical journals about the success of the P.S.A. in detecting tumors brought it to the attention of urologists and other doctors. Then the follow-up test, which had required a hospital visit, suddenly became a quick and easy office procedure when makers of transrectal ultrasound machines began selling them to urologists, complete with a spring-loaded biopsy gun, to obtain tissue samples.
 
'A No-Brainer'
 "Overnight, a procedure that required booking in the hospital became basically a no-brainer," Dr. Albertson said. "It became a test that takes 15 minutes, with no pain, and is relatively risk-free."
At the same time, the marketing of prostate cancer screening began. In 1989, the first Prostate Cancer Awareness Week was held, with a campaign engineered by the New York public relations firm of Burson-Marsteller, and paid for by the Schering-Plough Corporation.
Last year, said Dr. Stephen Rubino, senior product manager at Schering Laboratories in Kenilworth, N.J., the pharmaceutic company paid $1.2 million for this campaign. For this year's campaign, which began on Sept. 20, other companies and the American Cancer Society have joined to share the burden with Schering-Plough, whose share of this year's $240,000 campaign is $100,000. The campaign is under the auspices of the Prostate Cancer Education Council, a group of doctors, health educators and patient support groups.
The campaign has been "extremely successful," said Dr. E. David Crawford, a urologist at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver who is head of the education council. Dr. Crawford said that when it began in 1989, the group hoped to draw a few thousand men for screening. Instead, he said: "We had an overwhelming response. Fifteen thousand men came to 91 sites for screening. The next year we had 150,000. The years after that, we had over half a million."
Dr. Stephen Brenner, an internist who has a private practice in New Haven, said that he got many requests for the test, and that he felt he could not refuse to do it, even though he had reservations about its usefulness as a screening tool.
 
'An Avalanche' of Requests
 "It's an avalanche," he said. "It's really snowballed. The overwhelming majority of my male patients are aware of the test. They'll either ask about it or request it." He also worries about malpractice suits. And, he added: "I feel it can be helpful, but I don't know when."
Dr. Brenner said he felt the Prostate Cancer Awareness Weeks were "pretty transparent." He added: "I'm opposed to industry promoting products to patients. I am opposed to demand coming from industry. We ought to have firm scientific evidence that a test is useful before we start using it."
Last year, the American Cancer Society recommended that all men over 50 have an annual P.S.A. test and digital rectal examination. It recommended that men with a family history of the disease or who are black, placing them at higher risk, have the tests every year starting at 40.
JoAnn Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the cancer society, said the reason for the screening recommendation was that "men were having the test anyway."
"Doctors were doing it," she said. "We needed to spell out some very distinct practice guidelines. That is more useful than debating and riding the fence."
Now, some researchers question whether it will ever be possible to learn if the test saves lives. The only definitive way to do that would be to enroll men in a study, randomly assigning some to have it and others not to and then see which group benefited most. This is a study that the National Cancer Institute hopes to do.
But, Dr. Oesterling said: "That study will never get done. You are never going to find in the United States any more a control group of people who will not get a P.S.A."

Will Rogers
 By Ben Yagoda
 Illustrated. 409 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50.
Why is it that certain legends pale after their own time? Will Rogers is known to many today mostly because of the recent and frivolous Broadway musical. You could say that a man who claimed he'd never met a man he didn't like deserves no better. But you could also say, and show, as the journalist and English professor Ben Yagoda ably shows, that a man who managed to get himself liked and listened to by Calvin Coolidge, Dorothy Parker, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Woody Guthrie and H. L. Mencken deserves more sustained analytic attention. 
 Will Rogers was born in 1879, into a generation shaped by the last days of Victorianism and the first days of modernism. D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille in movies, Scott Joplin and W. C. Handy in music, Rogers and George M. Cohan on the stage and Ruth St. Denis and Isadora Duncan in modern dance: all were determined to fuse modern forms with folk or antique content. Rogers looked back to the Noble Savage and the Frontiersman while looking forward to the stand-up comic as cultural commentator: a Johnny Carson, in Mr. Yagoda's words, with touches of Walter Cronkite, Bill Cosby and Ross Perot.
His biography opens with a cultural paradox: Will Rogers was a cowboy and an Indian. He was the son of wealthy Cherokees, second-generation settlers in the Indian Territory, which became part of Oklahoma. Clem and Mary Rogers were mixed bloods (part white, part Indian), with full rights in the Cherokee Nation. Since Clem had fought for the Confederacy and had amassed 60,000 acres of land along with cattle and wheat holdings, he had nearly full rights in the European-American nation as well.
Will grew up a rich man's son, among white, Indian and black farmers and cowmen. He rode and practiced roping for hours, and he preferred ragtime songs and cakewalk contests to school. When he saw the virtuosic rope tricks of a Mexican vaquero at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, he fell in love with show business and got his first job in 1903 with a Wild West show that toured South Africa. He was billed as the Cherokee Kid and was recommended by his boss as the "Champion Trick Roughrider and Lasso Thrower of the World."
A year later he played a dying soldier in a re-creation of Custer's Last Stand at the St. Louis World's Fair. Sitting Bull was played by the Apache chief Geronimo, on loan to the show from prison. There is no record of what Rogers thought (he would later say that Thanksgiving was invented by Pilgrims to "give thanks every time they killed an Indian and took more of his land").
Rogers took his rope tricks into vaudeville in 1905, just as the nation was going mad for all things Western. The move from cowboy to comedian came when he began explaining to his audiences, with ostensible casualness, how hard those tricks were. Jokes about tricks that might fail turned into jokes about gags that might fail.
Instead of lassoing cast or audience members onto the stage for a mock interview, he started bringing a newspaper onto the stage, and making fun of its contents in language that paired plain talk (frontier dialect) with hip talk (city slang). Is there a late-night comic who isn't still using every one of these tricks?
"It's not the highest type of work, this acting a fool," he declared in 1925, when he was the top-drawing star of the Ziegfeld Follies. "But it's the best I will ever get."
Bunk, to use one of his favorite words. A few years later he was sending up the nation's social and economic follies in syndicated newspaper columns. He was at his best during the Depression, raising money for drought-stricken states and putting his mouth where his money was.
At his worst, the same man who called J. P. Morgan an outlaw in 1922 called Mussolini the "right" kind of dictator in 1933. The line between folk wisdom and folk ignorance can be pitifully thin: Rogers's world view was, in Mr. Yagoda's words, "common-sense cracker-barrel."
"The cracker-barrel view has a hard time with tragedy (though it does fine with sentiment), with ambiguity, and with evil, and so it was with Will. . . . For the Ku Klux Klan, for Hitler . . . he had only mild gibes."
Part of the Rogers appeal, in fact, lay in an "implicit refusal to challenge the core beliefs of his audience" or to "upset the applecart," Mr. Yagoda writes. In this light it's easy to see why James Agee, writing in 1944 about the hypocrisies of commercial American folk culture, denounced Rogers. But Agee was writing just nine years after Rogers's death. Now, 50 years later, Rogers the innovator can be seen as clearly as Rogers the panderer, and should be no harder to grasp, say, than the fact that D. W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" is great cinema and atrocious history.
As a performer, Rogers pioneered a kind of crafty naturalism that John Ford, who directed him in three movies, knew would serve Westerns for the next 30 years. (Joel McCrea, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry were all fans). His portrayal of the rich Western hayseed trying to hold his own in the city was refined by Gary Cooper and refueled by Ralph Bellamy in 30's romantic comedies. And his portrait of the salt-of-the-earth codger, full of "kinders," "sorters" winks and shrugs, was brought intact to television by Buddy Ebsen and Walter Brennan.
But we have entered a realm of highly mixed cultural blessings. So before you are left alone with reruns of "The Beverly Hillbillies" or with your copy of "Ole Rivers," Walter Brennan's hit record about his mule, let us turn back to the Will Rogers of the Jazz Age.
You must picture him in a smart Western shirt and breeches, with a kerchief around his neck and a felt hat angled just so, almost as men wear fedoras. He looks sensational in the 1923 silent "The Ropin' Fool," riding a goat and using two big lassos to rope a horse and rider simultaneously, then jumping in and out of two smaller ropes like a cowboy mastering Double Dutch. Let a cast member of the 1924 Ziegfeld Follies have the last word.
"My moment of delight came at the end," recalled Louise Brooks, who was smart, finicky, 18 and fresh from a tour with the Denishawn Dancers. "Will Rogers and I climbed a ladder to the top of a 15-foot tower set in the middle of the stage. Starting with a tiny noose on his lasso, Rogers would twirl it faster and faster, bigger and bigger, until the rope hissed in a circle around us like an intoxicated snake as the curtains opened and the dazzling spotlight shone upon us."
What New Vaudevillean wouldn't give his eye teeth for a finish like that?

HEADLINE: Jury Duty Is Exactly That -- a Duty

 BODY:
In New York State, foot doctors are exempted by law from state juries. So are embalmers, police, optometrists, lawyers and practitioners in more than a dozen other lines of work. Such a long list makes it hard for courts to line up all the jurors they need at a given time. That's wrong. The list should be repealed.
The under-representation of minorities in jury pools is also wrong. That happens because prospective jurors' names are taken from three lists that do not represent the whole population: registered voters, licensed drivers and the state's mailing list of taxpayers. The Constitution guarantees every defendant the right to trial "by an impartial jury," which the courts have interpreted to mean a jury drawn from a cross-section of the community. The remedy for New York's deficiency is rather simple -- broader lists. 
 The state's Chief Judge, Judith Kaye, and the Chief Administrative Judge, Leo Milonas, have named a special panel to recommend changes in the jury selection process, along with ways to improve the quality of jury life. The panel will report by year's end, but a solution to the under-representation of minorities may come even sooner.
This summer the State Legislature approved a bill introduced by Deputy Speaker Arthur Eve, Democrat of Buffalo, to draw jurors' names from two more lists: people who receive or have applied for welfare payments, and people receiving unemployment benefits. The bill offered a fair resolution to a clearly unfair situation, but was vetoed for technical reasons; it did not, for example, adequately protect the confidentiality of people on welfare or jobless insurance. It is expected that the flaws can be resolved, and the bill enacted.
Politically, the issue of automatic exemption is far more difficult. A bill by Assemblyman Pete Grannis, Democrat of New York City, would eliminate all of the 20 automatic exemptions now embedded in law. It has reached the Assembly calendar this year, for the first time, but there it sits.
There is no grand design to the exemption list. It just grew when lobbyists for various interest groups persuaded the Legislature to exempt them. Those lobbyists, as well as legislators who are lawyers or doctors themselves, are less than enthusiastic about repeal.
Wholesale repeal may sound drastic. It's not. There would still be procedures for individuals to be excused if they convince the court that jury duty would cause undue hardship -- such as having to shutter a one-person shop.
The number of people who claim automatic exemption may not be great, but the message is rotten; it says that if you're a somebody you needn't serve. Jury service is an obligation of citizenship. It should not be open to easy escape.

Voodoo Lunch

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I was dressed very nicely, thank you, in a sport jacket, neatly pressed slacks and a striped tie. I told the man behind the counter in the Upper West Side restaurant that I wanted a cheeseburger, not too well done, with ketchup.
I also told him that I had no money.
He laughed without showing any amusement and then his face settled into a look of impatience. 
 "I'm serious," I said. "I would like it for free."
"Get outta here," he said, waving his hand, and that was that.
I pulled this stunt a few times, just to see how people would react. A waiter with a heavy Middle Eastern accent said, "Where do you think you are? This is America! Here you have to pay."
I always thought so. But for the past several years politicians have been trying to sell voters on the idea that you can get something for nothing. They seem to be saying that perhaps there is such a thing as a free lunch.
Ronald Reagan was almost religious in his conviction that you could raise revenues by cutting taxes. George Bush, while less devout, held similar beliefs. Nevertheless, during the Reagan era, and while we were reading Mr. Bush's lips, the Government was hemorrhaging money.
Even Bill Clinton campaigned on the idea of tax reductions for the middle class.
With a Federal budget deficit of more than $200 billion, and with state and local governments financially strapped, you would think the politicians had learned something by now.
Enter Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey. Mrs. Whitman is out-Reaganing Reagan. Despite a budget shortfall that could approach $2 billion next year, Mrs. Whitman is proposing the biggest tax cut in the state's history.
In a TV ad she tells voters: ". . . as governor I am going to cut your taxes every year for the next three years, 10 percent each year for most people."
It is a move that is breathtakingly irresponsible.
George Bush called Ronald Reagan's budget proposals in 1980 "voodoo economics."
New Jersey's Democratic Governor, Jim Florio, calls Mrs. Whitman's proposal "voodoo redo."
Mr. Florio was supposed to have been finished politically three years ago when -- at the tail end of the Reagan-Bush era -- he gave New Jersey its biggest tax increase. The Governor's approval rating plummeted and opponents have been attacking him on the tax issue ever since.
But something unusual is happening in New Jersey. A New York Times poll this week showed Mrs. Whitman running well behind the Governor. The voters are not happy about Mr. Florio's tax increases but they seem to be grudgingly conceding that they may have been necessary.
At the same time there is skepticism about Mrs. Whitman's tax cut plan. A tugboat captain was quoted in The Times as saying, "If Whitman cuts the income tax, isn't the money just going to come out of another pocket, or end up with more deficit that will hurt the economy?"
Now might be a good time for politicians around the country to take a look at New Jersey. Mr. Florio exercised tough leadership, both on the tax issue and on a stringent gun control law. He is benefiting from that, and from an opponent who is making promises that few people believe she can deliver.
Elsewhere there seems to be a mortal fear of telling voters -- especially middle-class voters -- that they have to pay for what they get. The President and a majority of both parties in Congress seem to believe that we can bring the nation's fiscal problems under control and establish a system of universal health care without the middle class having to ante up in any significant way.
Hillary Rodham Clinton was on Capitol Hill yesterday, testifying on health care. "There are so many lessons to be learned," she said.
She could have said the same thing about poverty or crime or homelessness, or about the problems of employment or education. All are difficult problems and none will be solved if the middle class just takes a pass.
The lesson to be learned from New Jersey is that politicians do not have to hide the truth -- even tough truths -- from the electorate.

On Dying Hard

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At the Battle of Albuera in 1811, the wounded Col. William Inglis, commander of the 57th Foot Regiment, cried out to his troops: "Die hard, men, die hard!" Since that victory, the Middlesex regiment has been called "the Diehards."
Diehards today are in ill repute, sometimes deservedly so. In the besieged Parliament building in Moscow, cut off from food, water and electricity, an infuriated Aleksandr Rutskoi and a haggard Ruslan Khasbulatov lead a band of Communist apparatchiks defying the Russian President's order to surrender. 
 They are dying hard for the cause of a return to a command economy, centralization of power, gulags, oppression, militarism, imperialism, employer mandates, the whole discredited Socialist works. If the last-ditch defenders of the Brezhnev era were to win, Russia would lose.
But Mr. Rutskoi's diehards intend to provoke the K.G.B. and military units surrounding them into storming their citadel, giving them a chance for political martyrdom. At that moment, world opinion would recoil; President Clinton would have to dissociate himself from President Yeltsin; and across Russia's 11 time zones, a legend of "Rutskoi's last stand" would take root.
Why? Because bravery is admirable. The 200 or so legislators who have slipped out of the embattled Parliament to take advantage of job offers from the Yeltsinites are cowardly opportunists. The remaining diehards, suffering for their repugnant cause, know that they draw from the most grudging democrat at least a moment of admiration.
And they know that their stand, if they can induce Mr. Yeltsin's troops to blaze away, will be remembered in history. Oliver Cromwell shouted to a Parliament unwilling to commit regicide, "It is not fit that you should sit here any longer!" In the ensuing "Pride's purge," a Cromwellian colonel arrested 96 reluctant legislators, leaving a "rump Parliament" to behead the King.
That's the stuff of history; centuries from now, Russian students will learn about Yeltsin's own defiance of coup plotters atop a tank, and -- if today's diehards get their wish -- of the last stand of the brave apparatchiks in Russia's rump Parliament (slyly supported by the displaced Mikhail Gorbachev).
The cameras are in place; the cordon of troops is tightening; the last-ditch bravery of a few is ready to go on display; the only thing missing for history-making is the blunder of impatient authority.
We all saw what happened when authority grew impatient with demonstrators at Tiananmen. Students demonstrating for democracy are not to be equated with bureaucrats demonstrating for Communism, but sympathy will be on the side of those on the receiving end of bludgeons.
We have diehards for a better cause elsewhere. Many Bosnian patriots (usually described with distaste as "Muslim nationalists") dare to demand two-fifths of their former country rather than the one-third dictated by the U.N. They want some "cleansed" Muslim areas back before they surrender most of Bosnia to Greater Serbia and Greater Croatia. And they are willing to continue fighting for some national viability against the odds, despite being denied arms to defend themselves by John Major and Francois Mitterrand.
Those dumb diehards, say the world's imposers. Don't they realize they've lost, they're going to get killed, and -- even worse -- on camera, making us uncomfortable? Don't they know how to be good losers?
Old diehards like Rutskoi clung to their beliefs or power-hunger in the hope of historic vindication beyond the grave. New diehards in Bosnia and Kurdistan have grasped the idea that the hardness of the public dying might force others to prevent it.
If Bosnia's patriots insist on fighting on, would the American President not ask the U.N. to lift the embargo? If he does, would John Major cast the veto -- as he once threatened Clinton with doing -- that would end the Anglo-American special relationship? If new Bosnian arms level the fighting field, would the Serbs and Croats not offer a more honorable peace?
That's the way new diehards think. It's gutsy, and Americans have a claim on the quality: "I die hard," George Washington reportedly said on his deathbed, "but I am not afraid."

HEADLINE: Palestinians to Get $2 Billion In Pledges of Aid for Self-Rule

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will receive pledges of about $2 billion in aid to bolster their economy from more than three dozen countries -- including a multimillion dollar pledge from Israel -- at an American-organized sponsors' conference in Washington on Friday, Administration officials said today.
In the aftermath of the recent agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, Washington organized the conference to provide tangible evidence that the accord will improve the lives of the Palestinians in the occupied territories and defuse the attraction of groups like Hamas, the Islamic militant organization. 
 The United States, the European Community, Japan and Scandinavia have already signaled they would pledge more than $1.4 billion in aid over five years, these officials said, in varying proportions of direct grants, loans and other forms of assistance. Israel's decision to contribute to the Palestinian fund marks one of the historic paradoxes. Once bitter enemies, the two are now pledged to cooperate.
 
Saudis' Commitment Unclear
 On the other hand, a question mark surrounds the position of Saudi Arabia, which over the years has contributed billions of dollars to the P.L.O. But the Saudis cut off aid to the P.L.O. when its leader, Yasir Arafat, backed Iraq in the Persian Gulf war of 1990-1991. After the Israeli-P.L.O. accord, President Clinton asked King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to give his support, and he told the President that even though he still bore a grudge, he would help the P.L.O. out.
So far, however, the Saudis have not signaled the size of any contribution that they might make, although American officials said they hope Saudi Arabia would make a major pledge.
Officials involved in planning the 38-nation conference said Israel would make a direct contribution of about $25 million as the participants seek to give the Palestinians quick, tangible benefits from their agreement with Israel, which sets the stage for local Palestinian self-rule in the occupied lands, starting with Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza strip and the West Bank city of Jericho.
American officials said today that they would provide $500 million in grants and aid to the Palestinians over the next five years, a significant increase from the $250 million over two years that Washington pledged last week.
Administration officials said President Clinton had ordered the State Department and Treasury, the two departments that organized the conference, to make sure the aid produced rapid and visible results in the West Bank and Gaza to demonstrate that the peace accord was making a difference.
 
Pressure to Raise U.S. Pledge
 As host of Friday's gathering of ministers from the United States, Europe and several Arab countries, the Administration has come under significant pressure, from within and without, to put up more money so that its pledge would not be overshadowed by other countries, such as the European Community's pledge of $600 million over five years.
American, Palestinian and World Bank officials said the aid would be used to help set up a new civil administration in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, pay police salaries, help the poor, build housing, and finance investment in public services, like schools and sewers.
Officials from the Palestine Liberation Organization said this week that it was not yet clear what institution would receive and disburse the aid planned to help the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories.
 
Development Authority Set Up
 United Nations aid organizations already active in the territories are expected to distribute the aid over the next month or two. In interviews this week, American, Palestinian, and World Bank officials said a possible vehicle to handle aid long-term is the Palestine Economic Development and Reconstruction Authority, which was set up by P.L.O. officials this month.
This Friday's meeting will aim not just to win pledges, but to coordinate aid and technical assistance, and press the P.L.O. to build institutions and economic bodies that can handle a large flow of aid. The donor countries are eager for the Palestinians to develop an administration that knows how to budget, enforce budgetary discipline and prevent corruption.
American officials said they now anticipate overall aid of $400 million or more flowing to the Occupied Territories annually -- officials say at least one half of that will be loans, the rest being grants. That is considerably more than the level the World Bank originally said was needed in a study it completed shortly before Israel and the P.L.O. signed their peace accord.
Ram K. Chopra, the World Bank's director for the Middle East, said in an interview that the Palestinians need aid of $400 million to $475 million a year, well above the bank's previous estimate of $300 million a year. He said the bank's original study did not take into account the need to finance a civil government or the prospect that tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees would return to the area as a result of the peace accord.
"Now we see they will need money for a police force and for a civil administration," Mr. Chopra said.
The original World Bank estimates were just for basic investments in sewers, health care, education and other areas to satisfy the Palestinians' basic needs. Unlike estimates in the original report, the new, higher estimates also anticipate some relief for the poor and some foreign aid to finance new housing.
American and Palestinian officials agree that it is important that the Palestinians feel quick economic gains to help defuse militancy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
"Any improvement in the economic situation will be felt by Hamas, too," Yousef Sayigh, a senior economic adviser to the P.L.O., said at a seminar here on Tuesday. "They have to feed their children, too."
In an interview today, the Israeli Finance Minister, Avraham Shochat, said an end to violence was vital. "If there is terror, knifing and shootings, no one is gong to invest there," he said.
Mr. Shochat said Israel would transfer some of the tax revenues it receives from the occupied territories to help finance the Palestinian civil administration. Such a move could provide several hundred million dollars to the Palestinians over the next decade, and economists say this could significantly reduce the need for foreign aid.
Reacting to criticisms that Israel has taken a patronizing approach to the Palestinians, Mr. Shochat said, "We don't want to impose ourselves on them, but we do want to help."
Israeli officials said they planned to open their markets further to Palestinian products, especially by gradually removing barriers to farm goods from the Occupied Territories.
American officials said that in addition to the offers by Washington and the European Community, Japan has pledged $200 million over two years, while the Nordic countries have pledged $150 million over an unspecified number of years. Canada, India and several Persian Gulf nations have also indicated that they would contribute.
In addition, World Bank officials are organizing a $75 million emergency package to provide technical assistance and help get a Palestinian civil government off the ground.

HEADLINE: Murdoch in Accord With Craft Unions On Reopening Post

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
After a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity, Rupert Murdoch said yesterday that he was willing to return, once again, to publishing The New York Post.
The price was capitulation by the production unions whose members, for a time, supported a strike by the New York Newspaper Guild, which represents news, advertising and circulation employees. 
 After a daylong series of talks prompted by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Murdoch reached a new agreement with the leaders of the production unions under which they pledged that their members would return to work if Mr. Murdoch resumed management of the newspaper. The agreement set the stage for a bitter confrontation today between strikers and nonstrikers that could test the viability of labor unions in the New York newspaper industry as never before.
 
Persuading Murdoch
 Last night, Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Murdoch, said the leaders of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella group of all newspaper unions except for the guild, helped persuade Mr. Murdoch to return to the management of The Post by assuring him that their members would return to work despite the strike. He said the newspaper's nonunion editors would prepare to put out Friday's paper.
"He decided to give a last chance to the unions to do what they promised to on Monday and didn't do," Mr. Rubenstein said. He added that Mr. Murdoch appeared persuaded that "cooler heads will prevail" among production workers, who had seen Mr. Murdoch prepared to eliminate their jobs by closing the paper. Mr. Rubenstein said he was confident they would now cross the guild picket line that they had refused to cross on Monday.
George McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council, said yesterday that the unions came to terms because the rank and file were "concerned about their jobs."
"I know there were some guys who didn't want to cross," he said, referring to the picket line set up by guild members on Monday night. "They'll cross tomorrow night."
The president of the striking guild, Barry F. Lipton, whose union was isolated by yesterday's agreement, said he remained confident that the individual members of the production unions at The Post would respect his union's fight and would refuse to cross the picket line.
"I know we'll be out here," Mr. Lipton said on the picket line outside The Post's South Street headquarters, "and I think we'll have significant support."
Mr. Lipton was also critical of Mr. McDonald's moves to cooperate with Mr. Murdoch. "It's a disgrace that a person who purports to be a labor leader would assist in the attempt to kill a union," he said.
But the mood among some of those involved suggested that the leaders of the production unions were desperately searching for a way to satisfy Mr. Murdoch and manuever their own members past the guild picket lines.
 
Message From Murdoch
 One person involved in the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said union leaders had received a message delivered through intermediaries who appeared to be speaking for Mr. Murdoch. The message was that Mr. Murdoch would return to run the newspaper only if it was clear that he had prevailed.
"This is not about money," the person said. "It is not about job security. It is about who wins."
The guild represents 287 employees. The heart of the guild's dispute with Mr. Murdoch is his insistence that he be able to dismiss guild members -- one group at a time for each of four months -- as his executives review their usefulness. The guild has proposed a program of voluntary buyouts and an impartial review procedure.
But Mr. Murdoch insisted on the sole power to review guild employees and carry out dismissals without paying severance. The guild said it could not remain a union and permit its members to be dismissed in such a manner.
The leaders of the production unions have had a wary relationship with the guild in recent years. That relationship turned poisonous last winter when Mortimer B. Zuckerman took over The Daily News and, in effect, dismissed more than 170 guild members in a single night.
The production unions had already made separate pacts with Mr. Zuckerman at that time, as they have now at The Post. Already nursing other slights by the guild in other confrontations, the production unions at The News said the guild had been reckless in failing to reach an agreement and they refused to support the guild.
When a similar situation presented itself at The Post under Mr. Murdoch, the leaders of the production unions miscalculated, believing their members would cross a guild picket line or, perhaps, that that the mere threat of crossing the lines would keep the guild from calling a strike in the first place. Some of The Post's production workers would be able to work at other papers if The Post folded.
Mr. Murdoch's threats to dismiss guild members, and his unwillingness to honor severance commitments that would have given out-of-work Post employees some economic security, however, meant that many guild members believed they had little to lose by striking.
But when the guild essentially called the bluff of both Mr. Murdoch and the production unions by going on strike Monday, it had one advantage that people involved in the situation say was underestimated by leaders of the other unions. With only 700 employees, many of whom have worked together for decades, members of the various unions knew each other well.
Some Post guild members had family members in the composing room. Some had lifelong friends from the coffee line. In the end, it was those ties, rather than loyalties from inter-union or industry battles that ruled emotions, and the guild showed unprecedented clout in enforcing a strike.
In a new confrontation today, if there is one, those loyalties will be tested again.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Goes on Offensive Over Giuliani's Views

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
With the underbrush of the Democratic runoff for New York City comptroller cleared away, Mayor David N. Dinkins went on the offensive yesterday, broadcasting his first critical television commercial attacking Rudolph W. Giuliani's past stands on abortion, and squaring off with his challenger over the volatile issue of the city's affirmative-action program for minority contractors.
Together, the Mayor's moves highlighted the candidates' battle for the support of three vital constituencies -- women, liberal Jews and Hispanic voters -- as the race moved solidly into a new phase: direct confrontation. Mr. Giuliani responded by accusing Mr. Dinkins of negative campaigning intended to confuse the voters.
 
1989 Revisited
 By reviving Mr. Giuliani's public reservations about abortion from the 1989 mayoral race, even though the Republican-Liberal candidate has long since said he unequivocally backs abortion rights, Mr. Dinkins sought to reopen the gender gap that prevailed between them four years ago but has virtually disappeared in recent polls. 
 At the same time, Mr. Dinkins seized on Mr. Giuliani's comments reported in The Daily News yesterday that, if elected, he would press to end the Dinkins administration's goal of allocating 20 percent of city contracts to businesses owned by minorities and women. The program was created after a study found that such businesses constituted 25 percent of the concerns operating in the city but only 7 percent of city vendors.
 
'Bad Social Policy'
 Mr. Giuliani called the program, which went into effect last year and for which no statistics are yet available, "bad social policy," and his spokesman said yesterday that he instead favored community development banks financed partly with city pension funds as a way of providing access to capital for minority-owned concerns. Polls have shown that some traditional liberals, Jewish voters in particular, have long opposed such set-asides.
But Mr. Dinkins, appealing to another important swing constituency, disagreed.
"At about 5:30 this morning, I read that and I was shocked," he told reporters at City Hall as he accepted the endorsement of a black firefighters group. "I think when the Latino community fully understands what I have already done and what his positions are on things like residency, Civilian Complaint Review Board and our program for minority and women-owned enterprises, I think that the sands will shift greatly."
Mr. Dinkins spent the morning after the runoff stumping with his party's newly chosen nominee for comptroller, Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, and Mark Green, its choice for public advocate, in the heart of the predominantly liberal Upper West Side, and he pitched hard to cast his contest against Mr. Giuliani as a struggle between Democratic and Republican policies and values.
 
Party Values
 He hammered away at the theme of party values in his new 30-second commercial, in which a narrator cites Mr. Giuliani's statements in 1989 that he believed the landmark abortion ruling of Roe v. Wade should have been overturned. "Can we elect a man who's fought against everything we stand for?" the ad concludes.
Mr. Giuliani, who like many other Roman Catholic politicians has expressed personal reservations about abortion while saying he would uphold existing laws that allow it, ultimately came out four-square for abortion rights in his last campaign and has taken pains to make sure his position is understood this year.
"The Mayor has to reach back four and a half years to confuse voters in this negative ad campaign," said Mr. Giuliani, who campaigned in the middle-class neighborhood of Ridgewood, Queens, and got the endorsement of a Democratic political club there. "I am pro-choice and I have clearly and consistently stated that position during the last campaign and today."
Mr. Giuliani accused the Mayor of trying to obscure the city's record on providing adequate hospital care and access to safe abortions for poor women, issuing a statement saying that the denial of full accreditation to a number of city hospitals had "undermined the city's pro-choice policies on abortion."
For the Mayor, it was a day of courting every possible vote as he raced from the Upper West Side, back to City Hall and then off to the World Trade Center and on to the Lower East Side for meetings with Hispanic New Yorkers and the Federal Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry G. Cisneros.
Mr. Dinkins, who has been fending off harsh attacks from the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, also took pains to show he sympathizes with the officer on the beat, stopping by the Fairway produce market on the Upper West Side to commend Nicholas Antonelli, who helped catch a bandit there Sunday night. On learning that Officer Antonelli was planning to be married at the City Clerk's office yesterday afternoon, Mr. Dinkins offered to perform the ceremony in his office instead, and he did.
 
'The Burgermeister'
 As Mr. Dinkins stood outside the market, surrounded by television cameras, a German tourist came up to him and demonstrated the benefits of incumbency, exclaiming, "I know you, you're the burgermeister!"
The Mayor also began broadcasting another commercial, stressing his efforts to keep racial peace, highlighting a headline from The New York Post after the Los Angeles riots: "Mayor praised for keeping calm as riots hit nation."
Of all the back and forth, however, perhaps the greatest potential for a hot-button issue lay in the dispute over the set-aside program. Mr. Giuliani's spokesman, Richard Bryers, said he had long believed the program was ineffective and might be unconstitutional, though Mr. Dinkins began it only after conducting a lengthy study of the city's contracting records in order to comply with Supreme Court decisions that such programs are permissible only when they seek to rectify demonstrated patterns of past discrimination.
"In the past, programs like this haven't been very effective," Mr. Bryers said. "Our approach to empowering minority-owned businesses focuses on enterprise zones and neighborhood community development banks since the real dearth for minority businesses is not access to city contracts, it's access to capital."
Michael E. Schlein, chief of staff to the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Barry F. Sullivan, said the program had just passed its first anniversary in August and that statistics for the percentage of such companies awarded contracts under it were still being compiled and would be released soon. But he said 1,900 companies had already been certified as owned by women or minorities and eligible to compete.
"We are proud of this program and are right on target where we wanted to be," he said. "I think this is a very, very clear difference between these two candidates, and we hope New Yorkers will choose between them because we think we'll win."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
A.M.A. Rebels Over Health Plan In Major Challenge to President

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The American Medical Association urged doctors today to lobby patients to oppose central elements of President Clinton's health plan, including Federal regulation of health insurance premiums and cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid.
At a political education conference here and in documents sent to all doctors across the country, leaders of the A.M.A. punctured the spirit of bipartisan euphoria that has been hovering over the plan since Mr. Clinton presented it in a speech to Congress last week. 
 The association said some parts of Mr. Clinton's plan, like the proposal to guarantee health care for all Americans, were good for patients.
But in a letter to 670,000 doctors and 40,000 medical students, leaders of the association said they would "activate an unprecedented national network of physicians" to persuade Congress to make substantial changes in Mr. Clinton's proposal. Hundreds of doctors, organized by the association, took their case to Capitol Hill in a lobbying blitz this afternoon.
The doctors do not have a veto over legislation but are expected to wield considerable influence in Congress because many are prominent in their communities and contribute to political campaigns. The association itself has a $7 million budget for lobbying.
 
Debate Over 'Prescription'
 Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, chairman of the association, said: "The President has offered the country a prescription for what ails our health care system. While we agree with his general diagnosis, we disagree with some of his treatment decisions. He's prescribing some pretty stiff, new and untried medicine. We are worried that no one really knows what the side effects are going to be."
Until now, the association's tone had been conciliatory, as it worked quietly behind closed doors to influence Mr. Clinton's proposal. The Administration has swung between seeking the cooperation of the A.M.A., whose opposition has proved fatal to a long series of health care proposals, and preparing to do battle with it.
The A.M.A.'s tone became more aggressive today as members focused on details of the Clinton plan. The doctors said their positions reflected their patients' interests, not just their own economic interests.
At today's conference, doctors booed and hissed Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, when she told them of the President's proposal to limit medical malpractice lawsuits, a proposal the doctors see as inadequate.
While vowing to be constructive, the doctors criticized crucial parts of Mr. Clinton's plan to hold down health costs and reshape the medical system. Administration officials rejected the criticism but said they would work with doctors toward a compromise.
In the letter to the physicians, Dr. Bristow and Dr. Joseph T. Painter, the president of the A.M.A., said, "We have serious reservations about the President's proposal because it would limit choices by patients and physicians, undermine the quality of medical services and lead to Federal control of medical education and the physician work force."
 
No Doctor on Board
 The association said it "unequivocally opposes a national health spending budget," which Mr. Clinton proposed. The association said "it is unacceptable that no place has been reserved" for a doctor on the National Health Board, the body Mr. Clinton would establish to supervise the new health care system. It asserted that the Clinton plan was biased toward managed care and against traditional fee-for-service medicine, under which doctors receive a separate payment for each service. It complained that "physicians will be given financial incentives to provide less care."
By some accounts, the A.M.A. lost influence in the last decade, as more than 80 groups representing various specialties lobbied for themselves. But Mr. Clinton has unintentionally generated new interest in the association among doctors who look to the organization as their champion and protector in a showdown over the future of medicine in America.
The 290,000 members of the A.M.A. account for 43 percent of the nation's doctors. In the early 1970's the association represented 70 percent of the doctors.
The association provided doctors with information and arguments they could use to answer to patients' questions. The answers are not reassuring.
one question is, "Will costs be controlled in a way that doesn't interfere with my medical care?" The answer: "Cost controls may decrease your ability to choose and get some kinds of medical services. A national budget limit for health care will be set. The Government will restrict premium increases. This may lead to rationing."
Another question asks: "Will I still be able to see my own doctor? Will I have to pay extra? And will my doctor and I be free to decide how to treat my illness?" The answer: "You will be able to see your doctor if you choose a plan your doctor is in. If you want to see a physician outside your plan, you will pay more, and in some cases it may be the entire amount. Some plans may put economic interests ahead of medical interests."
The association said it was "adamantly opposed" to some parts of the plan, "staunchly opposed" to others and "deeply concerned" about some. Dr. Shalala said the President's plan was still a work in progress, and she thanked the doctors for the privilege of working with them.
Among the doctors expressing concern today was Dr. Joe P. Anderson, president of the Memphis and Shelby County Medical Society, in Tennessee. "When you start talking about controlling private fees and private expenditures, that's something new to this country," said Dr. Anderson, who reported that he had had many friendly debates with his son, Kevin Anderson, a spokesman for President Clinton.
In the 1960's, the American Medical Association fought the creation of Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, saying it was an "irreversible step toward the complete socialization of medical care."
The association, intransigent before passage of the Medicare law in 1965, cooperated with the Government to carry it out. Medicare now accounts for a substantial portion of doctors' income. In its analysis of Mr. Clinton's proposals, the association said reductions in Medicare reimbursement were unacceptable and threatened access to care for elderly people.
Mr. Clinton is proposing to cut the projected growth of Medicare by $124 billion, or 10 percent, from 1996 to the year 2000. He says all the savings will be used to finance new benefits for the elderly, including coverage of prescription drugs and some long-term care. The President is proposing to cut $114 billion, or 16 percent, from the amounts that would otherwise be spent in Medicaid, the fast-growing program for low-income people.
The Clinton plan would probably shift income from medical specialists to general practice doctors. While it would limit the fees of many doctors, it would guarantee some payment for uninsured patients who now pay nothing for their care.
The association has taken more liberal positions since Dr. James S. Todd became executive vice president of the organization in 1990. The doctors' group irritated President George Bush and his White House staff with insistent calls for Federal action to guarantee access to health care for all Americans.
In "Health Access America," a proposal advanced in March 1990, the association said the Government should require employers to provide health insurance for all full-time workers and their dependents.
Secretary Shalala complimented the doctors today by telling them: "Your goals and principles are remarkably similar to our own. In fact, we stole them from you."
Dr. Shalala said President Clinton was a new Democrat and did not want "a centralized bureaucratic health care system run from Washington." But the A.M.A. said that was precisely what Mr. Clinton had proposed.
In their letter to all doctors, Dr. Bristow and Dr. Painter said, "We are troubled by the degree of centralized regulation" in the Clinton plan. Dr. Bristow said the plan threatened to separate the heart from the soul of American medicine by "forcing a bureaucrat or an accountant to stand between patient and physician."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Drug Companies Feeling Pressure of Clinton's Plan To Keep Their Prices Down

SERIES: The Clinton Prescription -- Fifth article of a series: The Impact on Drug Companies

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Exchanging verbal thunderbolts with the companies that make prescription drugs, President Clinton has denounced high prices that force some sick and elderly Americans to skip meals to pay for medicine.
His proposals for revamping the medical system would fundamentally reshape the playing field for drug companies, pressuring them to hold down prices and in some ways treating them as much like a crucial social service or public utility as private profit-seeking businesses. 
 For their part, the drug makers say the President is unfairly singling them out. They assert that his proposals would cripple research budgets, delaying the discovery of cures for scourges like AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
Drug company executives say their products save both money and lives by helping to avert expensive hospital stays and surgery. But critics say the pharmaceutical industry took advantage of patients and payers for years by raising prices at more than double the general inflation rate in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
The companies insist they have turned over a new leaf and are already holding down prices. They say this is partly because they are under pressure from health maintenance organizations and insurance discount plans.
Under attack by Congress and the President and his wife, Hillary, 17 large drug makers have promised to keep their price increases, on average, in line with the consumer price index.
Pharmaceutical executives say they are pleased that the Clinton plan would add an estimated 70 million people to the 174 million who already have insurance coverage for drugs. Drugs would be included with the basic insurance benefits that all workers would get.
Also, for the first time, the Federal Medicare program would pay about 80 of the cost of prescriptions for the elderly and disabled; at present the program pays nothing toward prescriptions except for patients in hospitals. For the President, this is an important way to secure support for his health plan among wary elderly people.
 
Wall St. Skeptical About Drug Benefit
 But Jerome R. Brimeyer, a securities analyst at Lehman Brothers, questioned whether Congress would approve the drug benefit. The benefit would add $14 billion to $20 billion a year to Medicare, he said, making it harder for the President to deliver on his proposal to sharply curtail annual increases in Medicare spending.
Under the Clinton plan, drug prices would come under attack on at least these four fronts, fundamentally altering the ground rules for an industry that until recently has often charged whatever the market would bear:
*A new National Health Board could investigate "unreasonable" drug prices, requiring a company to bring in its records if the price of a drug was higher in the United States than abroad.
*Drug companies would have to return to Medicare a rebate of 15 percent of their average nationwide price for each drug paid for by Medicare. Industry analysts said such rebates would cost the industry $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion a year.
*The Secretary of Health and Human Services could bargain down the prices of new drugs before Medicare agreed to pay for them. If the companies resist, Medicare could refuse to pay for these drugs. Doctors would need permission from a Government official to prescribe, for Medicare patients, drugs deemed unreasonably costly.
*Most Americans would be expected to join health plans that typically offer financial incentives to use only the lowest-priced drugs. And by limiting increases in health insurance premiums, the Government would force insurers to keep reducing all costs, including those of drugs.
 
Industry Wants To Rely on Competition
 Drug company executives argue that the Clinton proposals are really price controls, which they insist do not work. They said prices should be kept low by competition, not by bureaucrats. But critics noted that some companies had long exploited the strong demand for patent-protected drugs by setting high prices.
G. Kirk Raab, chief executive of Genentech Inc. of San Francisco, one of the most successful biotechnology companies, said the price contraints "could slow down or eliminate the volume of research" by making it harder for young companies to raise money from investors. Genentech's products include genetically engineered human growth hormone and a drug that dissolves blood clots after heart attacks.
Investors supply at least 80 percent of the working capital for biotechnology companies, and there are more than 1,000 small biotechnology companies, of which 235 have sold stock to the public. But the biotechnology industry still has only two dozen drugs to its credit and 130 more awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
Genentech, which has spent more than $100 million seeking a vaccine to prevent AIDS, is one of only three companies currently working on an AIDS vaccine, Mr. Raab said.
"If eight wise people or Secretary Shalala is going to judge the price, my board of directors is not going to be very enthusiastic about my spending a lot of money on AIDS vaccine," he said, referring to Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
But critics like Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, say that many big established pharmaceutical companies have spent years pouring research dollars into products that largely duplicated already available drugs. The Food and Drug Administration said that only 40 percent of the new drugs approved last year were a significant advance over existing ones.
Indeed, managed health care groups exploit competition among similar drugs to push prices down.
Although the drug companies expect to spend more than $10 billion on research and development this year, pharmaceutical experts say they may spend as much as $11 billion on promotion and marketing.
The Administration's criticism of the drug companies is already having a financial effect. Many investors have apparently decided that the days are past when pharmaceutical companies could routinely boast of double-digit increases in profits every three months.
"Mere talk about price controls has squeezed $120 billion out of drug and biotechnology stocks," said Ray Egan, a senior vice president of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a large diversified health care company. He was referring to the drop in prices of the stocks as worried owners sold their holdings.
And a recent survey by Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm, found that more than half of even the larger biotechnology companies do not have enough capital on hand to keep them going for two years.
Henry Termeer, chairman of the Genzyme Corporation, a biotechnology company, said that as few as 1 in 20 new drugs tested would succeed. "The one successful drug has to pay for my total investment," he said.
 
Special Drugs For Rare Disorders
 Genzyme, based in Cambridge, Mass., developed a treatment for Gaucher's disease, a rare inherited disorder causing anemia and bone pain that affects only a few thousand people. The Genzyme drug, which is extracted from human placenta tissue, costs $50,000 to $100,000 for a year's supply for each patient. Those taking it "can live a normal life," Mr. Termeer said.
The drug "took 10 years to develop at a cost of $170 million," he said.
Mr. Termeer noted that biotechnology companies worked on "unmet medical needs: treatments for AIDS, cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cystic fibrosis." He added: "They are entirely dependent upon investments by institutions and individuals. Society only pays when a new drug is successful."
The established companies say the Clinton proposal for rebates on Medicare drugs is especially worrisome. Fred Telling, a vice president of Pfizer Inc., a large pharmaceutical company that makes several widely used drugs, said the rebates "would be significantly damaging to the industry."
Industry executives said elderly people currently consumed at least 20 percent of the $50 billion in American-made drugs each year. They said it was impossible to guess how much the volume would jump if Medicare paid most of the costs.
 
Regulations Draw Criticism
 Proposing to limit both the Government-paid drugs and the rebates, Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck & Company, the world's largest drug maker, said that only Medicare patients who are needy should receive the proposed new drug benefit. Then, he said, the companies should supply those drugs at the same reduced prices that they currently charge the state Medicaid programs for low-income people. Under a 1990 Federal law, the Medicaid rebates cost the companies about $1.5 billion a year.
Mr. Telling said drug makers agreed with the President that competition was the best way to control costs. But he said they were "concerned that beneath its broad outlines, the proposals contain elements that are highly regulatory."
Dr. Vagelos said the companies would try to persuade Administration officials and legislators to ease the controls on drugs. "The good news is that the Administration says it is willing to consider changes," he said. But recalling the industry's failure to stop the President from recommending broader Government purchases of vaccines earlier this year, he said he was "not optimistic."
Expressing similar concerns, companies that make medical devices like heart pacemakers and hip joint replacements say they are also worried that the Clinton program may stifle innovation. When health care plans judge the cost-effectiveness of new technology, they may not provide the opportunity for it to evolve, said Dr. Glen D. Nelson, vice chairman of Medtronic Inc., a maker of medical devices.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pact to Return Inmates To Havana Alarms Emigres

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, in secret talks with the Government of Fidel Castro, has agreed to hand over to Havana some 1,500 Cubans held in Federal prisons, spreading waves of alarm among Cuban exiles here.
On the streets of Little Havana, there was concern over what could await the prisoners once they are returned to jails in Cuba. But even more widespread were the fears that the deal announced by the Justice Department late Tuesday, the first of its kind in nearly a decade, might signal the start of a broader rapprochement between the United States and Cuba. 
 "We are only lending credibility to the Castro regime when we reach this kind of an accord with him," Julio Estorino, a director of a major exile group, the Association of Cuban Municipalities in Exile, said in an interview today. "At a moment when he is experiencing his worst crisis and the people are in the streets throwing stones, this is like a gift to him."
Under Tuesday's agreement, the United States plans to repatriate up to 50 of the Cuban prisoners each month during the next two and a half years. The deportees are to be Cubans who arrived in the United States as part of the Mariel exodus of 1980 and were later convicted of committing felonies in the United States.
 
Signs of Softer Line
 Officials did not say when the deportations would begin. Prisoners can appeal deportation orders to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Tuesday's agreement follows several other signs that both Washington and Havana want to diminish the tensions that have existed between the two countries for more than 30 years. This month, for instance, in a reversal of its policy of noncooperation, Cuba handed over to American authorities a pair of drug traffickers who had eluded an Army helicopter and fled into Cuban airspace.
For its part, the Clinton Administration has quietly eased restrictions on travel to Cuba by American citizens and twice let Cuba know of plans to hold military maneuvers in the area. It has also proposed a revenue-sharing deal on phone calls between the two countries that would generate millions of dollars in hard currency for Mr. Castro's cash-starved Government.
In addition, Cuban security agents, at the invitation of the Justice Department, testified last month before a Miami grand jury that was considering criminal charges against a Cuban pilot who commandeered an airplane with 52 passengers and flew to freedom here. Today, in what was viewed as an attempt to soften the impact of the repatriation agreement, the Justice Department announced it was dropping the case against the pilot, Carlos Cancio Porcel.
 
Helping Castro When He Hurts
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Cuban economy has gone into a sharp decline, with shortages of food and fuel forcing many people to spend much of their time foraging for supplies. In addition, fears of violence or even civil war are rising, with a Cuban Air Force defector saying at a news conference here Tuesday that the military has been told it may have to fire on Mr. Castro's civilian opponents.
In such an atmosphere, "anything that smells of agreement smells foul" to exile groups convinced that Mr. Castro's fall is imminent, said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University here. "This thing with the prisoners is criticizable not so much on content, but simply because there are negotiations at all," he said.
In 1980, an estimated 125,000 Cubans, nearly all legitimate refugees, fled the island as part of a huge boatlift. In 1984, Cuba agreed to accept the return of criminals it had deliberately mixed in with the refugees, in return for which the United States said it would accept 3,000 political prisoners and issue up to 20,000 immigration visas to Cubans each year. But Cuba backed out of the accord the next year to protest the Reagan Administration's decision to begin radio broadcasts to the island through Radio Marti.
When, late in 1987, the State Department announced that Mr. Castro had agreed to accept repatriation of more than 2,700 Cuban convicts, inmates known as "Mariel felons" took over two Federal prisons in an uprising that lasted two weeks. In August 1991, Cuban inmates at the Federal prison in Talladega, Ala., seized 10 hostages in an effort to avoid deportation. They were subdued when a Federal SWAT team stormed the prison.
Despite the uprisings, more than 1,100 Cubans have been deported.
 
Separating Cuban Inmates
 In addition to the 1,500 prisoners affected by what the Justice Department is formally calling "expanded repatriation of Mariel Cuban felons," there are 400 Mariel Cubans in Federal prisons and about 2,300 more in various state and local jails. The Justice Department said these convicts "will not be immediately affected" by Tuesday's accord. But it ordered that all Cuban nationals in medium- and maximum-security prisons be separated from the general inmate population until further notice.
Relatives of prisoners protested the agreement outside a prison here today. Robert L. Boyer, an immigration lawyer here who is closely involved with the Mariel issue, described the mood among the relatives as one of hysteria, and Spanish-language radio call-in programs here were filled with frantic calls from other Cuban exiles fearful they also might be deported.
Trying to reduce those growing concerns, Attorney General Janet Reno, who was State Attorney here when the Mariel influx occurred, sent Lula Rodriguez, a Cuban-American aide who is from Miami, to explain the new agreement to exiles here. Moving from one Spanish-language radio station to another throughout the day, Ms. Rodriguez argued that the United States would benefit from ridding itself of dangerous criminals whose incarceration costs up to $25,000 per person a year.
The Justice Department has also sought to play down the pact's political importance. "This action is a result of periodic reviews to discuss ongoing implementation of the 1984 migration agreement," it said in a statement.
But exile and human rights groups were skeptical. "This is a step towards normalization of relations in the immigration area, and that may have broader implications," said Arthur Helton of the Lawyer's Committee on Human Rights.
Rafael Penalver, a lawyer who helped mediate the 1987 prison uprisings, said he was worried about the prisoners who had already been repatriated to Cuba.
"Basically, the earth has swallowed them up," Mr. Penalver said. "Some of the relatives who have called the Cuban Interests Section in Washington have even received the answer that the deportations have never taken place."

HEADLINE: New Index of U.S. Factory Activity Climbs

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
A new index intended to forecast activity in the nation's factories by giving special attention to inventories moved up slightly in September, but growth is likely to remain sluggish, the sponsors said.
A decline in inventories in the manufacturing sector "has come to an end, removing one source of contraction for the overall economy," said Michael Evans, creator of the Apics Business Outlook Index. 
 "But the components of the index that would ordinarily point to a substantial turnaround in business activity in the months ahead have not yet registered those gains," he said.
The index, similar to the Federal Reserve's tabulation of capacity utilization, is based on confidential data supplied by more than 100 members of the American Production and Inventory Control Society.
Most of the September rise in the index, to 51.0 from 48.6, occurred in its future conditions component, driven by an unusually small decline in the ratio of inventories to sales. The current conditions component was mixed, with shipments showing a gain and employment declining.
Although he did not release the index until today, Mr. Evans, a Washington consultant, has calculated it since January with what he called promising results.
The respondents supply monthly information about their level of shipments, new orders, unfilled orders, employment, inventory stocks, actual and desired inventory-sales ratios, production for the current months and production plans for the next three months.
Unlike some other gauges, the Apics index takes account of the magnitude of responses, not just their direction, Mr. Evans said. It also weights the responses by company size.

Mercedes Selects Alabama Site

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 29

 BODY:
After World War I, textile manufacturers began moving south to be nearer their suppliers -- the cotton fields of Alabama, South Carolina and other balmy states.
Now auto makers are making a similar pilgrimage, building plants by those old cotton fields to take advantage of cheap land, skilled industrial workers and the proximity of many auto parts manufacturers. The latest to make the move is Mercedes-Benz, which will build its first automobile assembly plant in America in Tuscaloosa County, Ala. 
 The selection of Alabama, scheduled to be announced on Thursday by officials of the company in Tuscaloosa, comes after a five-month search that pitted 30 states, from Georgia to Nebraska, against each other in a bidding war.
 
Jobs for 1,500 Workers
 The $300 million plant, which will produce a new four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle, will employ 1,500 workers and create thousands of other jobs in related industries.
Mercedes-Benz plans to produce 60,000 vehicles at the plant -- about a third as many as the average American assembly plant makes.
The plant, which is scheduled to begin production in 1997, will be built on 1,000 hilly acres of pine forest about 11 miles east of Tuscaloosa. The city of 80,000 people is about 50 miles southwest of Birmingham and is the home of the University of Alabama. Foreign companies like British Steel and JVC already operate manufacturing plants in or near the city.
Officials of the company declined to discuss their decision today, but they confirmed that Mercedes-Benz had picked Tuscaloosa. Local government officials who brokered the deal sketched its outlines.
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the citizens of Tuscaloosa County," said Judge W. Hardy McCollum, the chairman of the Tuscaloosa County Commission. "It will change Tuscaloosa County dramatically, but it will also change the state of Alabama."
Someone's image is likely to change because of the deal. The question is whether the Mercedes-Benz marque, associated in the minds of many Americans with exacting German craftsmanship, will acquire the grittier associations that come with Tuscaloosa, or whether Tuscaloosa will acquire some of the glamour of Mercedes-Benz.
Mercedes-Benz, like BMW and Volkswagen, has slipped in the United States in recent years, as the value of the German mark has climbed, making German products more expensive, and the Japanese have introduced high-quality imports like Acura, Infiniti and Lexus.
The United Automobile Workers union plans to try to organize the Mercedes-Benz plant. But unionized or not, Mercedes-Benz is likely to have much lower labor costs in Alabama than in Germany, because of the weak dollar.
To fend off the union organizers, the company would have to offer hourly wages comparable to the roughly $17 received by most U.A.W. assembly line workers. Today BMW announced that workers at a plant it is building in Spartanburg, S.C., would start at $12 an hour, rising to $16 an hour within 24 months.
 
A Nest of Suppliers
 The region selected by Mercedes-Benz is particularly attractive to auto makers because a large number of manufacturers produce everything from tires to shock absorbers to fuel injectors in plants along Interstate 85, between Atlanta and the Virginia state line. Chrysler, Honda and Mitsubishi, along with several smaller manufacturers, operate components plants in Alabama.
"Basically, people are coming in and wrapping skins around these auto parts," said Bruce Yandle, an economist at Clemson University in Clemson, S.C. While Mercedes-Benz will be the first auto maker in Alabama, BMW is in Spartanburg, and the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company already have assembly plants near Atlanta. Thomasbuilt and Freightliner have assembly plants in North Carolina.
Mercedes-Benz will be importing many parts -- including engines -- and exporting about two-thirds of the plant's production, so a good transportation infrastructure was important. A railroad line touches the new site, an interstate highway runs by it and the port of Mobile is about 200 miles away.

HEADLINE: Clinton Held Ready to Order Standard on Recycled Paper

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
In an apparent victory for environmentalists over the paper industry, the White House is said to be leaning toward an executive order that would direct Federal agencies to purchase office stationery and other paper with at least 20 percent of its content recycled from trash.
Such a Federal move is expected to provide a powerful stimulus for recyling efforts by setting a standard that might also be adopted by state and muncipal governments and by corporate buyers of paper seeking a good environmental image. Expanded use of recycled paper, moreover, could also help create a larger market for the tons of paper that cities and towns collect each year in recycling programs. 
 "If they do 20 percent, it will do more for recycling in 6 months than the environmental community was able to accomplish in 20 years," said Allen Hershkowitz, a solid-waste specialist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. "The cities have been pleading for a definition."
Although the White House order was not signed or announced yesterday, people in Washington and elsewhere familiar with the discussions said yesterday that the Clinton Administration had apparently decided to rebuff pleas by the paper industry that the level of recycled material go no higher than 10 percent.
But the paper industry was mounting a vigorous counterattack yesterday after reports arose about the proposed terms of the order. Barry Polsky, a spokesman for the American Forest and Paper Association, the leading industry trade group, said last evening that "we are still talking to the White House" and declined to comment further.
The Federal Government buys less than 2 percent of the 22 million tons of printing and writing paper produced in this country each year, a market with a total value of about $20 billion. But a Federal standard could have a far-reaching influence. Until now, there has been widespread disagreement over how much reclaimed content is needed to label paper "recycled" and over the types of paper to be re-used.
 
30% by End of Decade?
 People familiar with the matter say the 20 percent content level will become effective at the end of next year and rise to 30 percent near the end of the decade. In addition, to qualify, the paper will have to have been previously used and reclaimed from garbage and will not include the paper-mill scraps the industry wanted to include in the definition. Environmentalists argue that only by removing paper from trash can the paper industry relieve the burden on landfills, where paper and cardboard are the largest single component.
In a statement issued yesterday as the issue was still in doubt, Sharpe James, the Mayor of Newark, who is chairman of the United States Conference of Mayors, said the 20 percent standard "represents a significant improvement over earlier proposals."
"Cities must have a market for every ton of recyclables collected," Mr. James said. "Today, those markets are so weak that the viability of many of our recycling programs is threatened."
Environmentalists do appear to have lost on a least one issue in the debate -- their proposal that the Government not buy paper bleached by chlorine or chlorine compounds. Chlorine has long been used to brighten paper, but environmentalists have argued that use of the substance leads to toxic emissions, including the family of chemicals known as dioxin.
Paper industry officials have argued that dioxin emissions have been greatly reduced in recent years and that it would be a heavy economic burden for them to convert mills based on chlorine bleaching to alternative methods, like ones using oxygen and ozone.
President Clinton promised to issue an executive order urging Federal agencies to increase their purchases of recycled goods in his Earth Day speech last spring. Because the recycled-paper standard is expected to be the only one in the order that sets a specific percentage, environmentalists and groups from the paper industry have been arguing for months over the content level and the sources of supply. The debate culminated in a White House meeting of the various factions on Monday.
According to peoples close to the discussions, Mr. Clinton's economic advisers were the chief opponents of the stiffer recycling standard, fearing a loss of jobs in the forestry and paper industry. But Mr. Hershkowitz noted that the collection and separation segments of recycling were labor intensive and tended to be in cities that generate the largest amounts of trash.
"We're talking thousands of inner-city jobs here," he said.

Galapagos Burden: Goats, Pigs and Now People

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PUERTO AYORA, Ecuador

 BODY:
An afternoon stroll down Charles Darwin Avenue captures the rapid evolution of Homo sapiens in the Galapagos.
Ecuadorean rap music blares from the Blowout Bar; an Otavalo Indian peddles Andean wool ponchos outside a new pizzeria, and at a souvenir kiosk tourists pick through T-shirts, including one praising an endemic bird species: "I Love Boobies." 
 "This town is filling up with bureaucracy and burglars," grumbled Jack Nelson, a California native who owns the Hotel Galapagos. "When I first came here in the 1960's, it was just a wooden schoolhouse on a street of sand."
The human population of the Galapagos has grown from fewer than 3,000 in the early 1960's to about 14,000 today. Two decades ago this isolated archipelago 600 miles west of South America's mainland was declared a national province of Ecuador, a move that threw open doors to unrestricted immigration from the continent.
 
Water in Short Supply
 Providing economic sustenance to colonization, tourism started with a handful of annual visitors in the 1960's, swept past a Government target of 25,000 visitors in 1982, and in 1990 reached the current plateau of 40,000.
"Before, we used to get two hours of water a day -- now we get half an hour of water every two days," Jorge Sotomayor, a resident of a neighboring island, San Cristobal, said of water faucets that stand dry in his house.
But more than physical limits to growth protect this arid chain of 19 volcanic islands. The Galapagos National Park blocks human settlement from 97 percent of a wilderness archipelago once known as the Enchanted Isles.
The Galapagos, a laboratory for studying biological evolution, has occupied a special place in the hearts of scientists since 1835, when Darwin arrived here aboard the Beagle. After years of pondering what he observed on the islands, the naturalist wrote "Origin of Species."
 
Without Fear of Man
 For millions of years, water currents sweeping off South America's western shoulder made the trip to the Galapagos a one-way voyage for beast and flower.
In 1535, when an expedition led by Tomas de Berlanga, Bishop of Panama, made the first known human visit here, he found a strange world where birds and animals had evolved completely without fear of man. Today, 90 percent of the reptiles, 50 percent of the land birds and 45 percent of the higher plants can be found only on these islands.
With the cold Humboldt Current washing an island group that straddles the Equator, the Galapagos is the only place in the tropics inhabited by fur seals. Its birdlife ranges from flamingos to penguins. Its landscape ranges from humid marshes to mile-high volcanic peaks.
"Where else can one find, all in one location, relatives of the sunflower that have evolved into trees, gulls which forage at night, lizards which feed on seaweed beneath the ocean surface, tortoises which grow to gigantic proportions, or cormorants which have lost the ability to fly?" Alan White and Bruce Epler wrote in a guidebook for the Charles Darwin Foundation, a private research group based here.
 
Tortoises Bounce Back
 Today's tourist invasion seems benign compared with the festivals of slaughter sponsored by earlier human visitors.
In the 1700's, British and American whalers discovered that Galapagos giant tortoises could survive for more than one year in the hold of a ship without food or water. Stacking live tortoises like casks of brandy, the whalers seized an estimated 200,000.
After three decades of work, the Darwin Foundation has restored the giant tortoise population to about 13,000.
The whalers soon discovered that the islands' fur seals were easy prey. "For years, people thought that the Galapagos fur seal was extinct," said Luis Die, a Spanish biologist and tour guide here. "Then a small band was discovered in the 1930's. Now there are 40,000. The population has fully recovered."
In the mid-19th century, human colonization started, bringing a new threat to the ecosystem: imported, domesticated animals. Convinced that food supplies would never arrive from the mainland, prisoners serving sentences in Galapagos penal colonies fostered wild populations of goats and pigs. Additional populations were started by fishermen wanting to find fresh meat when they visited remote islands.
The latest surge in human colonization has brought a surge in new species: rats, cats, cows, donkeys and dogs. "In the past 10 years, 100 new fauna species have been introduced," said Chantal Blanton, an American ecologist who directs the Charles Darwin Research Station here. "In the previous 200 years, there were only a handful of new species introduced."
 
Calls for a Curtain
 From scientists to politicians, a consensus is growing that a curtain should drop on the 20-year experiment with unlimited Galapagos immigration.
"There is no more land, there is no more drinking water, the topsoil is thin," Raul Flores Viteri, the sole Galapagos member of Ecuador's Congress, said in an interview in Quito.
This fall Mr. Flores plans to submit to the Congress a constitutional amendment that would allow Ecuadoreans to freely travel and to freely choose their residence anywhere in the nation, "with the exception of Galapagos Province."

Tourists shared a beach with several sea lions on Espanola Island. (Elizabeth Brooke for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: WOMEN PAY PRICE FOR BEING OBESE

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Women who are fat suffer enormous social and economic consequences, a new study has shown. They are much less likely to marry than women of normal weight and are more likely to be poor and to earn far less.
Fat men are also less likely to marry than men of normal weight, but they seem just as well off financially, the researchers found. 
 The findings are from an eight-year study of 10,039 randomly selected people who were 16 to 24 years old when the research began. It is the first study to document the profound social and economic consequences of obesity by following a population for years.
The researchers, led by Dr. Steven L. Gortmaker of the Harvard School of Public Health, said discrimination against obese people might account for their results.
Fat women were disproportionately found in lower socioeconomic classes, and some researchers say this is because poor women are more likely to eat fat-laden food and junk foods and to get less exercise than richer women. But, Dr. Gortmaker and his colleagues wrote, "our data suggest that at least some of this relation may be a socioeconomic consequence of being overweight."
 
Who Is Obese?
 The study, being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, defined obesity as the top 5 percent of people on an index in which weight is related to height. A typical obese woman in the study was 5 foot 3 and 200 pounds; a typical man was 5 foot 9 and 225 pounds.
The study found that fat women were more likely to lose socioeconomic status independently of their families' social status or income and independently of how well the women scored on achievement tests when they were adolescents. The fat women were 20 percent less likely to marry, had household incomes that were an average of $6,710 lower and were 10 percent more likely to be living in poverty.
The effects of obesity on men were more modest. The most significant finding was that obese men were 11 percent less likely to marry.
But comparisons among all men in the study at various heights with those a foot shorter found that the shorter men were 10 percent more likely to live in poverty and had household incomes that averaged $3,037 less. Previous studies have found that taller men seem to have an advantage in the business world.
Some investigators said they hoped that the findings would wake up the medical community and society to abiding prejudices that can sour the lives of fat people.
 
Moral to the Study
 The results should be "a clarion call," said Dr. Albert J. Stunkard, an obesity researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who was the co-author of an editorial on the findings in the same issue of the journal.
Discrimination against fat people, Dr. Stunkard said, "is the last fashionable form of prejudice." He and others said fat people were too often derided as gluttonous slobs who could be thin if they really wanted to. This attitude, Dr. Stunkard said, is used to justify rampant discrimination. But it is particularly unfair, he noted, because study after study has shown that virtually all obese people cannot permanently reduce and that their weight is not their fault. "Blaming the victim," he said. "That's what it is."
The researchers said discrimination against fat people was so profound that Congress should consider extending legal protection to them.
Some fat people said the findings reflected their everyday experiences. Frances White, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Fat Acceptance, said that employers were often prejudiced against fat women, like herself, but that they were seldom direct.
"Most of us find that this sort of discrimination is very covert," she said. "It's much like racial discrimination. Nobody wants to own up to it."
Ms. White, who lives in San Francisco, recently got a job as a membership coordinator at a local Public Broadcasting System. For two and a half years before that, she worked at temporary jobs, looking for something more permanent.
 
Change of Heart
 "I have a wonderful resume and years of experience," Ms. White said. "I can write a resume tailored to each job that is absolutely perfect." She said prospective employers often would be enthusiastic about her application until they saw her.
She said employers would call her and say: "You're exactly what we want. When can you come in?" But, she said, things often changed when she walked into an office for an interview.
"All of a sudden, they would get this look on their face," she said. " 'Oh, you're Frances White.' Then they'd give me a cursory interview and say, 'We're thinking of going with a more entry level person,' or 'We're re-thinking our staffing needs.' "
Dr. Susan C. Wooley, an obesity researcher and co-director of an eating-disorders clinic at the University of Cincinnati, said that she hoped that the new study would alert people to the plight of obese women but that she feared it would not. The problem, she said, is that many people believe that the women could be thin if they really wanted to.
Dr. Wooley said she feared that people would conclude that the new data showed "how important it is to treat obesity." But she said: "They still won't get it. You can't solve social problems by trying to alter victims."

HEADLINE: First-Half Economic Growth Exceeds Earlier Estimates

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The economy limped through the first half of 1993 at a fractionally stronger pace than was thought earlier, the Commerce Department reported today. Corporations posted record profits and inflation was dormant.
In another report, the Agriculture Department said farm prices jumped 2.1 percent in September from a month earlier because of a large increase in orange prices. 
 National output expanded at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter -- a little better than the 1.8 percent estimate a month ago -- after a feeble gain of eight-tenths of a percent in the first quarter. For the first six months of 1993, the economy grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent.
A month ago, the department estimated that the nation's total output of goods and services, measured by gross domestic product, or G.D.P., had grown at a 1.8 percent rate in the second quarter. It revised that upward because of stronger consumer spending and more business investment than first thought.
 
 
Weakness in Trade
 The improvement from these two sources of economic strength was partly offset by trade weakness. Exports grew less strongly than originally estimated, and imports shot up more rapidly.
Robert Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said, "This is an economy that is plugging along fairly nicely at home, but so much of our growth is being dissipated by going into imported goods."
 The White House predicts that the economy will expand 2 percent in 1993. To meet that target, the output of goods and services must grow at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the closing six months of the year, Commerce Department officials said.
In its farm prices report, the Government attributed the surge in orange prices, to $10.52 a box from $5.44 in August, to a decline in supplies of California Valencia oranges. The decline is a seasonal quirk, an analyst for the Government said.
"Without the large change in orange prices from August to September, the All Farm Products index would have been unchanged," the Government said.
Lettuce, wheat and apple prices also rose in September. Soybean, egg, cattle and corn prices all declined.
Compared with a year earlier, farm prices were 4.3 percent higher.
A revised and corrected table of data about the gross domestic product for the second quarter of 1993 follows. (The table that ran on Sept. 1, after the first revisions of the second-quarter results were released, reversed the data for current prices and 1987 prices.)
All dollar amounts are in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

Mazda Now Sees $300 Million Loss

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 29

 BODY:
In the latest sign of a rapid deterioration for Japan's once mighty automobile industry, the Mazda Motor Corporation said today that it expected to lose $300 million this fiscal year, a deficit almost three times larger than it had projected four months ago.
The company attributed the larger loss forecast to declining sales in Japan and Europe, and to the rise of the Japanese yen against the dollar, which has made Japanese products more expensive in the United States. 
 Mazda said it would cut its Japan-based work force by 3,000 people, or 10 percent, over three years through attrition and reduced hiring. It also said it would close an assembly line at its Hiroshima plant, further cut capital expenditures and eliminate the dividend on its common stock.
With today's announcement, Mazda becomes the second of Japan's five largest auto makers to plunge deeply into the red, following the Nissan Motor Company. Even Toyota, the largest and strongest company, has said it could have a small operating loss this year if the currency exchange rate stays near 100 yen to the dollar.
Japan's auto industry, which saw almost unbroken growth since World War II, is now in a protracted slide. Production is running close to the level of 1984. And the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said this week that exports in August dropped to a 14-year low, partly because auto makers are shifting production out of Japan.
Other Japanese industries are also finding the ground sliding out from under them because of the strong yen and a domestic economy that seems to be getting weaker. On Tuesday, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Japan's largest consumer electronics company, revised its sales and profit forecasts for the year sharply downward.
Mazda has some special problems. It is still paying for a factory in Hofu that was opened last year and is still not at full capacity. Analysts say Mazda is also burdened with five separate dealer networks in Japan; Mazda, however, says the separate dealerships are an advantage.
The company said that for the fiscal year ending in March it expected a loss of 32 billion yen, or $304 million. Until today the company had been forecasting a loss of 12 billion yen, or about $114 million. In the last fiscal year the company posted a profit of 2.6 billion yen, or $25 million.
Despite its woes, Mazda said it would not lay off permanent employees, although some managers were in for a change they might not have bargained for. Some 500 office workers at a time will be sent to work on the assembly lines for three months. They will replace contract laborers who will be dismissed, a spokesman said. An additional 1,000 office workers will go to sales and service.
The Hiroshima-based company now expects to sell 455,000 cars and trucks in Japan in the fiscal year that ends next March, down from 462,000 last year and 25 percent below the company's peak of 600,000 vehicles in the fiscal year that ended in March 1991. In May, Mazda had forecast an increase in domestic sales to 470,000 units this year.

HEADLINE: Albany to Let Insurance Law Cover Partners

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Reversing a 54-year-old policy, the Cuomo administration today lifted New York State's prohibition against providing family health insurance that covers the domestic partners of homosexuals and unmarried heterosexuals.
The ruling, which had been sought for years by advocates for gay and lesbian rights, opens a new and untested market for the insurance industry in New York, among private companies and local governments. It also provides a major political opportunity for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who may now be able to grant insurance benefits to the domestic partners of city employees. Such a move would almost certainly energize gay and lesbian supporters in Mr. Dinkins's re-election campaign against Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate. 
 Mr. Dinkins said in a statement that the ruling "eliminates a major obstacle" to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against the city in 1988 by the Lesbian and Gay Teachers Association. The teachers charged that it was discriminatory for the city not to provide health coverage for their domestic partners while allowing coverage for the spouses of married teachers and other city employees.
The Mayor's counsel, George B. Daniels, said Mr. Dinkins would also seek to negotiate insurance coverage for domestic partners with other unions of city workers. "The Mayor's made it clear that this isn't just about settling the gay teacher's case," Mr. Daniels said. "It's a benefit that should be available to all city employees."
 
Opponents Question Cost to Budget
 If New York City establishes health benefits for its employees' domestic partners, it will join at least a dozen municipal governments around the country. They include those of San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, West Hollywood, Calif., Ann Arbor, Burlington, Vt., Berkeley and Minneapolis.
Opponents of insurance rights for domestic partners question whether the cost would place an unmanageable burden on the New York City budget. But city officials and gay and lesbian lobbyists said that other cities had not encountered such costs.
In Seattle, for instance, insurance fees for coverage that includes domestic partners amounts to only 1.3 percent of total health insurance costs for city employees, said Sally W. Fox, Seattle's benefits manager. She said that 476 of the city's 10,000 employees were signed up for domestic partnership benefits, and that an estimated 70 percent of them were heterosexuals.
Mr. Daniels said the city was working on projections of the potential cost. Since Mr. Dinkins signed an executive order allowing domestic partners to register with the city earlier this year, 1,300 couples have registered, Mr. Daniels said. Only 150 of them include a city employee.
Until today, the State Insurance Department had interpreted the state's insurance law, which was written in 1939, as allowing family health coverage primarily for employees, their spouses and their children. It had ruled specifically that domestic partners were not covered by a clause in the law allowing coverage for "other persons chiefly dependent upon" an employee "for support and maintenance."
 
'Appropriate Circumstances'
 In 1989, James P. Corcoran, then the Insurance Superintendent, ruled that such a change would be "wholly antithetical to the Legislature's purpose." His successor, Salvatore R. Curiale, repeated that stand in 1990.
But after reconsidering at the request of Mr. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Curiale ruled today that domestic partners can be covered "under appropriate circumstances, without a showing of complete, unilateral economic dependency." Although the state controls the kind of insurance that companies may offer, he said the state cannot require coverage of domestic partners.
Mr. Curiale wrote in a letter to Mr. Cuomo that "a showing of mutual interdependency would be sufficient under the law to permit coverage." He said that interdependency could be demonstrated by factors like "common ownership of property, common householding, shared budgeting, length of the relationship, etc."
He did not specify how the department would ultimately define a domestic partnership. But he said he would work with insurance companies and gay and lesbian representatives "to fashion a set of criteria that would make them sufficient to protect companies and encourage them to make the coverage available."
Mr. Curiale did not specify why he changed course. His spokesman, John Calagna, said he had been influenced by the Mayor's decision to allow domestic partners to register and by a 1989 ruling of the State Court of Appeals. It said a domestic partnership could be defined as a family for the purpose of determining the inheritance of a rent-controlled apartment.
But gay and lesbian advocates said the decision also clearly had a political motivation. It enabled Mr. Cuomo to provide significant -- and cost-free -- help for Mr. Dinkins five weeks before Election Day.
Mr. Dinkins won enthusiastic backing from gay and lesbian groups when he ran for Mayor in 1989, largely because he promised to provide insurance coverage and other standard benefits to the domestic partners of city employees. Since his election, he has said his hands were tied by the state's insurance law. Although he established the domestic partners' registry this year, gay and lesbian supporters have expressed disappointment in the Mayor for not fulfilling his pledge on the insurance issue.
Mr. Curiale's decision also may rally gay and lesbian support for Mr. Cuomo if he runs for re-election next year. One possible Republican opponent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, was seen as playing to gay New Yorkers earlier this year when he expressed support for allowing homosexuals in the military.
 
'Cuomo Helping Cuomo'
 "This is definitely Cuomo helping Dinkins, but it's also Cuomo helping Cuomo because he has not been able to deliver a gay-rights bill," said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay-rights lobbying group.
Mr. Cuomo said today that he did not make the decision for Mr. Curiale. But he said he was "quite content with the result."
Most of the speculation about the potential demand for the new insurance is centering on municipal governments, because they will presumably be under the most immediate pressure to provide it. Insurance executives said that their activity in the new market would depend on demand from employers, and they doubted there would be a spontaneous surge to fill the new niche.
One health maintenance organization, Oxford Health Plans of New York, already has filed an insurance department application to provide coverage for domestic partners. David B. Snow, the company's executive vice president, said the filing was made at the request of a large corporate client, which he would not name. He said his company had not had many other requests.
Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the Prudential, said: "As long as employers and health insurers can develop a reasonable definition of what constitutes a domestic partner, then we would provide coverage. But it's really client-driven. We have not seen a big demand for it."

HEADLINE: Her Manner Controlled, Holtzman Gazes Ahead

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Elizabeth Holtzman says she may run again. She may teach first or practice law and accept an appointive post in government, which is how her public career began.
But yesterday, hours after suffering her third electoral loss and the first in which voters rejected her for a job she had vigorously campaigned to keep, Ms. Holtzman seemed remarkably equanimous. 
 Only a few months ago, Ms. Holtzman had seemed certain to be re-elected as New York City Comptroller. And it was uncertain whether her demeanor yesterday, in contrast to how she handled two other losing campaigns, was for appearance's sake as she prepares her resume and contemplates future political opportunities.
She said she was not just rationalizing, but had genuinely reconciled herself to the freedom of a defeat.
"I learned that in my days in the South, as a civil rights worker," the 52-year-old Ms. Holtzman maintained. "I didn't realize how dangerous it was, that you could lose your life. If I had, I wouldn't have come. Then, when I came to Congress, I knew the party organization would be out to get me, so I worried about the political implications of this vote, or that. And then I said, let's just try to do the right thing.
"You have to be willing to give things up, but they can't take your life away," she said. "In Solzhenitsyn's 'The First Circle,' the character in the gulag finally became unwilling to compromise with the system. They punish him further. But he's free."
 
Would the Past Be Prologue?
 Given her refusal, for years, to publicly concede the 1980 United States Senate election to Alfonse M. D'Amato, and the acrimony of last year's Senate primary against Geraldine A. Ferraro, some doubters wondered on Tuesday night how she would handle her lopsided loss to Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens in the city's first runoff primary for comptroller.
Ms. Holtzman took them by surprise. She was poised -- becoming teary only when she recounted the odyssey of her grandparents and parents, coming to America for economic and political freedom.
She was sanguine, even upbeat as she evoked the spirit of Lou Gehrig's Yankee Stadium farewell more than half a century ago, saying how lucky she had been to have spent more than two decades as an elected official. And, with what her critics had called Liz Holtzman's disease seemingly in remission, she was gracious.
Only once did she betray bitterness as she basked in a Brighton Beach man's verdict that she had more integrity in her little finger than all the city's other politicians had combined. "I think," she said yesterday, "there are some people who are honest."
She seemed sanguine, too. Just after midnight Tuesday, as she sipped champagne from a fluted glass with a rosebud bobbing at the bottom -- the trademark drink at the Yaffa Tea Room, a funky TriBeCa restaurant where she consoled a score of close friends and colleagues -- she told a reporter that it would be premature to print her political obituary.
"It's not over," she said, smiling.
Later yesterday, fielding phone calls in the Municipal Building, she said her immediate priority was a vacation.
But she repeated that her loss did not represent a defeat for integrity, civil rights, the rights of women and other values she had championed. "I know I will continue to stand up for them and for you, the people of this great city, no matter where I am, no matter what I'm doing," Ms. Holtzman said, afterward adding pointedly, "whether in or out of government."
Her term as comptroller expires on Dec. 31. Then what?
"This campaign's been exhausting on top of a campaign last year that was exhausting," she said, perfectly attired in a navy blue tattersall suit and fingering a paper coffee cup. "I don't, for the moment, want to be thinking of any more campaigns. I've practiced law, I've taught. There are a lot of options. and I intend to explore them."
Including an appointment in the Clinton Administration?
"First I have to pay off a loan," she replied, the irony conscious.
She had personally guaranteed the $450,000 loan her Senate campaign was granted by Fleet Bank in the closing weeks of the '92 primary. Seven months later, Fleet Securities, a sister company, was named by the comptroller's office as one of 23 co-managers of city bond offerings. Ms. Holtzman maintained that she played no role whatsoever in choosing Fleet Securities.
"The controversy over the bank loan obscured discussion of everything else -- my record, my vision for the future," she said yesterday. "It became the all-consuming issue of the race. I would say, with some hesitation, the sole issue."
Even in her home Assembly District in Brooklyn, a borough she had represented in Congress and served as District Attorney, the voters were unforgiving -- in part, because she was hoist by the petard of high ethical standards she had consistently set for herself and to which she had relentlessly held other officials.
 
No Mercy on Bookshelf, Either
 The Macmillan Dictionary of Political Quotations includes three references to Ms. Holtzman, all in the category of nicknames: "Ice Lady," "Liz the Lion Killer" and "Virgin Liz." But Ms. Holtzman maintains that her image as a rigid, intense, loner is merely "a media construct."
(Before the primary, she became weepy while discussing her political career and walked away from a television interview, only to return moments later and explain gamely that she had not been fortified that day with her regular morning cereal. An unwrapped 10-pack, boxes of assorted cold cereal, now adorns a coffee table in her office.)
"I'm lucky," she said. "It was a fluke that I got into Congress. I was young, a woman, going against the establishment, not from a wealthy background. I am still the youngest woman ever elected to Congress."
Her loss this week, she quoted supporters as saying, represented "a backlash against strong women" -- although one very strong woman, Ms. Ferraro, whom Ms. Holtzman verbally eviscerated in last year's Senate campaign, was pulling for Mr. Hevesi.
"I said I had put that Senate race behind me, but it's clear that she wasn't able to," Ms. Holtzman said, alluding to Ms. Ferraro. "For me, politics and government aren't about personal issues."
She might have gone further had she stayed in Congress, and she suggested that her political independence might have proved costly. It was worth it, she said.
"I have to look in the mirror at night -- you bet," she replied. "I'm not saying the price was justified, but you have to be prepared to pay it."
Twenty-three years have elapsed since her first campaign, for Democratic state committeewoman. "In order to have a shot at winning," she recalled, "I had to challenge the law that listed incumbents first on the ballot. It was Holtzman vs. Power, and Power lost. All powers have been miffed ever since."
On Tuesday, too, the challenger won; the incumbent was Ms. Holtzman.

HEADLINE: OPEC Accord Hurts Transportation Stocks

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
Oil stocks soared and transportation issues plummeted yesterday, as OPEC announced limits on oil production that meant good news for fuel producers and bad news for users.
The Dow Jones transportation index sank a sharp 16.25 points, or 1 percent, to 1,637.53, after the announcement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Although the announcement was made fairly late in the New York trading day, preliminary reports had moved the market strongly. 
 Oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose on the agreement, with November crude oil gaining 71 cents, to $18.67 a barrel. Analysts said the new pact was good for OPEC because it showed that the group could iron out some disagreements.
 
Dow Industrials Up 0.28
 The rest of the stock market was lackluster, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up 0.28 point, to 3,566.30, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index finishing down 1.42, to 460.11. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 277.8 million shares, up from 243.4 million on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq composite closed off 0.49, to 763.17, ending a four-day streak of record highs. Analysts attributed the drop to a selloff in technology stocks, which had a strong run-up in recent days. The American Stock Exchange index closed at 457.65, up 0.53.
Among the oil gainers were Anadarko Petroleum, up 5 1/8, to 47 3/8; Atlantic Richfield, up 4 1/4, to 116 1/8; Chevron, up 2 1/2, to 97; Amoco, up 2 3/8, to 57 3/4; Amerada Hess, up 2, to 54 1/4, and Exxon, up 1, to 66 5/8.
Among the transportation losers were UAL parent of United Airlines, down 3 5/8, to 141; Delta Air Lines, down 1 1/4, to 52 1/8; Federal Express, down 7/8, to 62, and Consolidated Freightways, down 3/4, to 15 5/8.
 
Technology Issues Off
 Robert G. Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock Mutual Funds in Boston, said the day saw "profit taking in technology stocks."
"I'm not sure the day really told us anything other than that traders were in there moving from sector to sector and taking profits," he said.
Traders also appeared to be looking ahead to third-quarter earnings reports for some guidance because the general economic news is mixed, he said.
Among the technology stocks that suffered were Micron Tech, down 4 3/8, to 55 3/8; Texas Instruments, down 2 3/4, to 76 5/8, and Applied Materials, down 5 5/8, to 72 7/8.
Paramount Communications rose 1 5/8, to 79 3/8, on news that Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental chain, had agreed to invest in Viacom as part of Viacom's offer to buy Paramount. Viacom sank 1 1/2, to 59 1/2, while Blockbuster dropped 1/8, to 29 1/8. QVC Network, Paramount's other suitor, rose 1/8, to 59 5/8.
Taubman Centers, a real estate investment trust that owns shopping malls, dropped 3/4, to 14, after the company announced that it would not meet cash-flow projections because of rising vacancy rates.
Braintree Savings Bank in Braintree, Mass., announced that it was discussing a possible merger but did not name the other company. Braintree's stock rose 4, to 16 1/2.

HEADLINE: Florio, on Stump, Pledges $1 Billion in Business Aid

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Seeking to offer a counterproposal to the economic plan unveiled last week by Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Gov. Jim Florio promised today to make nearly $1 billion available in state-backed business loans and investments over the next four years.
"There's no pie in the sky in this. No promises. No ledger sheets that don't add up," said Mr. Florio, who took to the stump to tout his plan to expand the Economic Development Authority, a state-run agency that guarantees bank loans for business. 
 Mr. Florio said that his plans for the authority were only a slice of his economic blueprint for the state over the next four years. But it provided a large enough target for the Whitman campaign.
"I don't consider that an economic recovery plan; it is more like the Economic Development Authority's annual report," said Carl Golden, spokesman for the Whitman campaign. "It does not go to the issue of the state budget. It does not go to the issue of budget cutting or raising taxes. Distributing the E.D.A. annual report is a woefully pitiful response."
 
Groping for Political Ground
 Polls have shown that the economy and jobs are among the major concerns for New Jersey voters, and Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Florio have maneuvered furiously over the last week to gain political ground on the issues.
While Mr. Florio broke no new ground with his Economic Development Authority plan, his choice of a fairly limited program enables him to contrast himself with Mrs. Whitman, whom he has accused of promising far more than she can deliver. Mr. Florio's program also gives her very little to shoot at.
Mrs. Whitman released her economic blueprint on Sept. 21 and spent the last week challenging Mr. Florio to do the same. Trumpeting a plan drawn up by a group of fiscal, tax and business advisers, Mrs. Whitman promised to cut taxes by nearly $1.5 billion, pare the size of state government and to create 450,000 new jobs over the next four years.
But Mrs. Whitman has refused to give specifics about her economic plan, opening the way for nearly daily attacks from Mr. Florio and generally caustic criticism from newspaper editorial writers in the state.
 
No Specific New Ideas
 Mr. Florio has not put forth any specific new ideas, either. Instead, he has pointed to his record over the last three years. He has cited public works projects such as the Atlantic City Convention Center and a 20,000-seat expansion of the Rutgers University football stadium, tough enforcement of environmental laws (which he said helped spur a business boom at the New Jersey Shore) and the Economic Development Authority.
The Economic Development Authority is one of the major pillars of Mr. Florio's economic plan. Since he took office, the authority's financing has grown from $95 million in 1990 to $579 million in 1992. President Clinton borrowed some ideas from the authority while putting together his program to provide community loans for small businesses, the Federal Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1993.
Mr. Florio said that over the last four years it had invested more than $1 billion in financing in more than 500 projects and had created nearly 30,000 jobs. Authority officials say the default rate -- bad debts that the taxpayers ultimately have to pay -- has been less than 4 percent, which they say is much lower than the comparable rate at commercial banks.
"The Economic Development Authority was idling in neutral when we took office," Mr. Florio said. "Today it's in high gear and there are entrepreneurs all over the state who can tell you how much thye have been helped."
Over the next four years, Mr. Florio said his administration through the E.D.A. would provide $50 million for one-year small business loans at interest rates of 3 to 5 percent, and $10 million for local development agencies to finance small business loans of $10,000 to $50,000; $800 million for a statewide loan pool for small to medium businesses and a pool to enable them to trade in the public bond market; $100 million to help New Jersey businesses obtain financing to sell overseas, and $25 million for a public schools loan assistance program.

Long Bond Price Falls; Yield at 5.99%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Volatility continues to be the only constant in the bond market, as traders and investors await some surer signals on the pace of economic growth and speed of inflation.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 25/32 yesterday, and the yield flirted with 6 percent, but finished at 5.99 percent, up from 5.94 percent on Tuesday. The prices of Treasury notes fell across the board. 
 In the 15 trading days since the 30-year bond yield reached a 25-year low of 5.86 percent, the yield on the 30-year bond has jumped as high as 6.12 percent and as low as 5.94 percent on Tuesday. But the volatile swings have yet to indicate whether traders and investors have decided that the rally was over and abandoned the hope for lower long-term interest rates.
Michael H. Strauss, the chief economist at Yamaichi International, said the recent downswings in prices of Treasury securities have indicated that the rally, which followed on the heels of President Clinton's election victory, was over. "It doesn't look like retail," he said, referring to money managers, "is willing to buy on the dips here."
 
Sturdier Growth Rate Expected
 One reason, he said, was that he expected the economy, which grew at an annual rate of about 1.3 percent in the first half of the year, to move to a sturdier 2.8 percent pace in the current quarter and possibly 4 percent in the fourth quarter.
But other analysts said they still expected longer-term interest rates to fall lower, breaching the 5.86 percent, 25-year low reached on Sept. 8, and touch 5.75 percent. But that bet hinges on the Labor Department report on employment in September, due a week from Friday, and the August Consumer Price Index, which is to be released the following Tuesday, showing that growth is still slow and inflation is at 3 percent.
In trading yesterday, the absence of significant news left traders and investors to do their trading on information of a second-tier nature. A jump in oil prices, which rose 71 cents, to $18.67 a barrel for the November contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, helped prompt some selling, Mr. Strauss said, because it dimmed the hope for more declines in oil prices that would further reduce inflationary pressures.
 
OPEC Decision has Impact
 The price rise was in response to the agreement on the production limits reached at the OPEC meeting in Geneva.
Mr. Strauss also said the reports of a big player in the bond futures market betting that prices would fall and yields would rise also put some pressure on bond and note prices.
The Commerce Department revision in its growth estimate for the gross domestic product in the second quarter had little impact on trading. The new estimate is 1.9 percent, after an adjustment for inflation, up from the estimate of 1.8 percent a month ago.
But Mr. Strauss said a bigger reason was the growing realization "that the economy is doing significantly better than it did in the first half of the year."
He said some investors were selling because they feared some of the economic reports scheduled for today and tomorrow would be strong enough to begin to suggest that the economy was moving ahead at a pace that would mean little chance for a further slowdown in inflation. If that is the case, the argument for lower long-term rates is harder to make.
 
Help-Wanted Index Rises
 The personal income report due today, he said, should show an increase of about 1 percent in August, after a decline of two-tenths of a percent in July.
He expected new home sales, also due today, to be up 9 percent and the index of leading economic indicators, due tomorrow, to rise about a percent.
The report yesterday that the Conference Board's help-wanted index rose to 104 in August, from 100 in July, also added to the selling. "We are not booming," Mr. Strauss said, "but clearly we have better economic numbers than we have seen in the past."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Companies Will Meet Health Costs With Higher Prices and Lower Pay

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHO will pay for national health insurance? Why business, of course, President Clinton assured the nation. Under the White House plan, most employers would be required to write checks for 80 percent of the cost of a generous package of medical benefits for employees and families.
But many economists think the President has it exactly backward: Of all the possible candidates, corporate America is least likely to be stuck for the buck. One way or another, they say, the cost of employer-mandated health premiums will either be passed forward to consumers in the form of higher prices, or backward to workers in the form of lower wages. 
 And while there may be admirable political reasons for preserving what Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University calls "the myth that someone else will pay," linking insurance to employment is likely to have side-effects that range from irritating complexity to flagrant inefficiency.
The plan calls for employers to cover 80 cents on the premium dollar charged to members of each "regional health alliance." This premium would be "community rated" -- that is, unrelated to age, medical history or health-threatening personal habits. It would vary only with the size of the worker's family and the number of family members who are employed.
How then would it be possible for employers to dodge their legal share of the bill? One route, suggests Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, would be for corporations to raise their prices. This, he argues, is what happens when business costs are broadly (and uniformly) increased by a government mandate like an increase in Social Security taxes.
Forward shifting may not work, though. If, for example, producers compete directly with importers who are unaffected by the insurance mandate or if consumers are unwilling to buy as much at the higher price, some of the extra costs must come from another pocket.
Thus stockholders may initially suffer a squeeze on profits. But the mobility of capital, the global flow of funds to investment with the highest returns, makes it virtually impossible to trap capital for long: Either jobs must be pared, or labor must pick up the tab. In the 1980's, Mr. Bosworth says, much of the increase in employer-paid health insurance costs came out of pension benefits.
Where mandated cost increases hit businesses more selectively (as may prove the case with the Clinton plan) employers are apt to go directly to labor for the extra money. Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that maternity benefits mandated in the 1970's were matched "roughly dollar for dollar" with cuts in wages for the young, married employees likely to claim the benefits. Over all, researchers believe that about three-quarters of mandated labor benefits are passed back to workers, with the rest passed forward to consumers.
So employers will not pay. Does Mr. Clinton's Big White Lie -- one that virtually every noneconomist probably believes -- really matter?
On the plus side (assuming one expects more good than harm to come from universal, community-rated health insurance), it has generated powerful allies for the Clinton plan within organized labor. And it will probably help win over the majority of middle-income Americans, who will not worry that their own health care costs will rise.
One the minus side, the myth has driven the Administration to cut a variety of side deals to placate business interests who think they will pay. To win over the small-business lobby, corporations with fewer than 50 employees whose workers average less than $12 an hour will not be obliged to shell out the maximum 7.9 percent of payroll in insurance premiums. Thus a fast-food outlet owned by McDonald's will apparently be expected to pay considerably more than a separately incorporated McDonald's franchise. "This will prove a bonanza for business consultants," Mr. Reinhardt predicts.
By the same token, the plan offers a safety valve to corporations with more than 5,000 employees: the option to bypass the regional health alliances and insure their own workers. Mr. Reinhardt says this could generate a welcome bonus in efficiency -- the huge regional health alliances are likely to be quagmires of bureaucracy. But it would also undermine the "we're all in this together" ethos of community-rating by giving big companies the chance to shed health costs by employing younger, healthier workers. According to Mr. Bosworth, a 55-year-old worker costs five times as much to insure as a 25-year-old.
An appealing alternative to employer mandates is individual mandates. Washington could oblige everyone to buy community-rated private health insurance, or pay an equivalent income tax surcharge. Those who could not afford the full premium could be subsidized by Uncle Sam.
The political catch is that Americans would be confronted with the reality that people, not corporations, pay for health insurance. "With health care reform," Mr. Gruber reluctantly concludes, "the best may be the enemy of the good."

HEADLINE: Like-New Romper, Worn Only on Weekends by Tiny Librarian

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
CHILDREN tend to outgrow clothes and belongings long before they wear them out, creating a vast pool of gently used garments, furniture, toys and books. For parents who need to keep up with the costly cycle, and for parents who need to dispose of barely used wares, there is a satisfying solution: resale stores.
Such stores typically sell used items for less than half their original retail prices, and they work on consignment, giving a percentage of the profit to the client. 
 Bargains may range from $150 infant gyms, selling for about $20, to $80 car seats, for $35. Many parents who resent being implored to buy the latest fancy toy relent happily when that toy is available used, at a fraction of its original price. Growth spurts often require the purchase of a second parka in the same winter; a secondhand parka won't pose half the hardship.
Party clothes, often worn just once, are a bargain, too. Dresses with a $200 price tag when new are resold for less than half that. Blue blazers can be had for under $36, about one-third the going rate on Madison Avenue. Sizes usually range from newborn to 14. Carriages are often only a few months old, their upholstery well cleaned, the hubcaps polished. Cribs are usually less than two years old.
Resale shops have no problem finding merchandise to sell. Parents eager to make a little money flock to the stores. They usually make appointments and are asked to show at least 10 items a visit. Clothes must be in style, clean and in season. No scratchy woolens. No kilts.
Merchant and client compile a list of items and agree on the selling price of each. The client generally gets a check for 40 percent of the sale price. Whatever does not sell quickly is marked down further. Eventually, unsold items can be retrieved; more often, clients let stores donate unsold merchandise to charities.
People consign new items, too -- gifts that could not be returned to distant stores (a second Monopoly game, piggy bank, mobile or car seat). Heirlooms are offered for resale when people run out of storage (or relatives to give them to).
Because items are used, potential buyers should check nuts and bolts and seams carefully. Look for stains. Some stores allow you to take a garment home to try it on the child.
Resalers market aggressively. "My competition is not other resale stores -- it's the Gap," said Carla Freedland, who opened Good-Byes Children's Resale Store 11 months ago, at 230 East 78th Street (Third Avenue). If an item doesn't move, she explained, she does what Gap does: "It's marked down once and gone. People don't want to come and see the same dress they saw last time. It's depressing."
In addition to selling clothing, Good-Byes has a maternity boutique and is the only Manhattan children's resale shop that regularly features furniture.
Just browsing is fun. The 400-square-foot store is immaculate, spare and well lighted. Garments are carefully pressed and displayed on plastic hangers. Shoppers sip coffee or cocoa, brewed at the register, and munch from the pretzel and M & M dispensers. In the only resale store that accommodates them, children play with blocks and crayons in a play area.
In a typical week, a mint-condition Brambilla unisex reversible down-filled parka, made in France, with a cotton shell and leather trim, sold for $20 (it costs $150 new). Hand-knit snowsuits, many never used, were $18 t0 $50. And Patagonia fleece jackets, at $20, sold for less than half their original cost. A Maclaren double stroller went for $195; an Inglesina carriage and stroller set, used by one infant for six months, $250; a bassinet on wheels, $25; a portable crib, $45; and a stationary crib, $200 -- all about half the retail price. Books sold for $1 and less.
Sometimes, used may be better than new, for example a hand-me-down layette perfectly shrunk, its cotton fibers silkily softened for newborn skin. And at Good-Byes, soft Baby Gap T-shirts are about $5 (new ones on sale at Gap are $7 when first marked down, $4 on second markdown).
After 30 days, items are marked down 20 percent; after 60 days, 50 percent. After 90 days, items are given to the Children's Aid Society.
Second Act Children's Wear, 1046 Madison Avenue (80th Street), is 32 years old, the senior children's resale shop in Manhattan. "My business has grown as families have shrunk," said Joan Blake, the current owner. "We play an economic role that big families once provided for one another: hand-me-downs."
Thousands of garments are displayed on wire hangers on racks in three cramped rooms. Pants of all sizes topple out of boxes. Plan to devote hours rummaging for gold; you may find a $300 shearling coat for $50.
Donna Goldberg has been consigning her sons' sports equipment and Ralph Lauren clothing here for 10 years. "There were no cousins," Mrs. Goldberg said. "A rummage sale was not the way to match these things with kids who need them. Resale is a great way for a family to recycle."
There's an emotional component, too, she added: "With that passing on of something of your child's, you pass on its history, extend its life, in a real and emotionally satisfying way, to one who looks for it, cares and wants it."
Ralph Lauren Polo shirts, $38 to $56 at retail, are $10 to $12 at Second Act. Tennis rackets are $10 to $45. A hockey uniform with helmet and shoulder pads typically sells for $75; skates, $30. A unisex English coat made by Lighthouse, originally $500, in size 6, recently sold here for $175.
Socks are $1 a pair; loafers, party shoes and winter boots are all less than one-third the price of new ones. Sebago loafers are $15; Maraolo black patent-leather party slippers, $110 new, are $20. Games are half-price. After five months, items are discounted a further 25 to 40 percent.
Once Upon a Time, 171 East 92d Street (Third Avenue), accepts "nearly everything," said Ronnie Mann, the owner. That includes stuffed animals. The store, 30 feet long and 12 feet wide, is crammed to the rafters, with about 200 garments of every type -- pants, shirts, dresses, tops -- on display.
New end-of-season leftovers of Liberty of London dresses, generally $130, sell for $50 here. "Rarely are shoes more than $14, or boots more than $16, even if they're still in the box," Ms. Mann said.
A Bonpoint dress, $275 new, might be $60 here. An ornate white satin brocade party dress, size 6, designed by David Charles and originally priced at $325, sells for $85. A cherry red Lans coat, normally $275 to $325, sells for $65. Gap cotton sweaters, $28 new, are $8 to $12 here.
While girls' apparel dominates, boys' staples can be found. Navy blue blazers by Polo Ralph Lauren or Brooks Brothers are $36, less than one-third the retail price new. Gray flannel slacks by Gant are $8; with a Benetton label, they're $14.
A final bit of advice: Don't try to cut a deal with shop owners. They're parents, after all. Whining will get you nowhere.
"Someone who asks, 'You want $120 for this?' or 'Look at all I'm buying; can't you throw in a shirt free?' I firmly remind them, 'This is not a flea market,' " Ms. Blake said.
Following are some stores in Manhattan that sell used children's clothing, equipment and toys. Rules and hours tend to be flexible. Call ahead to see what items are accepted

HEADLINE: Zita Johann Dead; Actress, 89, Played The Mummy's Love

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Zita Johann, a stage and film actress who played Boris Karloff's love interest in "The Mummy," died on Friday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 89 and lived in Orangeburg, N.Y.
The cause was pneumonia, said a friend, Rosemary Franck. 
 Miss Johann was born near Temesvar, Hungary, now Timisoara, Romania. She moved to New York City with her family when she was 7 and appeared in high school productions. After applying to the Theater Guild for work as an understudy, she immediately won roles in touring productions of "Peer Gynt," "The Devil's Disciple" and "He Who Gets Slapped."
She made her Broadway debut in 1924 in the Theater Guild's production of "Man and the Masses." Other leading roles followed, in "Machinal" (1928), "Tomorrow and Tomorrow" (1931) and other plays.
 
To Hollywood and Back
 In 1931 she played the wife of a steelworker who succumbs to drink in "The Struggle," the last film by D. W. Griffith. Most memorably, she played Helen Grosvenor in "The Mummy" (1932), whom the Mummy takes to be the vestal priestess for whom he conceived a forbidden passion 3,700 years earlier.
After appearing in "Tiger Shark" (1932), "Luxury Liner" (1933) and "Grand Canary" (1934), she returned to New York to act in the theater. She appeared in "Panic" (1935), "Flight Into China" (1939), "The Burning Deck" (1940) and "The Broken Journey" (1942).
During World War II, she raised money for war-related charities and organized shows for American soldiers on their way overseas. In recent decades, she worked with disturbed children and gave private acting lessons.
Her three marriages, to John Houseman, the director, John McCormick, an agent, and Bernard E. Shedd, an economist and publisher, all ended in divorce. She had no children.
