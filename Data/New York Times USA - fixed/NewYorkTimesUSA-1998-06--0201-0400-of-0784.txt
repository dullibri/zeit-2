HEADLINE: H.M.O.'s Could Save Your Life

BYLINE: By Susan Love; Susan Love, a breast surgeon, is the author of "Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Book." She expects to earn her M.B.A. this fall at the Anderson School of Management at U.C.L.A.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The future of health care in this country is about to be decided yet again by advertising campaigns and sob stories. Some lobbyists and public relations firms, pushing for tougher regulations, are parading patients who tearfully complain of abuse by mean-spirited, money-hungry managed-care companies. Others claim that regulation will only lead to higher premiums and more uninsured people.
Into this murky debate step members of Congress and state legislators, who are falling over themselves to offer legislation that would establish a "patients' bill of rights." For the most part, these bills would force managed-care companies to pay for specific kinds of care, expand a patient's choice of doctors and require plans to document the outcome of the treatment. 
 Such legislation tends to cast managed care as the enemy of good medicine. This is the wrong approach. Although H.M.O.'s definitely need more regulation and oversight, they may still be the best way to insure high-quality care in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
Many doctors and politicians want us to believe that we just have to get back to the good old days. But after 12 years as a surgeon in Boston and an additional six in Los Angeles, I can tell you that the good old days were not always so great for patients or doctors.
In the 1980's, medical costs were spiraling upward and yet the care itself and survival rates were not improving at the same rate. Tests abounded. As Dr. Marcia Angell, the executive editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, once said, if you think you are healthy, you have not had enough tests done yet.
How did this happen? The economic incentives encouraged overtreatment. The more tests, operations and procedures we did as doctors, the more we were rewarded by insurance companies. It didn't matter whether the tests or treatments were necessary.
In most economic markets, it is the consumers who decide when the cost outweighs the benefits. They simply refuse to pay. But in the area of health care, the consumer-patients were not the ones paying the bill. For the most part they had insurance, provided by their employers, that covered all their medical expenses. Patients certainly had no incentive and too little information to question their high-priced and often excessive care.
The system also discouraged preventive medicine. In the heyday of fee-for-service plans, insurance would not cover annual physical exams, birth control, baby care or even immunizations; nor would it cover Pap smears or mammograms.
Radical change was in order. But the transformation felt like a revolution from on high. It seemed as if it was imposed against the public's will, sparking fear, suspicion and mistrust. Today, patients no longer feel as if they have any say in their care. It seems to be controlled by employers in cahoots with the H.M.O.'s. And the public doesn't trust either of them.
Now no longer paid to overtreat their patients, doctors are encouraged to limit care to that which is absolutely necessary. But hiring the cheapest doctors and giving them incentives to keep costs down do not insure satisfactory care or happy patients.
This first phase of the revolution hasn't been perfect, but that doesn't mean it has to be abandoned.
First, H.M.O.'s can develop uniform standards of care and insure that doctors adhere to them. For example, recent studies from the American College of Surgeons have shown that treatment for women with breast cancer varies according to where they live. Obviously, a woman with breast cancer shouldn't be more likely to get a mastectomy simply because she lives in the South. H.M.O.'s are a perfect vehicle to insure that all doctors are using up-to-date treatments.
Second, H.M.O.'s can educate patients on what is appropriate care. Many patients are so used to overtreatment that the proper course can seem like a deprivation. For instance, the overuse of antibiotics to treat colds has led to drug-resistant bacteria, yet patients still want all the drugs they have become accustomed to.
Third, managed care can be more centered around the patient. In the past, appointments were scheduled at the convenience of the doctor or hospital, and -- remember -- patients were made to wait then, too. Now that health plans are vying for members, they have just begun to worry about patient satisfaction -- though they have a long way to go.
Fourth, managed-care companies can broaden the range of treatment. Studies have already shown that H.M.O.'s do a better job with preventive services like mammograms, Pap smears and immunizations. And many H.M.O.'s like Oxford are beginning to cover alternative therapies, like acupuncture and biofeedback.
 Instead of encouraging H.M.O.'s to fulfill this potential, however, Congress and state legislatures prefer to zero in on the abuses, offering quick fixes that will do little to help. Here are some examples of what to avoid:
* Playing doctor. Many states have passed legislation, for example, requiring managed-care companies to allow two-day hospital stays after a mastectomy. But in my years as a breast cancer surgeon, I often sent women home the same day after a mastectomy. They did fine, but they also had a lot of education and support.
"Drive through" mastectomies aren't the problem. It's the lack of a support system and the fact that women don't want their H.M.O.'s telling them what to do. The answer is not for legislatures to decide what the appropriate treatment is, but to give patients a say in their care. This can happen if patients have a place at the table when H.M.O.'s make their policies.
* Creating false demands. In the movement for a patient bill of rights, many members of Congress are touting the expansion of "patient choice." But I am not sure that people are really demanding more doctors to choose from. They just want the best medical treatment. After all, how did they choose doctors in the old system? More often than not, they asked Aunt Mabel or a neighbor. This did not insure quality care.
When we get on a plane we do not choose our pilot. We trust the airline to choose qualified pilots. In a similar way, patients would be much more comfortable if they knew that a certain health plan maintained strict quality control, picking its doctors carefully. So legislation should be more concerned with assuring quality by forcing health plans to reveal how they recruit, select and pay doctors.
* Relying too much on statistics to improve quality. The collection of data on complications and the results of treatment is important in the long run, but it will do little to solve the immediate problem -- the patient's lack of trust in the system. It would be better to require all health plans to publish their guidelines for treatment, along with the supporting evidence. We also need timely, independent appeal procedures to assure that we can challenge those decisions.
Managed care has many problems, but it retains much potential. Going back to "the good old days" or passing quick-fix legislation won't do much to improve medical care. Instead, we must demand that our employers use their clout not just to lower health costs but also to improve quality. We must demand that H.M.O.'s publicize their policies and guidelines, as well as defend them.
In sum, let's not bash managed care, but improve it.

HEADLINE: Telemedicine Getting a Test in Efforts to Cut Costs of Treating Prisoners

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY 

 BODY:
Universal health care is a reality in one part of the United States: prison.
By law, inmates are guaranteed medical treatment. And with the ranks of prisoners rising an average of 8 percent every year since 1990, providing that treatment is an expensive proposition. To control costs and improve security, a handful of states are trying out telemedicine -- health care via telecommunications. With government agencies, managed-care providers and legislators watching, these programs are serving as a proving grounds for broadening the use of telemedicine. 
 After two decades of limited acceptance as a way to provide health care to people in areas where there are few doctors, telemedicine has been embraced by prison officials as a way to minimize the costs and dangers of transporting inmates to hospitals when they need advanced or specialty care. Most prisons are in rural areas, requiring inmates to travel hours, shackled and under guard, to see a doctor.
"With telemedicine, prisoners don't even have to leave their cellblock," said Dr. Steven Viegas, a hand surgeon who oversees the prison telemedicine project at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
Starting in 1994 and covering roughly 100,000 inmates in 12 prisons, the University of Texas telemedicine program is the nation's oldest and largest. Yearly, the on-line network saves about $300,000 in prisoner transportation costs alone.
Prisons generally have infirmaries operated by primary-care doctors or nurses. When an inmate needs more than rudimentary care, the jail's medical personnel use specialized equipment -- like electronic stethoscopes and otoscopes -- to transmit real-time audio and high-resolution video images of prisoners to physicians at hospitals hundreds of miles away. Both the off-site doctor and patient have two monitors so they can see each other as well as their own images.
The hardware costs $60,000 to $100,000 and charges for high-speed phone lines are around $1,000 to $1,500 a month.
Although statistics are hard to come by because prison telemedicine programs are so new and so few, administrators say their economic benefits go beyond savings in transportation and security. Anecdotal evidence suggests that inmates are more likely to seek care when they do not have to travel to see a doctor.
"This lower threshold to getting care probably reduces the likelihood of more expensive acute care later on," said Dr. Michael G. Kienzle, associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Iowa Hospital in Iowa City, which last year began to extend electronic health care to 4,000 inmates in four state prisons.
Telemedicine also streamlines the delivery of specialty care. For example, the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center in Charlottesville schedules weekly on-line clinics for jail inmates in such medical specialties as dermatology.
"The specialist sits at a computer and sees patients from different units all across the state, one after another," said Richard J. Settimo, deputy director of the University of Virginia's office of telemedicine, which opened last year to serve 5,000 inmates in five state prisons. "The ability to block-schedule prisoners saves a whole lot of time and money."
The on-site medical staff follows the treatment recommendations of the specialist. If the treatment is complicated, the prisoner is then transported to a hospital.
The efficiency of prison programs has not escaped the attention of public and private interests responsible for providing health care to people who are not behind bars. Based on its success in treating prisoners, the University of Virginia received a grant from the Commerce Department in October to set up a $1.2 million telemedicine network to serve Medicaid patients in the state's rural southwestern region.
In January, the University of Iowa's prison project led to a joint venture with a private managed-care company, Help Innovations Inc. of Lawrence, Kan., to provide home health care using telemedicine.
"We are able to point to our experience in the prisons as evidence of the effectiveness of telemedicine," Dr. Kienzle said.
Two managed-care companies -- Partners Health Care System Inc., based in Boston, and Kaiser Permanente, based in Sacramento, Calif. -- had prison programs in mind when they recently established telemedicine networks as an inexpensive way to serve isolated, homebound elderly and chronically ill subscribers.
"We knew of the effectiveness of prison care systems and used them as a basis for carving out our own application," said Eric Menn, corporate manager of Partners' telemedicine division.
The military uses telemedicine, as well. For example, the United States Army has a $30 million system in place in Bosnia, linking the medical staff there to physicians at military bases around the world. Its benefits are aimed less at controlling costs than at keeping doctors out of harm's way, though.
The prison telemedicine systems have provided arguments for reimbursing the expenses of telemedicine when it is used to care for the general population. Currently, telemedicine is generally not covered by Medicare or private insurance.
Testimony from prison administrators before a Senate ad hoc committee on telemedicine led to the inclusion of a provision in last year's Balanced Budget Act that will require Medicare to pay for telemedicine delivered to certain rural areas found to have a shortage of doctors.
"The decision makers have definitely been watching what's going on in the prisons," said Deborah Dakins, editor of Telemedicine and Telehealth Networks, a bimonthly magazine that tracks the industry.
Positive preliminary results from these "test cases" have modestly increased access to telemedicine in both the public and private health care sectors, she said.
But it will take more time and more data before it is commonplace for patients outside prison to stick out their tongues and say "ahhhh" for a computer.

HEADLINE: CONNECTIONS;
For the Media's Dupes, Perhaps Thinking Makes It So

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
It is going to be difficult to escape "The Truman Show." For weeks, the film, starring Jim Carrey, has been featured on magazine covers and brooded about in beard-pulling advance features. Now it has finally opened, and escape is even less likely.
But after seeing the movie, escape is what I yearn for. Like Mr. Carrey's character, Truman, who has been, since birth, an unknowing subject of a 24-hour-a-day television show, I seek fresh air, open skies, new possibilities. Truman begins to suspect his seaside village is not all it's made out to be; I am beginning to suspect something similar about my cultural surroundings. 
 Here's the problem: I am being told, again and again, that we are a lot like Truman. He is living in a world constructed by the media. He is dominated by their desires, sacrificed to their whims, and he doesn't even know it. It has become almost axiomatic that we are in the same boat. The boundaries between television and reality have broken down. We sit for months watching the O. J. trial as soap opera. Networks interrupt their programming to broadcast a live California suicide. Jerry Springer stages talk-show fights. So, isn't "Truman" true?
This is what we are meant to think. And that is what I want to escape: the numbing insistence that we are the victims of higher media forces that have constructed a prefab stage set, who pull our strings and force-feed us useless products. And we, unknowing, turn from our empty lives to submit to the moguls' intoxicating fantasies. We are insistently told that we are duped, manipulated, controlled.
But I am beginning to suspect that this insistence is the real duping and manipulation; we are duped into believing we are being duped. Don't believe me? Try escaping that message. It is also being drilled in by another recent film, Warren Beatty's political satire "Bulworth."
There, too, television is so powerful it is sometimes difficult to tell whether life is an image of the screen or the screen an image of life. The television interviewer Larry King (who has actually predicted that "The Truman Show" will "revolutionize the art form") books the fictional Senator-candidate Bulworth, on his talk show. And in that film, too, television can seem to undermine perception of the real. In the midst of a mental breakdown, the Senator sits with a television remote in his hand, channel surfing his way into oblivion.
Bulworth, like Truman, tries to free himself from the media's manipulating power. He opposes a television interviewer's attempt to break away to a commercial. He challenges the independence of the questioners on a televised debate, pointing out that they are rich people working for other rich people who are running rich media companies that have subsidized his campaign.
In fact, his villains are the same moguls and producers who put on the televised "Truman Show" in Mr. Carrey's movie, enslaving Truman to a life of staged broadcasts. In Mr. Beatty's fantasy, the conspiracy is even more nefarious, because it extends so deeply into the pockets of corporate America and keeps so many different Trumans in penury.
Who can argue with these films' vision, when our attention keeps being drawn to similar notions even outside films? We blame television for violence, advertising for smoking and the media for political mediocrity. These ideas now form the familiar contours of our culture's seaside village; they provide the foundations for our prefab dystopia. And they offer a seamless web of ready-made interpretation about our masters and oppressors, spiced, in these films, with just enough humor and farce to make the message palatable.
But we, like Truman, can begin to notice certain oddities about this message that is supposedly reiterated for our benefit and insight. There are postures that seem out of place. It may be worth questioning the authority of the voices making proclamations, and perhaps even their noble intentions.
Whose interests, after all, are being served by seeing the world in this way? Mr. Beatty's film believes the Trumanesque victims are inner-city blacks. And Bulworth rescues them by becoming what Norman Mailer once called a "White Negro." He takes off his suit and tie and smashes the oppressive bourgeois mold. He dresses in baggy shorts for a television interview, swigs liquor during a television debate, raps insults to corporate donors and adopts a vintage 1968 radical political line, promising to lead the poor, particularly the black poor, to economic freedom.
Truman doesn't carry the torch for anyone else, but his way of undermining his handlers is similar: break the mold, act in unexpected fashion, rebel against the constraints of family, job and community (all of which, after all, are phony).
The level of disdain and condescension in these visions is astonishing. Mr. Beatty can envision Bulworth having an impact only when he jettisons all manners, adopts crude political doctrines and becomes a White Negro cartoon. He insults those he claims to champion.
And isn't that true of the makers of "Truman" as well? If we are meant to root for Truman against the delusions peddled by the media masters, why does the film portray ordinary citizens as so horrific? The stage set created for Truman (which he believes to be real) appears to be an ordinary suburban development. But Peter Weir's direction treats the village with winking mockery. When Truman weeds his garden, he wears bright red polyester shorts. His wife, while plugging a brand of hot cocoa or an all-in-one kitchen utensil, is an exaggerated 1950's housewife in a checked dress. Truman's job as an insurance salesman fits the same vintage cartoon. This is a town of Stepford Wives, Children of the Damned, Body Snatchers.
Of course, the town is meant to be cartoonish; the film, after all, presents it as a set made by the mad media masters directing Truman's life. But the filmmakers also want their condemnations to resonate in the "real world." The film even shows us the viewers of the Truman drama, people who are our counterparts, who watch television day and night. And they are even more grotesque than the bourgeois villagers.
Two old ladies pathetically hug a pillow decorated with Truman's picture. Two half-witted parking attendants can't keep their eyes off the television. A corpulent man soaks in a bathtub hypnotized by Truman's escapades. The film's unremitting scorn leaves no one but Truman untouched.
So here is what this vision of moguls and manipulation gives us: a world of flaccid, dull-witted oppressed and untrustworthy citizens who can't see what is in front of their eyes except to watch a screen. They are supposedly saved by visionaries whose rebellion undermines the phony stage set of bourgeois life. But this rebellion, it turns out, is itself full of scorn. Truman may not show it, but his inventors, the filmmakers, do. And so does Mr. Beatty in his condescension.
There is hardly any room in these films for ordinary people with their problems and struggles; either you are a grotesque victim of the moguls or an unmitigated rebel, a Child of the Damned or a White Negro. Nothing seems real.
That is the vision I seek to escape. But the filmmakers and their allies have things locked up tight. They insist that they alone have a true vision. Only they dare to show the reality behind the pap. In these films, behind cameras we never see, are the real heroes who should be hailed for their provocative and courageous films showing us as the dupes we are.
But isn't it peculiar that this courage and provocation are really founded on cultural cliches and papier-mache politics? Meanwhile, the results are so familiar and comfortable, we don't even try to escape.

Battered chip stocks may well have hit bottom, and some analysts are recommending buys.

BYLINE: By Lawrence M. Fisher 

 BODY:
WHEN bad things happen to good companies, many investors start looking for buying opportunities.
Such is the case with semiconductor stocks, which have been battered this year as one formerly stellar company after another has reported earnings disappointments, layoffs and product delays. Chip industry analysts agree that the group may be reaching a bottom, but they differ on when to start buying chip stocks again. 
 For now, the bad news just keeps on coming. The Intel Corporation is expected to be served with an antitrust suit today by the Federal Trade Commission; late last month the company announced that its Merced chip would be delayed. Motorola announced last week that it would cut 15,000 jobs, citing weak demand for cellular phones, pagers and other products using its semiconductors. And National Semiconductor warned that revenue would fall below analysts' estimates, and that it expected to report a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter, ending May 31, and possibly for the first quarter of the new year as well.
While some companies face problems of their own making, like Motorola's missing the shift from analog to digital cellular phones, there are two bigger forces depressing the group as a whole.
First is a glut of personal computers being sold in the United States, created largely by the Compaq Computer Corporation's need to reduce inventory as it moves to a build-to-order business model.
Second is the financial and economic crisis in Asia, which has weakened demand both for personal computers and for all kinds of devices that use chips.
Because no one in the industry saw either the glut of PC's or the Asian trouble coming, chip makers kept building production well into 1997. With supply exceeding demand, prices have plummeted for semiconductor products from microprocessors to memory chips. The personal computer oversupply and the Asia crisis are presumably temporary, but deciding whether and when to invest in chip stocks is difficult without a clearer end in sight.
Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that chip makers had already cut back substantially on new production, particularly in Asia, and that the PC inventory problems were well past the halfway point.
"You will actually see the demand rate for semiconductors bounce back," he said. "I think that will begin to happen in the next 60 days."
Still, many semiconductor stocks are trading at or near their 52-week lows, Mr. Edelstone said, because the companies' first-quarter earnings were a "disaster, with two-thirds of companies below estimates," and their financial performances are likely to be the same in the second quarter.
"You've got stocks that are pretty beaten up, and from a long-term point of view, attractive at current valuations," he said. "Investors should be getting their shopping lists together."
Mr. Edelstone is currently recommending Neomagic, a maker of graphics-control chips for notebook computers; Rambus, a maker of fast memory devices; Xilinx Inc., a maker of programmable logic devices, and Intel, which he believes will be little affected by the F.T.C. suit or the Merced delay.
"We expect them to be strong in the second half," he said.
Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen & Company, said that it was too early to begin buying most chip stocks -- that Asia remained an open-ended situation and that the oversupply of PC's was still a problem.
"It would be very easy to say it's got to get better pretty soon, but so far the data that would support such a conclusion are scarce," he said. "I believe it will happen, but that's only blind faith. Having said all that, I think we're going to get a rash of pre-announcements like Motorola's, if not as big, over the next few weeks. At that point most of the bad news will be discounted, and even if it takes a year to get a recovery, most of the risk will be removed."
Even now, Mr. Peck said he recommended some chip stocks that he thought had been unfairly battered. Among them, he likes Analog Devices, which makes chips for processing graphics, sound and other nondigital signals, and Amcor, which makes semiconductor packaging material. For the bulk of the semiconductor stocks, Mr. Peck said the time to buy had not yet arrived.
But, of course, by the time it becomes apparent that the worst is over, prices will most likely have gone up. Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said he started buying chip stocks last week. "I think we're going to go into a pretty different environment in the second half of the year, where prices will firm up," he said. "We started buying Intel when it went below $75 and took it to 5 percent of our portfolio when it went below $70."
Mr. Murphy is also recommending LSI Logic, Integrated Device Technology, Altera, Atmel and Xilinx. "I think you can pretty much buy anything in the semiconductor area," he said.

A word game that is a cross between Scrabble and the ancient Chinese game of mah-jongg.

BYLINE: By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
THIS year is the 50th anniversary of Scrabble, the classic spelling game thought up by Alfred M. Butts, an unemployed architect, as he sat in his fifth-floor walk-up apartment in Queens one night.
Is it possible that Mr. Butts's game can be improved? Pingsheng Huang, an inventor in Towaco, N.J., thinks so. 
 Mr. Huang has patented a new type of word game that he describes as a cross between Scrabble and the ancient Chinese game of mah-jongg.
His game, which he calls Magi Compo, uses 144 tiles, as does mah-jongg. But mah-jongg tiles feature abstract symbols that have to be matched up. Mr. Huang's tiles -- like those in Scrabble -- are inscribed with English letters that are arranged to make up words.
But Mr. Huang's tiles are far more complex than those in Scrabble. Each tile has not just a single letter, but also letter combinations. A player can pick which combination of letters he wishes to use. For example, he might draw a tile that has "P," "PE" and "PER" inscribed on it, and then draw a second tile that has "A," "AL" and "AR." From these two tiles, he could choose to form the words "pear" or "pal" or "par" or "peal."
The scoring system is also different, said Mr. Huang. In Scrabble, players reap big points by using letters like "x" or "q." With Magi Compo, the longer the word, the bigger the score, with no weight given to less-common letters or letter combinations. Mr. Huang also includes a number of wild-card tiles that can be designated whatever letter a player wishes.
Earlier this year, Mr. Huang, who is originally from China but has lived in the United States since 1990, quit his job as a marketing director for a computer company so he could promote his invention full time. Last month, he visited China to line up a manufacturer for the game, which he thinks will retail for about $50.
So far, though, Mr. Huang has not found an outlet to sell his game. For inspiration, he might look to the story of Mr. Butts. Scrabble did not come on the market until 1948 -- 10 years after Mr. Butts patented it.
Mr. Huang received patent 5,556,102.
 
A Box to Keep Watches Wound
 Although battery-powered watches are the norm these days, mechanical watches remain popular among timepiece connoisseurs. Many of these are self-winding as the wearer moves his or her wrist.
But what happens if the watch is not worn for a few days? "Once it stops, it can be a pain to reset it," said Jeff Richards, an inventor in Las Vegas, Nev.
Mr. Richards has patented a battery-operated vibrating jewelry box that will keep a watch ticking. "The patent is on the motion itself," he said.
He said that the jewelry box would sell for $250 to $350 but that he hoped to persuade a watchmaker to give away the box with high-end watches. "That's reasonable if someone were to buy a $10,000 watch," he said.
Mr. Richards received patent 5,608,693.
 
Snap-Open Frames For Eyeglasses
 David Wedeck, a former television executive in Teaneck, N.J., has patented what he says is an inexpensive way to make a fashion statement with eyeglasses.
His eyeglasses snap open at the point where the temple meets the lens frame so that the same lenses can be used in several different frames. The interchangeable frames can be either plastic or metal, Mr. Wedeck said, and take less than a minute to snap out and put in.
"It's an inexpensive way to get yourself a variety of styles and colors," he said.
Mr. Wedeck, who said he would like to license his invention, received patent 5,760,866.
Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

Telemedicine Cuts Costs for Prisons
With the ranks of prisoners rising an average of 8 percent every year since 1990, providing health care for them is an expensive proposition. To control costs and improve security prison officials are using telemedicine, or health care via telecommunications, as a way to minimize the costs and dangers of transporting inmates to hospitals when they need advanced or specialty care.

HEADLINE: Rooted in Old Sod, Music Grows All Over;
A Festival Points Up the Universal Appeal of Irish Culture

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
It's not quite the musical analogue to Thomas Cahill's "How the Irish Saved Civilization," the best-selling book blending Irish history, folklore and myth making that argues that Western culture would not have survived without the Irish monks who saved and spread the works of antiquity.
But there is clearly something that transcends music at the second American incarnation of the Guinness Fleadh, billed as "the ultimate Irish Music and Culture Festival" and scheduled for Saturday and Sunday on Randalls Island and then moving on to Chicago and San Francisco. 
 The Fleadh (pronounced FLAH) -- with its blend of Irish (Sinead O'Connor, the Chieftains, the Corrs) and distinctly non-Irish (Los Lobos, Tracy Chapman, Patti Smith, Chumbawamba) music, Irish literary readings, crafts and exhibits -- is partly a glimpse of the new, high-concept dynamics of summer festivals, which have evolved a long way from the time when all it took to draw people was loud music, tight halter tops, hot stadiums and cold beer.
But it is also a window onto the remarkable renaissance of Irish and Irish-American culture, all the more striking in light of the optimism that followed last month's peace referendum. The inspiration for the Fleadh (the word means festival) is the traditional Irish musical celebrations going back centuries. But if its roots are traditional, it highlights two revealing contradictions in contemporary Irish culture.
The first is the remarkably ecumenical quality of Irish culture: how music that is so intensely rooted in Irish soil seems to travel so well and include so much far-flung music amicably under the same tent. The second is the odd way that traditional Irish culture seems to be blossoming, often in all sorts of unlikely amalgams, in an Ireland that, for better or worse, is finally becoming integrated into the rest of the world.
The Irish experience, in the United States and at home, of course, has had more than its share of brutishness and intolerance. Indeed, the welcoming qualities of the music have often been at odds with numbing parochialism, whether in Northern Ireland or South Boston.
But from the plays of Martin McDonagh and the poetry of Seamus Heaney to the enormous success of Frank McCourt's memoir, "Angela's Ashes," and pop Irish folk culture like "Riverdance," to Irish music, which is flourishing in diverse forms as never before, the Fleadh seems well timed to catch a cresting moment of interest in all things Irish.
"I think there's always been a very deep current of affection for the Irish in American culture," said Mr. Cahill, "but Ireland was too oppressed and bedraggled and concerned with its own troubles and inferiority complex to take advantage of it.
"What's happened in the late 20th century is that Ireland has come into its own as a place that could support the arts, so now you see Irish culture taking off like crazy, and not just there or in the U.S. You go to Italy, and they're just nuts for Irish music right now."
Music is definitely at the center of the Fleadh, which will include about 60 acts on three music stages plus a fourth for literature and theater Saturday and Sunday on Randalls Island. There will be about 30 acts for each of the one-day festivals June 20 in Chicago and June 28 in San Francisco. Among other acts scheduled this year are the Irish musicians Tommy Makem, the Saw Doctors and Altan and Mary Black, and non-Irish musicians like Nanci Griffith, John Lee Hooker, Wilco and the Indigo Girls.
Long before anyone envisioned huge, big-bucks marketing extravaganzas, the fleadhs existed in Ireland as loose-knit musical celebrations. They careered along amiably for centuries as provincial festivals with musicians playing in pubs and on street corners, became more institutionalized in the 1950's, often including musical competitions, and have continued to grow from there.
"I played the pipes at my first one in Mullingar in 1950," said Paddy Moloney, of the traditional Irish band the Chieftains. "It was a wonderful thing, but no one expected it to grow into what it's become."
In 1990, the English promoter, Vince Power of the Mean Fiddler Organization, staged the first of his London Fleadhs, which have been a huge annual event ever since. The first American Guinness Fleadh was staged last year on Randalls Island by Mean Fiddler and Festival Marketing of New York and produced by Joe Killian, who founded the Central Park Summerstage concerts and was director of concerts for Radio City Music Hall.
It doesn't take a cynic to think that commercial as well as artistic instincts went into the decision to build the American fleadhs around both Irish musicians and big-name non-Irish performers.
But one of the most remarkable aspects of the event is the way the intensely Irish focus meshes so well with acts ranging from the Latino rock of Los Lobos to the Texas honky-tonk of Joe Ely to singer-songwriters like Ms. Chapman or Ms. Griffith.
Musicians say that partly reflects the nature of much American music, which has deep roots in Irish and Celtic folk songs and ballads, and the musical affinity between so much of the music of the Western world and Irish music.

Music as 'Part Of the Genetic Code'
"I'll tell you something, we felt more at home in Ireland than we did in South America," said Steve Berlin of the eclectic rock band Los Lobos, who appeared with the Chieftains two years ago on "Santiago," an album that explored the Gaelic and Spanish music of Northern Spain.
"I'm not sure what it is," he said. "But there's a specific and almost palpable similarity between Irish culture and Mexican culture. Maybe it's the way that music is everywhere. It's part of the genetic code of the culture."
The affinity no doubt also mirrors the way the Irish diaspora and its traditions suffuse American life. Thus, bands at the Fleadh include groups like the Prodigals, New York-based Irish-Americans who borrow from both cultures but whose music is still indelibly Irish.
But others say Irish music travels so well because at its roots the culture has always been both intensely local and possessed by a sort of visceral pantheism. Mr. Cahill says Irish culture from antiquity has always had the same ecumenical qualities as it does now.
"From the start, Irish culture was always a mix of pagan and Christian; it's always had very emotional ties to the earth, to cosmic events, to the idea of the world as a magical place," he said. "In that sense it's very flexible, protean, transportable. So the druidic aspects of Irish culture have a lot in common, for example, with the nature religions of North America."
The other striking aspect of the Irish music at the Fleadh is how amazingly diverse it is, but how much even the most stridently modern music is still animated by traditional Irish sounds.
Thus, for example, the Saw Doctors, a popular, raucous Irish rock band who got together in the small Galway County town of Tuam in 1987, include both primal rock sounds with melodies and instrumentation -- pipes, flutes, tin whistles -- that could be nothing but Irish.
"We're the first generation of Irish people to have grown up listening to traditional Irish music in the age of mass media," said Leo Moran, a guitarist and singer in the group. "We're the first generation who grew up with TV and radio, who could want to mix the Ramones with traditional Irish songs. So I like to borrow from all my favorite kinds of music: Hank Williams, Steve Earle, English punky stuff. But I've still got traditional Irish music in my blood, I guess."
The prosperity, economic and cultural, of course, could be short-lived and the Irish sense of tragedy is deep enough to make anyone wonder how long this vogue lasts.
Still, the current moment feels like a wry, Irish joke on history.
"We've always been the the victimized, not the victimizers, the colonized, not the colonizers" said Andrea Corr of the Corrs, three sisters and a brother from Dundalk, Ireland, whose band combines modern pop and traditional Irish sounds. "And now, in music, in literature, the Irish seem to be everywhere. It's very ironic, isn't it?"

HEADLINE: Milosevic Agrees to Let Diplomatic Observers Into Kosovo

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has agreed to allow diplomatic observers to enter and move through the province of Kosovo, where Serbian troops and policemen have been attacking the ethnic Albanian majority, senior Administration officials said today.
The first observer missions could take place as early as Monday, the officials said, after weekend negotiations in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, between Mr. Milosevic and the American Ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill. 
 Mr. Hill will be allowed to escort the chief negotiator for the ethnic Albanians, Fehmi Agani, and presumably bring journalists along to view areas where the Serbian military and police have been operating, the officials said. Mr. Milosevic's forces have prevented foreigners from traveling in Kosovo, Serbia's southernmost province, and Mr. Agani was denied access to those areas on Thursday.
But the officials stressed that the new agreements did not absolve Mr. Milosevic of responsibility for using fear and force to drive residents from villages along Kosovo's border with Albania, an operation apparently intended to prevent the infiltration of arms and new fighters from outside Kosovo.
 In Kosovo, members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said Serbian troops were removing bodies from areas observers might visit and concealing other evidence of their attacks.
"Ethnic cleansing, whether as a goal or a tactic, is still a crime," a senior American official said. "We cannot ignore that extraordinarily grave events occurred last week, and we cannot allow Milosevic to get a breather because some diplomatic observers are let in."
The official said Washington and its allies continued to insist on the withdrawal of Serbian special police and Yugoslav Army units from Kosovo and on full access for other foreigners. "Just having some diplomatic observers who come back and say, 'Gosh, this is terrible and they've destroyed the place,' isn't sufficient," the official said.
In the last two weeks, Mr. Milosevic, the former President of Serbia, has ordered a crackdown against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and, in particular, against the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence. Western governments do not support independence for Kosovo, fearing that it would reopen the Balkan ethnic and religious caldron.
While at least 250 people have been killed, 10,000 refugees have fled into Albania and 50,000 people have been displaced from their homes, according to an estimate given in London today by the British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the West has done little but plan new meetings.
"President Milosevic over the past week has crossed the threshold," said Mr. Cook, whose Government holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. "The use of tanks, of artillery, of the might of the military army against civilian centers of population is wholly unacceptable within the modern Europe."
Mr. Cook and Prime Minister Tony Blair have decided to push Washington and the West "to a much tougher policy, both politically and militarily," a senior British official said. Mr. Blair told his Cabinet on Thursday that the use of force may be necessary to get Mr. Milosevic to respond.
The British are circulating a draft Security Council resolution at the United Nations that would authorize NATO to use force "in or over Kosovo," the official said, a move intended in part to put pressure on Russia to act more aggressively against its traditional allies, the Serbs.
"I hope the British are prepared to be out there themselves," a senior American official said today. "I have the feeling they want to be sure that we're out there."
On Monday, the British will be host to a European Union foreign ministers' meeting to press for the imposition of tough economic sanctions -- especially an investment ban, as well as the more symbolic freezing of Serbian assets abroad -- that were suspended at Washington's request when Mr. Milosevic agreed to open talks with Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo's Albanians.
Those sanctions were never imposed, because Washington used their suspension as an inducement to Mr. Milosevic to open the talks with Mr. Rugova, even though just a week earlier Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pressed American allies to agree to them.
Washington, too, is now ready to impose those sanctions and to discuss new ones, American officials said today. They said Mr. Milosevic had used the suspension of sanctions as an excuse to crack down in Kosovo, embarrassing the Americans and making a next round of talks with him impossible for Mr. Rugova.
The Americans insist that dialogue -- together with the pressure of new sanctions and the ultimate threat of NATO action -- is the only avenue to a peaceful solution in Kosovo, and that it will continue. But some officials, both American and European, fear that the Milosevic crackdown may mean that any opportunity for a solution is already lost, and that Mr. Rugova's credibility has already suffered too much as the Kosovo Liberation Army gains strength.
The so-called Contact Group on the Balkans -- the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Russia -- will meet on Wednesday in Paris at the political director level, and could impose the suspended sanctions, officials say. The group will meet at the foreign ministers' level in London on Friday, along with Japan and Canada, and there is a NATO defense ministers' meeting on Thursday in Luxembourg, where Kosovo will be a prime topic.
NATO has already asked for military options and accelerated planning for deployments around Kosovo to prevent a possible regional conflagration. But the British, especially, feel that the problem is within Kosovo, not around it.
Already, the Pentagon has made it clear that it does not favor any new troops to be sent to the Balkans, even as the American forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina are reduced.
And an American threat to Mr. Milosevic of a military response to a crackdown in Kosovo -- a warning first issued by President George Bush and repeated by the Clinton Administration to Mr. Milosevic in 1993 -- remains "on the table." But this threat is "not now a topic of real discussion," a senior official said.
One American official said that in contrast to Bosnia, where Washington let the war go on for three years before acting and involving NATO, the United States has engaged much more rapidly in Kosovo, even if not quickly enough to satisfy the British.
The push for Milosevic-Rugova talks, backed by sanctions and then backed by NATO action if the violence continues, is a strategy that can work, the American official insisted. But as in Bosnia, he said, there is a great reluctance in the White House "to move further into the Balkans, rather than out of it."

HEADLINE: Train Blast Kills 23 and Pakistan Blames India

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, June 7

 BODY:
A bomb exploded this morning on a crowded railroad train in southern Pakistan, killing 23 people, and the Government immediately blamed Indian secret agents.
The explosion occurred a little after 4 A.M. near Khairpur, in the southern province of Sindh, as the Khyber Mail train was making its run from Karachi to Peshawar. 
 The blast went off under a seat in the middle of a crowded economy-class passenger car, wounding about 32 people in addition to the 23 who were killed, Pakistan Railway officials said.
The dead included four women and two children.
"The bomb blast on the Khyber Mail today is an abominable RAW-sponsored terrorist act," a Foreign Ministry statement said, using the initials of the Indian intelligence organization, the Research and Analysis Wing. "We condemn it."
The Pakistani Minister of Information, Mushahid Hussain, said his Government would provide "hard proof" of Indian involvement.
Indian officials denied the accusation.
The Indian Foreign Ministry, in a brief statement late today, said, "The reported statement of the Pakistan Information Minister regarding India's alleged involvement in the unfortunate train blasts in Sindh province of Pakistan are baseless and false," Agence France-Presse reported.
The railroad's general manager, Naseer Alvi, said the explosion was a case of "clear sabotage."
The explosion and the swift Pakistani reaction appeared likely to increase tensions between the two countries -- longtime enemies that have just stunned the world by setting off rival nuclear tests.
Each has blamed the intelligence services of the other for planting bombs and stirring up trouble among the region's many fractious religious and ethnic groups.
Mr. Hussain, Pakistan's Information Minister, said the Government had an Indian agent in custody who had been captured near the Indian border.
He said the Indian had confessed to similar acts of terrorism, including 10 bombings in a 9-week period this year that resulted in 16 deaths and that wounded another 93 people.
He suggested, too, that a bombing earlier this week in a movie theater in Lahore, which killed three people and wrecked the theater, was part of an Indian-sponsored series of terrorist acts. He said the main suspect was an Indian citizen.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, on a tour of Persian Gulf emirates and Saudi Arabia in hopes of garnering financial support in the face of impending sanctions, announced plans to visit Britain, Canada and the United States in an effort to build support among Pakistani expatriots. He is scheduled to be in New York on June 16.
Money sent home by Pakistanis working abroad is one of the main sources of income in the country's beleaguered economy.

HEADLINE: Aeromexico Strike Marks Transition

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 7

 BODY:
Alejandra Barrales Magdaleno's views about unions and labor were forged flying into American cities as a $700-a-month Aeromexico flight attendant, often alongside those from United States airlines whose salaries were four times as high.
Now as the leader of Mexico's 2,000-member flight attendants' union, Ms. Barrales symbolizes the more independent and vigorous labor movement emerging here a year after the death of Fidel Velazquez, the union czar who kept workers submissive for decades. 
 With Mexico's economy strengthening after years of crisis, Ms. Barrales brought to a modestly-successful conclusion on Saturday evening the first nationwide strike by one of the politically independent unions that formed a new federation last year. These unions are an important element in Mexico's democratic transition.
"This strike strengthened not just our union but the entire workers' movement," Ms. Barrales told hundreds of cheering flight attendants in an assembly that approved a new salary and benefits package by a unanimous vote.
The contrast could hardly be more dramatic between Mr. Velazquez, who was anti-communist, anti-American and -- when he died last year at the age of 97 -- antediluvian, and Ms. Barrales, who is 30 years old, politically independent, and an admirer of the American, Canadian and European labor movements.
"She's an impressive, dynamic new leader," said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who has met her to discuss new alliances among North American unions. "She's the kind of new labor leadership we're seeing in Mexico."
There are now fewer strikes in Mexico because so many have been crushed. In fact, the Government helped management during the flight attendants' strike by seizing control of the airline to keep planes flying.
But during a week of picketing and negotiations, Ms. Barrales marshaled middle class support and focused international pressure on management, finally wringing modest salary increases and new benefits from the airline.
Despite Mexican workers' reputation for being among the world's most long-suffering, the outcome suggests that after nearly two decades of falling wages, some want to lodge more aggressive demands.
Graciela Bensusan, an academic who studies the labor movement here, said that during years of economic turmoil, strikes have declined dramatically -- from 675 in 1982 to 39 last year -- partly because "workers have been willing to accept huge salary cuts to save their jobs."
"This strike is emblematic," she said, "because it shows that now some workers are willing to return to mobilizations as a way to improve working conditions."
The Mexican Workers Confederation, known by its initials in Spanish, C.T.M., which Mr. Velazquez headed, is still Mexico's largest labor body by far, representing some 10 million workers. But last year Ms. Barrales helped found a rival federation, the National Workers Union, which now represents some 1.5 million members and appears to be growing fast.
Francisco Hernandez Juarez, the leader of the telephone workers union, is president of the new federation. "Mexico's labor system was designed for control," he said in an interview. "The unions were taken from the workers and given to labor leaders who work with the Government and the company owners.
"The leaders get rich, and the Government and owners use the unions to impose economic programs and to keep labor costs low. We think its time to even things out. We want Mexico to compete and grow, but people can't eat macroeconomic indicators. They need better salaries."
During the first decades after Mr. Velazquez helped forge the post-revolutionary labor movement in the 1930's and 1940's, his official federation, which forms one wing of the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won important improvements in wages and working conditions in exchange for turning out the vote on election day.
But after 1982, the year of a watershed debt crisis, Mr. Velazquez's official unions worked mainly to discipline workers into tightening their belts as inflation and devaluations cut into real wages.
Sidney Weintraub, an economist at Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies, cited Government statistics in a recent article outlining the extraordinary erosion of Mexican wages. In 1980, he said, Mexican manufacturing workers earned 22 percent of what their American counterparts earned. By 1996, Mexican wages had fallen to 8 percent of American wages, he said.
Few groups of workers have felt this decline more painfully than the country's airline employees. In the wake of a 1988 privatization, two-thirds of Aeromexico's 12,000-member work force were eliminated and workers who managed to keep their jobs lost pensions, seniority rights, and virtually every other benefit.
"I tried to get help from the union," recalled Ms. Barrales, who was 21 years old and had been flying with Aeromexico for two years at the time of the privatization. "But there was no strength, no support, and we had to begin again at zero."
If some Aeromexico workers viewed the sacrifices as an investment in the company's future, the altruism soured in 1994, when Aeromexico's high-flying chief executive suddenly fled Mexico after Government accusations that he had embezzled $72 million from the airline. He, in turn, through his lawyers, accused PRI officials of shaking the airline down for $8 million in election year contributions even as the company was sliding into bankruptcy.
Since Ms. Barrales was elected president of her union in 1995, she has been watching Aeromexico's balance sheets, which have been improving. She said the company earned nearly $100 million in profits last year. An Aeromexico spokesman declined to divulge the official figure.
Before the strike, Aeromexico's most senior flight attendants earned about $7,400 a year, compared with about $42,000 on United States airlines, according to union statistics. Saturday's agreement will raise salaries by 18 percent and establish a retirement plan.
"You're going to see more unions ready to defend worker's interests," Ms. Barrales said.

HEADLINE: Religious Leaders Urge Clinton To Press China On Persecution

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

 BODY:
From Tibetan Buddhists to Roman Catholics to evangelical Christians, a broad array of religious leaders is urging President Clinton to use his summit meeting later this month in Beijing to press the Chinese Government to end the repression of religious believers there.
Religious persecution abroad has increasingly become a major cause of concern among members of the American clergy, many of whom say that China is one of the most consistent violators of religious freedom. Now rights advocates long concerned about the Chinese occupation of Tibet have joined forces with Christian clergy pushing for more freedom for Chinese churchgoers. 
 More than 200 American religious leaders have signed a letter to the President asking him to put pressure on the Chinese Government to release all religious prisoners, to rescind decrees forcing Christian churches to register with the Government, and to open negotiations about the future of Tibet with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhists' exiled leader.
"This summit," the religious leaders say in their letter, "will certainly have great benefits for future economic and trade relations between the United States and China. As important as these issues are, however, human rights, and religious liberty in particular, must not be ignored."
The letter, drafted by the Center for Jewish and Christian Values in Washington, is signed by people whose names rarely appear on the same page. They include two Roman Catholic cardinals and more than a dozen bishops, a spokesman for the Church of Scientology, Reform and Orthodox rabbis, evangelical Christian ministers and broadcasters, Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, Southern Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, African-American religious leaders and Orthodox Christians.
"It is hard for us, as Americans, to imagine what it must be like to live in a country that denies its citizens basic human rights," said Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua, Archbishop of Philadelphia, who signed the letter along with John Cardinal O'Connor of New York. "For that reason, I join my brother bishops and other concerned religious leaders in strongly urging President Clinton to help open the door to religious liberties for the Chinese people."
Thousands are expected to attend a rally for Tibet in Washington next Monday. The rally, which will follow a sold-out benefit concert over the weekend, was organized by a slate of pro-Tibet groups. Mr. Clinton is to travel to China on June 24, and advocates for Tibet see his trip as the best chance yet to press China to enter negotiations.
"This time," said Bhuchung K. Tsering, director of the International Campaign for Tibet, "we want the President to come back from Beijing not with another statement saying they are ready to talk, but with concrete assurance from the Chinese side that they will sit down with the Dalai Lama and resolve the issue of Tibet."

HEADLINE: Report Tying Abortion To Welfare Is Rejected

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
A team of Rutgers University researchers hired by the New Jersey government to examine the effects of the state's new welfare policy found that it has contributed to an increase in abortions, but the state has rejected the findings, and asked for revisions of the report.
In a December report, commissioned by the State Department of Human Services and the Federal Department of Health and Human Services and obtained by The New York Times, the Rutgers researchers said the welfare overhaul provision known as the family cap, which was enacted in 1992 and cuts off extra benefits from welfare recipients who have additional children, has caused some women to abort their pregnancies. 
 "The Family Development Program does appear to exert a small but non-trivial effect on abortion rates, adding about 240 abortions per year over what would be expected due to trend and population composition changes," the report said. There were 31,860 abortions in New Jersey in 1996.
The Rutgers findings are likely to add new fuel to the nationwide debate over welfare because 20 other states have imposed family caps similar to New Jersey's.
Welfare recipients generally have abortions at a higher rate than other women: In New Jersey, in the quarter ending December 1991, the abortion rate for the welfare population was 27 per 1,000 compared with 4 per 1,000 for all New Jersey women of child-bearing age. And although the abortion rate in New Jersey, and nationwide, declined between 1991 and 1996, the abortion rate among New Jersey's welfare recipients rose during the same period. By 1996, the Rutgers report found, the gap had widened further, with 29 abortions per 1,000 women receiving welfare, compared with 3 per 1,000 women in the general population.
But the state has not accepted those findings, calling the report a draft that needs substantial revision.
In a May 14 letter to the research team, the Department of Human Services said the document should be labeled a draft, criticized the methodology and asked for a re-working that would explain all the difficulties of determining whether it was the welfare policy that had caused the increase in abortions. The letter also questioned the validity of studying the behavior of the welfare population before and after the law changed, since the changes themselves may have altered that population, causing some recipients to get off welfare, and other people to avoid it.
But the lawyers challenging the family cap provision contend that the state's response reflects political problems, not methodological ones.
"We think this is a final report that the state is trying to cover up by saying it's a draft," said Martha Davis, a lawyer with the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, one of the groups challenging the family cap. "And we think the real reason for their objections is concern about what legislators will do if they see the conclusions the Rutgers researchers have drawn."
Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Human Services, denied that interpretation. Rather, she said, the state is committed to understanding what effects the family cap has had, and is concerned about the release of draft findings based on a methodology that the state says is flawed.
"This is just a draft," she said. "Neither of the two clients, us or Health and Human Services in Washington, has approved it, and it's not final until it's approved. We want to make sure that what we get is good social science research that is clear about the effects of the policy."
The question of how welfare recipients' reproductive decisions are affected by a family cap, removing any financial incentive to have more children, has been one of the most hotly argued issues in the debate over welfare.
Some conservatives have argued that family caps help discourage welfare recipients from having more babies than they can support, and prevent long-term welfare dependency. But in an unusual political alliance, the Roman Catholic Church and conservative Christian groups joined with advocates for the poor to argue against family caps, on the ground that they would encourage abortion and increase child poverty by forcing welfare families to stretch their meager benefits too far.
New Jersey's family cap went into effect in 1993, under a Federal waiver allowing the state to conduct welfare experiments. Two years later, the Federal welfare overhaul bill opened the way for any state to adopt such a policy, and family caps are now in effect in 20 other states.
"The Rutgers findings have very serious implications for children in every state that has instituted a family cap," said Regina Purcell, a spokeswoman for the Catholic Conference of New Jersey. "It's important to remember not only the number of babies that were aborted due to the family cap, but also the number of children born who were denied assistance. As of December, more than 25,000 children in New Jersey had been denied cash assistance because of the family cap."
Last year, Ms. Davis's group, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey and Gibbons Del Deo, a New Jersey law firm, filed suit charging that the family cap violated the state constitution by interfering with women's reproductive rights and treated children differently depending on their birth status.
In late February, in the course of preparing a summary judgment motion in the case, Ms. Davis said, the lawyers asked the state whether the final report from Rutgers, which had been long scheduled for release in December, was available.
A lawyer in the Attorney General's office gave them a copy of the December report, which they shared with representatives of the Catholic Church and others who oppose the family cap at a May 12 meeting. Ms. Davis said the lawyers challenging the cap had also asked for, and been granted, permission to talk to the Rutgers researchers.
But, she said, on May 14 -- the same day the department's letter went out to the researchers -- the Attorney General's office called to say that the report was only a draft and to withdraw permission to talk to the researchers.
"This is a report filed in December, and there was plenty of time for back and forth about the methodology before May," Ms. Davis said. "The timing, together with the fact that this was in no way labeled a draft, as an earlier interim report had been, lead us to conclude that something else was going on here."
Ms. Tencza said there were no political machinations involved: discussions of the methodology had gone on since the report was filed, she said, and the May 14 letter only reflected continuing discussions. And she said that the lawyer for the Attorney General's office who gave out the report was simply unaware that it was a draft.
"It was an oversight, and it should not have been released," Ms. Tencza said. "This is very complicated, very important social science research, and there are many serious concerns about methodology. We're not confident that there is any methodology that would result in establishing a cause-and-effect relationship. That's one thing we've learned through this process."
The letter questioned the researchers' use of trends in abortion and birth rates to estimate what those rates might have been without the welfare changes, and the suggestion that the welfare changes may have caused the difference. And it said that the researchers need not redo the study, but should submit a revised version making clear the difficulties of determining causality.
Michael Camasso, the lead researcher on the $1 million evaluation project, declined to discuss the specifics of the December report or the re-working now under way.
"We have three different studies of the family cap, this pre/post research, a cost-benefit analysis, and another using an experimental group and a control group," he said. "All I can say is that the final reports on all three, which are not that far off, will present the most comprehensive view possible of the effects of the family cap."
The lawyers challenging the family cap are convinced that the policy encourages abortions, both from the Rutgers research and from interviews with welfare recipients.
"We showed the report to outside experts, including statisticians and economists, and they agreed that it shows that the family cap is causing women to have abortions," said Lenora Lapidus, legal director of the New Jersey A.C.L.U. "In a state where there's been this strong effort to cut back on access on abortion, there's a real irony here. This state now has two choices, they can backpedal and try to change the study. Or with the Governor leading, they can take the high road and reconsider the policy."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI TO PLACE DISABLED MOTHERS IN WORKFARE JOBS

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
In an ambitious and controversial effort to increase the number of welfare recipients participating in New York City's workfare program, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will soon begin requiring physically and mentally disabled mothers to work for their welfare checks.
The new policy began quietly this weekend when city officials ordered about 800 disabled women to report to welfare offices for screening into the new 20-hour-a-week workfare program. The women, who showed up at city offices clutching plastic pill bottles and crumpled medical forms on Saturday, had already been examined by city doctors who classified them as permanently or temporarily unemployable since they suffer from seizures, mental illness, severe arthritis and other ailments. 
 But under the new rules, the mothers will be required to work in jobs tailored to their specific impairments by nonprofit groups accustomed to working with the disabled, including Goodwill Industries of Greater New York. Women who cannot walk, for instance, might type or stuff envelopes. Only those women with disabilities severe enough to qualify for Federal disability benefits will be exempt.
City officials say the old system, which allowed the disabled to stay home until city doctors certified that they could work, denied job training, work experience and career counseling to people who desperately needed those services. State officials, who will help finance and oversee the new program, say about 12,000 disabled mothers will participate in workfare initially, with the first group starting in two months. The remaining 21,000 disabled welfare mothers may follow if the program works well, city officials say.
But the policy shift, coming five months after Mr. Giuliani vowed to move virtually all city welfare recipients into workfare jobs, was quickly condemned by advocates for the poor, who said it violates state law and endangers the lives of the sickest and most vulnerable New Yorkers.
The clash between advocates and city officials over the issue marks only the beginning of a contentious debate that will likely land in civil court, and one that already swirls across much of the nation as states like Florida, Oregon and Wisconsin push disabled people on public assistance into the workplace. "The ethic has changed and a lot of states are trying to reach into that population," said Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Under Federal law, mothers on public assistance can receive welfare checks for only five years, regardless of whether they are disabled or not. State officials may exempt 20 percent of their welfare mothers from the time limit, but many are still pushing as many women into work as they can, fearful that more than 20 percent will still need benefits when the deadline hits.
"The clock is ticking and we want to help more participants work," Mr. Tweedie said of the disabled on public assistance. "The hard part is figuring out how to do it."
In New York City, where welfare officials have been sued for assigning people with less serious medical ailments to workfare jobs that threaten their health, advocates for the poor found the new policy particularly alarming.
Last month, a state judge ordered the city to create a process that would allow welfare recipients to challenge work assignments for health and safety reasons. But that process would apply to welfare recipients without severe medical problems, workers with asthma who can answer telephones but cannot scrub dusty garages, for instance. This group is classified as employable, but with limitations.
The city's new policy is directed toward a group that city doctors say are actually unable to work, and advocates say it will be impossible to find suitable work for this group. About 4,000 welfare mothers have been deemed permanently unemployable by the city's medical contractor, Health Services Systems. About 30,000 have been classified as temporarily unemployable, meaning they cannot work for three to six months.
They are young women like Daisy Rivera, 28, who was deemed permanently unemployable because she suffers from severe asthma and weighs 400 pounds. They are older women like Evelyn Valle, 39, who hobbled to the welfare office, leaning hard on a scratched wooden cane because of the arthritis in her hip. Or like Aglaee Muniz, 57, who takes medication for severe depression and diabetes and was also classified as permanently unable to work.
Advocates for the poor say state law clearly exempts such people from participating in work activities.
"This is mind-boggling," said Susan Sternberg, a staff attorney at the Brooklyn Neighborhood Office of the Legal Aid Society, who represents the workfare workers with medical limitations in their suit against the city. "These are people who the city has already found to be unable to participate in work activities. This means hundreds more people are going to be sicker and risk death."
But state and city officials say the policy is perfectly legal because the law also requires disabled people who have "the potential to be restored to self-sufficiency" to participate in vocational rehabilitation programs.
City officials say the new program has been carefully planned to meet the needs of this population, which was unable to participate in the traditional workfare program along with the 32,000 current participants. The work sites will be chosen by officials at four groups, Goodwill Industries, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, the National Center for Disability Services and the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, who will safeguard the health and safety of the new workers.
All told, the groups must place at least 228 mothers in unsubsidized jobs for at least 90 days by March 1999.
"We have to be concerned about the disability, but that doesn't mean these people are not worthy of being given an opportunity to be productive members of the community, to use the talents they have," said Debra Sproles, the spokeswoman for the Human Resources Administration, which runs the city's welfare programs.
"This is a whole group that was forgotten about," Ms. Sproles said. "We want to proceed cautiously, but this is a great step toward bringing these people back into the fold."
On Saturday, caseworkers for the four groups used a two-page questionnaire to screen hundreds of mothers, who were either temporarily disabled or permanently disabled women who had been denied Federal disability benefits.
Those with serious disabilities were given an appointment for a more complete evaluation, which will be reviewed by the State Office of Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals With Disabilities. Most of those women will ultimately work 20 hours a week for three months, and 35 hours a week after that, while receiving career counseling, job search training and other services. Twenty other New York counties, including Westchester and Onondaga, also received state financing for similar programs.
Those welfare recipients who are determined to lack serious disabilities will be re-examined by city doctors and may eventually end up in the traditional workfare program, although they can appeal that decision, city officials said. And those with the most severe medical problems will be told to apply for Federal disability benefits.
No one knows how smoothly the new process will work. Advocates for the poor in Wisconsin, which has also eliminated broad work exemptions for the disabled, said they have not encountered widespread problems. Jason A. Turner, the recently appointed chief of New York City's welfare agency, was the architect of that state's welfare program.
But the sheer size of New York City's welfare population makes the job infinitely more complex. Wisconsin has only about 9,000 adults on public assistance statewide, while New York City has about 200,000 mothers on welfare, including the 33,000 disabled women.
Hundreds of those women filled the waiting rooms of the city's welfare offices on Saturday, sitting on hard, plastic chairs as they thumbed through plastic bags and time-worn envelopes for their medical records. Most seemed stunned to learn that they were going to work after city doctors had told them that they could not.
"I work with people who can't see, who can't hear," a caseworker from one of the nonprofit groups told a doubtful woman, who said a stroke left her with chronic seizures. "I work with people who have only one leg, in wheelchairs. We're here to help you find jobs."
One 30-year-old woman, who said she suffered from mental illness, said the interview gave her hope that she might be able to work for the first time. "People think just because there's something wrong, you can't work," said the woman, who refused to give her name. "That's not true. You can work."
But other women left the city welfare offices fearful that they would be unable to function in the new program.
"I don't understand it," said Ms. Rivera, the woman with asthma who weighs 400 pounds, as she fumbled in her backpack for the letter from the city doctor who determined that she was permanently unable to work.
"They say I'm a sick woman," she said helplessly. "I don't know how I'm going to handle this."

HEADLINE: Praise for Dissident Turned President;
Korean-Americans Welcome Kim Dae Jung to New Jersey

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

DATELINE: CLIFFSIDE PARK, N.J., June 7

 BODY:
The initial shock has worn off, a schoolteacher named Joung Pyo Jyoung said today, but she still marvels at how Kim Dae Jung, the longtime dissident, came to be elected president of South Korea, her homeland.
"It is a surprising thing," she said at the very moment that Mr. Kim entered a Cliffside Park banquet hall where she and 500 other Korean-Americans had gathered to honor him today, his first full day of a state visit that is to take him across the United States this week. 
 Ms. Jyoung was hardly the only one here to express amazement at a political odyssey that can be compared to the triumphs of Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia and other champions of lost causes.
Successive South Korean dictators tried to have Mr. Kim killed, coming extremely close more than once. In 1980, the military regime then in charge sentenced him to the gallows, but chose instead to send him into exile in the United States. Even after he returned home in 1985, and after South Korea then nurtured a fledgling democracy, he seemed destined to spend the rest of his years in permanent opposition.
But there he was today, his country's leader since February, walking triumphantly into the banquet hall with a slight limp, the legacy of an assassination attempt.
"Some people now say that after all he went through, maybe he was meant to be president," said Ms. Jyoung, a public-school teacher from Bayside, Queens. "When you go through so much, maybe you become a better person."
His tortured road to political power was clearly on Mr. Kim's own mind as he spoke to the crowd for 35 minutes. "It's a funny thing," he said to laughter as he began his remarks in Korean, "but nobody believed that I'd be standing here as president."
A Roman Catholic, he told of how after his election he had called on Stephen Cardinal Kim Sou Hwan, South Korea's prelate. The Cardinal, he said, had observed that his election should stand as a model to young Koreans of how perseverance can lead to success.
That's true, Mr. Kim said he replied, but something else counted, too. "It is important to live long," he said.
Mr. Kim, 74, seemed to enjoy wading through the crowd and shaking hands with the Korean-Americans, many of whom had left South Korea 20 or 30 years ago but still had deep emotional and economic ties to their homeland.
It would be an exaggeration to say that they greeted him with wild enthusiasm.
He was applauded warmly and often by the invited guests -- for the most part businessmen, academics and clergymen who came from New York City or from this part of Bergen County, N.J., where thousands of Korean-Americans have settled. He was also ardently praised as a fighter for democracy by Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey.
But there was an underlying restraint. It was a sharp contrast to the emotional outbursts that Mr. Kim, a gifted speaker, is capable of producing, especially in crowds from Cholla Province, his native land in the southwest corner of South Korea.
Some who came to the Palisadium banquet hall, on the Hudson River, said they would probably not have voted for him if they had had the chance. They were not sure at first, they said, that he was the right person to guide the country through its most serious financial crisis in decades. Like millions of South Koreans, they had long heard military-dominated governments denounce Mr. Kim as an irresponsible populist -- and soft on North Korea's Communists, to boot.
But now, in his fourth month in office, he seems to have won over even the skeptics. And if the applause was not boisterous, it was nonetheless ample. The most frequently expressed opinion was that Mr. Kim had thus far handled the crisis well.
"We are expecting a lot of things from him," said Augustin Chi, who owns a Burger King outlet near the banquet hall. "We give him heartfelt support -- I can say 100 percent."
Jay Kim, a health statistician for the Federal Government, noted Koreans' well-earned reputation for being political battlers, but said everyone had to rally around the new leader now. "It's a very tough time," he said. "We can't afford to fight among ourselves." Referring to President Kim, he added: "I can't say we are all enthusiastic and want to hug him. It's more: 'Please do well.' "
President Kim arrived on Saturday and stayed overnight at the Intercontinental Hotel in Manhattan under tight security, which was equally intense in Cliffside Park. In the morning, he attended Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and met with John Cardinal O'Connor afterward.
This evening, he was honored at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, where he helped dedicate a new gallery of Korean art.
On Monday, Mr. Kim is scheduled to visit the New York Stock Exchange, where he can be counted on to underline a likely theme of this visit: reassurance to foreign investors that South Korea is fundamentally sound. After New York, he goes to Washington for meetings with President Clinton and a speech to Congress, before journeying on to Los Angeles, a center of Korean-American life.
Mr. Kim told the Korean-Americans here that his Government supported "with its heart" their choice to resettle in the United States. He spoke about his financial-recovery measures. But he also said the emphasis that past Korean leaders put on national security and economic growth, to the exclusion of almost everything else, was not good enough.
"Democracy and open markets are the basic policies of Korea now," he said.
It was a reminder of his credentials as a pro-democracy campaigner, not that anyone here needed that lesson.
Ms. Jyoung, the schoolteacher from Bayside, talked with a reporter who said, only half in jest, that the Korean words he knew best were "down with the military dictator," a phrase that echoed through thousands of anti-Government protests.
"They already did it," Ms. Jyoung said as Mr. Kim entered the room. "The dictatorship is gone, and I hope we don't hear those words anymore."

HEADLINE: City Council Says It Can Make Up Shortfall

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
The skirmishes over New York City's next budget continued yesterday as City Council leaders ventured into the labyrinthine world of property taxes to patch a $251 million hole that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had blown into their budget a day earlier.
Meanwhile, Mr. Giuliani's aides fiercely attacked the Council's budget as illegal. They described Council members as spendthrifts who had increased spending on themselves in the last four years even as the Mayor's office had substantially lowered its own expenses. 
 These were the latest shots in a budget battle that erupted on Friday, when the Council defied Mr. Giuliani by adopting a budget without his endorsement. On Saturday, the Mayor countered by announcing that expected revenues for next year would fall short of earlier estimates by $251 million. The move was intended to force the Council either to accept eventual spending vetoes by the Mayor or raise property taxes -- the only tax over which the legislative body has control -- to balance the budget.
But aides to Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, said last night that the Council had another response up its sleeve. It will meet this morning and, turning to an arcane section of the city's property tax law, draw the $251 million from a reserve fund that covers property tax shortfalls, the aides said. Taxes will not go up, they insisted.
"Nobody will pay more as a result of the actions that the City Council is taking," said Thomas L. McMahon, the Council's finance director. "Property tax is the most complicated tax in the world, and it's being used by the City Council to one-up the Office of Management and Budget," the Mayor's budget office.
Earlier yesterday, the Mayor and his top aides hunkered down inside City Hall, as Mr. Giuliani prepared to use, for the first time in his mayoralty, his line-item veto power and slash up to $200 million from the $34.08 billion spending plan. In the budgetary tit for tat, the Mayor's office said that it had conjured up "six scenarios" to respond to any maneuver by the Council, and predicted victory as long as the Council did not come up with a seventh counterattack.
Also, the Mayor's aides said the Council's budget violated the City Charter by not declaring how much money each Council Committee would receive; the Speaker deliberately left that information out, the aides said, to allow him to covertly move money around to punish disloyal members and reward loyal ones.
"The public has a right to ask, 'Where's the money, City Council?' " said Randy M. Mastro, Deputy Mayor for Operations. "Because right now you can't tell how the City Council spends its money, how much goes to each committee, how much is doled out in member goodies to individual members of the City Council."
Mr. McMahon said the information was left out because it was too cumbersome, and added that the Mayor's office had never complained about this practice in the past.
The escalating fight over $251 million -- which represents seven-tenths of a percent of the $34.08 billion budget -- underscored yet again how political hostilities have complicated the annual budget negotiations between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Vallone, who until now shared harmonious relations and, in the recession of the mid-1990's, were able to agree on deep cuts in services in almost every area of the city.
In a normal year -- and especially this fiscal year, which is expected to end June 30 with a record $2 billion surplus -- budget officials from both sides might have settled such picayune differences over drinks at one of the many bars near City Hall.
But budget talks collapsed last Monday amid much chest-beating and a political deadlock. The Mayor, who wants to use city money to help build a new home for the Yankees, possibly on the West Side of Manhattan, wanted Mr. Vallone to drop his call for a November referendum on the issue. But the Speaker refused, saying the referendum had nothing to do with budget talks. Mr. Vallone is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, and his political base strongly opposes any suggestion of moving the Yankees out of the Bronx into Manhattan; what's more, in a general race against Gov. George E. Pataki, a referendum on the November ballot would increase voter turnout in Democratic strongholds like the Bronx and Manhattan.
So on Friday, the Council passed its own budget for the first time since it acquired the authority to do so under the City Charter revision of 1989. But the Charter gives the Mayor a crucial advantage because only he can determine so-called revenue estimates for the budget -- the amount of nonproperty taxes the city expects to collect and the amount of money the city expects to get from Washington and Albany.
In passing its own budget, the Council used the revenue estimates projected by the Mayor in April; hours later, the Mayor put the Council's plan in disarray by saying that the revenues were actually $251 million lower, mainly because of state and Federal money the city had expected but was not granted.
Last night, Council officials said they would take $251 million from a property tax reserve fund. On average, residential and commercial property owners pay $10.36 for every $100 that their property is worth -- giving the city a total of $8.1 billion in revenues, Council officials said.
But not all of that amount is used in the city's budget: for example, only $7.4 billion is included in the budget for the next fiscal year beginning on July 1. The rest, about $700 million, is put into the reserve fund, which exists to cover up any shortfall in property tax collections, Council officials said. Taking $251 million from that fund would keep it around the level where it has been, $494 million, since 1990, officials said.

HEADLINE: $34 Billion Merger Expected By Norwest and Wells Fargo

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
In the banking industry's latest megamerger, the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis and Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco plan to join forces and may announce a $34 billion deal as early as today, according to people close to both companies.
Although the transaction is structured as a so-called merger of equals, Norwest's chief executive, Richard Kovacevich, will run the combined company as chief executive while Wells' chief executive, Paul Hazen, will relinquish that post. The new bank will be based in San Francisco and retain the Wells Fargo name. The new bank, with combined assets of $185 billion, will rank as the sixth largest in the nation if all other bank mergers announced this year are completed. 
 The logic of the merger follows a now familiar pattern: Many banks, stuck in an industry with little revenue growth and heightened competition from brokerage firms, mutual funds and credit card companies, see size as a solution to their woes. By bulking up, banks believe they can become more profitable by dominating certain markets and enjoying greater economies of scale.
It is the latest in a string of bank-related blockbusters this year that have surprised Wall Street, including the mergers of Citicorp and Travelers Group, BankAmerica Corporation and Nationsbank Corporation and First Chicago NBD and Banc One Corporation.
Mr. Kovacevich, considered to be one of the most disciplined and talented executives in banking, said in a recent interview that he felt no need to merge with another bank and that he found the recent prices being paid for banks to be exorbitant.
On the other hand, Mr. Kovacevich has said he would buy another bank if the price was right, and in this case it apparently was. Norwest will exchange about 10 shares for each Wells share, representing a premium of only about 10 percent to Wells' closing price on Friday. Big Wells investors, such as Warren Buffett, were apparently willing to accept a slim takeover premium based on the combined company's prospects. As of December, Mr. Buffet owned 7.87 percent of Wells Fargo.
Wells would have been unthinkable as a takeover target a few years ago, when it emerged as the victor in a hotly contested battle for the First Interstate Corporation of Los Angeles, but Wells botched the integration of the two banks. That cost Wells precious profits and customers, and brought Mr. Hazen, long considered a skilled manager, some unaccustomed criticism from analysts and Wall Street. And it left Wells vulnerable.
There had been speculation that Wells might be taken over by U.S. Bancorp, a Minneapolis rival of Norwest. But given the well-known and longstanding animosity between Mr. Hazen and John Grundhofer, U.S. Bancorp's chief executive, most bank advisers dismissed the rumors. Now, there will be considerable pressure on U.S. Bancorp to find a partner if it wants to be one of the banking industry's big survivors.
Norwest, the biggest mortgage underwriter in the country, has been one of the few banks with a solid track record in bundling, or "cross-selling," financial products like mortgages, credit cards, and annuities to its customers and likes to compare itself to Wal-Mart. It has plans to expand its sales of insurance, already the largest such operation among banks.

HEADLINE: WORLD CUP PROFILE: FRANCE '98 -- The Master of the Quick Fix;
An Enigmatic Milutinovic, an Equally Enigmatic Nigeria

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
ELINCOURT SAINTE MARGUERITE, France, June 7 -- His top goalkeeper has a broken arm. The news media are demanding his head. In recent exhibitions, his players have done nothing creative with their feet. And for democracy to overcome military rule in Nigeria, some believe, it is better for his team to fail than to succeed in the World Cup.
Bora Milutinovic is coaching his fourth team in soccer's world championship, and if he is concerned about any of this, he hides it well, beneath his Beatle haircut and glasses that are as thick as the intrigue surrounding Nigeria's slumping entrance into the world's most popular sporting event. 
 At lunch today, fewer than 48 hours after Nigeria was humbled by 5-1 in a friendly match with the Netherlands, Milutinovic laughed and joked and played Ping-Pong with his star midfielder, Sunday Oliseh.
"How can I make you happy, my friend, by losing a game to you?" he said to Oliseh.
Those who know him well believe Milutinovic is using that same sandbagging approach to artfully prepare for Nigeria's Group D World Cup opener against Spain on Saturday.
While his friends certainly do not believe he has deliberately been outscored by 13-1 by Germany, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands and the Swiss club team Grasshoppers since late April, they do believe that Milutinovic has been experimenting, using decoy maneuvers and smartly trying to lower expectations for a team that advanced to the second round of the 1994 World Cup and won the gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
The Serbian coach is famous for his craftiness and his evasiveness. His previous three teams -- Mexico, Costa Rica and the United States -- all advanced beyond the first round of the World Cup. And Nigeria hopes to exceed its performance of 1994, when it led Italy until the final minute before losing in overtime in the second round.
"Bora always tries to keep the big picture in mind," said Steve Sampson, the head coach of the American team and Milutinovic's assistant in the 1994 World Cup. "He's using friendly matches to prepare his team and his opponents psychologically, although I do think he has a legitimate concern with the goalkeeper situation."
In the buildup to the 1998 World Cup, Germany Coach Berti Vogts predicted that Nigeria would be the "secret surprise" and that, at some positions, "Nigeria has even better players than Brazil." No team from Africa has ever won the World Cup, and some think that Nigeria has the ferocious attacking style, the skill and depth to be the first. It is this kind of hyperbolic anticipation that Milutinovic is trying to deflate.
"One month ago, there was so much talk about Nigeria," Milutinovic said today at Nigeria's headquarters, the Chateau de Bellinglise, located about 60 miles north of Paris. "Now we have a better situation. Public opinion is that Nigeria doesn't have a chance."
The Nigerian news media would like to seize something else -- Milutinovic's job. He was hired in December at a salary of $35,000 a month, according to the Nigerian soccer federation, plus a bonus of $250,000 if the Super Eagles win the World Cup. But the nation's news media are in full panic, certain that Nigeria will be lucky to win a game against Spain, Paraguay and Bulgaria.
It is a notoriously impatient country, where coaches are changed like shirts. Milutinovic's predecessor, the Frenchman Philippe Troussier (now the coach of South Africa), was ousted in September. Now Milutinovic is hearing the thumbs-down jeers of the Nigerian media.
"Bora has nothing more to give the Eagles," The Guardian newspaper of Lagos wrote after Friday's humbling defeat to the Netherlands. "Sacking him would serve the team better."
Said The Vanguard newspaper: "The pompous Olympic champions who used to walk with high shoulders and bouncing steps left the Amsterdam area like wet hens. Nigeria's World Cup hopes appear to have been shattered without any hope of them being retrieved."
This is familiar criticism in a sport where passion is fanatical and job security is tenuous. Milutinovic, 53, was fired by Mexico last fall, even though his team did not lose a single game in the final round of qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. Before that, he was dumped by the Americans. He is not likely to coach Nigeria beyond the World Cup. People call him a soccer gypsy, but he really is a mechanic, a master of the quick fix.
After only two months as head coach, he took Costa Rica to the second round of the 1990 World Cup. Four years later, he took an American team, half of whose players had no professional experience, and also made the second round. Patience is what he asks for from the Nigerians. A little patience.
"It's important for you to do what you need to do, not what people think you should do," Milutinovic said.
Of course, there are real concerns. The defense, a Milutinovic trademark, has been shaky. His top goalie, Ike Shorunmu, is out with a broken arm. And he cannot know yet about the reliability of his magnificent striker, Nwankwo Kanu, who was found to have a deformed heart valve after the Atlanta Olympics.
Kanu underwent surgery at the Cleveland Clinic -- his countrymen donated money for the operation -- and he has made a comeback at age 21 that many thought was impossible. If he stars in the World Cup, he will become an international hero. But Kanu played rarely this season for Inter Milan, his club team in Italy, and Milutinovic wonders about his stamina.
"He's a good kid, a good player, but we just don't know," Milutinovic said.
Because his players have been spread out across Europe, playing for club teams in England, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey, the coach has had his full team together only for seven or eight training sessions. There is much to work on and little time.
"I don't like to make excuses, but in the United States we played together for three years before the World Cup," Milutinovic said. "Here, we will have 15 training sessions."
The outcome of the World Cup will have ramifications far beyond soccer for Nigeria. Politics is knottily intertwined with sport. Nigeria withdrew from the 1996 African Nations Cup in South Africa, after that country's president, Nelson Mandela, criticized the military regime in Nigeria for its poor human rights record and its halting move toward democracy.
The European Union applied sanctions against Nigeria, including a ban on sporting contacts, after nine rights workers were executed there in 1995, including the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. Glenys Kinnock, a British member of the European Parliament, called in February for Nigeria to be tossed out of the 1998 World Cup.
Some fighting for democracy in Nigeria are actually hoping for defeat of the soccer team, The Economist magazine suggested recently, believing it could be an important step in further destabilizing the military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha.
"Sport is one thing and politics is another," Milutinovic said. "I am not political."
Should his team advance beyond the first round, he said, "anything is possible." And his players seem to be sticking with him. While some observers have suggested that Milutinovic is too conservative and defensive-minded for Nigeria, Oliseh, the midfielder who plays for Ajax in Amsterdam, said: "I don't want to criticize my boss. It's up to the players to play."
If recent defeats have brought a hail of criticism, they have also brought an absence of overconfidence, said goalkeeper Peter Rufai.
"If a coach doesn't know what he is doing, you see him losing the branches of his tree," Rufai said. "But Bora knows what he is doing. We are still with him. His branches are still fresh."

HEADLINE: At the C.I.A., What Intelligence?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The threat of sanctions was an appropriate instrument for trying to deter India and Pakistan from exploding nuclear weapons, but sanctions after the fact are injurious to United States economic and strategic interests (news article, June 3). 
 Faced with a deteriorating economy made worse by sanctions, Pakistan might improve its economic position by exporting more drugs to the United States or by exporting nuclear technologies to rogue states like Iran and Libya. India can expand its trade with France, Russia, Germany and other countries that have not imposed sanctions, to the detriment of American exporters and workers.
Sanctions turn both countries against the United States, making it more difficult for it to play a role in lowering tensions within the region.

HEADLINE: For Some Families, Wage Increase Hurt

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Bob Herbert (column, June 4) asks for explanation of how raising the minimum wage is a bad thing since a study of the most recent increase found that wages of a large number of workers went up "without causing job loss." 
 David Neumark of Michigan State University, who did a study with Mark Schweitzer and William Wascher of the Federal Reserve, found an answer: Although raising the minimum wage does increase the income of some poor families, "the entire net effect of higher minimum wages is to increase -- not decrease -- the proportion of families that are poor."
Even a study Mr. Herbert cites shows how poorly crafted minimum-wage increases are in assisting the poor. Besides, census data show that fewer than half of the families in the bottom 20 percent of income even contain a worker.

Saint Laurent Passes a Rein
Certainly, several of the recent designer hires at French fashion houses have been more sensational than the appointment this week of Alber Elbaz as the designer and creative director for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche. But none have been as ripe with sentiment.
Mr. Saint Laurent is, after all, a legend, a living one, and a monument of French culture. Pierre Berge, Mr. Saint Laurent's business partner of almost 40 years, has continually suggested that no one would ever replace the groundbreaking designer in his own house while he was still alive. Amid the swirl of designer dust-ups, the house of Saint Laurent seemed stubbornly determined to survive on its memories. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Berge acknowledged that time had caught up with the house. Mr. Saint Laurent, who is 62 and has become increasingly reclusive, was relieved to be giving up the reins to Rive Gauche, the house's ready-to-wear line, Mr. Berge said in a telephone interview from Paris.
"The ready-to-wear in France has completely changed, and it was difficult for him," Mr. Berge said. Mr. Saint Laurent, who Mr. Berge said was unavailable for comment, will continue to design the haute couture collection. Mr. Elbaz will direct the ready-to-wear, diffusion lines like Encore and Variation and the licensed accessory lines.
In his new position, to begin in November, Mr. Elbaz will report to Mr. Berge. There was no thought, Mr. Berge said, that Mr. Elbaz would work with the man whose name was on the door. "I think he could be paralyzed," Mr. Berge said of Mr. Elbaz, 37. "I'm ready to accept what he will create. He has wonderful technique, and he likes women. It's not a question of replacing Saint Laurent; it's a question of bringing something new."
Mr. Berge's head was turned by Mr. Elbaz's work at Guy Laroche. Mr. Elbaz was at the Laroche studio in Paris yesterday overseeing the production of his last collection for the house, which hired him two years ago from Geoffrey Beene, where he was the assistant designer.
Mr. Elbaz immediately stamped his imprint on the French line with a fresh, light interpretation of a style that had become cloying and out of date. His floor-sweeping, jewel-toned mohair skirts and sweet embroidered tulle dresses buoyed up the beached house of Laroche.
The approach is consistent with the Saint Laurent esthetic. "I love that he makes women beautiful," Mr. Elbaz said, adding that he had not yet met Mr. Saint Laurent.
Born in Morocco, a favorite inspiration of the older designer, Mr. Elbaz grew up in Israel and moved to the United States when he was 25. His appointment to the house of Saint Laurent, with a three-year contract, is not a dream come true, he said. "It's my only dream," he said.
 
Pier 94 to Open in July
Fashion will have another home in Manhattan when renovations are completed on Pier 94, a 175,000-square-foot space at 755 12th Avenue (55th Street). Formerly a parking garage, the site, to be called the Unconvention Center, is to open on July 26 with the Collective, a men's-wear trade show produced by ENK International. ENK presents some of fashion's premier trade shows.
Elyse Kroll, the president of ENK, who has a financial interest in the development of Pier 94, is overseeing the transformation from garage to fashion center. The Unconvention Center is being developed at a cost of about $3 million, Ms. Kroll said.
The new space is a result of a two-year search that Ms. Kroll undertook after presenting her shows primarily in hotels, like the Omni and the Plaza. Accommodations for midsize trade shows have become scarce, she said. With the tourist boom, several city hotels are now turning trade groups away, she said. Last year, ENK shows were spread out over Piers 88, 90 and 92. " 'Titanic' came out, and all of a sudden the piers are fully booked with cruise ships," she added.
In her search, Ms. Kroll turned for help to the city's Economic Development Corporation. The piers are owned by the city and leased to private businesses like Port Parties and the International Terminal Operating Company, which together will operate Pier 94 for a fee.

Treasuries Flat Ahead of Greenspan Talk

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended little changed yesterday, as some investors took profits after Friday's gains. Few investors were willing to make large bets ahead of tomorrow's scheduled Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32, to 104 29/32, leaving its yield unchanged at 5.78 percent. 
 At yesterday's regular weekly auction of new Treasury bills, the three-month issue was sold at an average rate of 4.995 percent, up from 4.945 percent last week, while the six-month issue was sold at an average rate of 5.155 percent, up from 5.110 percent.
Following are the results of the auction:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.737	97.394	Discounted Rate	4.99%	5.15%	Coupon Yield	5.13	5.36%	High Price	98.736	97.394	Discounted Rate	5.00%	5.16%	Coupon Yield	5.14%	5.37%	Low Price	98.741	97.401	Discounted Rate	4.98%	5.14%	Coupon Yield	5.11%	5.35%	Accepted at low price	14%	82%	Total applied for	$37,020,805	$34,088,184	Accepted	$9,247,705	$11,548,354	Noncompetitive	$1,239,138	$1,143,389

Let's Play

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Since everyone is giving President Clinton travel advice, I'll chime in too: On your way home from China, stop in Iran. Yes, Iran. Invite yourself. Don't make this upcoming trip to China just about the last crisis. Make it about the next one. Looked at a map of South Asia lately? China's got the bomb. India's got the bomb. Pakistan's got the bomb. Let's see, who's next to Pakistan . . . Iran.
It's probably only a matter of time, a decade or less, before Iran, for its own geostrategic reasons, develops or acquires a nuclear device. Who knows, maybe Pakistan, reeling from sanctions, will sell Iran one. The only question is what regime will be in power in Teheran with its finger on the trigger. There is a struggle now under way in Iran over exactly that question. The outcome of that struggle is a vital American strategic interest. It must be defined as such, and it must be acted upon as such. 
 If Iran obtains a nuclear bomb and the most radical ayatollahs are in charge there, it will further undermine stability in the Middle East. If Iran obtains nuclear technology and the moderate forces now on the rise there can consolidate their hold on Iranian politics, it is possible that Iran can once again be a bulwark for stability in the region.
It is time the U.S. stopped debating whether to try to bolster the moderate -- yes, moderate -- new Iranian President, Mohammed Khatami, and started thinking about far-reaching ways to strengthen him and the popular forces behind him. Washington should be doing everything it can to encourage U.S.-Iran contacts -- from soccer to diplomatic dialogues to cultural exchanges -- and to lay out a specific road map of what it wants from Iran now, and what Iran could expect in return. It's time for a Nixon-to-China-like, bold U.S.-Iran initiative.
Stopping, or at least slowing down, Iran's acquisition of nuclear technology must remain a top U.S. objective, even if it means sanctioning Russian nuclear-export companies. It is necessary for the stability of the Middle East, but it is not sufficient. If we focus only on preventing Iran from going nuclear by isolating it, without also focusing on who in Iran has his finger on the trigger, we will be making a strategic blunder.
Wake up! Smell the Turkish coffee! The Iranian people stunned Teheran's hard-line leadership last year by rejecting the conservative candidates and electing Mr. Khatami in a landslide, embracing his platform of permitting greater cultural, personal and political freedoms. Ever since then, a low-grade civil war has been under way in Iran between the pro- and anti-Khatami forces.
Last month two senior clergymen on Iran's watchdog Council of Guardians attacked Mr. Khatami for his policies of opening Iran to the world. Two weeks ago Iran's supreme religious guide and chief hard-liner, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, suddenly showed up at Teheran University to address the students in an effort to puncture the huge outpourings of support there for President Khatami. After the Commander of the Revolutionary Guards told a closed meeting of his officers that he would "cut the necks and tongues" of Iran's new liberal press, he was denounced and had to back off his remarks, saying he had been misunderstood.
"The most important forces in Iran today are the students, the women and the middle classes broadly defined," said Shaul Bakhash, an Iran expert at George Mason University. "Those forces, all of which are militating for a more open society and the rule of law, are strengthened today, not weakened, by Iran's economic development and its interaction with the West. The way to strengthen these forces further is by helping Khatami further open Iran internationally and to develop it rapidly."
Nothing would advance American interests in the Middle East more than if this struggle is won by those who want to see Iran become a law-abiding member of the world community. The U.S. cannot bring about an end to Saddam Hussein, or produce a radical Arab-Israeli breakthrough, or really prevent the spread of nuclear technology in the Middle East, without a different Iran. Whether Iran is actually capable of being a pivot of stability is unclear. It needs to be tested. But the potential is there. Unlike elsewhere in the Middle East, Iran is the only country where the people themselves are now leading a genuine movement for change.
For the first time in 20 years, Iran is in play. So let's play.

Yen Continues Its Slide, Threatening Other Asian Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Japanese yen weakened to 140 to the dollar for the first time in seven years yesterday, extending a yearlong decline that is now threatening the economic recovery of the emerging markets in Asia that were battered by their currency devaluations last year.
Despite the fallout from the weakening yen, many currency traders and strategists expect its value to decline further because the Japanese Government has not come up with a convincing program to stimulate the economy. Many economists have already said Japan is in a recession, which could be confirmed Friday when Tokyo is expected to report its second consecutive quarterly decline in growth. 
 Economists and analysts said the falling yen was hurting Asia's recovery in two ways: One, the decline is a reflection of a weakening Japanese economy that means Japan will not be a big buyer of products from the troubled countries of South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
The weakening yen also means South Korean, Thai and other Asian manufacturers will have a harder time competing against Japanese goods sold elsewhere, especially in the United States.
A weakening currency makes that country's products less expensive abroad. But the advantage that South Korea and other Asian countries gained with their devaluations has been reduced by the 18 percent fall in the yen since last July, when the Asian crisis began.
"The competitive edge that South Korea has obtained is minimal," said Desmond Lachman, the head of emerging-markets research at Salomon Smith Barney. And, he said, "If the yen slides toward 150 we can be sure we are going to have real regional currency turmoil."
He said that one important unknown was how the Chinese would react to the yen's weakness. The Chinese said they would not devalue in the wake of the Asian devaluations. But Mr. Lachman said that he believed China's restraint was based on the assumption that the yen would remain relatively stable and not damage China's competitiveness. A Chinese devaluation now could set off another round of devaluations.
The yen's latest decline came after Koji Tanami, Japan's Vice Finance Minister, indicated that finance ministers in the Group of Seven industrialized nations were not going to discuss the yen's problems in Paris today and tomorrow. In addition, Mr. Tanami said it was unlikely that the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada would take action to support the yen.
"The main topic of the meeting will be Russia," he said.
In late trading in New York, the dollar cost 140.71 yen, up from 139.75 Friday. The dollar also rallied against the German mark, rising to 1.7794 marks from 1.7745.
In contrast to its strength against the yen, the dollar had been falling in value against the mark since April.
"There is not a whole lot the G-7 can do for the yen without the Japanese Government providing the policy for support," Mr. Lachman said. Even a surprising round of central bank intervention to support the yen after these comments would only have a temporary impact if Japan's policies are not changed.
Despite a succession of fiscal stimulus programs, the Japanese Government has not yet done enough to stimulate the economy or to deal with the mountain of bad loans that is undermining its banking system, said Jeremy Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston.
"Fundamentally, there is no reason why the yen should strengthen," said Mr. Fand, who is forecasting that the dollar could strengthen to 180 yen in the next 12 months. But he also said that the yen had fallen so much recently that it might be in line for a sharp rebound in the near term before resuming its decline.
The impact of the dollar's strength was also highlighted yesterday in a report by the Bank for International Settlements, which coordinates the activities of the world's central banks. The bank said the dollar was overvalued by 33 percent against the yen and 21 percent against the mark, which makes American exports less competitive and increases the likelihood that the American trade deficit will keep growing.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
The Dow Shifts Gears a Bit, Rising a Modest 31.89 Points

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Major stock market indexes rose modestly yesterday, extending their gains for a third day. Among the leaders were financial services companies, propelled by merger news, and pharmaceutical stocks, lifted by a positive outlook for new drug products.
After soaring more than 167 points on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.89 points yesterday, to 9,069.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.86 points to close at 1,115.72. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 4.85 points, to 1,787.77. The Dow and S.& P. advanced more than 1 percent on Friday. 
 Although investors' current bias seems to be to move prices higher, analysts say, stocks are not expected to gain much ground in the coming weeks as the earning season nears, said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Inc.
Despite the three days of gains, broad market indexes are lower than they were at the beginning of May, with the Dow more than 142 points away from its May 13 closing high of 9,211.84.
Yesterday, corporations offered investors mixed signals about the outlook for the market. On the one hand, merger activity continued at a brisk pace, improving the outlook for corporate profits in several sectors. The Norwest Corporation and Wells Fargo & Company announced plans for a $34 billion merger that would produce the nation's seventh-largest bank. The news helped lift other financial shares like First Union, BankAmerica and Chase Manhattan.
Renaissance Energy, a Canadian oil producer, said it planned to purchase Pinnacle Resources for more than $720 million, and Just For Feet, a sneaker retailer, announced plans to buy the rival Sneaker Stadium for $43 million in assumed debt.
On the other hand, earnings warnings from several companies and other negative news tempered investors' enthusiasm.
Galey & Lord, a denim manufacturer whose customers include Levi Strauss, the Gap retailer, and the designers Calvin Klein, Liz Claiborne and Polo Ralph Lauren warned that fiscal third-quarter earnings would not meet forecasts because of lower sales in the United States and Europe.
Michael R. Harmon, the company's chief financial officer, said that earnings were hurt because denim sales did not pick up as much as expected. In addition, the company also has excess corduroy inventory.
Adding to the weakness in the semiconductor industry, Galileo Technology, an Israeli maker of digital semiconductors, warned that second-quarter revenue could fall 20 to 25 percent because of slowing demand, price declines and product delays. And shares of Premiere Technologies fell more than 26 percent after a BancAmerica Robertson Stephens research analyst reduced second-quarter earnings estimates and questioned whether the telecommunications concern would realize savings this quarter from a recent acquisitions.
Nabisco Holdings, owned by RJR Nabisco announced a sweeping revamping plan yesterday, aimed at saving $100 million a year. But the company warned that the measures could significantly reduce earnings this year.
"What maintains the trading range is that you have earnings estimates that are still too high and are coming down," Mr. Cripps said. "Profits are being squeezed at the margin because of higher costs." However, stocks will continue to move higher because "I don't know where else you put your money," he said.
Near term, however, investors are unlikely to place big bets on stocks, said Andrew Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. Instead, stock prices are likely to tread water this week as investors await the testimony of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, before Congress tomorrow, as well as May retail sales and producer price reports due later this week, he said.

HEADLINE: Fight on Milk Prices Is Making Its Way to Capital

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: CARLISLE, Mass.

 BODY:
Do not be fooled by the virtuous grins on all those celebrities with the white mustaches. The question "Got Milk?" and its corollaries "How much?" and "At what price?" are fueling what economists call the most contentious, most political battle over agricultural policy in the East, if not the nation.
The fight involves Mark Duffy's dairy farm -- the home of cows named Oprah and Cher -- 20 miles northwest of Boston. It has already burst through a score of other statehouses and is expected to flare in the New York Legislature this week. And it will soon play itself out in Washington, pitting East against Midwest, farmers against dairy processors, those who want to preserve farm land against those who want to preserve lower milk prices. 
 The focus of these milk wars is the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a treaty-like agreement among the six New England states. It guarantees their dairy farmers a higher price for milk for drinking than the one dictated under the system the Federal Government has been using to set farmers' milk prices since the Depression. Created by Federal law, the agreement acts something like a regional minimum wage for farmers.
The compact, which went into effect last July, is meant to shore up the region's remaining dairy farms, whose numbers have dropped by nearly half over the last decade to about 4,600. By April, the compact had paid New England farmers a total of $33 million more for their milk than what Federal pricing would have paid them, the commission that runs the compact says.
The price of milk in New England stores, meanwhile, has jumped about a dime or 15 cents a gallon to an average of $2.88, said the commission's executive director, Ken Becker. He figures the compact has cost New England's 13 million residents about $2.50 each since it went into effect.
That seems acceptable to some, but not to opponents of the compact, who include advocates for consumers and the poor, groups of dairy processors who must pay the higher prices and Midwestern farmers, who are worried that if New England's milk production rises and increases the national supply, the prices for milk outside New England will drop.
These opponents say the agreement has fulfilled several of their Economics 101 projections that when the price rises, so does the incentive to produce, thus swelling supplies, while demand drops. New England's production this spring was up by 2.4 percent over 1997, Mr. Becker said, while the national average was up less than 1 percent.
That is another problem because the compact specifies that if New England milk supplies jump disproportionately and the compact is determined to be the cause, the New England states must reimburse the United States Department of Agriculture for buying up the extra supply to keep it from affecting the national market. Already, the compact commission has held back a total of $1 million from farmers.
"This thing has backfired," said John Schnittker, an economist with Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer advocacy group in Washington. "We've got consumers paying more; we've got surplus production; we've got government cost, and the extra revenues the consumers are paying are being directed back into the Federal Treasury. This is a lose-lose-lose policy right now."
The compact's backers, however, say that other factors besides price are at work: El Nino brought bad weather to the West and warmer weather to the East, they say, and the mild winter combined with better feed harvests has increased cows' milk production here.
Mr. Duffy, whose farm in Carlisle is about average for New England in its milking herd size -- 60 cows -- said the compact had brought him $5,570 extra so far, raising his milk receipts by about 3 percent. But he said his production was up because of the mild winter and a good harvest of corn for feed last fall, not because of the price.
"I didn't go out and buy a single cow," Mr. Duffy said. Rather, his family decided to use the extra money to invest in modernizing some stalls and equipment.
Already, the compact commission is working on altering its rules in order to discourage big increases in production and is discussing ways to direct the payments more to small farmers and less to big farms, which already enjoy economies of scale.
"This is a work in progress," said Jay Healy, Massachusetts Commissioner of Food and Agriculture and a backer of the compact for its potential to save disappearing farm land.
The compact has already altered its rules in response to criticism that higher milk prices hurt those who can least afford it. Participants in the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program were compensated for higher milk costs from the start; school lunch programs will be as well, beginning this August.
But the compact will be hard put to compensate for another predictable result: New Englanders are drinking about 2 percent less milk than a year ago, compared with a slight increase in the rest of the country, said E. Linwood Tipton, president of the Milk Industry Foundation, a Washington organization of milk processors, manufacturers and marketers that is leading the charge against the compact.
"There's a word," he said. "It's spelled m-a-r-k-e-t. It actually works and that's what the rest of the dairy industry is living with, and they seem to be surviving and thriving."
The conflict also touches on the question of whether, at a time when the Federal Government is moving away from supporting prices for commodities like corn, wheat and milk, consumers should be asked to help provide American farmers with a new economic safety net. Many see the compact as insurance for farmers as the Federal Government fiddles with its own complex system for pricing milk across the nation. But the dairy compact itself is facing an imminent deadline. Under Federal law, the compact expires next April. Unless it is re-authorized, it dies.
But while the Federal fate of the agreement may be up in the air, other states are jumping on the compact bandwagon.
More than a dozen Southern states, from Tennessee to Texas, have expressed interest in forming a Southern dairy compact, and several of their legislatures have passed laws to that effect.
In the East, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia have passed laws recently seeking to join the existing dairy compact. The Federal law creating the Northeast compact left it open to future participation by New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware but only as contiguous states. The focus of the political fight over the compact has thus shifted to Albany, because if New York does not join, neither can New Jersey and the rest.
The New York State Senate passed a bill calling for the state, with its 9,000 dairy farms, to join this winter, and Gov. George E. Pataki endorsed the idea despite complaints that it helped upstate farmers at the expense of downstate consumers.
But in the Assembly, where the bill's fate is expected to be decided this week, the compact suffered a major blow last month when William Parment, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, withdrew his sponsorship of it.
"I don't know that I want to jump into something that's not well-tested and has the potential for negative impact for both consumers and farmers," Mr. Parment said in a telephone interview.
Andrew Novakovic, director of Cornell University's Program on Dairy Markets and Policy and a leading expert on the dairy industry, said he believed the compact could be made to work.
In his assessment, retail prices have risen only slightly thus far to a level not unusual in other parts of the country, while farmers have gotten a definite lift; but it is worrisome that there are reports of a surplus that can drive prices down elsewhere.
He was gloomy about the compact's prospects for a Federal extension, but then immediately hedged his bet, noting that he had bet his house the compact would never pass in the first place.
"It's good thing nobody took me up on it," he said.

Korean President Sees a Western Cure for Economic Ills

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea told New York business leaders yesterday that his country's once-prized economic miracle was nothing but a "house of cards" and that his people now needed American help to rebuild the economy in a more Western image.
Mr. Kim, a former dissident who assumed the country's highest office in February, lashed out at his predecessors for creating an economy characterized by collusion and corruption. Now, he said, South Korea has turned decisively to democracy and it has opened its borders to foreign investment and trade. 
 "My greatest purpose in coming here," he said, "is to plead with the American Government and businessmen to invest in South Korea, to tell you that we are doing everything we can to open" the economy. He joked with an audience of executives, diplomats and scholars at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, saying, "If each of you today could invest just $100 million, that would be a great help."
Once one of Asia's most successful growth machines, South Korea has been a major victim of the economic turmoil that has swept the region. Last year, the International Monetary Fund arranged a $58 billion rescue package. Since then, the country's foreign currency reserves have rebounded sharply and interest rates have stabilized.
But Seoul is scrambling to find a solution to its huge private-industry debt problems, which have crippled financial institutions and bankrupted several leading conglomerates.
Mr. Kim, who is in his 70's, looked haggard during back-to-back appearances today, beginning with breakfast at the New York Stock Exchange. He walked stiffly and stayed seated during a question period after cutting short his lunchtime speech. Later, he left for Washington, where he will meet with President Clinton and top economic advisers.
But Mr. Kim was energetic in promoting his Government's friendly new attitude toward foreign business. He stressed that he had committed South Korea to open capital markets and relaxed investment rules as the cornerstone of economic recovery.
Many of New York's top business leaders turned out to hear the President's remarks, including Sanford I. Weill, chairman of the Travelers Group; Jon S. Corzine, co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and Maurice R. Greenberg, chairman of the American International Group.
"He said all the right things -- very direct, very positive," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "It will take some time for businesses to respond, but the direction is right on."
Mr. Kim outlined new rules that permit hostile takeovers of Korean companies. Foreign executives can now run South Korean companies and foreign investors can own land on the same terms as Koreans, a first for a country that long maintained one of capitalist Asia's most protectionist economies.
Some critics have contended that Mr. Kim has stalled on a basic economic overhaul and allowed old practices -- including bailouts for the some of the country's biggest countries, instead of allowing them to fail. But the President insisted that he was carrying forward with a "full-scale restructuring."
His recited a list of measures straight out of the International Monetary Fund's guide book: abolish cross-guarantees of debt among related companies; require better disclosure and accounting standards; give shareholders more power; force companies to focus on core businesses rather than peripheral investments.
To emphasize his welcoming attitude toward foreign investment, Mr. Kim said he considered the Dow Chemical Company's decision to build a $1 billion plant in Malaysia instead of South Korea a "serious mistake," adding that his Government would not allow bureaucratic resistance to derail important foreign investments in the future.

South Korean Recovery: A Mixed but Gloomy Picture

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
Six months after Koreans elected Kim Dae Jung as President, economic pain is mounting with few signs of a turnaround in sight.
Output has fallen even more sharply than predicted -- 3.8 percent in the first quarter, while unemployment has outstripped economists' forecasts, reaching 6.7 percent at the end of April. 
 The situation is likely to get worse before it gets better, most analysts believe. "They're breaking with a social contract that's been in place the last 40 years," said Linda Tsao Yang, the United States representative to the Asian Development Bank. "It's going to be painful."
Still, some discern seeds of growth. "The process of growth is probably already under way," said the United States Ambassador here, Stephen W. Bosworth. "It's just overwhelmed by the more visible pain of restructuring."
Mr. Bosworth and others say anyone who anticipated an overnight transformation was simply unrealistic. "I think we built expectations too high, and when you do that, you are sure to disappoint," said You Jong Keun, governor of North Cholla province and economic adviser to President Kim. "We could not have moved any faster."
The International Monetary Fund, which provided $58 billion in December to stave off Korean default, still claims South Korea as its star pupil in Asia and says that the Government is ahead of schedule on many required changes.
"What you're seeing is the first stages of restructuring in the financial system and the corporations, and those reforms are going to have a negative impact," said John Dodsworth, senior resident representative of the I.M.F. here. "At least in the next few months, they could be quite disruptive."
The banking system's bad debts have continued to rise as debt-laden South Korean corporations continue to borrow. And many of the chaebol, the sprawling conglomerates that dominate the economic landscape here and are widely blamed for South Korea's structural woes, seem determined to continue doing business as usual.
By one measure, companies are paying a total of $6 billion a month to service their debts, an amount equal on an annual basis to more than half the nation's export income last year. Asset sales, which would help eliminate debt, have been sporadic.
The foreign investors that South Korea so desperately needs apparently still need to be convinced that the reforms under way are substantial. But because the Government of President Kim, a former political prisoner, is determined to act in a democratic fashion, its ability to enforce change in private business is limited.
The Government cannot, for example, force the banks to make more rational lending decisions or order the conglomerates to sell their assets, as it could in the past.
"Our role has been reduced to that of a referee," said Hyun Oh Seok, general director of economic policy at the Finance and Economy Ministry. "The Government sets up the rules, but others are the players."
And although officials bulldozed virtually the last remaining barrier to foreign investment last month, foreigners greeted the news by pulling so much money out of the stock market that it hit an 11-year low. The market has since recovered somewhat, but remains shaky.
External factors beyond the Government's control have complicated matters, particularly the decline in the value of the Japanese yen against the dollar, and the weakness of the Japanese economy. Concerns like Samsung Electronics, Daewoo and Pohang Iron and Steel compete head to head with Japanese companies, and the cheaper yen means much stiffer competition. The Japanese market is also less able to absorb Korean goods.
The yen's decline has made many aware of the soft underbelly of Korea's surging trade surplus -- the hard-currency flow that keeps Korea's foreign-exchange coffers full.
South Korea's trade surplus is due more to a precipitous drop in imports than to increased demand for its products abroad. The fall in imports has investors worried because it means that business at home is suffering badly. Companies have not been importing the raw material, components and machinery they need, largely because modest size businesses have had difficulty finding financing.
"Many small and medium-sized companies that are doing well are going down because banks are rushing to recall their loans or they don't have access to the credit needed to do business," said Yoon Young Mo, international secretary of the Korea Federation of Trade Unions, the more militant of the nation's two labor groupings.
Although there are signs that the credit shortage is starting to abate, it has already put hundreds of thousands of people out of work. The country's 30 large conglomerates get most attention when it comes to labor issues, but they employ only about 5 percent of the work force and have thus far not resorted to sweeping layoffs.
Workers and small-company owners have borne the brunt of the restructuring, not the conglomerates for which the changes were intended. "Despite the fact that everyone is calling for reform in the chaebol system, what is happening is that because so many small and midsized companies are going under, the Government is rushing to prop up the conglomerates to avoid making the situation even worse," Mr. Yoon said.
The Government says that the conglomerates are in fact restructuring but that the process is exceedingly slow. Foreign companies have been buying their Korean counterparts' stakes in joint ventures, but only a handful of outright asset sales have taken place.
These include the recent sale of the Hanwha group's power-plant operations to the AES Corporation of the United States for $874 million, the highest price paid so far for a Korean asset.
 The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company intends to invest $1 billion in Korea Life, giving it as much as 60 percent of the privately held insurer, the companies said on Monday.
 Also on Monday, Reuters and Bloomberg News reported, Samsung Heavy Industries said it had signed a contract to sell its forklift truck business to Clark Material Handling of the United States for $30 million. This follows the sale early in May of Samsung's construction operations to Volvo for $720 million.
The practice of "cooperative financing" -- loans and loan extensions offered by bankers to big companies that would otherwise go bust -- continues with little apparent slackening. The practice has delayed corporate restructuring by giving otherwise insolvent companies a new lease on life and added to the woes of the banking system. Although Government officials have declared that such loans would stop, $600 million in new loans were granted last month to the Dong Ah group, raising fresh doubt about Seoul's commitment to banking reform.
No one is sure how vast the pool of nonperforming loans is. Mr. Hyun of the Finance Ministry conceded that raising enough money to cover potential bad loans would be an uphill battle. But action on this and other structural issues is necessary for the economy to recover, many analysts say.
"Now that the reform process has begun, investors are beginning to look more closely on a micro level as to precisely what changes are taking place," Ms. Yang, the American delegate to the Asian Development Bank, said. "They'll have to see those changes before they're convinced."

HEADLINE: At Drug Summit, Clinton Asks Nations to Set Aside Blame

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 8

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that the debate over who bears responsibility for the world's drug problems has gone on too long and called for drug-producing and consuming countries to cooperate in stanching the supply and demand for illegal drugs.
Addressing a special summit-level session of the General Assembly convened to discuss ways to counter drug trafficking and use, Mr. Clinton said that pointing fingers has not advanced the fight against drugs. 
 "It does not dismantle a single cartel, help a single addict, prevent a single child from trying and perhaps dying from heroin," Mr. Clinton said.
President Clinton said the lines between countries that produce, transit and consume drugs have blurred. "Drugs are every nation's problem, and every nation must act to fight them," he said.
But Mr. Clinton heard a blunt rejoinder from President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, who is still fuming over an American undercover operation that led to the indictment of 26 Mexican bankers last month on charges of laundering more than $110 million in drug profits. Mexican officials were not informed of the investigation, apparently for fear that it would jeopardize the plan and the safety of American agents inside Mexico.
President Zedillo said today that all countries share the same rights and obligations to fight drug trafficking. "We all must respect the sovereignty of each nation so that no one becomes a judge of others, so that no one feels entitled to violate other countries' laws for the sake of enforcing its own," he said.
While a overwhelming part of the world's demand for drugs comes from "countries with the largest economic capacity," Mr. Zedillo said, "the human, social and institutional costs in meeting such demands is paid for by the producing and transit countries.
"It is our men and women who die first in combatting drug trafficking," he said. "It is our communities that are first to suffer from violence, our institutions that are first to be undermined by corruption. It is our governments that are the first to have to shift valuable resources needed to fight poverty to serve as the first bulwark in this war."
Later this afternoon, President Clinton met privately with President Zedillo, and the two agreed to improve cooperation and communication and to strengthen ways to deal with drugs trafficking and money laundering. But the communique released after their 25-minute meeting gave no indication that the dispute over the sting operation was resolved.
The President of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, said the problem was rooted in the law of supply and demand. "The demand is what makes the existence of the market possible," he said, explaining that the illegal trade it creates is highly profitable and attractive.
He cited an intelligence estimate that 33 percent of the drugs smuggled into the United States from South America passes through the Caribbean, and 15 percent through the island of Hispanola, which his country shares with Haiti.
Prominent among voices pressing to reduce demand was Britain's Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, who spoke on behalf of the European Union. "It is no use stopping opium cultivation in one place just to see more grown elsewhere," Mr. Prescott said. "We gain nothing by closing one trafficking route to see another opened."
President Jacques Chirac of France urged a counterattack on every front. "Drug elimination cannot be left to a single category of country, whether it be producer or consumer," Mr. Chirac said. "Supply and demand must be reduced simultaneously."
Mr. Clinton said his Administration would request more than $17 billion in the next Federal budget to fight drugs, $6 billion of which will be earmarked to reduce demand.
Announcing several smaller steps, he said he would ask Congress to extend a new advertising campaign to discourage children from using drugs. The program got under way last fall with an initial $195 million budget, but Mr. Clinton promised to expand this to a $2 billion campaign through 2002, with part of the money donated by the private sector.
He also said the Government would create a "virtual university" on the Internet to make available drug prevention and treatment videotapes and will launch an international training course in New Mexico next month on reducing the demand for drugs.
The General Assembly session on reducing production, trafficking and use of illegal drugs, the first in 10 years to be devoted entirely to the subject, was initially proposed by Mexico, which has become a transit route for more than half of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.
Representatives of 150 countries, from presidents to government ministers and other senior officials, are scheduled to speak before the special session ends on Wednesday, with a joint declaration pledging to drastically reduce the demand for drugs worldwide in 10 years.
So far, the speakers have made clear that legalizing drugs will not become an option. "There will always be those who are ready to throw in the towel," Mr. Annan said in his remarks opening the special session. "But we must never give in to the human toll illegal drugs are taking on our societies.
Secretary General Kofi Annan estimated that 21 million "victims" around the world abused cocaine and heroin and 30 million abused amphetamine-type stimulants.

HEADLINE: Intel Case Gives Antitrust Law a New Twist

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
The antitrust laws are designed to protect an industry from monopolists that use predatory or other illegal tactics to extinguish rivals. The odd feature of the antitrust complaint brought yesterday by the Federal Trade Commission is that it accused Intel of victimizing putative rivals that are also customers.
In separate instances involving the Intergraph Corporation, the Compaq Computer Company and the Digital Equipment Corporation, the Intel Corporation is accused of withholding technical data about its processors from companies that were designing computers around Intel chips. 
 What will make the Government's case difficult is that only one of those companies -- Digital -- ever seriously competed with Intel. What is more, the information that Intel freely acknowledges it withheld from those companies may have had no direct bearing on competition in the chip industry.
The question, antitrust experts agree, is whether the commission can create a strong factual case for its accusations. Given the oddity of the charges, that task will not be easy.
Intel controls more than 80 percent of the market for the microprocessor brains of computers. When it designs a new chip, Intel gives advance information to its customers -- computer manufacturers -- to give them time to design new machines that will run the next generation of Intel's processors.
Intel acknowledges that it withheld vital information from Intergraph, Digital and Compaq, with which it was engaged in continuing patent disputes, but it says that it was not about to share intellectual property with customers that were suing it over intellectual property.
The company argues that it is not compelled by the antitrust laws to disclose proprietary information to customers that could exploit that information in subsequent patent disputes.
The commission says that while the three companies may have indeed been customers, they were also rivals and that it is illegal for a monopolist to exploit its market power to force them to cave into Intel's patent demands.
Intel insists that its hardball tactics were in pursuit of business objectives that were perfectly legitimate.
The dispute with Intergraph, for example, was a negotiation between buyer and seller. Intel wanted a free license to use Intergraph's chip technology. Integraph wanted proprietary information. Intel asserts that the Government has no business intruding on this negotiation.
Carl Shapiro, an economics consultant to Intel from the University of California at Berkeley, acknowledges that there may be areas of rivalry -- Digital, for example, produces a microprocessor that competes with Intel's Pentium chips in a very limited market -- but argues that the behavior under challenge by the commission is overwhelmingly limited to the relationship between the chip maker and its customers.
William Baer, the director of the trade commission's Bureau of Competition, says that it is unlawful for monopolists to injure rivals without an efficiency-enhancing business justification -- for instance, resulting in lower prices or superior products.
In fact, Mr. Baer says, Intel's decision to punish the three manufacturers was done only to compel the companies to settle their patent dispute on Intel's terms.
But to win its case, the commission must show that Intel not only hurt rivals, if any of the three companies are in fact rivals, but that it also hurt competition within the microchip industry.
That could mean proving that Intel's behavior drove its rivals into extinction. It could mean showing that Intel's behavior persuaded rivals to spend less on research and development, thereby undermining their ability to innovate as fast as Intel. Or it could mean showing that Intel's behavior convinced actual and potential chip makers that they could not survive because any computer company that needed to do business with Intel would be punished if it also bought chips from Intel's rivals.
In one respect, the trade commission's case mirrors the suit the Justice Department filed last month against the Microsoft Corporation. In that case, the Government pointed to cross-marketing and other exclusionary contracts between Microsoft and its partners that would be perfectly legal by nearly any other company. But Justice Department lawyers argue, with ample precedent, that those same tactics are illegal when used by a monopolist to shut its rivals out of a market.
Likewise, the commission is saying that Intel's refusal to do business in the midst of a legal dispute would be perfectly legal in nearly any other context but that the same tactic is not legal when embraced by a monopolist seeking to drive potential competitors out of contention.
The difference between the two cases will lie in facts, not theory. In the Microsoft case, the Government is offering evidence that the software giant's contracts directly affected actual competitors.
The trade commission, on the other hand, may be relegated to proving a counterfact: that Intel drove away potential competition. That is a hard case to win, especially when only one of the three alleged victims was ever a significant competitor in any sense of the word and all are among Intel's biggest and best customers.

HEADLINE: Sinn Fein Enters Campaign For New Ulster Assembly

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, June 8

 BODY:
The campaign for the new Northern Ireland Assembly began in earnest today as Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, abandoned its traditional policy and announced formally that it would field candidates even though the assembly is almost certain to have a Protestant unionist majority.
Sinn Fein, a predominantly Roman Catholic party, had said until two months ago that it would never take part in the new assembly, which is being set up under the Northern Ireland peace agreement approved in referendums on May 22 here and in the Irish Republic. 
 The 108-member assembly, to be elected on June 25, is to return this predominantly Protestant British province to self-government and to set up a body in which the North and the Irish Republic will cooperate. The British Government took direct control of the province's government during sectarian disorders in 1972.
The new peace accord is intended to change Northern Ireland politics, giving minority Catholics a fairer share of power and giving the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic added influence in Northern affairs.
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, began the campaign by warning that the entire peace effort could be disrupted again by violence provoked by Protestant patriotic parades through resentful Catholic neighborhoods. The parades, celebrating a Protestant victory over Catholic forces in 1690, have led to clashes with the police and costly vandalism. The parade season reaches its peak early next month.
Mr. Adams, at a news conference, referred to Catholic hopes, saying: "Following the events of the last year, the expectations among nationalists is that these parades should be banned and that nationalists' rights should be upheld. If we are to avert a major crisis in the coming weeks then the Irish and British Governments need to move now to resolve the situation."
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, said, "I think if we all, after the Assembly elections, do everything we can to make sure that the parades pass less violently this year we have a chance in Northern Ireland that hasn't been seen for many, many years."
The chance, Ms. Mowlam meant, was for an increase in foreign investments in the North. She spoke as she met Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, who is leading a group of 17 American executives on a tour of Ulster and the Irish Republic.
"I don't think there is any question that violence and support of violence by political people or organizations would go a long way to dissuade companies from investing," Mr. Daley said. "Every day the guns are silent, business confidence goes up."
About 100 American companies operate in Northern Ireland, and 500 in the Irish Republic.
The largest Protestant group, the Ulster Unionist Party, also began its campaign today. Its leader, David Trimble, alluding to a volatile issues that the Assembly will face, said it would be several months after the election before the Assembly would form a government.
Another issue that the Assembly will wrestle with is whether Mr. Adams will be made a Cabinet minister. He is almost sure to be eligible under the election rules apportioning power in the Assembly.
The prospect pleases most Catholics and angers many Protestants, who still see him as the mouthpiece for the I.R.A. In the campaign Sinn Fein will be competing for the Catholic vote with the Social Democratic Labor Party of John Hume. In recent elections Sinn Fein has become the third-strongest party in the province, behind the Ulster Unionists and the Social Democrats, but ahead of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian Paisley.

HEADLINE: Is the Music Live? Probably Not;
A Guitarist (Free This Saturday) Loses Gigs to Deejays

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
With a nod to the audience, Jeff Ausfahl got ready to play. As gigs go, the crowd was awfully young. Appropriately, he began with "I'm Popeye the Sailor Man."
The hubbub of chatter stopped. As Mr. Ausfahl strummed his guitar, the roisterous kindergartners at Public School 114 in the Bronx lifted their faces in delight. Accompanying him were Brian Grice on the drums and Sue Terry on the flute. They performed an Aesop fable set to music, distributing maracas for the children to shake along. 
 Between songs, they taught the rudiments of their instruments. (What's a guitar made of? How many strings does it have?)
"It's a far cry from a real gig, huh?" Mr. Ausfahl said as the children filed out. "Isn't the club date business great?"
Such is the sharply altered shape of the musician's life in a world more in thrall to canned music than live.
Jeff Ausfahl has played the guitar professionally for 25 years. He is what is known as a club date musician, who primarily performs at single engagements like weddings and private parties. A highly malleable guitarist, he can play everything from dance to rock to classical to merengue to polkas. He plays songs of contagious cheer and songs with a lot of ache in them, though he no longer gets to perform anywhere as much as he would like to.
That is why, at 43, Mr. Ausfahl finds himself doing about 75 gigs a year in front of schoolchildren, arranged through Music Outreach, a nonprofit outfit that puts on music demonstrations in public schools in New York. The audience is highly appreciative. He needs the work.
There has been an evolving decline in jobs for live musicians, caught in the undertow of disk jockeys spinning CD's on much improved sound systems and a more thrift-minded economy. Local 802, the New York chapter of the American Federation of Musicians, to which Mr. Ausfahl belongs, says union club dates in the city have tumbled to about 6,000 a year from as many as 15,000 15 years ago. The union reports that the bar mitzvah business and lower-end weddings have been almost totally lost to deejays, who generally cost a fraction of what a band does. Far fewer musicians find themselves able to play full time anymore. Many teach. And it has become axiomatic among union musicians that they must accept nonunion jobs to eat, a practice the union tolerates.
It is not strictly economics that has brought on this state of affairs. Many people do not want to hear someone who sounds like Bruce Springsteen or Elton John. They want Bruce Springsteen or Elton John, even if he is coming out of a box.
One can sometimes go to a $200-a-plate dinner today and be entertained by a music system. Years ago, the size of the band was a mark of the status of an event. The work was so copious that it was hard to find enough musicians. Bands enlisted "phantoms," nonplayers who simply held instruments to swell the size of the band. Saxophone players were known to pick up violins and apply soap to the bows so no sound would emerge as they "played."
These days, musicians have come to feel like very expensive bottles of wine, tasted less and less often.
It was a languid Monday void of gigs, and Mr. Ausfahl was working on the attic of the tidy Teaneck, N.J., house that he shares with his wife, Janet, and a parakeet named Henry. Mr. Ausfahl is a sinewy, genial man with longish hair and sharply chiseled features.
"I did a wedding yesterday with just a flutist," he said ruefully. "We played just the ceremony. When we left, the deejay started."
The subject of deejays causes him to snort with indignation. Brusquely, he said: "It does bug me. It bugs a lot of people. I'm not mad at anyone. I just want to make a living. You know, it started out that the records were to sound like the bands. Then it got to where the bands were supposed to sound like the records. Now they just need the records."
Ten years ago, Mr. Ausfahl played 250 to 300 club dates a year. These days he is lucky to get 100, plus his school jobs. His single biggest source of work is Lester Lanin Orchestras, the society band group. "I also work for his competitors," Mr. Ausfahl said. "I have to."
His year of greatest income was 1993, when he made about $60,000. The next year, he earned less than half that, but lately he has rebounded to about $40,000 a year. "I had some 10 years or so where I would be idle at most one or two Saturday nights," he said. "Now I'm idle 20 or more Saturdays."
He never imagined this constricted condition when he embarked on his free-form career. He was born in Peoria, Ill., where his father was a factory manager for Caterpillar, the tractor maker. Mr. Ausfahl started guitar lessons when he was 10. At 13, he was playing in a band at school sock hops. "When you're young, you want to find your self-worth somewhere," he said. "I tried a bunch of things and I was good at this."
He eventually received a degree from Berklee College of Music in Boston, after several interruptions. For a spell, he played rock music at bars and Holiday Inn lounges. For eight months in 1975, he joined a band in Chicago called Even Steven. The musicians wore silver satin suits and played soul music. One summer, he journeyed to Virginia Beach, Va., and played military bases and wet T-shirt contests.
In 1979, he drove from Boston to New York. He knew no one. He thumbed through the Yellow Pages to "Bands & Orchestras" and began dialing numbers. Some places hung up on him. Others invited him in for a tryout. One contractor asked him if he was free Saturday. He was free indefinitely. "Put yourself down," the man told him. "You've got two weddings." He picked up a third later the same week. Within a year, he was subbing in Broadway plays. He felt good about his footloose choice of career.
Mr. Ausfahl now regards himself as one of the car mechanics of the music business, someone who can be relied on to do solid, reliable work. "The way my career turned out, I'm not George Benson," he said. "I'm not a star. But I can really play."
He has never recorded his own album, though he has been on a few bootleg records. In the past, he appeared at many familiar New York nightclubs like CBGB and the Bitter End, but he has forsaken that scene.
"It's totally not lucrative," he said. "They think you should work for a piece of the door because of the exposure and then their guy counts the door and you never seem to get what you should. You're better off staying in your basement."
He went on: "At Christmas time, company parties were insane years ago. No more. I used to do a lot of industrial jobs -- I.B.M. sales conferences and stuff. They've all cut back." He performed at a fair number of debutante balls, but they have dried up, too. "The ones I do," he said, "instead of a parade of girls, I see six." Another nearly defunct source of steady work is songwriter demos. These days they tend to be done on a computer in a home studio.
Work used to flow worldwide. "Once I was playing a party north of London," he recalled, "and the bass player nudged me and pointed out that there was the Queen." Nowadays, he travels very little.
He considers himself hard-boiled about social trends, but he has made adjustments. He had done some music teaching, but doesn't much care for it. He took classical guitar lessons and has been picking up more classical and jazz gigs at restaurants and parties. "Instead of working with bands, I find myself playing solo classical," he said. "The trouble is, when you play solo dates, you're living wallpaper."
Within reason, he will take whatever comes along. He has a steady Friday night gig at a university club, where he plays swing and dance music and also sings. Once he played a divorce. A man was so elated when his divorce papers were signed that he threw a party. In exchange for a free checkup, he recorded a song written by his dentist to be entered in a contest to anoint a state song for New Jersey. (It lost.)
He did a funeral in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. In her will, a woman specified that a Dixieland band was to play at her final appearance. Mr. Ausfahl was among the musicians hired to fulfill her wish. As the coffin was carried out of the church, they struck up some slower Dixieland numbers like "Just a Closer Walk With Thee." A weeping woman came up to Mr. Ausfahl and sobbed, "Mother would have loved it."
Saturday parties pay about $200 (weekdays are about $170), and if he leads the band, it's $100 more. There is a $10 bonus if he lugs along his own amplifier, which he always does. When he plays solo guitar in a restaurant, he has trouble getting more than $125. A jazz club pays him no more than $50 to $75. In these days of depleted jobs, fees can get insulting. Not long ago, Mr. Ausfahl rebuffed an offer to play jazz in a prison in Albany for $80.
He finds it hard to comprehend why more people do not insist on live music. "To me the difference between a record and live music is night and day," he said. "When you play in a band and it all works right, it's like floating on a cloud."
The splendiferous Bedens Brook Club lies at the end of a curving road in Skillman, N.J., on the outskirts of Princeton. On a recent Thursday evening, the Princeton class of 1953 had gathered for a reunion dinner and dance. Don Anderson, a grizzled, 67-year-old band leader and piano player, had hired Mr. Ausfahl and three others to provide the evening's entertainment.
The elder classmates moved peristaltically across the floor, most of the men in their Princeton orange sport jackets. The band members were in black tie. The bass player, Michael Battiston, said, "I feel like a piece of dirt in a glass of orange juice."
Mr. Anderson spelled out his plan for the evening: "We'll play some stuff here. If nothing happens, we may assault them." "Assault" meant they would stroll from table to table and play.
As the cocktail chatter proceeded, the band stayed with background music, beginning with two Princeton songs. A woman strutted over and asked Mr. Anderson to tone it down; it was hard to talk over the music. "Ah, they love us," Mr. Ausfahl said.
He gazed at the crowd. "We're talking people in their late 60's," he said. "This seems to be what I get. I don't get the young groups anymore."
On they played: "East of the Sun," "Anna," "Blue Moon." Mr. Anderson sang "New York, New York," sounding not even like the treasurer of the board.
Mr. Ausfahl did a solo, and a woman stopped by to coo: "He can just do that all night long. I'm going to take someone like you home with me."
Mr. Anderson quickly handed her a business card. "I don't want to be pushy," he said, "but this is what we have to do." When she had gone, he said, "One year, in 1986, I grossed $400,000. Now I can do maybe a 10th of that."
Mr. Anderson strapped on his accordion and announced that they were going to stroll.
Mr. Ausfahl looked stricken. He abhors strolling. He is not much for repartee with the audience. When you stroll, people get up to sing -- often in unknown keys -- and won't sit down. One table requests a popular song like "Memory" and then all the other tables request it. You wind up playing it 25 times.
Here, it was the same Princeton standard that everyone wanted: "Going Back to Nassau Hall."
After dinner had been ingested, the band got heavy into dance songs. The alchemy was just right, and they were clicking. The reunion-goers rose from their chairs. Good drink had oiled reluctant limbs.
Even as the evening waned, the floor was seething with dancers. The musicians had smiles on their faces. By no means was Jeff Ausfahl wallpaper tonight. He was making music.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expresses Support for NATO Action to Halt Serb Attacks

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The United States said today that it would support a British resolution in the United Nations to authorize a NATO military intervention in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, and that Washington would press NATO to speed up planning for such an action.
American officials said that military action is not imminent, and that Washington would act only through NATO. But they said that a credible threat of such action is an important part of NATO strategy to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to end his army's attacks on civilians in Kosovo. 
 The national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said early today that American military intervention "is not something that is on the table." But American officials said later that he meant that unilateral American action is not being considered, and that military planning would be left to NATO.
Today the United States joined the European Union in imposing a ban on new investment in Serbia and a freeze on Yugoslav and Serbian government assets abroad. Washington and the European Union, pressed by Britain, acted after a continuing crackdown by Serbian special police and Yugoslav Army units in Kosovo that has caused at least 250 deaths, driven at least 10,000 ethnic Albanians into Albania and displaced tens of thousands of other people.
The sanctions were approved last month but were suspended at Washington's request when President Milosevic agreed to open talks with Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
After a first round of talks, however, Mr. Milosevic began his crackdown, aimed at defeating guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army and creating a cordon near the Albanian border to prevent infiltration of arms and recruits into Kosovo. Mr. Rugova and his team said they could not continue the talks while the violence continued because it would undermine their credibility and their search for a negotiated solution.
Regarding the United States decision to approve the sanctions, James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said today: "In the light of the indiscriminate use of violence over the last two weeks, and the way such violence has undermined the basis for talks, we are proceeding to implement these bans while calling on both sides to continue the talks."
The investment ban will hurt Mr. Milosevic because he depends on the sale of state industries to finance his Government, Western officials said. Government credit for private companies to invest in Serbia was already banned. The asset freeze is largely symbolic, since Belgrade has few assets abroad. But it will also serve as a disincentive for future investments, because it will mean that Belgrade cannot open bank accounts overseas. Both the European Union and American officials said they were ready to consider other sanctions and measures.
The 15 nations of the European Union acted first today, when foreign ministers agreed to put the sanctions in place and called on the United Nations and NATO to consider authorizing military action to force Mr. Milosevic and Serbia to stop its attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, where they make up 90 percent of a population of about two million.
Given that Kosovo is internationally recognized as a part of Serbia -- unlike Bosnia, which was recognized as independent -- Western officials believe that a Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force would be necessary. The resolution would come under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which allows intervention to deal with a threat to international peace and security, the same authority used in the war with Iraq. The British are consulting key countries on a draft of a resolution, American officials said. All key Western countries are working to persuade Russia, which has a veto and is a traditional Serb ally, to go along.
Russia, fearing the precedent that an independent Kosovo could set for Chechnya and other restless parts of the Russian Federation, is very sensitive to any suggestion of Western backing for Kosovo independence.
In Bonn tonight, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was expected to try to persuade the visiting Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to agree to the resolution, which would serve as a strong deterrent to Mr. Milosevic.
That effort will continue when senior officials of the so-called contact group -- the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia -- meet in Paris on Wednesday. The NATO defense ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday.
The defense ministers could authorize planning for air strikes against targets in Serbia, a NATO diplomat said, in addition to working on plans for "preventive deployments" around Kosovo to try to prevent the fighting from spreading.
Mr. Milosevic's crackdown has served to accelerate the recruiting efforts of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which draws many of its members from among ethnic Albanians in Germany and Switzerland.
"With every day he makes the mistake of using force rather than finding the wisdom to negotiate, Milosevic becomes the membership chairman" of the K.L.A., Mr. Rubin said today, "because he continues to push the people of Kosovo into a more extremist posture than they would otherwise be."
Under the pressure of the K.L.A.'s popularity, even Mr. Rugova advocates independence for Kosovo, while Washington and the West favor only more political autonomy for the province within a federal Yugoslavia. But the federal Yugoslavia is already breaking apart, with Mr. Milosevic having driven Montenegro into virtual independence and Kosovo rising in rebellion.

Diplomats Report Devastation
 DECANI, Yugoslavia, June 8 (AP) -- Devastation reminiscent of wartime Bosnia greeted diplomats allowed into western Kosovo on Sunday, they said today.
The region has been sealed off by Serbia, and it was the first look for outsiders since the latest Serbian campaign began. The diplomats saw charred ruins everywhere -- but few people, except for armed Serb policemen. "What we've seen is all sorrow, all grief," said the Dutch Ambassador, Jan Sizoo.

HEADLINE: Lively Council Race in Newark Pits Experience Against New Blood

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 8

 BODY:
Runoff elections rarely set pulses racing. But the one being played out Tuesday in Newark's Central Ward may prove the exception.
The race for the City Council seat from the neighborhood that was ground zero in Newark's 1967 riots and the setting for rebuilding in the last 15 years, is between a veteran politician and a 29-year-old newcomer with Ivy League and Oxford credentials. As New Jersey's largest city continues its steady struggle back from the turmoil of the late 1960's, the Central Ward contest is not just about young versus old and outsider versus insider, but about the glitter of things hoped for against the solidity of things known. 
 The passion excited by the election was evident after a candidates' forum last week, when Darlene Parker argued with a neighbor about the merits of one candidate, George Branch, a 69-year-old, four-term incumbent. Mr. Branch had, by virtue of his experience and his quiet but constant presence in the ward, earned re-election, she said. He had paid his dues, she went on, and this country ought to respect such people.
But her debating partner, DeTwayne Holmes, retorted that Mr. Branch's 29-year-old opponent, Cory Booker, had impressive educational credentials: Stanford University, Oxford University, Yale Law School. Mr. Holmes said he saw Mr. Booker as just the kind of "young, innovative, educated" candidate that the now resurgent ward and city needed. "We need new blood," he stressed.
Tuesday's runoff was forced by the May 12 municipal election, in which no candidate in a three-way race attained a majority in the Central Ward voting. Mr. Branch finished 340 votes ahead of Mr. Booker, out of 7,700 votes cast.
In terms of its energy level alone, the runoff shows a new fervor about politics and the city's future among the ward's 27,000 registered voters.
"It's to Newark's credit that there is this runoff," said Raymond Codey, director of development for the New Community Corporation, a nonprofit housing and economic development group in the Central Ward. "Residents didn't just vote for the older guy, but are intelligently evaluating the candidates. It speaks well for Newark that we can attract a candidate like Cory Booker and give residents this kind of choice."
Tuesday's ballot also features a runoff in the West Ward and a runoff among eight candidates for four at-large seats on the City Council.
But Mr. Booker's presence in the Central Ward race has generated the most interest. He could have been sent by central casting to typify a product of the black middle class who grew up in an era of integration and civil rights gains. A cum laude graduate of Stanford University, a Rhodes scholar and 1996 graduate of Yale Law School, he was raised in Bergen County's affluent Harrington Park, where his family had to invoke anti-discrimination laws to buy their home. His only early connection to Newark was through an uncle who lived and practiced dentistry here.
Then, two years ago, he moved to Newark with a fellowship to do legal work for the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, a nonprofit group. He says he soon saw politics as a surer route to change. Through school contacts, he had entree to city corporate and business leaders. Soon his name was on all their lips as someone who bore watching, and that buzz, as much as anything else, placed him as a new star in the city's political firmament.
"I picked a community which was in incredible distress and which at the same time had amazing human beings," Mr. Booker said, in explaining why he chose to come to Newark and to run in the city's Central Ward. "I'm in the top 1 percent educationally of this nation -- black or white -- and I have been taught that to he who much is given, much is expected."
Mr. Booker has raised and spent more than $140,000 so far, an extraordinary amount for a Council race in Newark, which rarely sees more than $50,000 spent. Much of it was raised from a network of friends and associates from Stanford, Oxford and Yale.
Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, who is supporting Mr. Branch, has styled the Central Ward contest as a race between the Rhodes scholar and the "road scholar" in an effort to burnish Mr. Branch's street smarts and long service in the city.
Mr. Branch, a former youth coordinator with the Newark Housing and Redevelopment Authority, is also a former lightweight boxer who amassed a professional record of 28-8. They were mostly decisions, he said in a recent interview, noting that he patterned himself after Sugar Ray Robinson, and was not a flashy knockout artist.
This style has characterized his political career as well, say supporters like the Rev. Jason Guice, pastor of Hopewell Baptist Church. Mr. Branch played a role in making sure that the privately financed, middle-income town houses of Society Hill/ University Heights got built and was one of the first buyers, Mr. Guice noted. He also helped bring about the construction of apartments by church-sponsored nonprofit groups and town houses by the city's housing authority, Mr. Guice said.
In addition, he has performed the traditional constituent service in solving problems for the elderly, helping start youth programs and getting homeowner tax abatements. "He has been there, and that is why the ministers of the Central Ward are supporting him," Mr. Guice said.
By most accounts, Mr. Branch and his supporters were lackadaisical before the vote on May 12. But by the end of last week, Mr. Branch had raised and spent more than $100,000 himself in an effort to beat back the challenge in the runoff.
Now, Mr. Branch and his supporters are pressing hard to stick the "outsider" label on Mr. Booker, as well as tie him to downtown and business interests whom they deride for having moved many of their operations, and in some cases their residences, from Newark to the suburbs.
The Rev. Jonah Nixon, vice chairman of the Newark North Jersey Committee of Black Churchmen, said that these unnamed interests now want to return and reclaim a prominent place in the city, as it seems to be rebounding with such amenities as the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
"Those who have deserted the city would like to come back, and these are the people who are supporting Cory Booker and giving him most of his money," Mr. Nixon said.
While Mr. Booker and his backers do claim the support of business leaders who have holdings in Newark but live elsewhere, they brand as ridiculous suggestions that they are his only supporters.
Mr. Booker's claim of broader support is borne out in part by the results of the May 12 election. Mr. Branch won most of the middle-income, homeowner areas and precincts with large numbers of elderly people, if only by slim margins. But it was Mr. Booker who won the poorer areas dominated by the city's last remaining high-rise public housing complexes.
Ms. Parker and Mr. Holmes never resolved their own debate.
"Newark is not moving as fast as it could," Mr. Holmes said. "We need young people, educated people with vibrant new ideas."
Ms. Parker shot back, "Education is not enough by itself. You can be an educated fool, you know."

HEADLINE: Of Ill Mothers, 36% Are Held Able to Work

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
After evaluating hundreds of disabled welfare mothers for a new city workfare program, officials at four nonprofit agencies said yesterday that most of the women could not work because they were too ill, had to care for disabled children or lacked enough interest in the program.
Of the 410 mothers screened on Saturday, only 36 percent will be considered for the work program, the officials said. The agencies will continue to interview disabled women over the coming months for the program, which is Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's newest welfare initiative. But while the officials stressed the importance of the project to the mothers who will participate, they now have doubts about how many will. 
 "I don't think there are going to be as many people participating as we had thought," said Linda Turner, director of rehabilitation services at Goodwill Industries of Greater New York. "There's a significant percentage of these folks that are quite seriously disabled."
The preliminary reports from the agency officials came yesterday as city officials and advocates for the poor fiercely debated the value of the new program, which will require disabled welfare mothers to work in jobs tailored to their specific impairments.
The new policy began this weekend when city officials ordered about 800 women to report to welfare offices for screening into the new 20-hour a week workfare program. It was unclear last night why only half of that group actually showed up for interviews, but state officials, who helped finance the project, said as many as 12,000 mothers may ultimately participate.
Under the old system, disabled mothers were exempt from workfare requirements unless a city doctor certified that they could work. City officials contended that, as a result, those women were denied desperately needed job training, work experience and career counseling.
But advocates for the poor say the new system endangers welfare mothers who have already been classified by city doctors as permanently or temporarily unemployable.
Officials at the four nonprofit agencies conducting the screening said they found some women eager to work and some who appeared to be too severely disabled to participate. The agencies are Goodwill Industries, the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service and the National Society for Disability Services.
The federation agency found 116 mothers who will likely participate in the new program. Most suffered from mental illness, asthma and chronic back pain. They were given an appointment for a more complete evaluation, which will be reviewed by the State Office of Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals With Disabilities.
Those women will ultimately work 20 hours a week for three months, and 35 hours a week after that, while receiving career counseling, job search training and other services.
"In our experience, a lot of them don't think they're up to working, but they welcome the opportunity," said Al Miller, chief operating officer of the federation agency.
On the other hand, officials at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service found only three employable mothers in a pool of 60.
"They're pretty seriously disabled, and work may not be appropriate for them," said Norma Martin, assistant executive director of the Brooklyn bureau. "We're not here to try to force people who are severely disabled to work if they can't work."
Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the Human Resources Administration, which runs the city's welfare programs, said she could not comment on the private agencies' findings without reviewing them first. She could not say what would happen to those disabled mothers who did not enter the workfare program.

Intel Sued; U.S. Cites Harm to Computer Makers
The F.T.C. filed antitrust charges against Intel, accusing it of threatening and injuring three computer makers, including Compaq, the leading maker of personal computers. The Government contended the company withheld information about its microprocessors that are at the heart of a personal computer in an effort to coerce the three companies to turn over rights to patented technologies.
Intel contended the suit was "based upon a mistaken interpretation of the law and the facts." Page A1.
 
Intel lowered prices on its Pentium II microprocessors for desktop computers by 12 percent to 20 percent and introduced a faster version of its low-end Celeron processor. It cut the price of its older, slower model by 32 percent. D6. 

U.S. Approves Rail Freight Plan

Honda and Ford Fined on Pollution
Honda will pay a record $12.6 million environmental fine, Federal prosecutors announced, because of bad programming on the pollution-control computers in 1.6 million Honda and Acura models. Ford will pay a $2.5 million fine for selling 60,000 Econoline vans that emit more nitrogen oxides at highway speeds than they do on treadmill tests. A1.
 
Roche Recalls Posicor Heart Drug
The prescription heart drug Posicor was pulled off pharmacy shelves in 38 countries by its maker, Roche Laboratories. The F.D.A. cited mounting evidence of dangerous, possibly even lethal, drug interactions. A12.
 
AOL to Buy Chat Service
America Online will pay at least $287 million for Mirabilis, a small Israeli company known for its highly regarded on-line chat service that enables users to detect when fellow users are on line and to communicate instantly with them. AOL's stock rose 2 percent on the news, which was viewed by analysts as a shrewd move. D3.

HEADLINE: NEW CHAPTER IN NIGERIA: THE OBITUARY;
Sani Abacha, 54, a Beacon of Brutality In an Era When Brutality Was Standard

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Gen. Sani Abacha, who died yesterday at 54, was the seventh Nigerian officer to come to power by force since the country gained independence from Britain in 1960. But even against this background, General Abacha established a distinctive record of brutal rule.
Nigerian human rights groups, clandestinely active in the country and openly critical in exile, have charged that more people were arrested in his five and a half years in power than in the five decades of British rule. 
 General Abacha regularly expressed his authority through fiat or intimidation, but rarely revealed much about himself, giving no interviews and keeping to his official mansion, known as Aso Rock. He would arrive at his office late in the day and work through the night, staying aloof even from his own ministers and military advisers.
A 1995 article in The New York Times reported that "journalists who have gotten too close to the subject of General Abacha's personal life are often arrested." And even in Nigerian circles, little was known about the dictator's life beyond the terse entries in the public record.
But his face, always obscured by dark glasses, was seen throughout the country on billboards that proclaimed, "Abacha is the Answer." Public works projects were named for him or his wife, Maryam, with whom he had nine children.
He was born on Sept. 20, 1943, in Kano State in the northern Muslim area that has produced most of the country's leaders. He attended school in Kano and just after independence was admitted to the Nigerian Military Training College in the northern city of Kaduna. In 1963 he received his commission as a second lieutenant after studying at the Mons Defense Officers' Cadet Training College in Aldershot, England.
In 1967, when mostly Ibo forces tried to wrench their region and its oil riches out of a federated Nigeria and gain independence as Biafra, the young officer fought in the civil war, and the secessionists were defeated. After the war, he continued his military training in England and then in Monterey, Calif.
Though his superiors recommended in 1971 that he never be promoted above the rank of colonel because he was "not considered stable enough for higher command," he nonetheless rose steadily. He was made a brigadier in 1980, a major general in 1984 and a lieutenant general in 1987. He was also involving himself in political affairs.
As oil, the country's main source of revenue, fell in price in the early 80's, President Shehu Shagari, who was elected in 1979, was toppled by the military on Dec. 31, 1983. It was the first of three coups in which General Abacha had a leading role, this time collaborating with Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.
The plotters installed Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari as leader. He was unable to reverse Nigeria's economic trials and showed little concern for human rights.
As things continued to worsen, General Babangida and General Abacha sent troops out to depose the man they had enthroned. General Babangida took over as head of state, and General Abacha became Chief of Staff of the Army.
General Babangida opened a nationwide debate on the form the government should take once democracy was restored. Local elections were held, and national elections were scheduled, but he decided that political traditions in the country were harmful and banned all 13 parties. In their place he created two factions, "one a little to the left" and the other "a little to the right," both under his control.
Elections were finally held on June 12, 1993. It appeared that Moshood K. O. Abiola, a wealthy businessman who was a member of the southern Yoruba people, had won. General Babangida annulled the election.
When widespread protests erupted, General Babangida resigned a day before he had promised to cede power to a civilian government. He gave the presidency to Ernest Shonekan, a civilian if unelected leader, who was also a Yoruba. General Abacha was the only member of the Babangida Government to stay on, as Defense Minister.
President Shonekan lasted only two and a half months. On Nov. 17, 1993, as he was preparing for a meeting with striking labor leaders, General Abacha staged his third coup, taking the top post himself.
A day later he outlawed the two government-sponsored parties and banned political activity. "We will not condone or tolerate any act of indiscipline," he declared.
In June 1994, Mr. Abiola declared himself to be the rightful president. A day later he was put in jail, where he remains.
Oil workers struck, calling for democracy. The military responded with violence and broke the strike within two months. In the summer of 1994, General Abacha imprisoned labor officials, journalists, politicians and rights activists. He announced decrees that put his Government above Nigeria's courts and permitted preventive detention. He shut down three major newspapers.
In March 1995, his Government announced, to some skepticism, that it had squelched a coup, and it was reported that within a month between 60 and 300 officers were executed along with 40 civilians.
At the same time General Abacha ordered the arrest of Lieut. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who in 1979 had been the only Nigerian military leader to have ever voluntarily turned over power to an elected official. Along with 39 others, he was charged with treason, leading to appeals from Pope John Paul II and Margaret Thatcher for leniency. On Oct. 1, 1995 General Abacha announced that he had lifted the death sentence on the 40 men.
He did not, however, accede to appeals for clemency in the case of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a writer and human rights activist, who was hanged along with eight of his associates on Nov. 10, 1995. He had been charged with provoking assassinations.
Many of the Government's critics believed that he was killed because of his role in the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, which sought a share of oil money for the ethnic group whose traditional lands lie over oil deposits. General Abacha is widely believed to have amassed a personal fortune from oil.
In January 1996 a group calling itself the United Front for Nigeria's Liberation claimed responsibility for a plane crash in which the general's 28-year-old son, Ibrahim, was killed.
The United States has imposed various levels of sanctions, banning flights because of security concerns, cutting assistance after the annulment of elections and again because of charges of Nigerian Government involvement in drug trafficking.
When Walter Carrington, the American Ambassador, was leaving his post last year, his farewell party was broken up by the police.
As General Abacha was being chastised by world leaders, he sought to establish Nigeria's military might as the peacekeeping power of West Africa. In February, Nigerian troops took Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, chased out a junta and, in a seeming paradox, paved the way for a democratically elected president.
In March, Pope John Paul visited Nigeria, calling for greater democracy and human rights in the country. A month later, parliamentary elections were held, but at many polling places soldiers and policemen outnumbered voters as the opposition called for a boycott. Pro-democracy groups claimed that General Abacha had rigged the list of candidates.
The general himself was preparing to run for President in August in an election in which he had in effect selected token opponents.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs Dividing Conrail to Increase Competition

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The Federal Government approved a sweeping plan today to restructure the nation's rail freight system east of the Mississippi River, a move officials said would take trucks off the road, reduce air pollution and lower the cost of goods for the New York City metropolitan region and much of the rest of the nation.
Today's vote by the Surface Transportation Board gave final approval to a proposal by the CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Corporation to divide Conrail's nearly 12,000 miles of track, stretching from Boston to St. Louis. CSX and Norfolk Southern jointly bought Conrail, which operated mainly in the Northeast, for $10.2 billion last year in one of the largest rail mergers in the nation's history. 
 The plan approved today creates two railroad giants that will dominate rail freight shipping throughout the nation's eastern half, allowing direct competition between the two companies in several places, including much of New Jersey and parts of western New York State.
"This carefully crafted, privately negotiated deal injects competition in the entire East like no merger before has ever done," said Linda J. Morgan, the chairwoman of the board. "It will bring competition back to many areas that had lost options through the creation of Conrail."
Aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki hailed the decision, saying it would allow more than one major railroad company to ship goods in and out of New York City for the first time in decades and potentially provide new transportation routes for Long Island businesses that are solely dependent on trucks.
"For the first time in a long time, businesses on the east side of the Hudson will have access to competitive freight rail services," said Bradford J. Race, Mr. Pataki's chief of staff. "It's a significant step forward for Long Island, Manhattan and communities all along the river."
But some members of New York's Congressional delegation said the plan fell well short of what was needed to revitalize the region's rail freight industry, charging that the transportation board had squandered a chance to force much more competition for New York City's huge market. Less than 3 percent of all the goods shipped in and out of the city is carried by trains, compared with about 40 percent in other cities.
"What they agreed to was grossly inadequate," said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from Manhattan, who said he might file suit to block the plan. "This doesn't give us any real competition at all."
It was also not clear whether the new plan would have a significant impact on rail shipping in Connecticut, where CSX will take over Conrail's lines. But in New Jersey, where CSX and Norfolk Southern will jointly operate hundreds of miles of former Conrail track while directly competing with each other, shipping costs are expected to decline and rail traffic to increase.
Environmental advocates and New York officials said they were concerned that added rail traffic in New Jersey would lead to an increase in trucks carrying goods from New Jersey rail yards into New York City over the George Washington Bridge even as New Jersey benefits from less trucking over all. The transportation board said today that it would conduct a study to see if that happened.
Today's vote clears one of the last major hurdles for CSX and Norfolk Southern to complete their takeover of Conrail, a monopoly system created by Congress 22 years ago out of the remnants of the failed Penn Central system. The board's decision -- which includes dozens of conditions dealing with labor, environmental and administrative issues -- still has to be set down on paper. After that report is released on July 23, the two companies will have to wait 30 days before the takeover becomes effective. Officials with the two companies have said they might take several months more to put the plan in place.
CSX and Norfolk Southern have said that their plan will cut truck travel on the nation's roads by a million trips a year, sharply reducing air pollution in congested regions like New York City. And while the elimination of Conrail's freight lines will lead to the loss of more than 2,500 union and management jobs, the two companies contend the nation's economy will benefit from lower shipping costs.
"This is going to be good for every consumer and every producer in the East," said David R. Goode, chairman of Norfolk Southern.
Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va., will grow from 14,400 track miles to 21,400 miles in 22 states. CSX, which is based in Richmond, will grow from 18,300 track miles to more than 23,000 miles in 23 states.
Some unions representing workers who may lose their jobs were expected to protest the plan. And some manufacturing trade associations said that they were concerned that shipping rates might rise in regions where Conrail had once competed with CSX or Norfolk Southern.
The plan calls for CSX to take over Conrail's lines in Connecticut, Massachusetts, along the Hudson from New York City to Albany and running west from there to Buffalo, as well as from Syracuse to Montreal. Norfolk Southern will take control of lines along the New York-Pennsylvania border and throughout Pennsylvania. The two companies will jointly operate much of Conrail's former lines in New Jersey.
Among the provisions the transportation board approved today is a requirement that CSX allow Canadian Pacific Ltd. to ship goods from Canada and parts west along the Hudson to New York City. City officials said that requirement would greatly increase rail competition in the metropolitan region, opening it up more to western markets.
But Mr. Nadler and other members of New York's and Connecticut's Congressional delegations had wanted the transportation board to make CSX allow Norfolk Southern to operate on the east side of the Hudson.
Doing that would not only reduce shipping rates, they said, but would also encourage the two companies to expand the use of barges to carry rail cars across the New York Harbor from New Jersey to Brooklyn. Because there is no rail bridge connecting New Jersey to New York City, rail freight coming from the south has to be unloaded in New Jersey and then trucked across bridges or through tunnels to the city.
The plan is also expected to cut shipping costs in Buffalo and Rochester.

HEADLINE: Strike Idles Other G.M. Plants And Workers Are Sent Home

BYLINE: By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 8

 BODY:
With two of its factories running out of essential components, the General Motors Corporation sent 4,500 workers home today as a four-day strike at a metal stamping plant in Flint, Mich., threatened to halt vehicle production for the world's largest auto maker.
While negotiators for the United Auto Workers and General Motors began their fourth straight day of bargaining, assembly factories in Orion Township, Mich., and Kansas City, Kan., were closed because of a shortage of engine cradles, the company and union officials said. Salaried employees remained at the plants. 
 The auto maker said an additional 8,500 workers could be idled on Tuesday with the scheduled closing of a light truck factory in Moraine, Ohio, a car assembly factory in Flint and a second shift at the Kansas factory.
And Thursday is the strike deadline at a second Flint parts-making factory, where 5,000 workers are demanding more job security.
The closings were set in motion by the strike of 3,400 hourly workers at G.M.'s sprawling metal plant in Flint, where the workers contend that the auto maker has reneged on a promise of $300 million in new investments that would essentially guarantee future employment. At least 17 of G.M.'s 29 North American assembly plants use fenders, hoods and engine cradles built in Flint.
"G.M. says the plant is not competitive, but that's their answer to everything," said Dick Shoemaker, the union's vice president for negotiations with the company.
G.M.'s response is that it will not back down until the union lives up to its promise to abolish work practices that give workers a full day's pay for a half-day's work.
Industry analysts estimate that the strike could cost the company $300 million a week in profits. Strikers receive $150 a week from the union. In most states, laid-off workers are eligible for state unemployment benefits, but G.M. typically fights against issuing benefits to U.A.W. workers laid off in a strike. A company spokesman said General Motors was still deciding whether it would challenge the benefits.

HEADLINE: NEW CHAPTER IN NIGERIA: THE IMPLICATIONS;
Dread Rules: An Unpopular Leader Leaves Nigerians Fearful and Divided

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: FREETOWN, Sierra Leone, June 8

 BODY:
Few Nigerians are in a state of mourning over the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, a deeply unpopular leader. But while Nigeria awaits clearer signs of its political future, nearly all of the nation is in a state of dread.
General Abacha's legacy is a demoralized army, a political class whose leaders have been jailed or driven into exile, and a national economy that has been looted into penury. 
 The booby traps he left in the nation's path could violently rend Africa's most populous country, and send shudders through the West African nations that gravitate around this regional giant like so many small moons.
Although the military leadership selected Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who was promoted from major general and was formerly defense chief of staff, as the country's new head of state, the army remains divided.
"How divided is this military? It is seriously divided," said Bolaji Akinyemi, a former Nigerian Foreign Minister. "What is the strength of each faction? Nobody knows. What is certain is that this is a very dangerous moment."
Today, the very first hints of potential trouble came from within the Nigerian army itself, when early this afternoon journalists were summoned without explanation to the presidential compound in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, and then just as suddenly chased away.
Hours later the military Government officially announced the death of the President, which had taken place early in the day. The lapse reflected deep divisions at the highest level of command about the army's immediate and future roles, according to retired senior officers of the Nigerian military.
General Abacha, who was 54, governing in a style bordering on heightened paranoia, left a military that is both Africa's largest and perhaps its least unified. Wave after wave of purges of senior officers, show trials of suspected opponents and long-sustained ethnic favoritism in the officer corps have left many commanders deeply demoralized and dangerously suspicious of each other.
"There are many of us who have made our lives in the army because we were trained to believe that the military had something vital to offer to the nation," said one senior Nigerian general in a recent interview. "This, however, does not include politics, and we have a bunch of officers who come to think of themselves as permanent politicians. In behaving this way, they are dragging us all down."
With feelings this raw and opinions so divided -- between those who wish to get back to a classic republican army and others who have for years cherished military power as a way to gain access to the country's trough of abundant oil wealth -- many now fear an open and potentially violent split.
General Abacha's unexpected death came less than four months before a long-promised transition to democratic civilian rule. But by the time he died early today, reportedly of a heart attack, even those who had been temporarily willing to believe in the improbable gift of a democratic election had long ago concluded that this stern and secretive military man would destroy the country in his attempt to keep tight personal control.
The seven military dictatorships that have dominated Nigeria's history since independence from Britain 1960 have all put forth plans for a "transition to democracy." Even if the current high command is able to maintain a reasonably united front and advance yet another, there is no sign that the country's political class will meekly sit back and await the results.
Already, in the hours following General Abacha's death there have been impassioned calls for the restoration of the presidential mandate of Moshood K. O. Abiola, the millionaire businessman who is widely believed to have won the country's 1993 elections, which the military then annulled and which international human rights groups have called the most democratic ever held in Nigeria.
"Abiola should be invited to head a government of national unity to organize a sovereign national conference and lead Nigeria to genuine democracy," the Nigerian human rights lawyer, Gani Fawehinmi told Reuters. "The Nigerian people will not allow the military to take over again."
Others, already suspecting that the military has little intention of giving up power, have begun to warn of the possibility of spreading unrest. In the weeks leading to his death, street protests against the military have erupted into small-scale riots, and opposition leaders had already announced plans for a series of strikes and other demonstrations against the army.
Nigerians, still haunted by the 30-year-old memories of the Biafra conflict, one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, have little difficulty imagining a continuation, indeed acceleration, of their national tragedy.
And throughout West Africa, where Nigeria looms huge, whether by virtue of its 105 million people, its large army or sophisticated economy, these kinds of scenarios are already causing serious worry.
In Sierra Leone, Nigerian soldiers intervened recently to restore the elected President, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who had been overthrown, and rout a guerrilla force that has been terrorizing much of the countryside. There, people from street vendors to Government officials expressed fear today that disorder in Nigeria would cause that country to lessen its commitment in Sierra Leone, perhaps allowing the rebels to make a comeback.
"Abacha may have been hated in Nigeria, but he saved us here," said one Sierra Leonean journalist. "If things go badly in Nigeria, we will surely suffer again."
In other West African countries mounting concerns about stability in Nigeria have less to do with Nigerian military involvements than with fears of a huge refugee outflow.
"If there is trouble in Nigeria, there is trouble for all of West Africa," said one senior official from Ivory Coast. "A sinking Nigeria is big enough to swamp us all."

HEADLINE: NEW CHAPTER IN NIGERIA: THE OPPOSITION;
With Nigeria's Military Ruler Dead, Concern Is Voiced for the Fate of His Jailed Foe

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
After the death of Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, the daughter of Moshood K. O. Abiola, the opposition leader who was imprisoned after being elected President in 1993, called today for the military to step aside and for her father's immediate release.
"It's the end of an era, and I hope, the end of military rule," said Hafsat Abiola, his 23-year-old Harvard-educated daughter who has worked with other opposition figures to protest military rule in Nigeria. 
 But Ms. Abiola, who works for the Special Olympics and lives in suburban Maryland with 5 of her 18 siblings, said she is concerned about her father's welfare.
"Abacha wanted to use my father as a hostage, to keep him close by so that if he was ever attacked he'd attack my Dad," she said in a telephone interview.
Asked whether she thought her father should take over the reins of power in Nigeria now that General Abacha is dead, she replied, "I just want my father released. I am very concerned about his safety."
Other Nigerian opposition leaders called for Mr. Abiola to be installed as President of a transitional Government in Nigeria.
Wole Soyinka, the exiled Nigerian playwright, told reporters in Jerusalem today, "There's only one choice for Nigeria -- that's a democratic option. And the structure is there. The President-elect is waiting."
Mr. Soyinka added that the general's death presented an opportunity for the military to step aside.
"The people were sick of military dictatorship," he said. "So it's up to the military to recognize this -- and up to the international community to say that we're sick and tired of the degeneration of a potentially great society."
Until that happens, other countries should increase diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions on the military Government, Mr. Soyinka said.
Mr. Soyinka, who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1986, fled Nigeria in 1994. He was charged in absentia with treason last March in connection with bomb attacks aimed mostly at the military, which left two people dead and about sixty people wounded.
The view that it was time for the military to step aside was echoed by the son of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a human rights activist and writer who was executed by the Nigerian Government.
 "This is an opportunity for the opposition and an opportunity for democracy to be restored to Nigeria, though how that actually happens is anybody's guess," Ken Wiwa told Britain's Channel Four television news.
 "One hopes that democracy will have a chance to establish itself," said Mr. Wiwa, whose father was hanged in 1995 with eight others.
But he said it was unclear whether Mr. Abiola was well enough to assume power.
"We are really not sure how healthy and fit Moshood Abiola is." Mr. Wiwa said. "Reports say he himself is close to death."
Ms. Abiola said that she was not ready to embrace the call of other opposition leaders like Mr. Soyinka for her father to assume the leadership of the country.
"We know he is not doing very well and have to attend to his medical needs first," she said. She said that he suffered from high blood pressure, a pinched nerve and had trouble moving his left leg.
The family has not seen her father in well over a year. When they saw him in January 1995, "he had been tussled, beaten around and looked very disheveled," she said.
But Ms. Abiola said that her father was the only person who can bring democracy to Nigeria.
"The only person who can move the country beyond the point where it is peaceful and democratic is my father," Ms. Abiola said. "He is the only person chosen by the people to do so."
Mr. Abiola has been in jail since mid-1994, after he was charged with treason by a federal high court in Abuja for declaring himself President. He was chosen by popular vote in election that was annulled by the military.
One of his three wives, Kudirat Abiola, Ms. Abiola's mother, was killed two years ago while working to free her husband from prison, in what her daughter called a political execution.
Ms. Abiola, who has spent nearly a third of her life in the United States, said she was ready to go home if she could feel safe again. "I want to be able to welcome my father back to our house," she said.

HEADLINE: NEW CHAPTER IN NIGERIA: THE OVERVIEW;
NIGERIA DICTATOR DIES AFTER 5 YEARS OF RUTHLESS RULE

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator of Nigeria, whose ruthless suppression of opponents, human rights and democracy led to condemnation around the world and seething discontent at home, died early yesterday. His defense chief of staff was quickly sworn in to lead Africa's most populous nation.
Reports of the death were sketchy, but American officials said they had no evidence of foul play. 
 General Abacha had not left a clear successor, but Nigeria's top military leaders convened and selected Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, apparently averting a protracted power struggle for leadership in the oil-rich nation of 115 million, a country wracked by decades of harsh, corrupt military governments and the effects of Western sanctions imposed in a futile effort to hasten democracy.
The swift selection of another military leader came in the face of appeals by exiled Nigerians and world leaders in Washington, London, Paris and other capitals, who said the general's death heralded an opportunity for Nigeria to release hundreds of political prisoners, cancel executions set by kangaroo courts and restore civilian government.
"Abacha's death is not going to bring my father back," said Ken Wiwa, the son of the playwright and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, who, with eight other opponents of the general, was publicly hanged for "treason" in 1995 while a worldwide outpouring of appeals for mercy was icily ignored.
Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright who won the 1986 Nobel Prize for Literature, fled to exile in Paris in 1994 and was recently charged in absentia with treason, said from Jerusalem that the general's death was an "incredible opportunity" for Nigeria to resurrect democracy.
In Washington, the White House offered no comment, but the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, offered sympathy to General Abacha's family, reaffirmed the United States commitment to promoting democracy in Nigeria, and urged a "peaceful transition to civilian, democratic rule."
After a morning of rumors and confusion in which heavily armed soldiers sealed off the general's compound in the capital, Abuja, General Abubakar announced in a brief communique that the 54-year-old Nigerian leader, who had seized power in 1993, was dead.
The swearing-in of General Abubakar took place about 4 A.M. Nigerian time.
"I appeal to all Nigerians to put all hands on deck to move our nation forward," he said in a statement issued shortly afterward.
The communique did not specify the cause of death, but news reports quoted family friends and Western diplomats as saying General Abacha had suffered a heart attack. Reports that his health was failing circulated after he canceled a trip to Lagos, Nigeria's principal city and former capital, on Tuesday.
In one of his first official acts, General Abubakar declared seven days of mourning for General Abacha.
But word of the death drew no outpouring of sorrow in Nigeria, where the general had tamed political parties, trade unions and the press, and had an enemies' list that read like a Who's Who of Nigeria.
"God is capable of wonderful things," an opposition political figure in Lagos said from behind a screen of anonymity. "Perhaps Nigerians will be free at last."
General Abubakar, 55, was born in the northern Nigerian town of Minna and later attended the Kaduna Technical Institute in 1963 before enlisting in the air force.
A career serviceman, he transferred to the army in 1975 and received military training in the United States. In 1981 he served with Nigerian troops assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon. He was appointed chief of the defense staff in 1993..
General Abubakar has not played a prominent political role, the BBC reported. It said that although he is the highest officer overseeing the army, navy and air force, he does not directly command any large body of troops.
Reports from Kano, the northern city where General Abacha was born in 1943, said thousands of people had lined the streets, awaiting the arrival of the general's body and an escort of senior government and military officials who were to attend the funeral.
"People don't know what to think," a Kano businessman who had closed his shop for the day told Reuters. "It's true some people are sad, but some will not be so sad either. We just worry over what comes next."
That was the question on many minds.
There was a political vacuum yesterday in the absence of General Abacha -- who wielded absolute power for five and a half years and was so haunted by the specter of a coup that he surrounded himself with a 2,000-member personal security force, rarely appeared in public and jailed or executed many leading Nigerians who could form a credible opposition.
The general's former second-in-command, Lieut. Gen. Donaldson Oladipo Diya, who had been seen as a possible successor, was sentenced to death by a military tribunal in April for allegedly plotting a coup. His fate is still in the hands of the military junta.
As Nigeria's leaders gathered in Abuja in a body called the Provisional Ruling Council, the prospects appeared at first to be for a behind-the-scenes struggle during the next few days to see who would lead the Government. Political experts said the likely contenders to succeed the general included General Abubakar; Lieut. Gen. Jeremiah Useni, Nigeria's senior officer, and Maj. Gen. Ishiaya Bamaiyi, the Army Chief of Staff.
General Abubakar, after his selection, was promoted from major general to full general and was sworn in by Nigeria's Chief Justice, Mohammed Uwais.
A coalition of 45 Nigerian groups that had clandestinely opposed General Abacha called yesterday for the installation of a civilian government headed by Moshood K. O. Abiola, who was imprisoned by General Abacha after his annulled election as President in 1993 in what was widely seen as the country's most democratic vote since it gained independence from Britain in 1960.
Mr. Abiola remains in prison.
It is a country of 250 tribal groups. The Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Ibo in the southeast make up 65 percent of the population. The 1960's were marked by a struggle for political dominance among the main ethnic groups, and a devastating civil war almost broke the country apart in the late 1960's.
During the 1970's oil exports helped Nigeria recover economically, and in the early 1980's, with a civilian Government in Lagos, Nigeria became known as a model of African democracy and prosperity. Nigerian arts were the envy of the continent. Its press was one of the freest anywhere. Nigerian diplomacy challenged the United States and Britain over issues like apartheid. The nation's currency was worth twice as much as the dollar.
But democracy in Nigeria died in 1983, and General Abacha, a career soldier who became an infantryman at 18 and attended military colleges in England, the United States and Nigeria, had a role in three coups.
The generals ousted Nigeria's last civilian government in 1983. Hopes for a return to democracy were high in June 1993, when Mr. Abiola, a millionaire businessman, won an election with pledges to return Nigeria to civilian rule. But the Government annulled the vote, and three months later Mr. Abacha overthrew President Ibrahim Babangida.
Mr. Abiola, frustrated over the victory that was stolen from him, declared himself President in defiance of General Abacha and was jailed on treason charges. General Abacha promised democratic reforms and an election in 1996 to bring back civilian government, but the promises proved hollow.
While announcing that he was stretching his rule to 1998, General Abacha began a virtual reign of terror. He cracked down on all opposition, subdued unions, took control of the press, jailed hundreds of people and began a series of trials that sent opponents to prison or the gallows.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa was executed on charges stemming from his campaign to have Nigeria's huge oil revenues shared with the communities where the petroleum was produced. The general's purges also extended to prominent Nigerians and into his inner circle, and many fled into exile.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian leader, misidentified his predecessor. General Abacha took over in 1993 by unseating President Ernest Shonekan, an unelected civilian leader for two and a half months, not Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who had installed Mr. Shonekan.

HEADLINE: HONDA AND FORD ARE FINED MILLIONS

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
Honda and Ford have agreed to pay millions of dollars in civil fines for selling cars that were designed to pass emissions tests but run dirtier on the road, Federal prosecutors announced today.
The Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency fined the Honda Motor Company $12.6 million for violations of the Clean Air Act. The E.P.A. said the auto maker would also face costs of about $250 million for remedial efforts, including extending warranties and providing free tune-ups for the 1.6 million cars that are affected. 
 The Ford Motor Company will pay a $2.5 million fine for a pollution control problem on 60,000 of its 1997 Econoline vans, the officials said, and $3.8 million in other costs and compensatory measures. Ford began a recall of the vans today.
Both companies denied wrongdoing.
The announcement is an embarrassment to Honda, which in advertising and public statements has portrayed itself as an environmental leader.
The auto maker has voluntarily put extra equipment on hundreds of thousands of vehicles to make sure that they meet California's strict emission standards, even if they are sold in states that enforce the looser Federal standard. Ford also voluntarily exceeds emissions rules on many of its models.
"We are making very clear that cars are a major source of air pollution in this country and it is important for auto manufacturers to assure they are carefully complying with the Clean Air Act," said Lois J. Schiffer, an Assistant Attorney General and head of the environment and natural resources division at the Justice Department. "If they don't do it, we will take strong action against them."
The agreement with Honda covers all of the Honda and Accura vehicles built in the 1996 and '97 model years, with the exception of Passport and SLX, and the 1997 Integra R. For 1995 models, the agreement covers the Accord V-6 and the Accura NSX, 2.5 TL. Accura is a division of Honda.
The prosecutors say Honda was fined for programming the pollution-control computers to ignore spark-plug failures. The computer software would not illuminate the "check engine" light when parts fail and emissions rise, thus allowing the cars to emit twice as much smog-causing hydrocarbons without warning their drivers.
A lawyer for Honda, William R. Willen, said that the problem was one of interpretation of the rules and that the vehicles' diagnostic systems would function if the problem were serious. The "check engine" light would fail to come on, Mr. Willen said in a telephone interview, only in times of intermittent failure.
Mr. Willen said the company's engineers had simply gone too far in their efforts to minimize the number of times the light came on.
But the environmental agency estimated that uncorrected, the cars -- Civics, Accords, Del Sols, Integras, Preludes, NSX's and CR-V's, Odysseys and their Isuzu-brand twin, the Oasis -- would emit eight million extra tons of hydrocarbons in their lifetimes. Total emission of hydrocarbons from all transportation sources was about 10 million tons in 1996.
Prosecutors also said that the cars could grow sluggish without warning the driver that something was wrong and that if a driver took one to a garage, the mechanic would have a harder time diagnosing the problem.
David E. Alexander, a lawyer with the E.P.A. enforcement division, said suppressing the dashboard warning light made life harder for all drivers, even those who were relatively knowledgeable about cars.
"The idiot lights are for all of us," Mr. Alexander said.
In Ford's case, the 60,000 Econoline vans are equipped with a feature that makes them emit more nitrogen oxides at highway speeds than they do on treadmill tests.
In addition to paying $2.5 million in civil penalties, the company will buy pollution credits from other sources for $2.5 million, and will spend $1.3 million on fixing the Econolines, with a goal of completing the work on at least 70 percent of them.
A Ford spokeswoman, Sara Tatchio, said the company had changed the pollution systems on Econolines on its assembly line and in dealer lots as soon as the Goverment raised its objections early last year.
The investigation also called into question the pollution control systems on 1.7 million Ford Escorts sold between 1991 and 1995, but the agreement did not require any corrective action to those cars. Ford sold 6.9 million vehicles worldwide last year and had earnings of $6.9 billion.
Honda was also notified of the problems last year and has also corrected it for vehicles now in production.
The software in the affected Hondas is burned into the computer chips, and correcting the problem would mean replacing the chips, at a price the Government put at $500 million. The package that Honda agreed to -- including free oil changes, to lure drivers in for their free tune-ups -- was more effective, the E.P.A. said.
In addition to tuneups and engine checks, Honda will extend the warranty on the pollution-control systems to 14 years or 150,000 miles. Depending on which part was involved and where the car was sold, the existing warranties ranged from three years or 36,000 miles to eight years or 80,000 miles.
In spite of the Justice Department estimate, Honda said it did not know the cost for the remedial actions because no one had ever guaranteed car parts for that long. Honda's payment will be spread over 14 years, which will significantly reduce the financial impact on the company. Honda sold two million vehicles worldwide in 1997 and for the fiscal year that ended March 31 had a profit of $1.96 billion.
The largest previous case was the $45 million in fines and remedial actions that the General Motors Corporation agreed to in 1995 for producing Cadillacs that passed emissions tests but violated pollution standards on the road.
The Honda problem was discovered by officials of the California Air Resources Board, which serves as the Environmental Protection Agency's surrogate for certifying that Honda vehicles meet Federal standards.
The California board tested one vehicle that had been on the road for several months, and found that it did not diagnose engine misfires, in which the fuel-air mixture fails to explode and is shoved out the exhaust system, sometimes damaging the catalytic converter on the way.
On closer examination, California engineers found that the system was designed not to work.
Honda said owners with questions could call its Consumer Affairs Department at (800) 999-1009.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 18, 1998, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on June 9 about defects in the pollution control systems of Hondas misstated the amount of additional hydrocarbons that the Government predicted would be emitted without corrective action. It was 8,000 tons of hydrocarbons, not eight million tons.

HEADLINE: New York Pizza, the Real Thing, Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
NEW YORK pizza is a phrase synonymous with pizza greatness, yet for years New Yorkers could find the genuine article in only a few isolated spots. Now pizza lovers can rejoice: the true New York pizza is back in town.
I'm not talking about the by-the-slice pies congealing in neighborhood display windows as they await reheating or the sodden boxes delivered to the door. I'm talking about classic New York pizza: pies cooked quickly in extremely hot ovens, generally coal-fired, until the thin crust achieves a gloriously charred, smoky crispness. The dough is prepared daily; the mozzarella is real, not packaged; tomatoes are the best quality, and toppings are simple and used in moderation -- no pineapple or Thai chicken. The pizzas are cooked to order and never sold by the slice. 
 As recently as 10 years ago, the classic pizza was on the endangered list, treasured as an artifact of old New York but bypassed by a culture that preferred its pizzas fast, cheap and delivered. Just a few pizza landmarks, most famously John's Pizzeria on Bleecker Street, Patsy's Pizza in East Harlem and Totonno's Pizzeria Napolitano in Coney Island -- all presided over by rival clans -- zealously preserved the traditions. Disciples were required to make pilgrimages to these hallowed halls for a taste.
Today, those three families, plus a newcomer, are almost entirely responsible for a pizza renaissance in New York. The landmarks have been joined by a new set of great names: Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge; Lombardi's on Spring Street; Nick's in Forest Hills, Queens, and Rockville Centre, on Long Island; Candido on the Upper East Side; Polistina's on the Upper West Side; Zito's in the East Village and, most recently, Angelo's on West 57th Street. What's more, the landmarks have themselves branched out. There are now John's, Patsy's and Totonno's in many Manhattan neighborhoods.
Why the renaissance? It's driven, I think, by the same sense of renewed connoisseurship that gave rise to the microbrewery boom, for example. And as with the ponds of microbrews measured against oceans of Budweiser, it's easy to forget that the number of classic pizzerias amounts to no more than a leaf of fresh basil in a sea of canned tomato sauce.
At its highest level, pizza making is a labor-intensive, artisanal craft requiring dedication and training. The coal ovens, more than twice as hot as the gas oven at the corner pizzeria, demand an apprenticeship to master their intricacies. Good pizza makers, or "stick men," are artists, shifting and moving the pies within the oven as they cook, equalizing the effects of hot spots.
Ferreting out the freshest mozzarella cheese, building relationships with tomato suppliers and sausage makers, starting dough fresh each day, rather than in advance, being willing to jettison ingredients past their prime -- all this takes rare dedication when it's so much easier to buy long-lasting factory-made mozzarella or to make a week's supply of dough and freeze it.
Environmental regulations also make it hard to build new coal ovens. Nowadays in New York City, coal ovens can only be rebuilt or replaced under an environmental grandfather clause -- not installed from scratch. Pizza makers have become architectural historians, seeking out spaces that once housed a coal-burning oven, like old bakeries or restaurants.
The determination to make pizza the hard way seems to come from being born and bred into a pizza-making tradition. New York pizza did not exist before 1905, when Gennaro Lombardi, a Neapolitan immigrant, began to sell pies in his grocery store in Little Italy. Lombardi's was by most accounts the first New York pizzeria, and Mr. Lombardi, who hired and trained a series of other immigrants, became the sturdy tap root of a tree of family and acquaintances that would go on to define great New York pizza.
The legendary pizza makers -- John Sasso of John's, Patsy Lancieri of Patsy's and Anthony (Totonno) Pero of Totonno's -- are all said to have learned their craft at Lombardi's brick-walled coal oven. Nearly a century later, their descendants, including Lombardi's grandson, are fueling the expansion. New York's pizza dynasties are now in their third and fourth generations, and counting.
Yet, a lot of the energy has come from new blood, the Angelis-Tsoulos clan, which joined the pizza pantheon just a few years ago. In 1994, Nick Angelis, the son of a Greek pizza maker who learned the art in Naples, opened Nick's Pizza in Forest Hills. It is dedicated to preserving the tradition of New York's great pie men. Paradoxically, he uses a new kind of gas oven that can achieve the high heat necessary for the best pies. No matter. It's hard to imagine a better crust than Nick's: blackened and barely crisp, glistening and golden, with a faintly smoky flavor. The crust is matched by the other ingredients: pure, creamy mozzarella, delicious roasted peppers, terrific sausage. Mr. Angelis has since opened a second branch in Rockville Centre.
Meanwhile, Nick Tsoulos, his brother-in-law, seeing how well Mr. Angelis was doing, decided to bring such a pizzeria to Manhattan. He made an arrangement with the owners of the East Harlem Patsy's to use that name and in 1995 opened Patsy's Pizza at 509 Third Avenue, near 34th Street. The smooth, blackened crust lacks that classic smoky flavor, but the toppings are superb: wonderfully mellow mozzarella and excellent sauce made of plum tomatoes. The three other Patsy's that have since opened in Manhattan are just as good.
In April, the clan combined forces and opened Angelo's at 117 West 57th Street, named after Mr. Angelis's father and run by Nick and John Pashalis, Mr. Angelis's cousins. The pizzas are excellent, very much like the Patsy's pies.
Not surprisingly, these new pizzerias have heightened tensions among old-line pizza dynasties, which regard one another with all the sunny warmth of rival boxing promoters. Yet, faced with newcomers, they band together with a universal sneer at Mr. Angelis and Mr. Tsoulos as imitators.
More serious is the battle over the name Patsy's. The original Patsy died in the 1970's, and his widow sold the East Harlem pizzeria to longtime employees in 1991, to the chagrin of Patsy Grimaldi, her nephew, who opened a Patsy's in Brooklyn in 1990. He got even angrier when the Tsoulos Patsy's began to open in Manhattan. Finally, in a fit of independence -- not, he insists, through any legal coercion -- he changed the name of his pizzeria to Grimaldi's. Nor is there any love lost between the East Harlem Patsy's and all the others.
If the mantle of Patsy Lancieri were awarded on quality alone, Grimaldi's, at 19 Old Fulton Street, near Front Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, would win hands down. The crust, bready and dense, is excellent, and the fragrant tomato sauce, the fresh mozzarella and the home-roasted peppers are spectacular. Sadly, the original Patsy's, in a picturesque storefront in a remnant of an Italian neighborhood at 2287-91 First Avenue, near 118th Street, has not kept up with its estranged cousins. The pizza is good, but the crust lacks snap, and the flavors lack liveliness.
In addition to Nick's and Grimaldi's, my favorite pizzerias include the original John's at 278 Bleecker Street, and Lombardi's at 32 Spring Street. John's has three other branches in Manhattan, but the ramshackle Bleecker Street site is best for the expert economy of its pizza: crust just crisp enough, with a wonderful smoky flavor, creamy mozzarella and perfectly spiced tomato sauce. There is no excess.
At Lombardi's, opened by old Gennaro Lombardi's grandson and namesake, diners revel in tradition. The handsome brick and stucco dining room is adorned with old photographs, and when you eat the pizza, with its gloriously light, thin, crisp yet elastic crust, you feel you are devouring history.
What's more, Lombardi's also serves great clam pizza, a style original to New Haven that is a worthy departure from New York traditions.
Totonno's, the third of the old New York institutions, offers a slightly different style of pizza, whether at its simple bastion in Coney Island or its duded-up new quarters at 1544 Second Avenue, near 80th Street. The crust is puffy and thick, bready, rather than thin. I'm not the biggest fan of this style, but its partisans love it. Totonno's is planning to open an Upper West Side branch in the fall.
The newcomers have all added their distinctive notes to the chorus. Zito's, 211-13 First Avenue, near 13th Street, comes from the bread-making tradition of Zito's bakery on Bleecker Street. Its crust is smooth and proper, without the slightly gritty quality of the traditional style, but superb just the same. Candido, at 1606 First Avenue, near 83d Street, produces a terrific thin-crusted pizza that is most distinctive for its lightness. You can easily put away three slices without the overstuffed feeling that comes with an ordinary pizza. The hallmark of the pie at Polistina's, which opened over the winter at 2275 Broadway, near 82d Street, is a thin crust that achieves a consistent crispness and pleasantly grainy texture.
Ultimately, in the pizza-making stratosphere, it may be nitpicking to quarrel over whose mozzarella is the freshest or whether the billowy Totonno's pie is better than the thinner John's crust. But it sure is great to have so much to choose from.
 
A Geography of Pizza: Simple, Stuffed and Carried Away
New York is not the only place that has given its name to a style of pizza. Following are some others.
 
NEW HAVEN
New Haven's claim to pizza fame is the clam pie. As made at Frank Pepe's, it is elemental and delicious: whole clams with garlic, olive oil and oregano, on a thin, brittle crust. Many New Haven pizzerias call their pies "apizza," pronounced a-BEETS. Jesse Sheidlower, a slang specialist in the reference division of Random House, suggests that comes from a dialect spoken in Catania in Sicily, where Frank Pepe was from. In Manhattan, Lombardi's at 32 Spring Street, serves a superb version.
 
NEAPOLITAN
Pizzas made according to the rules of the Naples Pizza Association, a trade group based in Italy, are different from New York pies. They are smaller, 9 to 10 inches in diameter, and the crust is softer and breadier than the crisp New York version. Neapolitan pizzas must also be made with buffalo mozzarella, San Marzano tomatoes and a special flour, and baked in a wood-burning oven. In the United States, only La Pizza Fresca, at 31 East 20th Street, and Antica Pizzeria Napoletano in Los Angeles have received the association's certificate of authenticity. Many designer pizzas made in fancy restaurants are closer to Neapolitan pizza than to New York pizza.
 
SICILIAN
These pizzas, traditionally rectangular, are significantly thicker than the Neapolitan versions, with typically puffy, breadlike dough. In New York, Sicilian pizza can be sampled at Matese Pizzeria, 26-15 Francis Lewis Boulevard, Whitestone, Queens.

Deep-dish pizzas, as made famous by the original Pizzeria Uno and still served at the chain, are Chicago's signature. They have thick, bready crusts and chunky toppings and may be of Sicilian origin. They have grown baroque, with double crusts encasing all manner of foods.
 
CALIFORNIA
Wolfgang Puck, the Los Angeles chef, must take both the credit and the blame for California pizza. In his hands, crisp, thin-crusted pizza became a vehicle for unusual and delicious toppings like duck sausage and goat cheese and sun-dried tomato. But in less tasteful hands, the California pizza has become a cliche for bad marriages, like ham and pineapple. California Pizza Kitchen, 201 East 60th Street, serves many examples of the genre.

Even with many big cities like Chicago adding to capacity, hotel rooms can still be hard to get.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
HOTEL room rates are expected to rise slightly this year, even though occupancy rates will decline slightly, but travelers should not be lulled into thinking they need not book well in advance. With the economy still chugging along, rooms will continue to be hard to come by in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and other business cities.
Chicago, for example, just added the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place, a 33-story property. All of its 800 rooms are expected to be open next month; more than 500 are already open. Even with that capacity, the hotel already projects that more than 100 nights will be sold out through the end of June 1999. 
 Designed for business travelers, all rooms have desks, ergonomic chairs and power strips with grounded outlets. There are also 53 suites, including 5 for entertaining clients. The hotel has an indoor heated swimming pool with outdoor sun deck and a health club with sauna and cardiovascular and strength training equipment.
 
Poor Skiing in 2050?
A warning for skiers: According to predictions at the recent World Congress on Snow and World Tourism, climate change caused by global warming will cause the snow line to withdraw significantly up the mountains and snow cover can be expected to last for fewer months. But there is no need to panic just yet, since the effects are not expected to be felt for 30 to 50 years.
 
Cruise Update
Remember when cruise passengers wanted to leave their worldly cares behind? They still can, but only if they don't turn on the television in their cabins. More and more ships are offering live news and sports via satellite, as well as an array of reruns for children and adults. Princess Cruises, part of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company of Britain, has CNN and ESPN live, and is adding BBC reruns to its television schedule. It will also, of course, continue to show reruns of the "Love Boat" series, which was filmed on the original Sun Princess and two other Princess ships, and ran on ABC television from 1977 to 1986.
As one indication of how the cruise industry has grown, literally, consider that the Sun Princess was 17,000 tons while the Island Princess and Pacific Princess were 20,000 tons. By contrast, the Grand Princess, which made its debut May 26 and is currently sailing European waters, is 109,000 tons. While in nautical terms a ton is not a measure of weight -- more formally known as a gross register ton, it represents 100 cubic feet of internal capacity -- it is worth noting that any of those earlier ships would fit comfortably in the Horizon Court, the 24-hour restaurant aboard the Grand Princess.
Speaking of huge ships, two days ago Cunard Lines -- recently bought by the Carnival Corporation and a group of Norwegian investors -- said it was going to build "the grandest and largest liner ever built." Details will be announced.
 
Airline Update
In the last 10 days, Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines have begun nonstop service to Japan -- Northwest with two flights a week connecting Tokyo and Las Vegas, Nev., and Delta with daily nonstops between Atlanta and Tokyo. On Oct. 2, Japan Airlines will operate twice-weekly nonstops from Tokyo to Las Vegas. The Northwest and J.A.L. flights are largely a response to growing Japanese tourism to Las Vegas, while the Delta flights reflect the growing Japanese investment in the Southeast, which amounts to almost $14.5 billion, and the region's exports to Japan, which exceed $5.5 billion a year.
Air New Zealand and Ansett Australia have agreed to join the year-old Star Alliance in 1999, bolstering the alliance's access to the Pacific, especially the South Pacific. The current alliance members -- United, Air Canada, Lufthansa of Germany, Scandinavian Airlines System, Thai Airways International and Varig Brazilian Airlines -- already serve some 650 destinations worldwide, and alliance flights average a takeoff every 15 seconds around the clock.
Alaska Airlines is again offering special summer fares to and from three of the five cities it serves in the Russian Far East. Round-trip fares to Vladivostok or Khabarovsk range from $585 from Anchorage to $635 from Seattle, Reno or the San Francisco Bay area to $735 from Las Vegas, Phoenix and greater Los Angeles. Round trip to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is an additional $250 from each of those American cities. Fares represent savings of 48 percent to 69 percent, and as usual, restrictions apply.
Best Western International and the Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa are the newest members of the frequent-flier program of America West Airlines.
Austrian Airlines is offering trans-Atlantic round-trip passengers a one-week car rental from Budget Rent-a-Car in Austria for $163.80 a week, or less than $24 a day, including unlimited mileage and taxes.

HEADLINE: From Palau to Kyrgyzstan, Leaders Agree: The Scourge Is Drugs

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 9

 BODY:
Palau's President describes his nation as an island paradise, with the world's best scuba diving in pristine South Pacific waters, abundant seafood, safe streets and a growing economy.
"One might think that our paradise is free of drug problems," President Kuniwo Nakamura said in a statement to the General Assembly's special session on illegal drugs. But an imported form of methamphetamine -- nicknamed "ice" -- has begun to entice users as young as 13 and 14 years old. 
 "Although our law enforcement is well trained and respected, we lack the technology to effectively combat this terrible problem," said the President's statement, which was delivered to a largely empty chamber by Palau's representative, Hersey Kyota, on Monday night.
Oratory from big nations like the United States dominated the opening of the special session on Monday. But the full scope of the drug problem has unfolded in sometimes poignant testimony by smaller and poorer countries like Palau, the United Nations' newest member. They have lined up to recount how drug trafficking and consumption have corrupted their struggling economies and societies and why they are hard pressed to stop it.
A result has been more candor than characterizes most General Assembly sessions. Former Soviet republics have complained of rising drug use in the wake of the heady arrival of democracy. Caribbean nations have recounted the dangers of being overrun by drug smugglers. Many countries have asked for financial and technical assistance and a greater effort by developed countries to reduce the demand for drugs.
Prime Minister Kubanychbek Jumaliyev of Kyrgyzstan said today that "while two or three years ago people in Kyrgyzstan had only a theoretical idea of what heroin is, nowadays it has become one of the main drugs on the illegal market."
Since Armenia found itself on the drug trafficking route from Central Asia, its Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said, local drug seizures have risen thirtyfold since 1993 and narcotics-related crime in Armenia is up by 150 percent. New-found democratic freedoms left many Armenians vulnerable to drugs, Mr. Oskanian said, "not just of personal use but for quick and easy financial gain."
Prime Minister Basdeo Panday of Trinidad and Tobago said his island nation's proximity to South America made it vulnerable to cocaine trafficking. Among the results, he said, were a rise in serious crime, the recruitment of unemployed people as drug traffickers and users, and a dramatic escalation in addiction.
Latvia's Prime Minister, Guntars Krasts, said that 80 percent of Latvian high school students surveyed have tried drugs at least once, and that drug abuse had claimed the lives of an increasing number of young Latvians. Deputy Prime Minister Josef Kalman of Slovakia agreed, saying, "We have noticed an increasing number of consumers coming from lower and lower age levels."
No nation has proposed legalizing drugs. The Danish Health Minister, Carsten Koch, said law enforcement works when combined with primary drug prevention and social intervention. "No government should jeopardize this situation by considering to legalize narcotic drugs for other purposes than medical and scientific ones," Mr. Koch said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Many Internet Shares Rally, but Major Indexes Are Mixed

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
A three-day rally in stocks fizzled yesterday and left major market indexes mixed, illustrating Wall Street's renewed concerns about the corporate earnings outlook and some wariness about the near-term prospect for interest rates.
But a rally among some Internet-related shares pushed technology stocks higher, as the Nasdaq composite index closed above 1,800 for the first time since May 22. Falling energy prices pushed up transportation stocks, and news concerning prescription drugs continued to buoy pharmaceutical shares. 
 Blue-chip issues bore the brunt of the declines, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 19.68 points, to 9,049.92. Financial services companies like American Express, J. P. Morgan and Wells Fargo, as well as some multinational companies such as McDonald's, which had been higher in recent days, had some of the largest retreats.
Concerns about today's Congressional testimony of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, also helped weaken blue-chip issues, analysts said, as investors expressed some concern that the Fed could still raise interest rates sometime soon.
"The consensus seems to be that rates will not be going higher," said Charles W. Johnson, a managing director and head equity trader at Blaylock & Partners. "But there is that nervousness in the marketplace that maybe the Fed sees something that we don't," which would justify an interest rate increase, he said.
A continuing flow of earnings warnings from companies is keeping investors worried about the outlook for corporate profits, analysts said.
Yesterday, Billing Concepts, a billing agent for the telecommunications industry, warned that earnings could fall below expectations in its third and fourth quarters because of a decline in demand. Arrow International, a maker of disposable medical products, said fiscal third-quarter sales are likely to increase less than expected because of slowing international orders.
A decline in oil prices pushed the stocks of companies like Chevron and Exxon lower after the Paris-based International Energy Agency forecast a decline in Asian demand for oil. However, the oil-price drop lifted stocks of transportation companies, particularly airlines. Gains in such carriers as Alaska Air Group and US Airways Group lifted the Amex airline index 4.1 percent and the Dow Jones transportation average 3.11 percent, its biggest one-day gain this year.
Led by a 4-point rise in Pfizer, the Standard & Poor's 500 index inched up 2.69 points, to 1,118.41. Pfizer soared to 112 7/16 on news that the Food and Drug Administration said the company's impotence-treatment drug, Viagra, did not directly cause the deaths of 16 users.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 12.99 points, to 1,800.76, pulled higher by a broad rally in Internet stocks on news of a deal between General Electric's NBC and the struggling Web service Cnet, which shot up 12 1/8, or 37 percent, to 45 1/8. Lycos, Yahoo, America Online, Netscape Communications and Earthlink Network all rose. Lycos also gained after receiving a patent for its "spider" search technology.
But some Internet-related shares that had caught investor attention in recent weeks are now languishing. K-Tel International, which soared to 33 15/16 after the company announced in April that it would sell music on the Internet, fell 33/64, to 11 1/4.
Other prominent losses yesterday included Chromatics Color Sciences International shares, which fell about 49 percent before partly recovering to close at 6 1/2, down 2 5/16. The company develops technologies to scientifically measure skin color in order to detect jaundice in infants.
Asensio & Company, a firm that bets that stocks will go down, recommended selling the stock yesterday. Asensio said that Chromatics' principal product had no sales and licensing potential and that irregular trading activity might have occurred in the stock among owners, including two Dreyfus micro-cap mutual funds that have sizable holdings in Chromatics.
A Dreyfus spokesman called the allegations "unsubstantiated." And Darby Macfarlane, the chief executive of Chromatics, said the company was "working diligently to put out a detailed report" to counter the Asensio claims.

Bonds End Little Changed
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday for a second consecutive session as investors awaited today's Congressional testimony from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
While few expect him to signal any change in monetary policy, many investors remained cautious, knowing that his remarks have the potential to cause big price swings.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32, to 104 27/32, leaving the bond's yield unchanged at 5.78 percent for a second day. Trading was lighter than usual. About $53.8 billion in Treasury securities were traded as of 3 P.M., 30 percent below average, said Govpx, a bond pricing service.

HEADLINE: THE N.B.A. FINALS;
After Its Rapid Demise, Jazz Seeks Resurrection

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 9

 BODY:
Four days ago, they were the most economical and efficient team in basketball. One minute away from putting Michael Jordan's team in a two-game hole on its home floor, the Utah Jazz appeared to have all the artillery necessary to end the Chicago Bulls' championship reign.
Now, Karl Malone and John Stockton are 48 minutes away from going down, 3-1, and being devoured by the Bulls. They will take the United Center floor on Wednesday night for Game 4 of the league championship series searching for their confidence and anything resembling an offense. 
 "We don't have to be told that tomorrow is a must-win game," the reserve center Greg Foster said today. "You can sense it and feel it. Giving away another game would be like giving up our hopes of winning a title."
In the worst loss in finals history, a 96-54 defeat in Game 3, Utah scored the fewest points in a National Basketball Association game -- playoffs or regular season -- since the inception of the shot clock in 1954.
After leading by 1 point with less than a minute remaining in Game 2 before falling to the Bulls, the Jazz has essentially gone from putting Chicago on the ropes to desperately needing a victory on Wednesday.
The Bulls, meanwhile, have no intention of going back to Salt Lake City for either Game 6 or 7, preferring to end the series in five games on Friday in Chicago.
"We've always responded well after a tough loss like that, so there's no reason to think any different," Malone said. "I like our attitude now."
Indeed, the Jazz has dealt with adversity well in the playoffs this season. Utah was down, two games to one, to the Houston Rockets in a three-of-five-game first-round series. The Jazz rebounded and won in five games on its home floor. In the second round, Utah was annihilated by San Antonio in Game 3 at the Alamodome before coming back to win Game 4 and close the Spurs out in Game 5.
But that was Houston and San Antonio. This is Jordan, Scottie Pippen and the ring dynasty. If the Bulls win Game 4, Chicago will almost be assured of winning its sixth title in eight seasons.
"If we can create distance between them and us, we can put ourselves a step closer," Jordan said. "We can put them closer, put their backs closer to the wall, put them in a panic situation."
The Bulls have made the necessary adjustments after a Game 1 loss in overtime, letting Pippen play off his man and operate as a roving help defender. Dennis Rodman has plastered himself on Malone's elbow, and no one on the Jazz roster has been able to contend with Jordan physically.
About the only good news for the Jazz going into Wednesday's game was that its power forward did not skip practice on Monday to hang out with Hulk Hogan and a cast of professional wrestling blowhards in Detroit. Rodman is indeed at it again.
Chicago's irascible forward caused so much of a distraction by skipping practice and flying to Detroit on Monday to participate in a World Championship Wrestling extravaganza, the parties involved almost forgot they had a game to play on Wednesday night at the United Center.
While Coach Phil Jackson and the Bulls welcomed their wayward forward back with open arms, Jerry Sloan and the Jazz simply could not relate. Instead of dealing with how they might recover from their record loss, Sloan and his team wondered aloud how a flamboyant role player could make a mockery of the league championship series.
Asked how he would discipline Rodman for his latest transgression, "First of all, I wouldn't have him," Sloan said. "That's what makes the question real simple, because Dennis, everybody knows what he's about. Winning has never been that important to me. I'd just as soon lose if I had to be put in that situation.
"There are things I can deal with. Guys have a problem once in a while, I can deal with that. But I can't deal with it when winning is the only thing there is."
Though the Bulls and the N.B.A. were each planning to fine Rodman $10,000, the implication from the Jazz seemed to be that the Bulls organization was letting Rodman make a mockery of the finals, that Chicago would put winning before proper, old-school decorum.
"We always talk about where this league is going without Michael Jordan," Sloan said. "I think it's important to realize, if we want it to go in the other direction, where there is no discipline and no respect, then those things will be important. To me, they aren't. I know how corny it sounds, but when that is more important than the game itself, we've lost our whole reason for being here."
The Bulls were not buying that theory. Jackson said, "In the end result, Dennis always comes back and tries extra hard to please."
Bulls center Luc Longley said: "I like having Dennis as a teammate. The things he's brought to this team are far greater than anything he is taking away from the team. Some of those long road trips, he spices it up a little. He's a good bloke to have around."
Longley added: "Anyway, aren't we supposed to be talking about basketball today? I would think Game 4 is fairly huge for the Jazz, wouldn't you?"

HEADLINE: Clinton Rejects Pleas to Avoid Tiananmen Ceremony

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
President Clinton rejected appeals today that he avoid an official welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square in Beijing when he visits China this month, saying that he could not dictate to China's leaders how he should be received in their country.
Appearing at a news conference with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, Mr. Clinton said appearing at Tiananmen Square, the scene of a deadly crackdown on democratic protesters nine years ago this month, did not signal that he was endorsing Beijing's suppression of dissent. 
 Last week the House voted, 305 to 116, to approve a nonbinding resolution demanding that the President avoid the plaza on his trip to China, which is to begin on June 25.
"My own view," Mr. Clinton said today, "is that if this is going to be a state visit to China and I am going to be the guest of the Chinese that they should be designing the terms of the arrival ceremony, not me. And I simply don't accept the proposition that observing their diplomatic protocol in any way undermines my capacity to advance the principles of the United States."
Addressing another issue that has generated opposition to his policy toward China, the President said his approval this year of China's launching an American satellite over the objections of the Justice Department was "a pretty routine decision" made on the recommendation of other agencies.
This was the first time that Mr. Clinton has addressed questions from the press on the satellite deal, which is the subject of a Congressional investigation. Lawmakers are seeking to learn whether American national security was harmed by the decision and whether the President was influenced by large campaign contributions from Bernard L. Schwartz, chief executive of the satellite maker, Loral Space and Communications Ltd.
The White House has rejected a call from 152 members of Congress that Mr. Clinton postpone his China trip until questions about the satellite deal have been resolved.
On Korea, Mr. Clinton rebuffed gentle pressure from Mr. Kim to ease American economic sanctions against Communist North Korea. Mr. Kim has argued publicly and privately that the United States sanctions are counterproductive, driving the fearful North Korean leadership further into isolation and alienation.
Mr. Kim said reconciliation between the Koreas and an improvement in United States-North Korea relations "should be promoted in harmony."
But Mr. Clinton said Mr. Kim had not directly asked him to lift the sanctions, adding:
"What he asked me to do was to work with him to support a policy of reciprocity, which would enable us to move forward with the reconciliation of the North and the South. And I said that I would be prepared to do that."
He said easing sanctions would require Congressional approval, but did not pledge to seek such changes. He hinted at some "executive flexibility" in some categories of economic punishment of the North, but did not promise to exercise his authority. "What I told President Kim I would do is to work with him," Mr. Clinton said.
The President also announced the resumption of loan guarantees for American companies doing business in Korea, after seven years of their being suspended by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Mr. Clinton said improved conditions for workers warranted the lifting of restrictions on the loan guarantees.
Mr. Clinton also said he and Mr. Kim had discussed a bilateral investment treaty, an "open skies" agreement for unrestricted airplane service between the United States and South Korea, and South Korea's recent decision to order $1 billion worth of Boeing airliners.
Much of the discussion between the two concerned South Korea's economic crisis, both a symptom and a cause of the financial panic gripping much of East Asia. Last year, the International Monetary Fund arranged a $58 billion rescue package for South Korea, helping stabilize exchange rates and slowing the downward slide of the economy.
Much of Mr. Kim's nine-day visit here is devoted to rebuilding investor confidence. On Monday in New York he visited the New York Stock Exchange and addressed American business leaders, reassuring them that South Korea was undertaking a sweeping reorganization of the economy, rooting out decades of corruption and featherbedding.
Mr. Kim's visit to the United States is his first since he became President in February, after a lifetime in opposition to what had for decades been a one-party state.
At an elaborate arrival ceremony at the White House this morning, Mr. Kim, who 17 years ago was under a death sentence from Seoul, was met by a 21-gun salute and warm praise. Mr. Clinton compared Mr. Kim to former protesters and political prisoners who rose to the leadership like Lech Walesa of Poland, Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and Nelson Mandela of South Africa. They are heroes who changed the world by their courage, Mr. Clinton said.
The President added, "Standing with me today is living proof, Kim Dae Jung, a human rights pioneer, a courageous survivor and America's partner in building a better future for the world."

HEADLINE: In Bilingual-Schooling Setback, Educators See Another Swing of Pendulum

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
With the defeat of bilingual schooling in California, educators around the country are examining that program's ill-fated path and drawing parallels to the outcome of other educational innovations of recent decades.
They say the story of bilingual education -- its rise in the 1960's, preceded by little research or experience in it; its mushrooming bureaucracy; the passion of its ill-prepared implementation, and, in California at least, its sudden abandonment for an equally unproved method -- is the story of American education. 
 Whether the issue is reading or mathematics, outcome-based education or open classrooms, public schooling in this country lurches from one trend to its opposite with alarming speed and little forethought, they say.
"It is the pendulum-swing approach to educational reform," asserted Patricia Albjerg Graham, professor of the history of education at Harvard University. "Bilingual education exemplifies the American enthusiasm to find a complete solution by going to extremes, when most solutions in fact are in the middle."
Chester E. Finn Jr., a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, put it this way: "Bilingual education, like every interesting idea, was eventually carried to a pernicious extreme and created its own backlash. It began for humane and reasonable motives. But it got distorted, twisted and turned into a caricature, with its interest groups and zealots and funding streams. The view was, If one year of bilingual education is good, two years must be better."
Bilingual education -- teaching immigrant children in their native language while they simultaneously learn English for several years -- has hardly vanished overnight. It exists in most states and has many backers and practitioners.
But it was decisively rejected last week by California voters, many of them Hispanic. Barring a successful court challenge, then, bilingual education will end in the state that is home to 45 percent of the nation's children with limited English skills. And other challenges to it, in the states and in Congress, suggest that its days as a widely hailed solution to the complex problems of immigrant absorption are numbered.
Yet the program that will replace bilingual education in California -- one year of so-called structured English immersion for all limited-English students, with minimal instruction in other subjects during that period, all of it in English -- comes equally untested. That was the main reason many of California's political leaders and editorial pages gave for opposing the anti-bilingual ballot initiative, Proposition 227.
"So much of what we do in education is a reaction to what we just did," said Marc S. Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, in Washington. "A lot of people I know would have supported Proposition 227 if it had included two to three years of English immersion rather than one, which is seen as draconian and hard to implement."
There has been a similar pattern in reading instruction, which has moved, on and off, from traditional phonics (the sounding out of words) to so-called whole language (looking for contextual clues to meaning). The same has been true of mathematics, where the tradition of drill and practice yielded to a more conceptually oriented approach of word problems and team solutions before emerging to the fore again.
The reading wars are not new -- Jeanne S. Chall, now retired from an education professorship at Harvard, wrote a book on the debate in 1967 -- but they have grown so intense that a committee of experts commissioned by the National Research Council sought to put an end to them by studying the issue. In a recent report, the committee said there was merit to both approaches and to a mixture of them.
"So often," Mr. Finn said, "the truth about these things can be summed up with the word 'both.' "
Theodore R. Sizer, chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools, a group advocating educational innovation, said being a teacher could be frustrating. "They tell you not to use phonics or whole language," Mr. Sizer said, "when in fact a good teacher uses both with an eye on who the kid is. We have this bad habit of giving simple encyclicals to define very complex issues."
That tendency appears to have grown more common in recent decades, with tugs-of-war inside the educational system serving increasingly as proxies for battles over larger societal concerns. (Larry Cuban, education professor at Stanford University, sees an analogy to the religious wars of earlier societies.)
This has been the case to some extent since public schooling was made compulsory in the last century, but even more so since the 1960's, when education began to be viewed as a means toward national as well as personal well-being. "The answer for all our national problems comes down to a single word," President Lyndon B. Johnson declared in 1965. "That word is 'education.' "
As a result, the war on poverty, absorption of immigrants and preparation of a new multicultural generation are all viewed as appropriate goals for the educational system. At the same time, parents look to schools as a cornerstone of their children's credentials and financial future. Each set of forces creates pressures to innovate, but not necessarily in the same direction.
One factor in the failure of some innovations is the unacknowledged difficulty of undertaking them. Since reform often comes in response to a pressing problem -- immigration, delinquency, international competition -- adjusting the system to meet the need is like repairing an airplane in midflight.
In "The Right to Learn" (Jossey-Bass, 1997), Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor of education at Columbia University, noted that after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik four decades ago, American policy makers felt an urgent need to improve teaching. But despite research showing that approaches like "discovery learning" and team teaching prepared students to think more critically than did the rote approach of previous years, efforts to incorporate the new methods largely failed because teachers were not properly instructed in them.
"Perhaps the single biggest obstacle to maintaining progressive reforms is the extensive skill needed to teach both subjects and students well," Dr. Darling-Hammond wrote.
This is evident in the current examinations of what has gone wrong with bilingual education. Finding teachers who were fully bilingual was itself difficult, let alone making sure that they were also skilled and fully trained.
Catherine Snow, a professor of education at Harvard who was chairwoman of the National Research Council committee that examined the teaching of reading, said the trouble with many reforms is that "there is inadequate recognition of how much professional quality it takes to do a good job of them."
Most education research, Professor Snow said, is done by giving bold new ideas to first-rate teachers. Their successes produce "lots of descriptions of extremely wonderful, exciting classrooms and relatively few of average classrooms," she said. Far too little research, she added, takes the somewhat jaundiced but essential perspective: not of how good an approach can be when well done, but of how bad it will be when badly done.
Other experts say methods are less important than the presence of dedicated and thoughtful teachers.
"Many educational practices succeed by dint of our wanting them to succeed," argued Philip W. Jackson, professor of education at the University of Chicago.
Gerald Graff, a colleague of Professor Jackson at Chicago, says the cloistered nature of the classroom lets ignorance, misinformation and paranoia flourish among the general public outside. Educators, Professor Graff says, must acknowledge a growing and legitimate public concern over education and take initiatives to explain themselves better, or face ill-informed tinkering by politicians and voters.
"The main experience of education historically is that of failed efforts," he said. "The more we fail, the more we try new things, and so you get these desperate swings.
"We fail partly because democratic education is such a tough challenge. It is a relatively new idea in the world to educate anything more than the elite. But the more people see they have a stake in it, the more fighting over it there will be. Something this valuable and expensive is going to be fought over politically, and we educators have to be prepared to take part in that fight."

HEADLINE: Wage Gap Between the Sexes Is Narrowing

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
The strong economy and an increase in the minimum wage have helped narrow the wage gap between the sexes by about 3 cents on the dollar since last spring, the Clinton Administration has reported.
"White, college-educated males have always done the best, but as the economy gets tighter, other people get more opportunities," Rick McGahey, the Assistant Labor Secretary for Policy, said on Monday. 
 With unemployment at its lowest level in 28 years, companies are scrambling to find and keep workers, opening higher paying jobs and promotions to women and members of minorities.
In addition, since women still tend to be concentrated in the lowest-paying jobs, the increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour last summer is also credited with helping to improve their earning power compared with men, Mr. McGahey said.
In the 12 months ending March 31, the median weekly wage for women working full time grew 6.6 percent, to $455 from $427, the department said. Men's median wage grew by 2.4 percent, to $596 from $582.
As a result, women earned 76 cents for every dollar men made in the first quarter of 1998, compared with 73 cents in the same period of 1997.

HEADLINE: Signing Bonus Now a Fixture Farther Down the Job Ladder

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Unable to hire enough teachers, the Dallas school board voted last month to lure them with $1,500 signing bonuses. Corporate recruiters paid out much larger bonuses -- averaging $17,500 -- to Cornell's business school graduates. Even Burger King has got into the bonus game, offering $5,000 in some cities to hire away restaurant managers from rival fast-food chains.
The signing bonus is proliferating in America, and growing ever larger as employers bid for scarce workers. A recruiting tool that had been limited to upper-level managers, highly skilled technicians and athletes, it is spreading today to many others, even civil servants. The Labor Department, for example, is for the first time offering a bonus of up to $4,000 to attract young economists. 
 The hiring bonus appears to be flourishing because employers, faced with the lowest unemployment rate in a quarter-century, have shifted some of the bargaining from wages to the less costly one-time payments. And job applicants, accepting the shift, often welcome the bonus as a windfall to pay off accumulated debt, or as a measure of their value -- and status -- in the eyes of their new employers.
One 30-year-old woman, recently hired as a consultant at Price Waterhouse, accepted the proffered $85,000 salary without challenge, but balked at the $5,000 signing bonus. "I barely had to say that $5,000 was not enough, and they said, 'Fine, would $10,000 make you happy?' and I got that," she said. She declined to give her name out of concern, she said, that other newly hired consultants at Price Waterhouse who got smaller bonuses might be resentful.
The hiring bonus is just the latest tool that companies have turned to in recent years to hold down wages. The others include profit sharing, flexible schedules, tuition subsidies, stock options, health club memberships and "performance" bonuses in lieu of raises for those already on the payroll. While wages are now rising a bit faster than they have in a decade, hiring bonuses are ballooning and spreading across the work force -- absorbing some of the pressure for still-greater income.
"Signing bonuses are certainly rising faster than starting salaries," said Stephen Johansson, director of career services at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. "It is much harder to raise the starting salaries because you end up having to pay people coming in the door more than those who have been there two or three years and have done well. Most companies have avoided raising wage scales."
The American Management Association, in a new survey of its corporate members, found that 44 percent of the 344 who replied paid signing bonuses to employees hired in the last year. That was up from 30 percent last spring, the first time the association even asked about the practice in its surveys.
"A lot of our clients offer the base pay up front, and then the bonus in a second interview as the kicker to get people in the door," said Jamie Hale, an executive at Watson Wyatt, the management consulting firm. "The bonuses range from 5 to 15 percent of a year's salary. In some cases, people have to pay them back if they leave within six months. But if you attach too many strings, the bonuses are not going to do what they are supposed to do, which is get people on board."
For all its growing popularity, the signing bonus is hard for the Federal Government to track and is not calculated as part of the Employment Cost Index, a broad Federal measure of worker compensation. The index converts the various forms of income and benefits into pay per hour. For the bonus, however, that cannot be easily done, officials explain, because it has already been paid by the time a new employee starts working.
That means people have more spending money than the income statistics suggest. In addition, labor costs may be putting greater pressure on companies to raise prices than the Employment Cost Index now indicates. The Federal Reserve considers the index an important indicator of whether inflationary pressures are building up sufficiently to justify an increase in interest rates to slow the economy.
One measure of the bonus's popularity is its spread over the last year or so to most fast-food companies. "If you are going to get good people, you have to take them from a competitor, and the way to get them is the bonus," said Anthony Austin, vice president for human resources at Burger King, a unit of Diageo P.L.C.
Not that every Burger King employee gets one. Rarely are they disbursed in Montana, say, or in other places where unemployment is not so low. But in the tight labor markets of a Milwaukee or a Tampa, Fla., the company finds itself paying an $8,000 to $10,000 bonus to recruit a $50,000-a-year area manager, and $3,000 to $5,000 to win someone to a $35,000-a-year job as a restaurant manager.
"Someone else will pay the bonus if you don't," Mr. Austin said.
But counter clerks, earning $6 or $7 an hour, are not yet in the loop. The odds are too great that they would take a $200 bonus and quit within a week, Mr. Austin said. Instead, they get that amount as a "retention" bonus if they stay for six months.
Sometimes, when a worker shifts to a new employer, the signing bonus compensates for a benefit lost at the old job. That happened to Sarah Peters, who joined the Principal Financial Group in Des Moines last month as a writer in the public relations department, earning more than $35,000 a year. She shifted from a similar job at Mid-American Energy, a Des Moines power company.
"Principal recruited me," said Ms. Peters, who is 25, "but I have my wedding coming up in October and I hesitated to accept; it meant giving up the vacation time I had accumulated for my honeymoon."
As a signing bonus, Principal granted her a one-time-only extra week of paid time off, to be taken whenever Ms. Peters wishes. Normally, an employee at Principal, a big insurance company, earns one paid day off, to be taken as vacation or sick leave, for each two months of work. "Principal is the employer of choice for anyone in Des Moines," Ms. Peters said, "but without that vacation bonus, I would have definitely thought twice about taking the job."
No one is more a target of the signing bonus than the college graduate -- not only those receiving an M.B.A., but even those getting a simple bachelor's degree. Rather than push against stiff resistance to a higher salary, they are often satisfied, some experts say, to pocket a fat up-front bonus because they feel they will move on anyway to another job in two or three years.
Three of every 10 graduates at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte got bonuses this spring, up from one in 10 two years ago, according to a school survey. And at Cornell's management school, which had 260 graduates this spring, 90 percent of the new M.B.A.'s who responded to a survey said they had received bonuses from their new employers. That was up from 63 percent two years ago.
More striking were the skyrocketing amounts. The $17,500 average bonus for this year's Cornell M.B.A. class was nearly double the 1996 average of $9,400, and 43 percent above last year's $12,200.
The bonus is spreading, for the first time, to the public sector. The Labor Department has just started to use it, in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as has the Census Bureau. An act of Congress is required to raise Civil Service pay scales, but bonuses are legal under a rarely invoked provision in the law. In recent months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has paid bonuses of $2,000 to $4,000 to nine newly hired employees, seven of them economists.
"I hired one guy and there was a competing bonus from another agency," said Michael Allen, a personnel specialist at the bureau. "The compensation packages were basically equal and he wanted to work with us, but without the bonus he would not have accepted."
Short of teachers, the Baltimore Board of Education voted last month to pay $5,000 to new teachers buying a home within the city. There are two strings attached: The bonus must be used for the home purchase and must be paid back if the teacher leaves the job in less than five years.
In Texas, the school boards in Dallas and Fort Worth are engaged in what amounts to a bonus war. Fort Worth led off earlier this year with a set of bonuses starting at $500 and rising to $2,000 for applicants who signed contracts by June 1.
The Dallas board countered last month. Faced with 900 openings for the coming school year, the board authorized a flat $1,500 for each new hire. More than 200 signed up at a job fair on May 30, including Linda Livingston, a 50-year-old English teacher who had taught public school before and wanted the $28,500-a-year job to help put two children through college.
"The bonus is kind of nice," she said, "but that is all; you can go through the money pretty fast."
But for Vicki Parker, a junior high school teacher currently on leave who lives in Winifred, Mont., the bonus being offered by Dallas made all the difference in the world. Hearing of it on a radio news broadcast, she immediately applied and her papers are being processed. "I have cousins in Dallas," she said.
Montana has a surplus of teachers and Ms. Parker, who is 40 and single, has never earned more than $17,000 a year in the state.
"Whenever a school system is willing to offer a bonus, there is a need," she said. "The $1,500 isn't so much, but they are probably willing to do extra things for me, because they need me, which is not the case here."

HEADLINE: Logjam on Bill To Cut Smoking Starts to Unclog

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Signs developed today that the Senate's weeks-long impasse on anti-smoking legislation might be broken.
The Senate voted, 52 to 46, for a Republican amendment to use some of the money that would be raised from higher cigarette prices on drug abuse programs. The vote was the first on the legislation in three weeks, and plans were made to vote on Wednesday on proposals to use other money from the tobacco legislation for income-tax cuts. 
 No one involved was prepared to assert that the bill was out of the woods. But in a brief interview, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said, "If we're going to start having some votes, then something might happen."
This was a different tack from the one Mr. Lott took on Monday, when he said the bill was such bad legislation that it should be withdrawn. Approval of the anti-drug measure, along with expected adoption of the tax cuts, "does change the mix," he said tonight.
In a telephone conversation just before President Clinton's news conference this afternoon, Senator Lott told the President of the progress. When he was asked about the legislation, the President said:
"I do believe that the possibility of getting a comprehensive bill out of the Senate is greater now than it was this morning. There are still problems, to be sure. But we are getting closer to, I think, a principled compromise."
Senator John McCain, the chief sponsor of the bill, agreed. "Reports of the death of this legislation were premature," he said. But Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, quickly added that "a lot of difficult hurdles" remained before the bill could be brought to a final vote.
The basic bill, meant to discourage teen-age smoking, would raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack over five years, expand Federal regulation of tobacco marketing and advertising, and require the cigarette makers to pay stiff penalties if youth smoking did not fall to specified levels.
Most Democrats have argued that it is the most important public health measure to come before Congress in years. Republicans have countered that the legislation is a futile effort to deal with a public health problem by raising taxes and creating new Government programs.
The measure to be considered on Wednesday would give tax breaks to couples filing joint returns and to self-employed workers who must pay for their own medical insurance. That and the anti-drug measure approved tonight give Republicans the opportunity to argue that they have turned the legislation into one that fits Republican principles.
Republican leaders in the House are still unenthusiastic about the direction the legislation in the Senate is taking. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, told reporters today that his associates were working on a stripped-down bill that would not raise the price of cigarettes.
The Congressional elections this fall are a motif that influences the entire debate. Democrats have made clear that if strong anti-smoking legislation does not pass, they will accuse Republicans of doing the bidding of the tobacco companies. But Democrats have been forced into supporting income-tax cuts to keep the Republicans themselves from having a strong campaign issue.
The logjam in the Senate came unstuck today during a series of private meetings that followed an unsuccessful Democratic move to cut off debate on the legislation. The Democratic effort, called cloture, was rejected by 56 to 42 -- 18 votes shy of the 60 needed for approval.
All the Republicans who voted, even such anti-smoking stalwarts as John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Mr. McCain himself, opposed stopping the debate, treating the matter as a challenge to the Republican leadership. All the Democratic senators who voted were in favor of cloture except for two from tobacco states, Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky and Charles S. Robb of Virginia.
Both sides agreed that the cloture vote had caused senators to focus on the issue. Senator Lott said Democrats had become willing to compromise because "they saw we wouldn't crack on cloture."
Democrats had a different explanation. They said Senator Lott's hand had been forced because he knew he could not keep Republicans who favor tobacco legislation in line on future votes to cut off debate. New cloture votes are set for Wednesday and Thursday.
One of the most ardent opponents of the legislation, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said tonight that the changes being made might swing him around. "This is a step in the right direction," he said.
The Republican amendment approved tonight, on what was virtually a party-line vote, would spend part of the money raised from higher cigarette prices to beef up Federal efforts against drug trafficking and to give vouchers to children who are victims of drug-related crimes so they can attend private or parochial schools. The amendment would also prohibit Federal money from being used for needle-exchange programs.
After approving the Republican amendment, the Senate rejected, 53 to 45, a Democratic alternative that would also have put more money into drug interdiction programs. The Democratic proposal would not have included vouchers for schoolchildren, however, and would have limited the moratorium on needle exchanges to one year.
Senator McCain said that beyond the drug and income-tax issues, only a few contentious topics remained. One involves the kind of assistance that would be given to tobacco farmers and to communities whose economy is dependent on tobacco farming and cigarette manufacturing.

HEADLINE: House to Vote Today on Legislation for Bankruptcy Overhaul

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
The House is preparing to vote on Wednesday on the first major overhaul of the bankruptcy system in two decades, legislation that could allow the credit and banking industries to reap billions of dollars.
Coming at a time when credit-card lending is among the most profitable sectors of an intensely competitive banking industry that has little room for growth, the legislation has prompted the credit-card and banking businesses to spend millions of dollars to push the bill. 
 The theory of the measure, sponsored in the House by Representative George W. Gekas, Republican of Pennsylvania, is that thousands of people are shucking their responsibilities, driving up their debt and then declaring themselves insolvent under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, which forgives most debts. The legislation would make it more difficult for consumers to use Chapter 7 while giving banks, credit-card companies, department stores and other lenders more authority to recoup what they are owed.
The industry estimates that of the 1.37 million people who filed for bankruptcy last year, 15 percent to 25 percent had the means to pay their debts. It says that the debts of these dishonest people are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices and higher interest rates that cost every American household about $400 a year. The industry estimates that by reducing the number of people who file under Chapter 7 and putting others on a more rigorous repayment schedule, it could recoup $4 billion a year.
Many Democrats in Congress and consumer advocates have criticized the bill as a billion-dollar bouquet to the credit-card industry. They say that while companies complain about people not paying their debts, they also send out more than two billion "pre-approved" credit-card solicitations annually -- 12 for each person in the United States. Critics say this can tempt vulnerable people to borrow more.
"They could easily see a billion a year in windfall profits from this legislation," Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School and strong critic of the bill, said of the credit-card industry. "They will do it by squeezing hard-pressed families out of the bankruptcy system and continuing to collect from them $50 here and $50 there."
That could add up to billions, Professor Warren said.
The full Senate is to take up a more lenient version of the bill this summer. Both versions would apply only to people filing for bankruptcy whose incomes are above the national median of $50,000 a year for a family of four. Those earning less, could file under Chapter 7, or under Chapter 13, which allows a judge to set a repayment schedule.
Under the House bill, debtors who are deemed able to repay 20 percent of their debt over five years would not be allowed to file under Chapter 7. The Senate version gives the bankruptcy judge more leeway in setting a repayment plan.
If committee votes are any indication, the House and Senate will pass their versions of the bill, and will have to reconcile them. The Clinton Administration has said it opposes the House bill in its present form.
In a May 21 letter to Congress, Jacob Lew, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, objected to a provision that would impose what he described as "a rigid and arbitrary" income test to determine who could file for bankruptcy.
Both President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have also expressed concern that the legislation would force debtors to repay credit-card companies before making alimony and child-support payments.
The bill is clearly a priority for the industry. Last year alone, over 100 financial-services companies spent more than $40 million to push it and other banking legislation through Congress, according to lobbying-disclosure records. Much of that money rained down here on the K Street corridor of professional lobbying firms. The records do not include the undoubtedly higher amounts spent so far this year, when scores of lawyers and industry lobbyists swarmed over the House and Senate Judiciary Committees as they gaveled the bankruptcy bill to approval.
The bankruptcy issue has been cooking along behind the scenes on Capitol Hill for a couple of years. But even as it has drawn closer to the floor, it has been overshadowed by tobacco legislation and other matters. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, described the bankruptcy bill as "a freight train going 90 miles an hour."
Referring to the hordes of financial-services lobbyists who have been packing the Capitol corridors, Mr. Dodd added: "It's hard to find someone on K Street who hasn't been called in to work on this bill."
Virtually anyone who is owed money has spent money lobbying for the bill. Included are department stores like J. C. Penney, which spent $500,000 on banking legislation last year, and Sears Roebuck, which spent $240,000, according to records on file with Congress. The International Council of Shopping Centers devoted $360,000.
The reports for the first six months of 1998 are due in August.
Eager to see this legislation are the credit-card companies and other money lenders. Visa spent $1.3 million last year on lobbying, according to records, and Mastercard International spent $390,000. The Money Store, a financial services company based in Union, N.J., with a loan portfolio of $10 billion, spent $1.2 million on lobbying last year.
Many interested parties turned to experienced K Street lobbyists to push the issue. The American Financial Services Association, the main trade group that provides credit to consumers, paid $600,000 to the firm of Barbour Griffith & Rogers.
Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, is a senior partner in the firm. The association also helped organize fund-raisers for Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, and Representative Bill Jenkins, Republican of Tennessee, who co-sponsored the legislation.
In addition, the industry has increased its campaign contributions to members of both houses who are playing major roles in the bill's move through Congress. Under the banner of the National Consumer Bankruptcy Coalition, the industry has given $1.6 million to House and Senate candidates so far in the 1997-98 election cycle, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Bruce Markell, a bankruptcy specialist at Indiana University Law School, said the bill was a priority for lenders because credit cards were so profitable. Three-fourths of all households have at least one, and three-fourths of those carry debt from month to month at high rates of interest, often around 18 percent. The prime audience for credit cards, he said, is women 25 to 40.
"They make money on being able to target those people who incur debt and can barely pay it off," Mr. Markell said, noting the widespread opportunities to use credit cards these days to buy almost everything.
At the end of 1997, Americans owed $422 billion in credit-card loans, twice as much as at the end of 1993.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
The Public Ambition of A Private Firm

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
As the partners of Goldman, Sachs & Company debate whether to turn Wall Street's premier private investment bank into a public company, they might mull over this paradox: They are earning record profits advising clients to do deals they themselves would never do.
As a partnership, Goldman does not issue stock, the basic currency of big mergers and acquisitions. So while it helped link Daimler A.G. to the Chrysler Corporation and brought BankAmerica together with Nationsbank, two of the biggest deals in the global rush to consolidate, Goldman has husbanded its partners' capital and shunned the risky mergers game. 
 All that may change, some Goldman insiders say, if the partners back a plan to go public at the firm's annual meeting on Friday. Going public would help Goldman buy other firms to expand at home and abroad. It would level the playing field with its fast-growing rivals, including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Salomon Smith Barney, all of which are publicly owned.
Some outside bankers say that public ownership might make Goldman a target for big commercial banks, though few expect Goldman would agree to any deal that could compromise its fiercely independent culture.
How aggressive Goldman becomes depends on how partners react to the firm's strategic plan, a study of options drawn up under the leadership of Henry M. Paulson Jr., Goldman's co-chief executive. People familiar with the broad outlines say it explores ways that Goldman, as a public company, could rapidly expand in areas in which it considers itself small or weak.
Among the most likely acquisition targets: a major American or European asset management company or a Japanese brokerage house. Goldman in the past has sought close ties with T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based mutual fund manager with about $100 billion in assets. Some Goldman bankers say the firm should also consider an alliance with Daiwa Securities, Japan's second-largest broker after Nomura and the only leader there that has yet to find a partner.
Goldman wants to add to the mutual funds and other assets it manages so that it can rely more on recurring fees and less on volatile trading and underwriting revenues. Nearly all major American brokers have tried to grab a bigger share of Japan's securities market, especially since that country's long recession has reduced the cost and barriers to entry.
"The question is how to expand more quickly," said a Goldman partner who will participate in Friday's debate and declined to be identified. "No one wants to radically remake the firm. But there is some frustration that we are not a part of all the deal making."
Any shopping spree by Goldman would add to the financial world's consolidation frenzy, especially if the respected banking house puts its seal of approval on the recent trend of combining insurance, commercial banking and investment banking. It would also be a sign that in the race to become global players, even the most successful banks and fund managers need a public currency -- stock -- to make transactions.
By some measures, Goldman has fallen behind leading rivals. It manages $160 billion in assets, well under Merrill Lynch's $450 billion. Goldman's elite client list is the envy of Wall Street. But Morgan Stanley has combined its blue-chip corporate business with a retail brokerage network selling stocks to Main Street investors, earning the steady fees and high margins those accounts bring.
A Goldman spokesman said on Monday that even if the partners decided to take the firm public, that did not mean Goldman would abandon its strategy of growing internally rather than through acquisitions. He rejected as "rumors" the idea that Goldman had an informal shopping list of companies it would like to buy.
The spokesman agreed that to have stock to make purchases was a factor in the debate over issuing shares, but added, "I don't think it's a primary factor." He added, "It's a factor in the sense that you don't know what the world will be like, and this gives you more options."
Goldman has considered and rejected the idea of selling shares as part of an expansion plan half a dozen times in recent years, and it might decide to pass this time as well. Profits, after all, are running at a record level, with the firm set to earn more than $2 billion in this year's first half, compared with about $3 billion all of last year. Most of those profits come from the firm's bread-and-butter business of trading, underwriting and providing client advice.
And even if Goldman could tap public capital markets instead of relying primarily on partners' capital, it would not necessarily follow the path blazed by other Wall Street financiers, like Sanford I. Weill of the Travelers Group. Mr. Weill recently agreed to merge his company with Citicorp, the largest financial deal in history.
"I would think that the idea of being part of Citibank would send shivers up and down the spine of every person at Goldman," said one retired partner, who asked not to be named. "On the other hand, the firm has to have the currency to make strategic acquisitions. It now has its hands tied."
In the past, the firm has tended to grow internally, making only small acquisitions. When Goldman wanted to break into the European asset management fund business, it bought the small British pension fund manager Cinman, a deal valued at the time at less than $100 million. When the publicly traded Merrill Lynch pursued a similar vision last year, it snapped up the leading European player, Mercury Asset Management, paying $5.3 billion.
Similarly, several American investment banks have scrambled to expand their presence in Japan. Goldman has performed well there but has fallen behind rivals like Merrill and Salomon in striking alliances. Salomon earlier this month spent $1.6 billion for a 25 percent stake in Nikko Securities. To date, Goldman has followed a more conservative strategy in Japan, finding partners to help distribute its mutual funds but avoiding major capital commitments.
A small number of current and retired Goldman executives at least loosely entertain the idea of much bigger deals. One possibility is a merger with a commercial bank eager for Goldman's investment banking expertise. Chase Manhattan, J. P. Morgan and BankAmerica, three of the largest American banks, would make the most logical fits, some bankers say.
All of those banks have stock market values so far above even the highest values placed on a public offering by Goldman that they could swallow the Wall Street firm with little trouble. All have strong traditional banking businesses but lag far behind Goldman in investment banking.
If the firm decides to issue stock priced at $20 a share, "then Chase offers us $25 a share, we would at least have to consider it," said one current Goldman partner. "My own feeling is that the way to unlock Goldman's true value is through a merger" rather than a public offering of stock, he added.
But such alliances remain long shots. Even if Goldman decides to go public, it seems unlikely to risk diluting the tightly integrated, highly motivated culture it has nurtured over recent decades by blending itself with a large outsider.
Moreover, Goldman is not only one of Wall Street's most profitable creations, it is also one of its most egocentric. Bankers there say they would never agree to be dominated by a commercial bank, with its eight-hour days and fatter management structure. Thus, Goldman would insist on a difficult reverse merger in any linkup with a big commercial bank, putting its own executives in control of a combined entity.
At any rate, Goldman will probably need all its in-house mergers and acquisitions expertise if it decides to go public. "I wonder if they know the kind of pressure they will be under if they actually pull the trigger," said one outside banker.

Blue-Chip Rally Fades, But Internet Shares Gain
A three-day rally in blue-chip stocks lost stamina, leaving major market gauges mixed. The stumble illustrated some renewed concerns about the corporate earnings outlook and the prospect for interest rate changes ahead of Congressional testimony today by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.68 points, to 9,049.92. But sharp gains among some Internet-related shares pushed technology stocks higher, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 12.99 points, to 1,800.76, its fourth straight gain and first close above 1,800 since May 22. Drug and transportation shares also gained. Page D9. 

Treasury prices were little changed, as investors awaited today's testimony. D9.
 
Boeing to Cut 747 Production

HEADLINE: NEW HEALTH PLANS DUE FOR ELDERLY

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Thirty-eight million Medicare beneficiaries will soon be flooded with information about new health insurance options, and most of them are likely to be thoroughly confused, consumer advocates, members of Congress and Medicare officials say.
The new options were created by Congress last year to give beneficiaries a wider variety of choices, like those available to many workers in private industry who receive insurance coverage from their employers. 
 But Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, who is supervising the new program, said, "Many beneficiaries do not understand the basics of the original Medicare program," much less the exotic variations of managed health care devised by Congress.
The Government plans an extensive education and publicity campaign and will soon send a new Medicare handbook, with a detailed description of all the options, to every Medicare beneficiary's household.
Federal officials said they had tested the materials in "focus groups" of beneficiaries and said the results were not encouraging. Beneficiaries are often overwhelmed by the number of choices, Mr. Hash said, and "even well-educated beneficiaries have difficulty understanding them all."
Illene Gordon, a caseworker for Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, predicted that Congressional offices would "be flooded with calls" from constituents baffled by the Medicare options, which include not only health maintenance organizations, but also preferred-provider organizations, provider-sponsored organizations, medical savings accounts and private fee-for-service plans.
John C. Rother, director of legislation and public policy at the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "Most beneficiaries will have a hard time sorting through the new choices because of their complexity, and because the Medicare population has very little experience with managed care. It's not what they had when they were working. We can anticipate a high level of confusion."
The new options, most of which will become available late this year, offer the possibility of extra benefits, including prescription drugs and other items not covered by the standard Medicare program, the national health care plan for the elderly. But they may also expose beneficiaries to higher costs and more uncertainty.
Equally important, the new options represent a great national experiment in health policy, enabling private health plans to compete with Medicare's Government-run insurance program. Consumers will decide which model works best.
Different options will be available in different parts of the country, and no one knows for sure how many private health plans will enter the potentially lucrative Medicare market. If beneficiaries are satisfied with their health care, they do not have to make a change.
Six million beneficiaries are in an H.M.O. or another type of managed care today. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the number will soar to 17 million by 2008.
Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, a psychiatrist, said: "I am really worried that when 38 million beneficiaries -- 26 million households -- get the new Medicare handbook, confusion will reign. Our casework staff will be inundated with questions just before the November elections."
Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, said the handbook was "a waste of $40 million." In fact, Mr. Stark said, "it could actually be worse than a waste of money because of the confusion it will create for seniors and their families."
An excerpt from the handbook reads: "If you had a supplemental policy and dropped it to enroll in a Medicare managed care plan, or Medicare Select policy for the first time, and you choose to disenroll from the Medicare health plan or Medicare Select policy within 12 months of enrolling, then you can go back to the Medigap policy you had before joining the Medicare health plan, if it is still offered, or purchase Medigap policies A, B, C or F. This protection is only available during the 63 days after leaving the health plan."
Dr. Robert A. Berenson, director of the Center for Health Plans and Providers at Medicare, said he doubted that his 85-year-old mother would fully understand the new options, even though she used to work in a doctor's office.
Judith H. Hibbard, a professor of health policy at the University of Oregon in Eugene, said: "Some of these options are so new and so complex, it's very difficult for anyone to know what is best, or even what questions to ask. It's uncharted territory."
Marilyn Moon, a trustee of the Medicare trust fund, said at least 20 percent of beneficiaries had Alzheimer's disease, memory problems or other mental impairments that would make it difficult for them to understand the new options. And that does not include people with low literacy skills or very poor eyesight, said Ms. Moon, an economist at the Urban Institute.
Nationwide surveys by the Education Department have found that 40 percent of the elderly have very limited ability to read and use printed materials.
On the other hand, many older people are active and alert, well versed in the complexities of medical care and money management. Younger beneficiaries may have had some experience with managed care in their working years.
Most of the health plans will become available late this year. But they may begin enrolling Medicare beneficiaries sooner, if they have signed contracts with the Federal Government.
In most cases, the new plans will receive a fixed amount of Federal money for each beneficiary, regardless of how much care the person requires. By contrast, under the original Medicare program, doctors receive a separate fee for each service they perform, and hospitals are paid an additional amount each time a patient is admitted.
The changes in Medicare have profound implications for thousands of employers who provide health benefits to retirees, supplementing Medicare. Stephen Parahus of the Segal Company in New York, a consulting concern that specializes in employee benefits, said, "Many Medicare-eligible retirees will find the new array of choices bewildering."
Accordingly, Mr. Parahus said, employers "should brace themselves for a torrent of questions and requests for assistance."
The Government will answer questions about the new program on a toll-free telephone line. But the toll-free service will not be immediately available in all states, and consumer advocates predict that callers will face long waits because Medicare has not hired enough operators.
Mr. Hash estimated that the Government would need more than 2,000 people to answer calls at the busiest times of day.
The Medicare handbook will contain detailed information comparing the cost, benefits and performance of H.M.O.'s and other health plans. There will be more than 500 versions of this section of the handbook, each tailored to a specific local market, Mr. Hash said.
Another Medicare official, Jean D. LeMasurier, said, "It's really an absolutely overwhelming project" to compile such data, produce the handbooks and mail them to consumers.
Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, said, "We are very concerned about whether this old-fashioned Government bureaucracy can change in time to do the job of consumer education."
Medicare beneficiaries will also receive mail solicitations and brochures directly from H.M.O.'s and other health plans that want them to enroll.
But William J. Scanlon, director of health care issues at the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said the marketing materials often omitted important information and could mislead consumers.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said it was extremely difficult to compare the costs and benefits of private health plans being offered to Medicare beneficiaries because their brochures did not use a standard format or terminology.
Thus, for example, a health plan that offers to pay for $1,300 a year in prescription drugs might seem more attractive than a plan that covers only $1,000.
But, Mr. Scanlon said, the plans typically measure drug usage in different ways. Some use retail price, some use wholesale price and some use a discounted version of the wholesale price.

Older Americans and some disabled people will soon have more health insurance options. Here are the main alternatives authorized by Congress. Different options will be available in different parts of the country.
 
ORIGINAL MEDICARE. Beneficiaries can use any hospital and can go to any doctor who accepts Medicare patients. The Government regulates doctors' fees and most other aspects of the program.
 
HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION. Patients must use doctors, hospitals and suppliers approved by the H.M.O. But the plan may pay for prescription drugs and other items not covered by the Medicare program.
 
H.M.O. WITH POINT-OF-SERVICE OPTION. Patients meet most of their medical needs using doctors and hospitals on an approved list but may go outside the network if they are willing to pay extra.
 
PREFERRED-PROVIDER ORGANIZATION. Beneficiaries may use any doctors or hospitals, but are charged less if they use those on an approved list.
 
PROVIDER-SPONSORED ORGANIZATION. This plan is owned and operated by the doctors and hospitals that provide most of the services to beneficiaries.
 
PRIVATE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PLAN. Patients may go to any doctor or hospital, but there may be substantial costs for beneficiaries because the Federal Government does not limit the premiums that may be charged. The plan gets a fixed amount of Federal money for each beneficiary. Doctors are paid a separate fee for each service.
 
MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT. Beneficiaries choose a private insurance policy with a high deductible to cover catastrophic expenses. Medicare pays the premium and deposits money in a savings account, which is used to pay routine medical expenses. Patients may have to use their money to pay medical bills if the savings account is insufficient.

HEADLINE: Boeing to Increase Cuts in 747 Production

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company announced yesterday that weakening demand in Asia would force it to cut production of its wide-body jets even deeper than the company had previously indicated, resulting in further job cuts.
Boeing, the world's biggest aerospace company and the country's leading exporter, said it would cut production of the 747 jumbo jet by 30 percent early next year rather than the 20 percent reduction it had hinted at two weeks ago. It will also cut production of the newer 777 to five a month from seven a month. 
 The move surprised Wall Street analysts who follow Boeing because only a month ago the company was saying that strong orders for the 777 might force it to raise the rate above seven a month.
"Things must be moving fairly quickly for this to come out in the form it has," said Byron Callan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York.
The 747, which carries more than 400 passengers, is the biggest commercial jet on the market and is Boeing's most profitable airplane by a wide margin. But it is mostly used to fly over the Pacific Ocean to and from Asia. Since an economic crisis began to sweep over much of Asia nearly a year ago, air traffic has plunged, and many airlines have delayed orders for new airplanes.
"The continued slow traffic growth in Asia has caused some airlines to negotiate slides in deliveries of their 1999 747 orders or to substitute other Boeing airplane models for their existing 747 orders," said Fred Mitchell, Boeing's executive vice president of airplane production.
Boeing said it would reduce production of the 747 to 3.5 a month in the second quarter of 1999 from its current rate of 5 a month.
The company, based in Seattle, has been plagued by problems since last fall, when it was forced to halt production on the 747 and narrow-body 737 jets because it did not have enough parts and experienced workers to assemble the planes fast enough. The production difficulties have since forced the company to take billions of dollars in charges against earnings.
The great fear on Wall Street was that by the time Boeing recovered the boom in demand for new jets that began in 1996 would begin to subside. That sequence of events may appear to be coming to pass, though many analysts believe that strong demand for new aircraft will continue.
Boeing said yesterday that demand for its narrow-body planes, especially the latest version of the 737, the world's most popular commercial jetliner, remained strong. That is an indication of the continued strength of the economies in Europe and North America, where a larger number of smaller planes are used than in Asia. The company expected to increase production of the new 737 to 24 a month in the second quarter of next year from 21 a month.
Boeing also said that it expected the demand for the 777, which sits between 305 and 386 passengers, to pick up in 2000, when the company expects production to return to seven a month.
But analysts were skeptical. "If this crisis continues and we've had one rate decrease, I think people are going to ask: 'Is another one coming?' " Mr. Callan said.
Boeing said that the cutbacks would force it to eliminate more jobs. Last fall, the company said it would cut 12,000 jobs from the commercial airplane group by the end of this year. The division now employs nearly 120,000.
But Janice Hayes, a Boeing spokeswoman, said yesterday that it was unclear how many more jobs would be lost.
The production-cutback announcement came after the stock market closed. Earlier, Boeing shares rose 25 cents, to $46, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Drug Regulators Make Push To Rein In Herbal Remedies

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: FARMINGTON, Utah

 BODY:
Here at the base of the Rocky Mountains, in a region that is the heart of the nation's herbal and vitamin industry, a stainless steel contraption was hard at work on a recent morning, spitting out clear plastic capsules at the rate of 90,000 an hour. Each contained precisely 600 milligrams of a fine, brick-colored powder that Federal health officials are trying to ban.
The powder, a pulverized strain of rice fermented with red yeast, is imported from China, where it has been consumed for 2,000 years, as an herbal remedy (it is thought to improve blood flow) and a food (it spices up tofu and makes a tasty marinade for duck and pork.) Then five years ago, William McGlashan Jr., a young California venture capitalist, learned that scientists in Beijing were studying red yeast rice for another reason: it seemed to lower cholesterol. 
 Today, Pharmanex, Mr. McGlashan's company, sells the encapsulated red powder under the trade name Cholestin in 37,000 American stores, from health food outlets to the giant Wal-Mart chain. Mr. McGlashan calls Cholestin a dietary supplement. Officials at the Food and Drug Administration call it something else: an illegal, unapproved drug.
On June 15, in the gray stone Federal courthouse in Salt Lake City, United States District Judge Dale A. Kimball will be asked to determine who is correct. The case is being watched as a pivotal battle between the agency, which is chafing at a 1994 law that left it almost powerless to regulate vitamins and herbal products, and the dietary supplement industry, which has been growing wildly since the law was passed.
At issue is not whether Cholestin is dangerous; no one argues that it is. Rather, the agency contends that Cholestin has crossed the increasingly murky boundary that separates dietary supplements from drugs, because it contains an ingredient, lovastatin, that is the key component of a cholesterol-lowering drug. Pharmanex says the lovastatin occurs naturally in the rice and that Cholestin is more akin to a food than to a drug.
The outcome of the case could be reflected in the medicine and kitchen cabinets of millions of American consumers, including many doctors and scientists, who have come to believe that ginkgo, echinacea and St. John's wort, among other natural remedies, are as important to good health as aspirin and antibiotics.
Aside from the turf battle between the supplement industry and regulators, the dispute raises crucial questions: Is there a distinction between these herbal products, which may contain naturally occurring chemicals as potent as those in any drug, and the drugs themselves? Must products like Cholestin be subjected to the rigorous testing that drugs undergo?
"You see more and more dietary supplements sold right next to over-the-counter drugs," said William B. Schultz, the F.D.A.'s deputy commissioner for policy. "There is a risk that the line will blur.
Indeed, it is already blurry. "Foods are medicines; medicines are foods," said Loren Israelson, executive director of the Utah Natural Products Alliance, a trade group based in Salt Lake City that represents 10 of the nation's biggest supplement manufacturers. "If you drink coffee in the morning, why are you drinking coffee? You're looking for the caffeine, a stimulant. That same caffeine is sold over the counter as No Doz. That's a drug when it's in a pill form, and it's a food when it's in coffee. Why is that?"
The Food and Drug Administration struggled with such questions for decades. But with the passage of the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the law under which the Cholestin case will be decided, the agency's task grew even more vexing.
The new law moved dietary supplements out of the underground and into the mainstream, giving manufacturers like Pharmanex the long-sought right to advertise the potential benefits of herbs, even if the evidence for those benefits was sketchy. Unless the F.D.A. can prove the product is unsafe, companies can say what they wish, so long as they do not claim their products can prevent, treat or cure disease. Thus, Mr. McGlashan can advertise that Cholestin "promotes healthy cholesterol," but not that it "prevents heart attack or stroke."
"For the first time," he said, "we can educate the American consumer about what the product does. We don't have to rely on a person in a health food store to explain it."
Since the law was passed, the agency has received about 2,300 notifications from manufacturers intending to make claims about their products, and has objected to about 150 of them. It has also proposed a rule that would restrict, but not eliminate, the manufacturer's ability to use the herbal stimulant ephedra, which has been linked to more than a dozen deaths nationwide. It has banned one ephedra-based product and it is now trying to ban Cholestin.
Agency officials say the 1994 law, restrictive though it is, gives them the authority to take Cholestin off the market, because it bars companies from bringing dietary supplements to market if they contain the same active ingredients as previously approved drugs. In passing the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, Mr. Schultz says, Congress did not intend for companies to skirt the drug-approval process by selling medicines under the guise of dietary supplements.
Lawyers for Pharmanex, however, contend that Cholestin falls squarely within the intent of the 1994 law.
"This product was specifically developed to be a dietary supplement," said Daniel Kracov, a company lawyer. "What the F.D.A. objects to is the fact that this product has a drug substance in it, in their view. You may object to that, but our response is: If you don't have a safety issue, don't go after these products."
Whatever the outcome, Dr. David A. Kessler, the former Commissioner of Food and Drugs, says the agency's action will hardly make a dent in the rampant proliferation of herbal remedies that he says are ineffective at best and unsafe at worst.
"Just walk into your pharmacy; it's out of control," said Dr. Kessler, who waged a bitter, unsuccessful battle against the 1994 law as commissioner. "Efficacy is now defined as what sells off the shelves. The agency is powerless."
While the law was a disaster for regulators, it was a windfall for makers of dietary supplements and vitamins. After the act was adopted, annual sales of dietary supplements in the United States skyrocketed, jumping to nearly $12 billion last year from more than $8 billion in 1994, according to the Nutrition Business Journal, a trade publication.
So furious has the growth been that one analyst, Matthew Patsky of the Boston-based investment banking firm of Adams, Harkness & Hill, said some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies were planning to sell their own herbal products.
That worries Mr. Schultz, the F.D.A. deputy commissioner for policy. "If companies that would have tested their products and sold them as drugs are now going to not test them and sell them as dietary supplements," he said, "then we have lost information about the safety and efficacy of those products."
Among the law's beneficiaries was Mr. McGlashan, a 34-year-old Stanford University business school graduate who studied Chinese history. With the aging of baby boomers, Mr. McGlashan saw a growing demand for natural medicines the Chinese have used for centuries.
Mr. McGlashan says he had a vision for his business; he wanted to apply "pharmaceutical rigors" to the dietary supplement industry, using research to persuade consumers that Eastern therapies worked. In early 1994, he met Michael Chang, a former pharmaceutical industry researcher who had set up a plant to produce herbal medicines in Huzhou, China, near Shanghai.
Dr. Chang scoured Chinese research for promising herbal products, identifying 5,000; the list was narrowed to 30. By early 1995, Pharmanex was born, with headquarters in Simi Valley, Calif. Red yeast rice, called hong qu, was one its most promising projects.
"We know hong qu has been used for centuries, but we don't know why it lowers cholesterol," Dr. Chang said. "We need to find out."
The 1994 law, Mr. McGlashan said, made it worth investing in science. The company introduced Cholestin at the end of 1996, after nearly three years of study. Most recently, Pharmanex enlisted Dr. David Heber, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California at Los Angeles, to study the effects of Cholestin in adults with moderately elevated cholesterol.
The study, financed by Pharmanex, compared the cholesterol levels of 42 adults who took 2.5 grams of Cholestin every day for three months with the levels in 41 adults who were given placebos. Dr. Heber said the total cholesterol counts of those who took the supplement dropped, on average, from 250 to 210.
Dr. Heber dismisses the contention that red yeast rice is a drug; instead he calls it "a functional food." The same cholesterol-lowering ingredient in lovastatin, he notes, occurs in even higher concentrations in oyster mushrooms, commonly used in Asian cooking. And nobody, he said, is trying to ban mushrooms.
However, Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of psychopharmacology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, contends the current distinction between dietary supplements and drugs is based on semantics, not biology, and that both should be carefully regulated.
"If there is a biologically active component in the supplement, to say it is not a drug is illogical because it will have a similar effect," he said. Companies like Pharmanex, he added, "want to be able to implant the idea in the public that the drug is medically beneficial" without the rigorous research.
That kind of science, Mr. McGlashan admits, would cost far too much for a small company like his. Yet with a decent body of research behind Cholestin, he said, he at one time envisioned himself becoming the F.D.A.'s model for good behavior.
Instead, he received a visit from F.D.A. investigators last year; the agency had received complaints that Cholestin contained lovastatin, both from a pharmacist and from Merck and Company, which makes Mevacor, the cholestorol-lowering drug, known generically as lovastatin.
Shortly thereafter, Federal authorities impounded ten tons of red yeast rice. Then on May 20, the F.D.A. notified Mr. McGlashan that it considered Cholestin illegal, a move that led the company to ask for a hearing before Judge Kimball.
"This case is going to determine the extent to which companies can imitate prescription drugs," said Mr. Schultz of the F.D.A., "and avoid the approval process."
But Mr. McGlashan contends that the dispute is an economic one. Cholestin, he said, is intended for use by people who are too healthy for Mevacor. Merck, he contends, is trying to push Cholestin off the shelves -- a charge denied by Jan Weiner, a company spokeswoman.
While the court case is pending, Mr. McGlashan said, sales of Cholestin are booming. Even his mother called, he said, asking, "How am I supposed to get my Cholestin?"
For now, Mr. McGlashan has no answer. Standing outside the low-pressure room where the encapsulating machine was spinning, a lab coat covering his royal blue shirt and Hermes tie, he looked a little wistful. The fine red powder being packed into the capsules, he said, was the last of his supply.

HEADLINE: Bid to Expand Javits Center Loses Ground

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
State officials are scrambling to salvage a $750 million plan to expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the West Side of Manhattan, which has collided with the Giuliani administration's proposal to build a stadium for the New York Yankees and a developer's efforts to erect a sprawling apartment complex.
The state, which controls the Javits Center, had hoped to double the size of the center's exhibition space to 1.5 million square feet by extending the convention hall from 38th Street to 42d Street, a plan that officials and hoteliers said would enable New York to compete with other cities for tens of millions of dollars in convention business and anchor the western end of a rejuvenated Times Square. 
 But discussions between executives at the convention center and the developer, Larry A. Silverstein, who owns a key parcel of land needed for the expansion project, collapsed recently when the Giuliani administration failed to support the state's plans. Any state project north of the convention center would require city assistance to close streets and redirect traffic.
Real estate executives and state officials say Mr. Silverstein decided to go ahead with plans to build apartments on the city after concluding that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani would not approve expansion plans that did not include a baseball stadium just south of the Javits Center.
"There's nothing happening with the expansion of the convention center on 42d Street," Mr. Silverstein said. "So we're going forward with our project. To sit and wait makes no sense at all. I couldn't afford to delay this any further." His decision to move ahead on the apartment plan was first reported this week in Crain's New York Business.
Officials of the Giuliani administration insist that the stadium and convention center issues are separate. "We're continuing to consider proposals for the expansion of the convention center," said Randy L. Levine, the Deputy Mayor, "but we are not going to stand in the way of any alternate development."
Even so, officials of the Pataki administration have recently expressed deep frustration with Mr. Giuliani for not helping their cause in trying to expand the Javits Center. And they believe that the city wants a quid pro quo: support for the stadium in return for help with the Javits expansion.
But aides to Gov. George E. Pataki have expressed grave doubt about the West Side plan, and so far the Governor has done little to support it, saying only that he hoped that the team would remain at its historic home in the Bronx.
Real estate executives and state officials said the Javits expansion was only the latest example of how the debate over a future home for the Yankees was overshadowing everything from the city budget to a new location for the New York Stock Exchange.
Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, said he was surprised that the Mayor had been concentrating so heavily on the stadium.
"The Yankees are sucking up all the oxygen at City Hall," Mr. Moss said. "It's shocking to think that a baseball stadium is more important than a convention center or stock exchange. New York's future lies in tourism, finance, communications and entertainment, not in professional baseball."
Mr. Giuliani has revived a plan to build a billion-dollar stadium on the West Side of Manhattan that he said would prevent the Yankees from leaving New York and generate $1 billion a year in economic activity.
The administration has commissioned several studies and recently set up a delegation of nine officials to visit new ball parks in other cities to assess their economic impact. On May 28, the group led by Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, and Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corporation, visited Baltimore and Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
"I guess that says something when folks come out of New York to see how others do it," said Charles Graves, the director of city planning in Baltimore, who met with the delegation. "We talked about design, siting, political and economic issues. And they had a chance to see a first-rate luxury sky box."
Rather than wait for the Javits expansion, Mr. Silverstein plans to build two residential towers with 1,800 apartments on the block along 42d Street, between 11th and 12th Avenues. The apartment complex would form an insurmountable roadblock to what state officials said was the best route for the expansion.
State officials were urging Mr. Silverstein yesterday to reconsider. At the same time, the officials are reluctant to press the Mayor because they want to avoid an open battle with him during Gov. George E. Pataki's re-election campaign.
"The last three years have proven how vital the Javits Center can be to New York," said Robert E. Boyle, chairman of the convention center. "We intend to build on that record. But in light of Mr. Silverstein's plans, we would have to consider less desirable options for expansion."
Real estate executives and state officials say privately that the problems with the Javits expansion are the latest example of the Giuliani administration's almost single-minded effort to resolve the future of Yankee Stadium.
On Monday, the Mayor vetoed nearly $5 million from the budget that the City Council had allocated for itself, surprising Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, who is in a dispute with the Mayor over the stadium. And last month, executives at the stock exchange threatened a move to New Jersey to get the attention of city officials, who the executives said were more concerned with baseball stadiums than dealing with the financial industry. Mr. Levine, the Deputy Mayor, rejected that contention, saying the city was in active discussions with the stock exchange about a future home in lower Manhattan or Battery Park City.
State officials had hoped to reach a compromise with Mr. Silverstein. In discussions with convention center executives earlier this year, he had agreed to swap his land on 42d Street for the right to build a large hotel or apartment tower over the expanded convention center.

HEADLINE: Nigeria's Opportunity

 BODY:
The death this week of Sani Abacha, the corrupt and abusive Nigerian military dictator, is an opportunity for an African giant to begin to lift itself from poverty, fear and decay. General Abacha so discredited military rule that in recent months even many officers began to join ordinary Nigerians in clamoring for a civilian government. Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who has taken over the Government, was one of those officers. He should put those ideas into practice.
Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, should also be the most prosperous. Oil revenues alone, if not depleted by corruption and mismanagement, should provide the basis for sustainable economic growth. It is also a diverse, culturally rich land stunted by years of tyranny. 
 Ideally, General Abubakar should turn the Government over to Moshood Abiola, a civilian who apparently won Nigeria's last democratic elections, five years ago this week. The military annulled the election, and Mr. Abiola was imprisoned in 1994 and has suffered there since.
The military seems to have another plan in mind. A spokesman for the Government said yesterday that it would turn power over to elected civilians by October. If the military holds free and open elections, this would be acceptable as well. But military leaders have repeatedly failed to deliver promised transitions to civilian rule. Even though people who know Mr. Abubakar call him the least corrupt and power-hungry of Nigeria's top generals, Nigerians are right to be skeptical. His first task should be to release all political prisoners and end the persecution of critics.
Outsiders can help with a clear call for democratic, civilian rule. A high-level American delegation bearing such an unambiguous message would be useful. Companies like Mobil, Chevron and Shell, which profit from Nigerian oil, have done little in the past to promote democratic rule. Mr. Abacha's death offers them a chance to use their considerable influence to discourage continued dictatorship. The one favor that Mr. Abacha may have done his country is to clarify that military rule is misrule.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Plans Personal Bid To Defuse Kosovo Crisis

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, June 9

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, seeking to forestall a NATO military incursion in the Serbian province of Kosovo, promised today to undertake a personal diplomatic effort with the Serbian leadership in an effort to defuse the violence there.
Speaking after a day of talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr. Yeltsin said NATO action would "destabilize the situation in the Balkans with unforeseeable consequences for all of Europe." 
 At the same time, German officials seem increasingly inclined toward charting a military course to stop the violence in Kosovo, where Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, has cracked down on an independence movement in the province, pitting Government forces against ethnic Albanian rebels.
"The more delicately we proceed, the greater are our chances for a settlement of the conflict," Mr. Yeltsin said. It was not clear when his effort would take place or exactly how it would be carried out.
NATO Defense Ministers are to meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the fighting in Kosovo, which has inspired deep concerns here about the likelihood of waves of refugees flooding Western Europe. Germany took in hundreds of thousands who fled during and after the Bosnian war and makes no secret of its aversion to providing shelter for more Balkan refugees.
The "contact group" on the Balkans -- the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Russia -- is to meet at the foreign ministers' level in London on Friday, along with Japan and Canada, to discuss Kosovo.
Volker Ruhe, the German Defense Minister, said today that it was crucial for the NATO ministers to examine military plans to augment economic and political pressures on Mr. Milosevic.
For his part, Mr. Kohl said at a joint news conference with Mr. Yeltsin that Germany -- Russia's biggest trading partner and creditor -- would offer "decisive support" for Moscow as it seeks to contain an economic crisis and pursues economic reform. "These measures contribute significantly to increasing the confidence of foreign investors," the Chancellor said.
Both German and Russian officials ruled out any further injection of German money, saying Mr. Kohl's backing for Moscow's reform measures was enough. "Chancellor Kohl's personal support, as a major international political figure, is important to demonstrate that our policies are correct," Mr. Yeltsin said.
Germany is Russia's closest European political ally, and Bonn's backing is important as Moscow seeks financial support from the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, Mr. Kohl likes to depict Mr. Yeltsin as a personal friend, seeking to base his diplomacy on a network of personal relationships typified by the special friendship he has declared with President Clinton.
Because of the personal relationships, though, it is often difficult to disentangle diplomacy from domestic politics.
Mr. Kohl, in particular, faces the nettlesome problem of trying to win an unparalleled fifth term of office in elections in September.
Today, his Social Democratic electoral opponents resurrected the criticisms they lodged when Mr. Kohl met with Mr. Clinton last month, accusing the Chancellor of stage-managing media coverage, in this case by barring television cameras from a breakfast today with Mr. Yeltsin and Gerhard Schroder, Mr. Kohl's opposition challenger, who ranks in opinion surveys as Germany's most popular politician.
Government officials denied orchestrating the blackout, saying Russian officials insisted on it to avoid becoming ensnared in Germany's domestic politics.
Nonetheless, Mr. Kohl ruled the sound bites with Mr. Yeltsin, reflecting his campaign strategy of building voter support on his reputation as a statesman -- not only as Europe's longest-serving leader, but also as the key European interlocutor for the men he likes to call "my friend Bill" and "dear Boris."
While not quite so effusive as Mr. Clinton was, Mr. Yeltsin today referred to the German leader's international stature in remarks that seemed intended to feed into the campaign.
Mr. Kohl and his Christian Democrats, in office for almost 16 years, lag behind the Social Democrats in opinion surveys. But in recent days, Mr. Kohl has received some heartening news suggesting that the vote on Sept. 27 will be closer than was assumed a few weeks ago.

HEADLINE: Baltimore Journal;
As City Buffs Its Image, It Keeps a Place for Hons

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
The crowd grew quiet, knowing a solemn moment was finally at hand. Pamela Foresman stepped forward. These were her final minutes as Baltimore's Best Hon, the title she won at the Cafe Hon last year.
"My reign may be over," Ms. Foresman said, handing a bouquet of flowers to Sharon Gill, her successor. "But once a Hon, always a Hon." 
 O.K., so what is a Hon, and why are they beloved enough that 200 people would spend a nice weekend afternoon in a restaurant parking lot to celebrate their existence?
Fact is, Hons are as much a part of Baltimore's cultural landscape as crab cakes, the Orioles and Harborplace. They have earned their sociological niche for greeting friends and strangers alike the same way -- "Howya doin', Hon?" -- and speaking in "Bawlmerese," a dialect indigenous to the area and virtually unknown anywhere else.
At the recent fifth-annual Best Hon contest, Ms. Gill, a 44-year-old legal secretary, defeated two other contestants with her quintessential Hon look: black stretch pants, faux tiger-skin shirt, high-heeled sandals and wildly teased hair that takes her as long as "two arries" -- translation from Bawlmerese, two hours -- to set properly in place.
"This is my very first booty pageant," she told adoring fans.
Of course, the accent, with its mangled vowel sounds and fractured syntax, is not limited to Hons. Included in the day's festivities was the Best Bawlmerese contest, in which one man sang "Home on the Range," where in his version "the deer and the cantaloupe" play. Finishing first was a pair of beehived 11-year-old Honchkins -- Chiari Lattanzi and Leah Platek -- who sang a hilarious Bawlmerese version of "My Heart Will Go On," the theme song from the film "Titanic."
The filmmaker John Waters has made a career of feasting on the idiosyncrasies of Hons, setting "Pink Flamingos" and "Hairspray" in the Baltimore neighborhoods he knew growing up. All his characters speak in Bawlmerese, and many of his female characters dress like Hons.
But Hons and Bawlmerese seem harder find now. As Baltimore has polished its image with downtown redevelopment, new hotels, first-class sports stadiums and reborn commercial centers, the Hon life style, like the old, working-class neighborhoods that spawned them, is slipping into the shadows of progress.
Here in Hampden, a central neighborhood that was once a hotbed of Hons and their families, the main thoroughfare, 36th Street, has taken a decidely upscale turn in the last few years, with new restaurants, shops and refurbished row houses.
"Mainstreets are making a comeback, not just here but all across the country," said Denise Whiting, 39, owner of Cafe Hon who strapped on a foot-high beehive wig for her role as emcee. "People are rethinking cities, to get them back to what they once were, the hub of major activity."
But the changes, here as elsewhere, have not come without pain, especially to residents who find gentrification scary and expensive.
"Older people are afraid of change," Ms. Whiting said. "They don't necessarily see it as positive. They're frightened by it. They even felt more comfortable with the drug addicts and prostitutes."
It was largely to celebrate the old Hon ways that Ms. Whiting opened her 1950's-style restaurant six years ago and began the Best Hon contest a year later. But even that seems to have gentrified, with more faux Hons entering than real ones. The first year's winner seemed legitimate enough, Kelly Gambino, a forklift operator. But subsequent titles were captured by a professional dancer, a medical writer and, last year, by Ms. Foresman, 32, a lawyer who deflates her beehive for the courtroom.
She said she was saddened that Hons were disappearing, "like drive-in thee-aters." But she vowed to continue doing her part to keep them alive, if only in spirit.
"Last year, someone asked me where all the Hons have gone," she told the crowd in parting remarks. "It made me think that a lot of things are gone, and we need to save 'em. Like duck-pin bowling. That should be the state's national sport. Not jousting. I don't get jousting."

HEADLINE: Maine Holds Its Primary Among Modest Spenders

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Maine, June 9

 BODY:
Maine's primary today could be considered a breath of cool, fresh political air after the overheated spending of California's election last week.
The results brought no big surprises. With more than three-quarters of the precincts reporting, Democrats appeared to have selected as their candidate for governor Tom Connolly, a prominent Portland defense lawyer who emphasized social justice in his campaign. He heavily defeated Joseph Ricci, a racetrack owner with a tendency to become unprintably outspoken. 
 Among Republicans running for governor, Jim Longley Jr., a conservative former Congressman and son of Maine's former governor, appeared to have defeated two opponents with a campaign that focused on tax cuts and criticism of the state's economic performance.
Gov. Angus King, an independent, is expected to be easily re-elected in November.
But for politics-watchers still goggle-eyed at the immense sums spent on last week's primary in California -- more than $100 million in all -- the most striking aspect of Maine's primary was its financial modesty.
The biggest spender in the governor's race, Mr. Connolly, had raised about enough to cover a California campaign's dry-cleaning bills: $21,477, according to state records. Mr. Ricci raised $16,385.
Governor King and the state's two House members, John Baldacci and Tom Allen, both Democrats who faced no challenges in their primaries, raised about $200,000. And both contenders in the Republican primary for the 1st District seat in Congress fell well short of $100,000.
That would seem like cause for rejoicing in a state that is considered one of the leaders in campaign finance reform, and is expected to put into effect by 2000 a ground-breaking system that would provide public money to candidates who voluntarily accept limits on fund-raising.
But the coolness of the campaign was a little too cool for some voters. A low turnout -- reported to be below 14 percent -- bolstered the general impression of a campaign so lackluster and a public so apathetic that it was called "the stealth campaign."
"It's an odd election in that there's nothing going on," said Bill Coogan, a political science professor at the University of Southern Maine. "The two parties have conceded the governorship; there's no Senate race; and though there are two Congressional campaigns in the fall, the results are a foregone conclusion."
Maine, it seems, has a particularly potent case of the complacency, even somnolence, that often comes with economic prosperity, political observers said.
In Portland today, when several Maine voters were asked as they left their polling booths in City Hall what issues they wished had been highlighted, none could come up with any.
Governor King is so popular that neither party had reason to believe its candidate could beat him. So the top of the ticket in both primaries appeared to many to be all but moot, and few were willing to give money to candidates who appeared doomed.
"Let's be honest," said Garison Murrell, who had just loyally cast his ballot in the Republican primary. "The gubernatorial nominees don't even have a shot unless Angus King decides to parade naked down Congress Street."
In other races around the country, State Representative Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas defeated Attorney General Winston Bryant in a runoff to become the Democratic nominee for the Senate. She will face the Republican candidate, State Senator Fay Boozman.
In South Carolina, Representative Bob Inglis easily defeated Stephen Brown, a former Republican county chairman, for the Republican nomination to face Senator Ernest Hollings, a Democrat. North Dakota Republicans chose a former state senator, Donna Nalewaja, as their nominee to face Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat.

HEADLINE: Seeing Threat to Casinos, Tribes March on the Capitol

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
In an intensifying battle between California's American Indians and its Governor, more than 100 tribal leaders traveled here this week to try to halt what they call a threat to the survival of their reservations: state action to rein in their casinos.
The California tribes say Gov. Pete Wilson has violated their sovereignty; he says they are violating state and Federal law. 
 With Federal prosecutors, acting at Mr. Wilson's behest, taking steps to seize lucrative slot machines inside the Indian casinos, the tribal leaders appealed today to members of Congress and are scheduled to meet on Wednesday with Attorney General Janet Reno.
The dispute centers on the compacts that Federal law requires tribes and states to negotiate before casinos operate. Most tribes with casinos in California have no compacts.
In other states, where Indians are either seeking compacts or negotiating the renewal of existing compacts, the standoff in California is being watched closely.
Mr. Wilson has demanded that all tribes either sign a predetermined compact that they have called restrictive or shut down the casinos and negotiate a pact that is mutually agreeable. Mr. Wilson has said he will not negotiate with tribes that are operating casinos illegally, or without a compact.
Dan Kolkey, Mr. Wilson's legal affairs secretary, said, "If a tribe was permitted to operate illegal gaming until such time that they entered into a compact with the state, then they would never have an incentive to conclude a compact negotiation."
So far, all but a few of the 39 tribes that operate casinos in California have refused to accept either option, and Federal prosecutors, at Mr. Wilson's request, have gone to court to try to seize some 14,000 gambling machines from the resisting tribes' casinos.
Lanny J. Davis, a former special counsel to President Clinton who was hired to represent the tribes, said that the tribal leaders were in Washington to convince Congress and Ms. Reno that Mr. Wilson's refusal to negotiate was a violation of Indian rights under the 1998 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
"We're in Washington to ask the U.S. Government to fulfill its historic, legal and moral obligation to act as our trustees in requiring the Governor to come to the negotiating table," Mr. Davis said.
The tribal leaders say the battle is more than an economic or political issue.
"We are trying to head off a potential powder keg," said Mary Ann Andreas, chairman of the Morongo band of Mission Indians, which operates a casino outside Palm Springs and has refused the Governor's terms. The Morongo tribe, like others, Ms. Andreas said, feared losing not only revenues from casinos but also the sovereign rights granted the tribe through treaties with the Federal Government.
"What's at stake is our survival," Ms. Andreas said. "This could mean devastation."
The compacts that Mr. Wilson wants the tribes to sign are modeled after one he signed in March with the Pala band of Mission Indians, a tribe that has never had casino gambling on its reservation, in northern San Diego.
The casinos have proliferated into a statewide industry that employs about 15,000 people and has revenues that some industry experts estimate is more than $500 million. The Pala compact requires gamblers to be at least 21 years old and casinos to meet state laws regarding hiring, workers' compensation and collective bargaining.
But financially, what the tribes say is the issue of most concern is the compact's limitation on the type and number of slot machines they can use, a restriction that they say would cause them to lose about 85 percent of their revenues.
With the slot machines that are now in use, winning gamblers receive predetermined jackpot amounts, and the casino takes a percentage of everything that goes into the machines -- a system used in places like Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic City. But California law allows only lottery-style slot machines, which pay winners based on a machine's proceeds and divides the jackpot among the players and the casino.
The Justice Department, which agreed that the tribes were violating Federal law by operating without compacts, began seeking court approval on May 13 to seize machines that did not comply with state law.
The tribes have filed a lawsuit in State Superior Court contending that the Governor lacked the authority to sign the Pala compact because he did so without prior approval from the Legislature. A hearing is scheduled for later this month.
But the issue may be resolved in the November elections.
Californians are being asked to vote on a ballot initiative in November that would supersede the Pala compact and award the tribes a compact allowing them more control over their casinos.
The tribes are expected to spend millions of dollars in support of the initiative, and gambling interests in Las Vegas, where the Indian casinos are viewed as a threat, are expected to spend millions to try to defeat it. Industry experts estimate that as much as 30 percent of Nevada's casino customers come from California, and a new group, the Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling, which includes Nevada casino interests, has vowed to defeat the ballot initiative.
"Politicians like Governor Wilson are robbing the tribes, and Vegas interests are providing the ammunition," said Daniel Tucker, president of the California Nations Indian Gaming Association.
The tribal leaders have warned that the government's hard line and its efforts to remove the machines could lead to a violent confrontation.
"What we have here is the state of California coming in and cannibalizing tribal soil," said Anthony R. Pico, who said that as chairman of the Viejas band of Kumeyaay Indians, which operates a casino near San Diego, signed the compact under duress. "We can't have that. We would die first."

HEADLINE: GAME THEORY;
In the Headlights: P.D.A.'s and Virtual Pets

BYLINE: By J. C. Herz; E-mail address: Herz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta contains 35 football fields' worth of exhibition space. During the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May, it contained the equivalent of 35 football fields filled with video games -- PC games, console games and handheld games -- peripherals and accessories of all descriptions, as well as thousands of developers, software publishers, retailers, investors and journalists.
Crammed with 12-foot screens and massive speakers, looming exhibition domes, lasers, showgirls and video game mayhem at every turn, it's sheer heaven or sheer hell, depending on your personality. But whether you wallow in the spectacle or run screaming, E3 is a once-a-year chance to view the universe of interactive entertainment and to see what's on the horizon for Christmas and early '99. Here's a report from the trenches: 

GAME MACHINES -- No new ones this year. Sony and Nintendo are sitting tight with their consoles. The PC standard for gaming has stabilized with the Pentium II and a 3DFX graphics accelerator card. That is a good thing for consumers and developers alike because people get to catch their breath and concentrate on great games instead of racing to catch up with the hardware.
Sega is coming out with a new machine for Christmas 1999 that promises the moon -- superfast graphics, multiplayer on-line games, E-mail, chat, 3-D audio and a Windows CE operating system (and breakfast in bed?) -- for less than $300, but for now, we are in the eye of the technological hurricane. So content is king. Hallelujah.
 
PERIPHERALS -- Stable platforms have brought dozens of accessory manufacturers out of the woodwork. It is now possible to buy video game controllers in every color of the rainbow and hundreds of ergonomic configurations, like game pads, joysticks, headsets, gloves and racing wheels. Force feedback -- a tactile sense of explosions, body blows or the torque of a racetrack through a controller -- is the cool technology du jour. All the new joysticks are going to rumble, rattle and throb.
More significant in the grand scheme is a new crop of video game storage devices. Interact's Dex Drive, for instance, hooks into your PC. Pop a Playstation or Nintendo memory card into the drive and you can upload game saves, characters or sports rosters to your computer, then E-mail the data or post it to a Web site. Anyone else with a Dex Drive can download the information, plug it into a console and play with your levels, characters or teams, modifying them or mailing back new ones. At $40 (less than the cost of a Nintendo game), this peripheral knits together the console, PC and the Internet in an accessible way and could make game saves and video game characters as tradable as baseball cards.
Along the same lines, the Sony P.D.A. (personal digital assistant) is a $30, key-chain-size device that plugs into the Playstation like a memory card. After downloading game data, the P.D.A. converts into a portable gaming device. It has a calendar and a clock as well as an infrared transmitter that lets you beam data -- words, symbols and animations as well as game information -- across the room to other P.D.A.'s. You can transfer secret moves, trade weapons, play head to head and pass notes to your friends. This device will no doubt be the bane of every schoolroom from Seattle to Miami.
 
WORLD-BUILDING FOR THE LAITY -- It used to be that if you wanted to build your own levels of a PC game, you had to be a programmer. No more. A slew of computer games, particularly first-person shooters, will include built-in point-and-click-level editors that let you create your own versions of a game by importing geometric shapes into a void and giving them qualities like size, weight, hollowness, texture and lighting effects. It's the holodeck, more or less.
GT Interactive's Unreal and Sierra Studio's Half-Life are standouts in this respect, allowing players to create their own game worlds and distribute them on the Internet or play them on line. Building these worlds becomes a game in itself -- perhaps a more rewarding pastime than the original code (witness the sprawling virtual community of amateur Doom designers).
 
ARTIFICIAL LIFE -- Bad news for grown-ups: the virtual pet is not a passing fad.
Digital creatures are only getting stronger, more numerous and more sophisticated. From monster-breeding combat games to Cyberlife's sequel to Creatures, virtual vermin abound. Nintendo is releasing its own menagerie this fall. They're called Pokemon (a portmanteau word derived from "pocket" and "monster"). They live on your belt loop and come in 150 flavors, each with its own plush doll counterpart. Tamagotchi meets Beanie Babies. Be very afraid.
 
THE S-WORD -- After Silicon Valley's disastrous first date with Hollywood, synergy is back. Fox Interactive is trotting out a series of showbiz titles -- Alien vs. Predator, an X-Files game, Die Hard Interactive and the Simpsons' Virtual Springfield. Activision is transforming "The Fifth Element" into a console game. GT Interactive is bringing "Beavis and Butt-head" to the PC and the Playstation. Acclaim is tackling "South Park," and MGM is animating James Bond in Tomorrow Never Dies. Movie-based games have usually been stinkers, but this time around, developers have used the silver screen as a springboard instead of a crutch. They're finally getting it right. Chalk one up for the media empires.
 
THE SCOTS! -- An economic development agency financed by the Scottish Government has determined that video games represent a new engine for economic growth, so scores of computer science grads and art school students are being funneled into interactive entertainment. The result? A convention hall teeming with game designers in kilts. Bagpipes on the concourse. Interactive renditions of "Braveheart."
"The object of the game is to become the king of Scotland," said Wai Ming Yuen, the Glaswegian producer of Tartan Armies, a strategy game based on 13th-century clan warfare. "And then you get to invade England."
 
FEMALE PROTAGONISTS -- From Lara Croft to the trash-talking, gunslinging truck-stop waitress in Panasonic's Space Bunnies Must Die and the heroine of Square Soft's epic Parasite Eve, female game characters are shooting first and asking questions later.
As one game designer so eloquently put it, "There's something about a chick with a gun."

Economic theory won't provide easy answers in the drug war.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IF the war on drugs is indeed a battle of good versus evil, then Satan is gaining some impressive allies. An open letter to the United Nations Secretary General, on the occasion of the General Assembly's special session on drugs, asserts that "the global war on drugs is now causing more harm than drug abuse itself." Among the signers of the letter were Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former Secretary General; Robert Strauss, the Democratic Party's lobbyist-lawyer; George Shultz, the former secretary of everything to Republican presidents, and even Walter Cronkite.
More striking from the parochial perspective of this column, the list includes high-profile economists ranging from Milton Friedman (the Hoover Institution) to Jagdish Bhagwati (Columbia) to Gavin Wright (Stanford). 
 On second thought, perhaps it is not so surprising. Most economists these days are alert to the unintended consequences of regulation. And in the case of drug policy, they do not have to look far. "The harmful side effects -- everything from the spread of AIDS to violent crime to abuse of civil liberties -- simply overwhelm the benefits," said Jeffrey Miron of Boston University.
The only way to reduce illegal drug use is to reduce the supply or the demand. Consider supply-side strategies first.
Common sense says the place to start is at the border, or even in farmers' fields. But in this case, suggests Peter Reuter of the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, common sense is a ticket to frustration.
Smugglers of low-bulk drugs have adapted easily to interdiction efforts, he says. Confiscation of large quantities at sea or at the border has only modest impact on importers since the value of the drugs outside the country is so much lower than the value once they cross the border.
By the same token, discouraging drug production by subsidizing alternative crops is a fools' game. Drug entrepreneurs can always afford to pay more since the cost of the raw material is a minute fraction of the wholesale price of the delivered product.
What about disrupting wholesale and retail markets on this side of the border? It can and has been done through policing efforts -- though at a cost that makes economists, as well as legislators and civil libertarians, wince. With more than a half-million arrests annually for marijuana possession alone, the bulk of police, prison and court resources is now devoted to drug law enforcement.
Besides, Mr. Miron notes, for supply-side policies to work, drug prices must rise. And if, as most economists believe, the use of drugs is not particularly sensitive to price, the total value of drugs sold actually increases when enforcement is successful. This breeds ancillary crime as users steal to pay for their habits and dealers fight over turf.
If supply-side antidrug policies create a vicious circle of higher prices and more crime, demand-side policies should lead to a virtuous one. Lower demand means lower prices, lower revenue and less incentive to steal and kill.
By no coincidence, then, demand-reducing drug treatment and education have become the centrist politician's mantra. Mr. Reuter acknowledges that treatment is often cost-effective. But he doubts that even the most dedicated treatment policy would reduce addiction by more than one-third.
Mr. Miron points to another problem: pushing addicts off illegal drugs all too often pushes them into legal ones -- methadone, alcohol and tobacco. "You have to be skeptical that the benefits of treatment would exceed the benefits of simply minimizing the adverse side effects of illicit drug use," Mr. Miron said.
For Mr. Miron the best of all possible worlds would be one in which dangerous drugs are legal, with their use discouraged with taxes and social pressure. But many people who buy arguments against the flat-out prohibition cannot stomach policies that would probably lead to greater drug consumption.
For his part, Mr. Reuter argues that legalization has become a straw man that diverts attention from the messy task of reforming regulation. That might include the decriminalization of drug possession without making it legal to sell drugs for a profit. Or the quiet abandonment of expensive border interdiction. And it would certainly mean a more nuanced policy in which the use of marijuana by adults ceased to preoccupy the justice system.
Is the world ready for a change in drug policy as usual? Ethan Nadelmann, the director of the Lindesmith Center in New York, which sponsored the open letter, is encouraged by the growing numbers of very important people ready to take a stand in favor of a fresh start. But he doubts that the United Nations' own drug bureaucracy can lead the way. "It's hard to turn that big boat around," he lamented.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Economic Slump in Asia Spurs Sharp Drop in Dow

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday on concern that Asia's economic slump is causing companies that do business there to report disappointing earnings.
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company tumbled after an analyst downgraded the stock, while the Boeing Company and the Lattice Semiconductor Corporation fell after warning of disappointing profits because of a drop in Asian demand. The declines underscored remarks by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, who told Congress that Asia's slowing economies could cut into United States growth, potentially driving stock prices lower. 
 Investors accustomed to three years of 20 percent-plus gains in the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index will have to lower their expectations as earnings growth slows, said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers Inc., which manages $2 billion. "You can't have the market going up 25 percent when earnings are going up 5 percent."
The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 78.22, to 8,971.70, erasing a 46-point gain.. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.13, to 1,112.28. The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with computer companies, slid 27.51, to 1,773.25, its biggest drop in eight sessions.
Earlier yesterday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slumped 4.9 percent to its lowest level since March 10, 1995, as a weak yen drove up borrowing costs. The yen's slide to a seven-year low against the dollar may cut Japanese investment and lending abroad, causing weakness in other Asian currencies. Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 1.23 percent.
Benchmark indexes in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia all tumbled 3 percent or more. Latin American markets also fell. Brazil was down 4.83 percent yesterday and Mexico declined 3.57 percent.
A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company analyst, Mark Gulley, cut his rating on 3M to "neutral" from "outperform," in part because the company gets 25 percent of its earnings from the Pacific Rim. "The company's earnings are being held hostage to the sliding Japanese yen," he said in a report to clients.
Boeing, like 3M one of the 30 Dow industrials, fell 9/16, to 45 7/16, after the aircraft maker said it would cut jobs because Asia's financial turmoil had prompted airlines to delay deliveries and order smaller planes.
Tobacco stocks slumped. Brown & Williamson Tobacco lost a Florida tobacco trial and was ordered to pay the estate of a dead smoker at least $500,000, an unexpected defeat that could derail the tobacco industry's efforts in Congress to win protection from future lawsuits.
Philip Morris Companies fell 1 7/8, to 38 3/8. B.A.T Industries P.L.C., parent of Brown & Williamson, lost 5/8, to 19 9/16, and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation sank 7/8, to 26.
The Inktomi Corporation, which makes software designed to reduce Internet congestion as well as a popular Internet search engine, doubled on its first day of trading, reflecting continued enthusiasm for Internet stocks. Shares of the company, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., surged 18, to 36.
Mr. Greenspan also said United States stock prices may be "difficult to sustain unless economic conditions remain exceptionally favorable."
"He said what he probably had to say in this crisis," Mr. Stovall said. "The strong dollar here and the weakening and suspect currencies from Japan and the rest of Asia are all such that he certainly didn't want to say anything to push them over the lip."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Congress Testimony by Greenspan

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony yesterday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress: 
 In short, our economy is still enjoying a virtuous cycle, in which, in the context of subdued inflation and generally supportive credit conditions, rising equity values are providing impetus for spending and, in turn, the expansion of output, employment, and productivity-enhancing capital investment. The hopes for accelerated productivity growth have been bolstering expectations of future corporate earnings and thereby fueling still further increases in equity values. . . .
To a considerable extent, investors seem to be expecting that low inflation and stronger productivity growth will allow the extraordinary growth of profits to be extended into the distant future. Indeed, expectations of per share earnings growth over the longer term have been undergoing continuous upward revision by security analysts since 1994. These rising expectations have, in turn, driven stock prices sharply higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps to levels that will be difficult to sustain unless economic conditions remain exceptionally favorable -- more so than might be anticipated from historical relationships. In any event, primarily because of the rise in stock prices, about $12 trillion has been added to the value of household assets since the end of 1994. Probably only a few percent of these largely unrealized capital gains have been transformed into the purchase of goods and services in consumer markets. But that increment to spending, combined with the sharp increase in equipment investment, which has stemmed from the low cost of both equity and debt relative to expected profits on capital, has propelled the economy forward. The current economic performance, with its combination of strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the American economy. . . .
At this point, at least, the adverse wage-price interactions that played so central a role in pushing inflation higher in many past business expansions -- eventually bringing those expansions to an end -- do not appear to have gained a significant toehold in the current expansion. . . .
The effects of the crisis in Asia will almost certainly damp net exports further, potentially moderating the growth of domestic production and hence employment. The strength of domestic spending that has been been bolstering output growth and the demand for labor also could ebb if recent indications of a narrowing in domestic profit margins were to prove to be the forerunner of a reassessment of the expected rates of return on plant and equipment. Reduced prospects for the return to capital would not only affect investment directly but could also affect consumption as stock prices adjusted to a less optimistic view of earnings prospects. Finally, the clearly unsustainable rise of inventories that has been evident in recent quarters will be slowing at some point, perhaps abruptly. An easing of the demand for labor would be an expected consequence of a slowdown in either final sales or inventory accumulation. Of course, the demand for labor that is consistent with a particular rate of output growth also could be lowered if productivity were to continue to accelerate. And, on the supply side of the labor market, faster growth of the labor force could emerge as the result of delayed retirements or increased immigration. . . .
In summary, Mr. Chairman, our economy has remained strong this year despite evidence of substantial drag from Asia, and, at the same time, inflation has remained low. As I have indicated, this set of circumstances is not what historical relationships would have led us to expect at this point in the business expansion, and while it is possible that we have, in a sense, moved "beyond history," we also have to be alert to the possibility that less favorable historical relationships will eventually reassert themselves. That is why we are remaining watchful for signs of potential inflationary imbalances, even as the economy continues to perform more impressively than it has in a very long time.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A falling yen confronts Japan with bad choices: weak demand, pump priming, monetary inflation.

BYLINE: By Gretchen Morgenson 

 BODY:
THE yen must fall. Even further than it has.
So say several veteran Japan-watchers. While economists argue about when and how the Japanese Government might act to reverse the nation's economic slide, these analysts say it matters not. Japan is in such a straitjacket, their notion holds, that even if the Government takes decisive action, the yen will still plunge. 
 Severe weakness in the yen's exchange value has already taken it from 135.5 yen to the dollar a month ago to 141.43 late yesterday, a 4.4 percent decline. And the Japanese central bank increasingly appears incapable of stopping the plunge. "I don't think an intervention by the Bank of Japan, even a massive one, can reverse the slide," said David Horner, a senior financial strategist with Merrill Lynch in New York. "The worst is yet to come."
Mr. Horner expects Japan's central bank to soon try to prop up the currency. But he expects any intervention to be modest compared with the $25 billion buying spree of yen by the Bank of Japan over Easter weekend. The threat of another intervention has so far been successful, keeping currency traders on guard and speculators reined in. It has also helped make the yen's four-week fall a smooth, not disruptive one.
As a result, the currency may rebound here and there, but the long-term outlook seems grim indeed. Mr. Horner says the yen could fall within eight weeks to a rate of 148 against the dollar, a 5 percent decline from yesterday.
Others agreed. "Japan is in depression," said Robert H. Parks, a former Wall Street economist and a professor of finance at the Lubin Graduate School of Business at Pace University in New York. "And the Japanese are not taking effective action to get out of depression."
If Japan reports tomorrow that the economy contracted again in the first quarter, as is expected, economists will characterize it officially as a recession.
The first thing Japan must do to give its economy some lift, Mr. Parks argued, is to increase demand at home. The current lack of demand shows up in several ways. In May, Japanese wholesale prices fell by 2.3 percent from their level a year earlier. Another measure is inventories. Even considering that Japanese companies normally carry two and a half times as much inventory for each unit of output as American companies do, the inventories overhanging the Japanese economy today are staggering at 22.5 percent above the average level in the 1980's. Corporate inventories are now double the level of their last peak in 1992.
But it is not easy to increase the demand for goods and services in a country where the working population is declining by one-half of 1 percent annually. According to Andrew Smithers of the economic advisory firm Smithers & Company in London, "Even if Japan is very successful, if its productivity paced the rest of the world and it had a higher growth in the standard of living than the rest of the world, it will still grow slower than everybody else."
The result? Japan must stimulate its economy by cutting taxes and spending more on public works projects that are not boondoggles. And, Mr. Parks argued, the central bank must finance these projects with money fresh off the printing presses. If the bank did not create new money and instead sold debt to pay for the projects, it would merely sop up funds that might otherwise go to investment or consumption.
But revving up the printing presses is something the Japanese are loath to do. For one, it goes against a monetary policy in place since 1990. Japan's money-supply growth, running about 4 percent last year, has come down from 20 percent in the early 1970's and 9 percent in 1990.
Printing money is also deemed inflationary by the Japanese and therefore deeply feared. Creating a fresh supply of yen would also push the currency's value down further.
Therein lies the Scylla and Charybdis aspect of the Japanese situation. If the Government were to let the budget deficit run bigger than this year's estimated 3.8 percent of the gross domestic product, the yen's value would fall. If the Government did nothing, it would fall as well. "The yen is tumbling either way," Mr. Parks said. "There's no bottom to a currency in the middle of a depression."
A tumbling yen could be expected to cause another bloodletting among the already wan Asian economies. A serious downward spiral in currencies in Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and other Asian countries would likely be even more damaging than the devaluations there last fall.
That's because in 1997, most of these countries were still showing growth in their economic output. Now, they are not. China, which is growing, albeit slowly, is voicing its concerns to Washington about the free-falling yen.
Finally, a sharply declining yen would devastate Japanese stocks, already down more than 7 percent this year. Conclusion: investors buying into the Japanese market in the belief that it is the bargain basement may soon learn that they are nowhere near the cellar at all.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Long-Term Interest Rates Fall to 5.7%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates fell sharply yesterday, as the Asian financial crisis and continuing problems in Russia apparently sent more foreigners to the haven of the American bond market.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped the rally when he indicated, in an upbeat assessment of the economy, that an interest rate increase to slow economic growth was not imminent. 
 The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.70 percent, just a tick away from the 5.69 percent closing low it reached in January. That yield for the 30-year bond was the lowest since the Treasury began issuing them in 1977. At the same time, yields on corporate debt approached 30-year lows.
Other interest rates, however, have not fallen back to their January levels, which means that mortgage rates are still above the four-year lows they reached at the beginning of the year.
While Mr. Greenspan said that the American economy was "still enjoying a virtuous cycle," he also said the Asian crisis could lead to a cut in earnings expectations, a key element in the outlook for the stock market.
The Asian crisis, he told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, should lead to both a further dampening of American export sales and a reduction in profit margins because of rising price pressures from cheaper imports. Both developments would cut into earnings.
The stock market plunged in the afternoon, as the Boeing Company and the Lattice Semiconductor Corporation announced that the Asian problems were worsening their earnings outlooks, emphasizing Mr. Greenspan's warning. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 6.13 points, to 1,112.28, while the Nasdaq index dropped 27.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,773.25. The Dow Jones industrial average, which has suffered the least in the recent market downturn, fell 78.22 points, to 8,971.70.
Although Mr. Greenspan raised the issue of earnings and the stock market, he did not make any comments that appeared aimed at talking the market down. He has tried that in the past only to see stocks rally after an initial negative reaction.
But in a contorted way -- something that a quick reading of his remarks might miss -- Mr. Greenspan did say that a decline in stock prices would help the central bank avoid an interest rate increase because the fall would probably help curtail the consumer spending that has helped propel the economy.
In listing the factors that could help slow growth and obviate the need for an interest rate increase, Mr. Greenspan said, "Reduced prospects for the return to capital would not only affect investment directly but could also affect consumption as stock prices adjusted to a less optimistic view of earnings prospects."
Analysts did not focus on this part of his remarks, however. They were more taken by his positive outlook. He said that wages had not risen as much as one would have suspected and that productivity gains might offset inflationary pressures.
"He sounded more optimistic about the long-run prospects of keeping inflation down than in his previous testimony," said Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Most of the surge in bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, came after stock markets dropped sharply in Asia, showing that the economic turmoil there that helped push interest rates to their January lows might be deepening. The price of the 30-year bond rose 1 7/32, to 106 2/3, as the yield fell from 5.78 percent Tuesday.
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropped 4.9 percent, to 7,979.26, a three-year low that brought it below the 8,121.06 low it reached on Jan. 12, the same day that the 30-year bond yield reached 5.69 percent. The Nikkei index in Japan dropped 1.2 percent, to 15,339. Also adding to concerns about the world's emerging markets was the failure of the weekly Russian treasury bills sale. The Government needed to raise $1.1 billion to cover maturing issues but received only $742 million, raising concerns about the Government's ability to pay its debts without new international assistance. A key Russian stock index dropped 6.2 percent.
Even though the yield on the 30-year bond is near its recent lows, other interest rates are not nearly so low as they were in January. For example, the yield on the 10-year note dropped to 5.50 percent yesterday from 5.58 Tuesday. But it is still well above January's 5.36 percent level, which is why mortgage rates have not come down to January levels.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, the average rate nationally on a 30-year mortgage is 6.92 percent, still above the 6.87 percent of mid-January.
And short-term rates are so much higher than they were in January that the 5.50 percent yield on the 10-year note yesterday was below that of the two-year note, 5.52 percent.
One reason that short-term rates are high is that investors still expect the Fed to raise its interest rates target sometime in the next year. In January, when the yield on the two-year note dropped to 5.17 percent, some expected the economy to slow enough for the Fed to cut interest rates.
In some circumstances, a move of short-term interest rates above longer-term interest rates could signal that the economy will be slowing down if the so-called inversion is caused by the Fed's decision to raise its short-term interest rate target.
But in the current circumstances, the inversion is caused more by a fall in longer-term rates that reflects positive views on inflation and, therefore, it is not a warning signal, Mr. Berner said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japanese Seem Ready to Let Banks Fail

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 10

 BODY:
Six months after it retreated from closing weak banks or allowing them to fail, the Japanese Government is once again inclined to administer such shock therapy as a cure for the nation's sick financial system.
Although no bank failures are expected before elections for the upper house of Parliament in July, comments from leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party suggest that they would not rescue financial institutions, some large, that are verging on insolvency. 
 Investors are betting against the survival of at least two of Japan's weakest banks among the top 20 in the country, the Nippon Credit Bank and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
Lenders and stockholders are abandoning them and other weak institutions. Nippon Credit shares traded here today at 121 yen, down 4 percent so far this week. The Long-Term Credit Bank's stock closed at 176 yen, down 8 percent in the same brief time.
Analysts have resumed handicapping merger possibilities they envisioned last fall, when a string of failures shook the financial system. Those merger possibilities were dropped when Government bureaucrats insisted that no further fallout was evident.
"There seems to be a greater possibility than before that the Government would consider shutting down some banks," said James P. Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Baring Securities of Japan.
A week ago, Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior Liberal Democratic Party leader whose outspoken criticism of Government's efforts to fix the financial system have been a source of irritation, said Japan needed only half the number of banks it now has. "Japanese banks can't survive with the current number," he told reporters.
And Koichi Kato, the party's General Secretary and a longtime critic of the Finance Ministry, which oversees the banking system, said last month in Washington that more bank closings "could well be expected."
Japan's banks are struggling with an estimated $600 billion in bad debt, a legacy of the speculative "bubble economy" of the 1980's. Last month, some of the largest banks reported their biggest annual losses ever.
Last fall, the banking system seemed poised for a major overhaul when a number of overly indebted institutions collapsed. Sanyo Securities closed in November, quickly followed by the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, Yamaichi Securities and a smaller regional bank.
Investors expected more, but the torrid pace seemed to unsettle Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who spent much of December insisting that no more banks would fail.
But market wisdom has held just as stubbornly that just as there is overcapacity in the global auto business that only consolidation will repair, there are too many Japanese financial institutions.
That sentiment has hung over the Japanese economy and stock market, despite a 30 trillion yen rescue package for the financial system as well as several economic-stimulus packages.
With few options left, politicians now seem more resigned to further financial institution failures.
Mr. Fiorillo and other analysts decline to identify which banks they considered candidates for closing.
Last fall, the Government made life difficult for the firms that employ analysts who spoke their minds about specific banks, accusing them of spreading rumors to support short-sellers, or investors who bet on stock declines. Right-wing extremists threatened the lives of two banking analysts who made the names public.
Nippon Credit's problems have been grist for the rumor mill for more than a year. The Government arranged for a bailout for the bank last summer, pressing insurance companies and other banks to recapitalize it by buying preferred shares and issuing subordinated debt, which carries a higher risk of nonpayment than other types of debt.
Nippon Credit now wants to extend the terms on some of those loans because it will have trouble meeting its obligations. Lenders are balking.
One of those, the Nippon Life Insurance Company, sent a clear signal of its sentiments about the banking system when it announced over the weekend that it would no longer make subordinated loans to financial institutions because it considered them too great a credit risk. The Finance Ministry has said it will not protect shareholders or subordinated-debt holders.
The Long-Term Credit Bank's shares have been pummeled, as rumors circulated that its investment banking alliance with the Swiss Bank Corporation was unraveling. Both it and Swiss Bank deny that their relationship is dissolving, but Swiss Bank has also made clear that it feels no obligation to rescue its partner, should it need help.
Mr. Fiorillo calls Long-Term Credit the "hardest call" he has. He said the bank was not in as precarious a position as Nippon Credit because it had no immediate need for additional funds.
Moody's Investors Service currently gives 10 Japanese financial institutions its worst rating for financial strength, including Long-Term Credit, Sakura Bank and Daiwa Bank.
Daiwa is widely regarded as a potential acquisition target for a foreign bank. Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank are often discussed as candidates for potential mergers or takeovers.
And banks are expected to take advantage of changes in the holding-company law to consolidate. Sanwa Bank, for instance, could absorb Toyo Trust and Banking, or Fuji Bank could take in the ever-ailing Yasuda Trust.

HEADLINE: THE STANLEY CUP FINALS;
The Red Wings' Tough Guy Enjoys an Unlikely Renaissance

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 10

 BODY:
Joe Kocur's face didn't make the cover of Rolling Stone, but it takes up about half of page 101 of the current issue.
The music magazine is a strange place to find one of hockey's top fighting specialists, a man who calls himself "a country guy" in reference to both his musical tastes and his boyhood in Western Canada. 
 The black-and-white photograph of his menacing expression illustrates a story about hockey fighting. The magazine's next hockey story might have to include Kocur in a list of players who score important goals in the Stanley Cup finals. Kocur got the first one on Tuesday night to help the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the Washington Capitals in Game 1 at Joe Louis Arena. Game 2 of the four-of-seven-game championship round will be here on Thursday night.
When the Wings won the title last season after sweeping the Philadelphia Flyers, one of their scorers in the first game was Joe Kocur. For a veteran who had washed out of hockey two years ago, Kocur has made a remarkable comeback. The goal was his fourth of this spring's playoffs.
In a career that began in 1984, Kocur had scored only five post-season goals before this spring. He might have even more in this tournament had he not been held out of uniform for four of the six games in the Wings' previous series against the Dallas Stars.
Not that Kocur is complaining. After playing with the Red Wings until the 1990-91 season and with the Rangers until late in the 1995-96 season, he finished with Vancouver and could not find a job in the National Hockey League. Living in suburban Detroit, he played recreationally in what is called a "beer league." He got tickets to Wings games from a friend and hung around the locker room just to remind management that he was unemployed.
"Out of sight, out of mind didn't help," said Kocur, now 33 years old. "I made myself known."
Kocur got a glimpse of life as a former athlete. It enlightened him. "When you see the end is near, you get a second lease on life," Kocur said. "You make the best of it."
He began to notice that fans treated him differently, that the complimentary tickets to shows weren't so readily available. "When your career is over, those people forget about you pretty quickly," Kocur said.
Steve Yzerman, the captain, put in a good word with Scotty Bowman, the coach. At the time, Bowman thought that players such as Brendan Shanahan, Martin Lapointe and Darren McCarty were fighting too much. Kocur, with as many as 377 penalty minutes in a single season and almost 2,000 in his career, could still fight if necessary. More likely, his presence might discourage other teams from starting trouble. Around Christmas 1996, the Wings offered him work.
"He is a really smart player," Bowman said. "He knows how to play hockey. That sounds strange, but he's really got a big sense of the game. And he's got the reputation."
The reputation was that of a scary puncher who might knock a foe unconscious with one swing. His hands, which have had surgery, are legendary for their scars. There have been infections. Sometimes, the knuckles bleed easily. The worst is his mangled right fist.
"It's not a normal hand," Kocur said. "It gets the job done. That's the best way to put it."
This season, he said, he had to fight "maybe a half-dozen times, more out of necessity, when it's called for."
In the playoffs, particularly in the late rounds, fighting is rare. This creates new dynamics when players of Yzerman's skill are bullied by opponents like Dale Hunter of the Capitals, as was the case twice in Game 1.
Although Kocur got penalized for roughing Hunter, the retaliation was not the fistic sort of a regular-season game.
"Yeah, well, in a regular-season game, Hunter wouldn't do that," Kocur said, referring to Hunter's attacks on Yzerman. "You've got to live with it. It's not going to help us to go back after Hunter."
Instead, Kocur suggested, the Wings might retaliate against highly skilled Capitals, such as Peter Bondra and Andrei Nikolishin.
"Show them," Kocur said. "If they are going to go after Stevie, we're going to do it to your guys."
In his first tour in Detroit, Kocur was a friend of Bob Probert's. They were the Bruise Brothers, men about town, as active after games as during them. Now married and a father, Kocur is a team elder, inspiring tough young players like McCarty.
"We don't call him 'Papa' for nothing," McCarty said. "His leadership factor goes well beyond what he does on the ice. Last year, he came in here and taught us what it was like to win a Stanley Cup. A lot of times, he's a soothing voice in here. He takes care of a lot of things."
Kocur won his first Stanley Cup ring with the Rangers in 1994. He won his second last season. Should the Wings win three more games, he will get his third ring to fit over his gnarled fingers, giving him a diamond-studded set on hands that do more than score.

HEADLINE: The Silicon Valley Gang;
An Influential Industry With Lots of Money Is Getting Its Way on Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
The topic may have been an arcane change to the securities laws, but there was the sound of old-fashioned melodrama today in a hearing room on Capitol Hill.
Supporters of the legislation talked of protecting the hard-working companies that are trying to cure AIDS, heart disease and other ailments. Opponents talked about protecting "the weak, the frail, the infirm and those not fully able to defend themselves." There was even a mysterious villain in the piece, cryptically referred to by several Congressmen as the notorious "Mr. L." 
 But the subtext of this discussion could not have been more up to the minute: the growing political influence of the companies in California's Silicon Valley, which have begun flexing their political muscles after years of disdaining government and politicians' increasing desire to tap into the glamour -- and gold -- of the booming high-technology industry.
"The technology community has an advantage most industries don't," said Dan Schnur, Republican political director of Technology Network, or Technet, a year-old political advocacy group that represents 140 California companies. "The National Widgets Association would have a much tougher time getting attention, because Silicon Valley is about the future, and I don't know of any politician who has come out against the future."
And the No. 1 issue on Silicon Valley's agenda right now is the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, which is the bill that was approved today by the finance subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee. Identical legislation has already passed in the Senate, so if the House approves the bill -- which it seems all but certain to do -- Technet will have scored its first Federal victory.
The actual content of the bill is hardly likely to catch the attention of most voters. Basically, it would prevent investors and their lawyers from filing class-action securities fraud cases in state courts. Instead, these suits would have to be brought in Federal court under strict rules imposed by Congress in 1995 to discourage "meritless" lawsuits. The new rules would apply only to securities traded on national stock exchanges, which supporters of the bill contend should be covered by national, rather than state, standards.
The connection between such legislation and the high-technology industry may not be immediately apparent -- except to those who know that technology companies have been frequent targets of class-action securities frauds suits.
And California is also home to Mr. L. -- William S. Lerach -- who is probably the most feared of the class-action lawyers for plaintiffs. In 1996, he tried to persuade state voters to loosen the rules in state courts to make it even easier for investors to sue companies. The high-technology industry spent $40 million to beat the initiative, in what was by many accounts its political awakening.
Now Silicon Valley wants to make sure it never faces a similar threat, in California or anywhere else. And it is putting its money on the line. In 1995 and 1996, the industry gave $4 million to Congressional candidates. And in the last 18 months, even before the campaign fund-raising season has fully swung into action, computer companies and their executives have already given more than $1.2 million. That includes $150,000 to members of the Senate Banking Committee, which handled the litigation legislation but otherwise has little involvement in technology issues.
"They've really opened up their wallets," said Jennifer Shecter, an analyst for the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. "This industry has so much money, and if as a politician you can tap that successfully, you're golden."
For years, the high-technology industry had a reputation for being politically naive. Ms. Shecter said that was no longer the case. She pointed out that Technet, for one, was serving as a conduit for individual contributions, which allowed the organization to get credit for delivering funds while keeping contributions within legal limits.
Last fall, Technet funneled $37,500 to the campaign of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Banking Committee, according to a filing the organization made in March with the Federal Election Commission. The list of contributors from Silicon Valley includes venture capitalists, investment bankers, technology executives and even a couple of political action committees.
Senator D'Amato has also received more than $50,000 from other high-technology executives and corporate PAC's, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The group's study included information released by the F.E.C. as of May 1, and may understate the amounts because not all donors' professions were identified.
Asked by The New York Times whether there was any connection between Senator D'Amato's support of the uniform standards legislation, which backers say was important to its success, and the campaign contributions, Lisette McSoud Mondello, the Senator's director of communications, called the question ridiculous. "This bill was introduced by two other Senators, passed the Senate overwhelmingly and with strong bipartisan support, was supported by the White House and the Securities and Exchange Commission," she said. "And it's good legislation."
One of the sponsors of the bill in the Senate, Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, was a sponsor of the 1995 securities litigation reform bill as well. He has raised more than $24,000 the last two years from computer companies, almost all of them from outside Connecticut, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Senator Dodd, said Ellen Miller, president of Public Campaign, which advocates publicly financed elections, "has carried enough water for the securities, investment, accounting and high-tech computer industries to fill all of the bathtubs of Connecticut."
That statement is "garbage," replied Marvin Fast, Senator Dodd's spokesman. "Chris Dodd fights for what he believes in. He works for the people of Connecticut, and no one else."
Lobbying involves more than campaign contributions, of course, and Silicon Valley has become more adept at getting its message across. In late May, less than two weeks before his House subcommittee was to take up the legislation, Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio, visited California under the auspices of Technet and met with several companies.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Oxley did not respond to questions about his trip.
Mr. Schnur of Technet said such face-to-face visits, rather than campaign contributions, helped explain his group's success.
Indeed, politicians are falling all over themselves to be associated with high-technology industries, said Mark Gitenstein, counsel for the more traditional lobbying group on this issue, the Uniform Standards Coalition.
"People in policy are attracted by the new economy," he said. "The percentage of jobs they are creating dwarfs the smokestack industries. That's what this is all about. There is no question that the very mechanism by which they flourish is chilled by litigators."
And that is what the 1995 securities law was supposed to prevent: class-action lawyers jumping on a company because its stock tumbled, finding a plaintiff who owned a handful of shares, and rushing to the courthouse to sue for fraud. Companies settled almost all of these lawsuits, arguing that the cost of fighting them was prohibitive.
Opponents of the 1995 legislation, however, said that it would encourage securities fraud and deprive investors of one of the few ways they had to recover money in a fraud.
The fight over the 1995 legislation was extremely contentious, pitting securities firms, accountants and, increasingly, the technology industry, against trial lawyers and consumer groups. President Clinton vetoed the bill; Congress overrode his veto for the first and only time.
The 1995 law requires that when they are filed class-action securities fraud suits contain very specific accusations, and it does not permit plaintiffs to demand information from a company until a judge has ruled on the company's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. It also provided a "safe harbor" that allows companies to make predictions about their business without being legally liable if those predictions fail to come true.
Lawyers for plaintiffs fought back with Proposition 211, which was on the ballot in California in 1996. This initiative would have made it far easier for investors and their lawyers to file securities-fraud lawsuits against companies. At first, it appeared to enjoy wide public support.
In the end, Proposition 211 was roundly defeated -- primarily through a $40 million campaign organized by high-technology concerns, venture capitalists and investment bankers. That effort led to the creation of Technet.
In the meantime, securities lawyers began filing class-action fraud suits in state courts, where the new Federal rules did not apply. The number of such cases jumped from about 19 in 1992 and 41 in 1994 to 70 in 1996, according to a study by two Stanford University law professors, Michael A. Perino and Joseph A. Grundfest, who is also a former commissioner of the S.E.C. More than half these were filed in California.
But in 1997, a funny thing happened: the number of state lawsuits began to decline, falling to just 24 in the first six months of the year. "I still haven't done the final statistics for 1997, but the raw amount of litigation is less than in 1996," said Professor Perino, who has recently joined the faculty at St. John's University in New York City.
Mr. Lerach, the California lawyer, said the number of such suits was declining because state courts had not turned out to be "an effective forum." Not only are the courts overburdened, he said, but it is unclear if one can bring a national class-action case in California.
So why does he think Silicon Valley's executives are so intent on getting the litigation bill passed? "I don't say it in a mean way," Mr. Lerach responded, "but they are intoxicated with their own power, and think they can get what they want."
Silicon Valley's power clearly had an impact on Arthur Levitt Jr., the politically astute chairman of the S.E.C., who reversed himself and agreed to support the litigation bill on the day his renomination was taken up by the Senate Banking Committee. The commission's staff argues that he got some significant modifications to the legislation in exchange for his support, and that the commission wants to encourage companies to provide more forward-looking information for investors, which they have been reluctant to do because of their fears of state lawsuits.
Besides, said one former S.E.C. lawyer, it was impossible for the commission to resist. "This is the most powerful lobbying force in America today," he said.
Consumer groups have tried to stop the legislation, which they argue will deprive investors of their rights. But they are not optimistic. "It's been clear Congress was going to do this, and it's hard to justify making a massive campaign in a future effort," said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America.
Just because the opponents are not mounting a big counteroffensive, however, does not mean Silicon Valley's executives are relaxing their push. "One neat thing about our community," said Mr. Schnur of Technet, "is that it is filled with people who don't take no for an answer."

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Calls the Economy One of the Best He Has Seen

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
With a mixture of pride and puzzlement, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, declared the economy to be in extraordinarily good shape today and signaled to investors that he saw no immediate need to strike against inflation by raising interest rates.
"The current economic performance, with its combination of strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the American economy," Mr. Greenspan said. 
 The Federal Reserve chairman sprinkled his two hours of testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress with caveats about how the combination of low unemployment and strong growth could eventually force the central bank to raise rates. But he emphasized that price pressures were subdued and that Asia's financial crisis was already working to take some of the steam out of the American economy.
Just as he has in other public statements over the last several years, Mr. Greenspan spoke optimistically about several economic developments, including his belief that the nation was benefiting from huge investments in technology that were helping companies produce more for every hour worked, holding down overall costs even as wages rise. And he pointed to a "virtuous cycle" in which low inflation had reduced interest rates and stimulated more investment and consumption.
And in what has become a familiar refrain for investors in the stock market, Mr. Greenspan said expectations of stronger earnings had "driven stock prices sharply higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps to levels that will be difficult to sustain unless economic conditions remain exceptionally favorable."
Mr. Greenspan's less direct but more explosive warning about the danger of "irrational exuberance" spooked the markets when he first suggested the market might be overvalued a year and a half ago. But investors largely shrugged off his concerns today -- although reports late in the day from some big American companies about likely earnings weakness because of the Asian turmoil jolted the markets.
Not only has Mr. Greenspan's fretfulness about the market become old news to investors as they have pushed the market higher, but Wall Street is convinced that the Federal Reserve has little leeway to raise rates anyway because of its concerns about the fragility of Asian markets and economies. Underscoring those worries, stock markets fell sharply today in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and other nations, largely because of concern that the plummeting value of the Japanese yen could further harm the region's economies.
On Wall Street, bond prices rose sharply today, with Mr. Greenspan's comments extending a rally set off when investors in Asian markets sought a safe refuge in United States Treasury securities. After being up much of the day, stock prices ended lower, dragged down in part by a warning from the Boeing Company, the nation's biggest exporter, that weak demand for airliners from Asia would cut into its profits.
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan suggested that the risks to the American economy remained balanced between an Asia-induced slowdown and an inflationary overheating fueled by the surging stock market and strong demand.
Mr. Greenspan said the Fed remained uncertain about whether Asia was stabilizing or whether further economic deterioration there could wash up in the United States later this year.
At the same time, he said, there were signs that consumer price inflation might be picking up from extremely low levels. And without saying so explicitly, he suggested that a continued run-up in the stock market could fuel excess demand and inflationary pressures.
But he said there was almost no evidence of the phenomenon that central bankers fear most -- wage and price increases feeding off each other and creating inflationary pressures that can only be squelched by higher interest rates.
"At this point, at least, the adverse wage-price interactions that played so central a role in pushing inflation higher in many past business expansions -- eventually bringing those expansions to an end -- do not appear to have gained a significant toehold in the current expansion," Mr. Greenspan said.
The crisis in Asia, a slowdown or reversal in the rise of corporate earnings and a reversal of the inventory buildup of the last several quarters could all help slow the economy to a sustainable pace, he said.
Mr. Greenspan was careful to say that he would be as vigilant as ever in looking for early warnings signs of broad-based wage and price increases, especially with unemployment at a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
"If developments such as these do not bring labor demand into line with its sustainable supply, tighter economic policy may be necessary to help guard against a buildup of pressures that could derail the current prosperity," he said.
The optimistic tone of Mr. Greenspan's testimony put him at odds with a small group of inflation hawks on the central bank's policy-making committee who have been urging a rate increase now. Led by Jerry L. Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, they have been arguing that heading off inflation down the road requires striking now, even if there is little evidence of current price pressure. The Fed will next meet on June 30 and July 1 to consider interest rate policy, and economists say it is extremely unlikely that the Fed will raise rates then.
Mr. Greenspan mused at several points during his testimony about how the old rules and assumptions about the interplay between growth, inflation and unemployment did not seem to be holding up -- although he quickly added that he did not know whether they had been permanently retired or just set aside by temporary factors.
"The fact that economic performance strengthened as inflation subsided should not have been surprising, given that risk premiums and economic disincentives to invest in productive capital diminish as product prices become more stable," he said. "But the extent to which strong growth and high resource utilization have been joined with low inflation over an extended period is nevertheless extraordinary."
One reason for the strong economic performance, Mr. Greenspan said, is an apparent pickup in the growth rate of productivity, or the measure of output for every worker for each period of time worked.
A steep and largely unexplained decline in productivity growth since the early 1970's has been the main brake on economic growth in the United States, and economists have been debating for several years whether heavy investments in computers and other technology have turned the trend around. There is mounting evidence that productivity gains are growing, Mr. Greenspan said, although the extent of the improvement remains unclear.
"Signs of a major technological transformation of the economy are all around us, and the benefits are evident not only in high-tech industries but also in production processes that have long been part of our industrial economy," Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Ruling on Use of Education Money

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the decision issued yesterday by the Wisconsin Supreme Court on the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program allowing the city to use public money to send children to parochial or other religious schools. The text was obtained from the Web site of The Milwaukee Journal.
The first issue we address is whether the amended M.P.C.P. violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Neither the circuit court nor the court of appeals reached this issue. Upon review we conclude that the amended M.P.C.P. does not violate the Establishment Clause because it has a secular purpose, it will not have the primary effect of advancing religion, and it will not lead to excessive entanglement between the State and participating sectarian private schools. 
 The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in part that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This mandate applies equally to state legislatures by virtue of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. The Establishment Clause, therefore, prohibits state governments from passing laws which have either the purpose or effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.
When assessing any First Amendment challenge to a state statute, we are bound by the results and interpretations given that amendment by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. . . .
The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that the Establishment Clause raises difficult issues of interpretation, and cases arising under it "have presented some of the most perplexing questions to come before the Court." We are therefore cognizant of the Court's warnings that:
"There are always risks in treating criteria discussed by the Court from time to time as 'tests' in any limiting sense of that term. Constitutional adjudication does not lend itself to the absolutes of the physical sciences or mathematics. . . . C andor compels the acknowledgment that we can only dimly perceive the boundaries of permissible government activity in this sensitive area of constitutional adjudication."
In an attempt to focus on the three main evils from which the Establishment Clause was intended to afford protection: sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of thesovereign in religious activity, the Court has promulgated a three-pronged test to determine whether a statute complies with the Establishment Clause. Under this test, a statute does not violate the Establishment Clause if (1) it has a secular legislative purpose; (2) its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) it does not create excessive entanglement between government and religion. We must apply this three-part test to determine the constitutionality of Wisconsin Statute 119.23.
Under the first prong of the Lemon test, we examine whether the purpose of the state legislation is secular in nature. Our analysis of the amended M.P.C.P. under this prong of the Lemon test is straightforward. Courts have been "reluctan t to attribute unconstitutional motives to the states, particularly when a plausible secular purpose for the state's program may be discerned from the face of the statute."
A state's decision to defray the cost of educational expenses incurred by parents -- regardless of the type of schools their children attend -- evidences a purpose that is both secular and understandable. An educated populace is essential to the political and economic health of any community, and a state's efforts to assist parents in meeting the rising cost of educational expenses plainly serves this secular purpose of insuring that the state's citizenry is well-educated. . . .
Analysis of the amended program under the second prong of the Lemon test is more difficult. While the first prong of Lemon examines the legislative purpose of the challenged statute, the second prong focuses on its likely effect. A law violates the Establishment Clause if its principal or primary effect either advances or inhibits religion. . . .
The Supreme Court, in cases culminating in Agostini, has established the general principle that state educational assistance programs do not have the primary effect of advancing religion if those programs provide public aid to both sectarian and nonsectarian institutions (1) on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion; and (2) only as a result of numerous private choices of the individual parents of school-age children. The amended M.P.C.P. is precisely such a program. Applying to the amended M.P.C.P. the criteria the Court has developed from Everson to Agostini, we conclude that the program does not have the primary effect of advancing religion. . . .
The final question for us to determine under the Lemon test is whether the amended M.P.C.P. would result in an excessive governmental entanglement with religion. Stated another way, it is necessary to determine whether " a comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that these restrictions against the inculcation of religious tenets are obeyed and the First Amendment otherwise respected." . . .
The amended M.P.C.P. will not create an excessive entanglement between the state and religion. Under the amended program, the state need not, and in fact is not given the authority to impose a "comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance" over the participating sectarian private schools. . . .
The program does not involve the state in any way with the schools' governance, curriculum, or day-to-day affairs. The state's regulation of participating private schools, while designed to insure that the program's educational purposes are fulfilled, does not approach the level of constitutionally impermissible involvement.
In short, we hold that the amended M.P.C.P., which provides a neutral benefit directly to children of economically disadvantaged families on a religious-neutral basis, does not run afoul of any of the three primary criteria the Court has traditionally used to evaluate whether a state educational assistance program has the purpose or effect of advancing religion. Since the amended M.P.C.P. has a secular purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing religion, and does not create an excessive entanglement, it is not invalid under the Establishment Clause.

HEADLINE: Vallone Introduces Bill to Put Stadium Issue Before Voters

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Following through on a pledge that has contributed significantly to his current budget battle with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, introduced a bill yesterday that would put a referendum about the future of Yankee Stadium on the November ballot.
Accusing Mr. Giuliani of not caring about the opinion of ordinary New Yorkers, Mr. Vallone said he wanted voters to decide whether Government money should be used to help build a new ball park for the Yankees in Manhattan. 
 "The taxpayers of this city have every right to say, 'Yes, I want a new stadium in Manhattan,' or, 'No, I want the Bronx Bombers to stay in the Bronx,' " Mr. Vallone said at a news conference. "That, ladies and gentlemen, is what democracy is about."
The Giuliani administration immediately attacked the bill, saying it was driven by the political ambitions of the Speaker, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. The administration also said the referendum would handcuff the city in its negotiations with the Yankees. The team's owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, said last week that Mr. Vallone's referendum plan had pushed him to the edge of moving the team out of New York City.
"Politics and leadership in politics requires a certain degree of wisdom, and not just pandering constantly to what public opinion polls tell you," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday at a news conference, adding that a referendum would probably increase the Democratic voter turnout for Mr. Vallone in the fall election.
"I think the calculation was he felt he would get 100,000 more votes if he put this on the ballot," Mr. Giuliani said. "So to create a difficult problem in a very sensitive negotiation, which this will no doubt do, for a city that has had a terrible record of keeping sports teams, just in order to get yourself 100,000 votes on the ballot, seems to me the wrong thing to do."
The referendum bill is considered certain to become law, because Mr. Vallone has tight control over the Democratic-dominated Council.
The Speaker introduced the bill as Mr. Giuliani vetoed more than $196 million from a budget that the Council passed on Friday in defiance of the Mayor. The budget negotiations collapsed last week, in part because of the political impasse between the Mayor and the Speaker over the Yankee Stadium issue. The Giuliani administration has insisted that it will not agree to a budget unless Mr. Vallone drops his plans for a referendum.
The deadlock caused the Council to pass a budget without the Mayor's agreement for the first time since it acquired the authority to do so under the 1989 City Charter revision.
Beyond the budget implications raised by the referendum, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Vallone have starkly different views of where a new Yankee Stadium should be and how to pay for it.
The Mayor is trying to block Mr. Vallone's proposal from appearing on the ballot this fall by creating a special commission to recommend changes to the City Charter. By state law, a charter question takes precedence over all other ballot questions, and would block the Yankee Stadium issue from being considered this year.
The Vallone camp, in turn, is also helping a grass-roots organization gather enough signatures in a petition drive intended to put the stadium question on the ballot. If the group gathers 30,000 signatures, the question would be put before the voters separately from the referendum called for by Mr. Vallone's bill, but a charter commission initiative would knock both questions off the ballot.
The referendum fight began after a half-ton steel beam fell on a section of Yankee Stadium seats in April. The Mayor revived a proposal to build a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, a project that by some estimates could run as high as a $1 billion. Mr. Giuliani said he wanted the team to stay in the Bronx, but a new stadium was needed to keep the team profitable, and eliminating the option of Manhattan could push Mr. Steinbrenner to New Jersey.
Saying that a stadium in Manhattan would require both public and private money, the Mayor proposed extending a commercial rent tax that he had previously sought to abolish, a tax scheduled to expire in 2001 that would raise at least $600 million.
But while Mr. Vallone said officials should study the possibility of using public funds to help build a new stadium, he added that the stadium should stay in the Bronx. He said moving the team out of the Bronx would be an economic disaster for that borough and financing a Manhattan stadium would be an undeserved gift to Mr. Steinbrenner, whose ball club has earned him millions.
The Speaker proposed letting the voters decide the issue by having the Council put a referendum on the November ballot. And members of his gubernatorial campaign are helping a grass-roots organization called Keep the Yankees in the Bronx in its separate petition drive to put the stadium question on the ballot, said Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone.
By pushing for a referendum, Mr. Vallone is likely to derive substantial benefits in his drive to challenge Gov. George E. Pataki. In addition to increasing his name recognition, Mr. Vallone, if he gets his referendum on the ballot, could drive up voter turnout in Democratic strongholds like Manhattan and the Bronx.
In a defensive move, the Mayor created a City Charter Revision Commission to place a question on the November ballot. Under the arcane rules governing the City Charter and the state's Municipal Home Rule Law, a charter question would bump from the ballot any other referendum questions, either from the Council or from a petition drive, said Eric Lane, the executive director of the 1989 Charter Revision Commission.
But because charter revision commissions were set up in the past to review the fundamental workings of city government, Mr. Vallone's aides said they are hoping to prevent Mr. Giuliani's commission from putting a question on the ballot, possibly by arguing in court that the question is not a serious one but merely an attempt to block the stadium referendum.
"There may be legal and governmental reasons why the Mayor's charter commission won't be able to put its proposal on the ballot," said Richard Weinberg, the Council's general counsel.

To the Editor:
Re "Candy Bar, and Skills, Aid County in Job Hunt" (news article, June 7): The people of Henry County, Virginia, are mistaken to think that giving laptop computers to schoolchildren or increasing adult education opportunities will help ease the area's economic malaise. The ideas of creating a curriculum that will help match graduates to the local job market and teaching county residents "skills that new companies might require" sound appealing, but what happens when the local job market changes or the new companies turn out to need skills different from those that were taught? 
 It makes little sense for educators to increase their students' dependence on businesses that have no real stake in the community or interest in the needs of the people they employ or serve. Instead, the county should take a more long-term approach: encourage students to develop their independence and find their own ways of meeting the community's needs, like starting small businesses.

HEADLINE: SENATE BACKS USE OF CIGARETTE TAX TO ASSIST COUPLES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
The Senate voted tonight to use part of the money that would be raised from higher cigarette prices to give an income-tax break to married couples with low and moderate incomes. The vote gave additional strength to anti-smoking legislation that has been before the Senate for three weeks.
The marriage-tax amendment was approved on a voice vote, after a procedural motion to kill it failed on a 50-to-48 roll-call along party lines. 
 The Republican amendment to the tobacco bill would give all couples with annual incomes below $50,000 a new tax deduction of $825 this year, rising gradually to $3,300 in 2008. The amendment was billed as a reduction in the marriage tax penalty -- the additional income taxes some couples owe above what they would owe if they were single.
A Democratic alternative was then rejected, 55 to 43, on another party-line vote.
The Republican amendment would also allow self-employed taxpayers to deduct the full cost of their medical insurance premiums beginning with this year's taxes. Under the current tax law, the self-employed can deduct 45 percent of the cost of premiums, and the percentage will not reach 100 percent until 2007.
The tax relief seemed likely to win more Republican support for the underlying tobacco legislation. Many Republicans have argued that the anti-smoking bill is mainly a tax increase to finance a big-government solution to the problem of teen-age smoking that is bound to fail.
Some of the steam is taken out of the tax argument if, as tonight's amendment would require, one-third of all the revenue generated would be used to provide a tax cut.
Republicans argue that it is bad public policy to impose higher taxes on couples who marry than on those who live together out of wedlock. Party leaders have made elimination of the marriage penalty their No. 1 tax priority this year.
Last week, the House of Representatives approved a budget blueprint that would allot $100 billion to that end over the next five years.
The vote tonight, which followed hours of tense negotiations, was a big step in moving the tobacco bill to final passage by the Senate. That could occur as early as next week.
But serious obstacles remain, especially a serious dispute over whether the Government's price-support program for tobacco farmers should be abolished and how much money should be allotted to ease the financial burden on tobacco growers and communities whose economy depends on tobacco farming and cigarette manufacturing.
And many Republican senators continue to oppose the bill, even with the tax breaks approved tonight.
"The bill is still a tax-increase bill," said Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri.
The legislation, which seeks to reduce the number of young people who start to smoke, would raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack over the next five years, expand the Government's authority to regulate cigarette advertising and marketing and impose penalties on tobacco companies if teen-age smoking did not fall to specified levels.
Speaker Newt Gingrich said today that the House was working on a much narrower anti-smoking bill. He called the measure before the Senate a "dead end."
The purpose of the tax break for couples, said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, the main sponsor of the amendment, was to "help working families shield more of their income."
The new break would not be limited to those who face a marriage penalty. More than half of taxpayers who file joint returns pay lower taxes than they would if they filed as individuals -- what some call a marriage bonus -- but even those with a bonus would be entitled to the new deduction under the amendment approved tonight.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 25 million such couples receive a "marriage bonus," while 21 million incur a penalty.
As a general rule, the penalty applies when a husband and wife both work and earn approximately the same amount of money. Couples normally get a bonus if only one spouse works or if one earns much more than the other.
All the Democrats who voted favored killing the Gramm amendment, except for Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. But they were joined by only five Republicans: Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, Connie Mack of Florida and James M. Jeffords of Vermont.
The Democrats' alternative amendment, which failed tonight, would have given larger tax breaks than Mr. Gramm's plan to couples that faced a marriage penalty, but little if any tax relief to couples who now pay lower taxes because they are married.
"There's no rationale for rewarding those who get a bonus," said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat who is a former Tax Commissioner of North Dakota, said: "We ought to give those who actually experience the marriage penalty the help they really need to overcome it. It does not make sense to give the help to those who benefit from being married in the same way you help those who are being hurt."
Democrats also argued that the Gramm amendment would become so expensive in the second decade of the next century that it would eat into budget surpluses that should be set aside for Social Security benefits.
Senator Gramm said the Democratic plan would have had the effect of penalizing parents who stayed home to take care of children.
Mr. Gramm argued that the tobacco bill, by raising cigarette prices, would impose "a bone-crushing tax on moderate-income Americans." Under his proposal, Mr. Gramm said, "One-third of the money we are collecting in higher tobacco taxes would be given back to working families."
The White House said that President Clinton preferred the Democratic approach but could live with the Gramm amendment.
Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, said that reducing the marriage penalty had not been "a high priority for the Administration," but that President Clinton now supported efforts to cut taxes for some married couples as a way to secure passage of anti-smoking legislation.
The tobacco bill was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee in April on a strong bipartisan vote. But the cigarette makers abandoned the bill as too costly and mounted a nationwide advertising and lobbying campaign to defeat the bill.
For weeks, the bill was bogged down in the Senate. But on Tuesday, senators began to find ways to unclog the logjam. The Senate then attached to the tobacco bill several measures to combat drug abuse, an important Republican issue.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 12.
 
Now Playing
 
"ARTEMISIA," starring Valentina Cervi, Michel Serrault and Miki Manojlovic. Directed by Agnes Merlet (R, 96 minutes). With its painterly cinematography, this high-toned bodice-ripper about the early life and times of the Italian Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, whom feminist art historians rescued from obscurity in the 1970's, is the movie equivalent of a Caravaggio exhibition. A sexy film, which narrowly avoided an NC-17 rating, it gives its title character a split personality. She is not only an early 17th-century Lolita with a big streak of voyeurism, but also a ruthlessly ambitious painting prodigy. The movie, which turns the story of her rape by her art teacher, Agostino Tassi, into a star-crossed love story, is very good at capturing the all-consuming intensity of a passionate student-teacher relationship (Stephen Holden). 

"DEEP IMPACT," starring Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mimi Leder (PG-13, 120 minutes). Apparently there is no better aid to family therapy than a murderously large meteor hurtling toward Earth. So this is a more sensitive sci-fi disaster film than most, with lovers bonding and old wounds healing as the summer's first colossal cinematic catastrophe looms. This thriller is vigorously made, but it provides less grisly mayhem than might be expected. As the planet faces extinction, attention is paid to rescuing art, antiques, elephants and flamingoes. Special-effects wizardry provides a suitably devastating tidal wave (Janet Maslin).
 
"FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS," starring Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Directed by Terry Gilliam (R, 120 minutes). Mr. Gilliam, the visually ingenious cinematic maestro behind "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys," has filmed Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 classic of gonzo journalism with an astonishing fidelity to the book's psychedelic phantasmagoria. But if this is as close to recreating the sensory world of an acid trip that a mainstream film has ever come, the movie packs the book's vignettes together into an overstuffed hodgepodge. Where the book conveyed a spirit of open-ended adventure in which each new caper could be spun out into its own little movie, the film rarely gives the book's appallingly funny anecdotes room to breathe. Mr. Depp, who has been made partially bald for the role of Raoul Duke, turns in a clever performance. And Mr. Del Toro's portrayal of Raoul's gun-waving sidekick and "attorney," Dr. Gonzo, is a tour de force of unfettered goonishness (Holden).
 
"GODZILLA," starring Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria and Maria Pitillo. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 139 minutes). The ads for "Godzilla" proclaim that "size does matter." But it turns out that bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. The animatronic lizard that rises from the ocean and stomps on a number of New York City landmarks has thundering metallic footsteps but still has the impact of a weightless cartoon monster. The movie doesn't get scary until halfway through, when the beast's eggs hatch (in what's left of Madison Square Garden) and an army of more lifelike baby Godzillas threatens to devour the search party. The storytelling and acting in this $120 million wad of gummed-up popcorn reaches new depths of crudeness and ineptitude for a so-called Event Movie (Holden).
 
"HOPE FLOATS," starring Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Directed by Forest Whitaker (PG-13, 112 minutes). This pajama-party women's picture starts out on a talk show and stays there, raising issues like divorce, single parenthood, mother-daughter relationships, caring for aging relatives and summoning the courage to date after trauma. But Ms. Bullock, who is actually seen cheerleading here, gives her best approximation of American's sweetheart since "While You Were Sleeping," and her winning performance helps make up for the film's cute streak and rosy, commercial glow. Ms. Rowlands does a feisty, down-to-earth turn as the star's Texas mama, even if the story gives her taxidermy for an offbeat hobby. As the post-divorce dreamboat, Mr. Connick is on the tepid side. "The Horse Whisperer" does this kind of serene, resuscitating romance much better (Maslin).
 
* "THE HORSE WHISPERER," starring Robert Redford, Kristin Scott Thomas and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Robert Redford (PG-13, 164 minutes). There's a blunt soap opera of a movie inside Nicholas Evans's widely popular novel. But Mr. Redford, directing himself for the first time with intelligence and restraint, has found a visually eloquent way to turn it into something much more thoughtful and tranquil. Magnificently photographed by Robert Richardson, this film is a wide-screen love affair with the West, and a story more of peace and healing than of ardor. Though it's long and its resolution is a problem, this is an enveloping film that richly rewards the viewer's attention (Maslin).
 
"KURT AND COURTNEY," featuring Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love. Directed by Nick Broomfield (Not rated, 95 minutes). Mr. Broomfield's latest quizzical documentary has finally surfaced at the Cinema Village, despite various lawyers' best efforts to keep it under wraps. It is -- and is well worth -- a trip. As in his documentary about Heidi Fleiss, Mr. Broomfield burrows into the scuzz surrounding flamboyant public figures to explore a colorful, sordid demimonde, in this case mostly grunge parasites with Nirvana connections. So many interviewees here have grievances to settle or stories to sell that the James M. Cain echoes are stronger than they are in most film noir. And Ms. Love, by fighting and eluding Mr. Broomfield's dogged efforts, turns what might have been a loose, meandering film into "Courtney and Me" (Maslin).
 
* "THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO," starring Kate Beckinsale, Chloe Sevigny, Chris Eigeman and Robert Sean Leonard. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Mr. Stillman's smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway between "Metropolitan" and "Barcelona" in a film that charmingly mixes post-college career worries with improbable discomania. A delightful cast engages in nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting debate, rendered with Mr. Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms. Beckinsale, an English actress with a flawless American accent here and diffidence that's just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at the center of a bright and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone willing to entertain the notion that the spread of environmentalism was sparked by the revival of "Bambi" during the disco generation's formative years (Maslin).
 
"THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION," directed by Nicholas Hytner. Starring Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd, John Pankow and Allison Janney (R, 111 minutes). The latest Hollywood comedy to play house while playing with gender roles is easier to watch than believe. Ms. Aniston is energetic and adorable, too much so for a woman who knows exactly one heterosexual man (a comically unappetizing one) and falls in love with her gay roommate. Pregnant, she asks her charmingly reticent friend (Mr. Rudd) to help her raise the baby, and toothless complications ensue. Whatever the real-life issues raised by such a menage, this stylish but thin comedy isn't up to handling them. Adapted by Wendy Wasserstein from Stephen McCauley's breezy novel of star-crossed relationships, it features welcome worldliness from Nigel Hawthorne as the one wise, rueful figure in the story (Maslin).
 
* "THE OPPOSITE OF SEX," starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100 minutes). Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully acerbic comedy finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from nasty little Wednesday of "The Addams Family" into Lolita's evil twin. Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this film and announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart of gold. Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally skewers preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Mr. Donovan and Ms. Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery, deliver the zingers from Mr. Roos's screenplay with deadpan panache (Maslin).
 
* "A PERFECT MURDER," starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow ad Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film) "Dial M for Murder," but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play are icily amusing. Mr. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled, riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader in deep financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover (Viggo Mortensen), a con man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic and twinkly, is the wife, Emily, a translator at the United Nations, who has her own agenda. The story takes enough surprising twists to keep you engrossed, and the high-style ambiance (especially the Taylors' Fifth Avenue apartment) is mouthwatering (Holden).
 
"QUEST FOR CAMELOT," with the voices of Jessalyn Gilsig, Andrea Carr, Cary Elwes, Bryan White, Gary Oldman, Eric Idle and Don Rickles. Directed by Frederik Du Chau (G, 100 minutes). Warner Brothers' shaky entrance into the Disney-dominated sweepstakes of the musicalized animated feature wants to be a juvenile feminist "Lion King" with a musical heart that fuses "Riverdance" with formulaic Hollywood gush. But its characters are too wishy-washy and visually unfocused to be compelling, and the songs (by David Foster and Carole Bayer Sager) so forgettable as to be extraneous. In this variation on the Arthurian legend, a nondescript Celtic farm girl named Kayley with aspirations to be a knight wrests the magic sword Excalibur from the evil would-be emperor Ruber (a Hulk Hogan look-alike) and saves the kingdom (Holden).
 
* "THE SPANISH PRISONER," starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Written and directed by David Mamet (PG, 112 minutes). The most engaging of Mr. Mamet's cinematic puzzles begins with an X-ray at an airport security check. And the audience will wish it had a similar device for reading the characters' sneaky minds. No such luck: the mystery here, in a handsome and Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate con game, stays tricky to the very end. Mr. Scott plays the inventor of a lucrative, stealable scientific process, with Mr. Gazzara as the boss who's in no hurry to compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast working entirely on the calculating Mamet wavelength, Mr. Martin plays a rich, debonair mystery man who tells the inventor all about his pretty young sister. In her performance as a pert, unaccountably off-kilter secretary, Ms. Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's sleight of hand (Maslin).
 
* "THE TRUMAN SHOW," starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed Harris. Directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol (PG, 104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top, but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Jim Carrey, refreshingly free of shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud contrived by Mr. Harris's so-called "televisionary." Mr. Carrey's innate edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest. Mr. Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin)
 
Film Series
 
"COMDEN AND GREEN." He was an unemployed actor from the Bronx. She was a New York University theater major from Brooklyn. Their names were Adolph Green and Betty Comden, and their collaboration, which began six decades ago, led to films like "Singin' in the Rain," "On the Town," "The Barkleys of Broadway," "Auntie Mame" and "The Band Wagon." Beginning today, as part of its yearlong "N.Y.C. 100" celebration, the Film Forum is presenting a two-week festival of musicals written by the team of Comden and Green, plus some of their favorite films, presented on Mondays. The festival's opening attraction, through Sunday, is a double feature of Vincente Minnelli's "Bells Are Ringing" (1960), including a five-minute number cut from the original release, and Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's "It's Always Fair Weather" (1955). The series continues through June 25 at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, the South Village. Screening schedule and information: (212) 727-8110.

50 Years of the 2CV's Joie de Vivre

BYLINE: By PETER C. T. ELSWORTH 

 BODY:
THE Citroen 2CV, affectionately known the world over as the Deux Chevaux -- for two horsepower -- turns 50 this month. Although the eccentric little car has not been built since 1990, French devotees recently marked its birthday with a parade on the Champs Elysees, and a smaller celebration is planned next week in Massachusetts. Like the Model T Ford and the original Volkswagen, two other cars designed as basic transportation for common people, the 2CV has transcended its humble origins to become a 20th-century icon.
When the car was unveiled in 1948 at the Paris Auto Show, it was greeted with astonishment and derision. An American in attendance is said to have asked, "Does it come with a can opener?" 
 It does indeed look like a tin can on springs, and it has often been called "the duck." But the odd design was intentional. Citroen's general manager at the time, Pierre Boulanger, asked his staff to come up with "four wheels under an umbrella." And Boulanger tested the prototypes by getting into each while wearing a hat; if it was knocked off, the design was rejected.
Like the VW Beetle, the Deux Chevaux was designed in the 1930's. Prototypes were built in 1939, but the car's introduction was delayed until after World War II. By 1953, a plant in Levallois-Perret, France, was turning out 1,500 a week, and the 2CV was ultimately assembled in several other countries. A total of about 5.5 million were built.
Of that number, the Citroen Club of North America estimates there are only 2,000 2CV's in the United States, but not for lack of interest. "People go to Europe, fall in love with it and want to have one here," said Michael Cox, editor of the Citroen Quarterly, who is organizing the 22d annual Citroen Rendezvous in Northfield, Mass. The June 19-21 event will focus this year on the 2CV, and Mr. Cox says he expects more than 100 of the cars to be on hand.
The 2CV was imported from 1955 through the late 60's, but in contrast to the very popular Volkswagen, only a few dozen were sold annually, said Erik de Widt, president of the Citroen Club of North America. Now, however, the 2CV is highly desirable on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the United States, it is prized in seaside vacation spots like Nantucket, Mass., and there are pockets of loyalty in Southern California and the Pacific Northwest.
David Allen, who runs a 2CV importing business in Mustoe, Va., sold 2CV's to Chrysler and Ford for research into economical third-world vehicles. Indeed, Chrysler used the 2CV as a model for its Composite Concept Vehicle, or CCV, a plastic-body car envisioned as low-cost transportation for China and other emerging markets.
The 2CV was nothing if not utilitarian. With its front-wheel drivetrain, it was spacious for its size. The suspension was extraordinarily supple, providing a well-cushioned ride. (Engineers were ordered, legend has it, to put a basket of eggs on the back seat; none of the eggs could be broken after the car crossed a plowed field.) The roll-back canvas roof provided primitive air-conditioning; the seats could be unlatched and removed to serve as picnic chairs.
The car unveiled in 1948 -- the first sales came a year later -- had a two-cylinder, 375-cubic-centimeter engine. (Compare that 0.375-liter power plant with the 2-liter engine of the 1998 VW New Beetle.) The Deux Chevaux appellation referred to the engine's output of just 2 units of chevaux vapeur (2CV), or steam horsepower -- roughly equivalent to 9 regular horsepower -- and powered the car to a top speed of 34 miles an hour. It could travel up to 60 miles on a gallon of gasoline.
Like the VW Beetle, the 2CV managed to be endearing despite its modest performance and homely appearance. Early models came only in gray, but blue, green and yellow paint was added by 1961, when the engine produced 13.5 horsepower and the car could attain 53 m.p.h. Over the years, the size of the engine increased and a number of variations were produced, including a small panel truck for deliveries and a fancier, two-tone model called the Charleston.
In 1962, when Citroen was producing some 1,000 2CV's a day, the car got a new dashboard, a speedometer and odometer, a fuel gauge and electric windshield wipers. (While a student in France in 1968, the author purchased a 1955 model with hand-operated wipers and a dipstick in the gas tank.)
An 18-horsepower version capable of 60 m.p.h. came out in 1963, and in 1968 the company introduced a restyled model, the Dyane, a sort of a new Deux Chevaux. Intended to replace the 2CV, the Dyane faltered when interest in the original 2CV was rekindled by the Green movement in Europe. The Dyane was discontinued in 1988, ahead of the 2CV.
In the United States, a low-mileage model in good condition now costs $8,000 to $10,000, according to Mr. de Widt of the Citroen Club, who said a 2CV in top condition could sell for $18,000. The simple, austere cars produced before 1970 are considered closer in spirit to the original.
Would-be buyers should carefully examine a car's frame, since rust is among the car's chief perils. Frames are now routinely galvanized in the course of restoration.
Even for collectors, the car's simplicity is a virtue. "If you have a 13-millimeter wrench and a screwdriver, you can take the entire engine apart and put it back together again," Mr. de Widt said, noting that parts are available from specialized suppliers like French Parts Service in Bremerton, Wash.
Further information is available from the Citroen Club of North America at (301) 587-8635; from Michael Cox, editor of Citroen Quarterly, at (617) 742-6604, and from French Parts Service at (360) 373-8520.
 
A Gallic Duck's Oddest Offspring
 
PERHAPS the strangest variant of the 2CV was the twin-engined Sahara. It had a pair of 425-cubic-centimeter engines, one at each end of the car and each driving an axle. Built in response to a request from Total, the French oil company, the Sahara was designed for geologists looking for oil in the North African desert.
Individual throttle cables ran to a single gas pedal. It was possible to have the engines and the axles they were driving running at different speeds, which, if everything was not perfectly synchronized, led to interesting handling characteristics as one end of the car attempted to go around a turn at a different speed than the other. Performance of this primitive sport utility might be charitably described as leisurely, since the Sahara weighed 1,800 pounds, compared with 1,100 pounds for a regular 2CV.
Only 694 Saharas were built between 1959 and 1967, and most were shipped to Africa, the Pyrenees mountains in Spain and, for police use, to French Polynesia. Fewer than 25 are thought to exist today.
Saharas have a tiny but devoted following. An unrestored car purchased in 1991 for $6,000 was sold last year for $9,500. A fully restored Sahara sold at a Paris auction in March for $23,500. KEITH MARTIN

Japanese Portrayer of Mythic Warriors Leaves No Stone Unturned

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
One of the achievements of "Heroes and Ghosts: Japanese Prints by Kuniyoshi, 1797-1861" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art is its vigorous demonstration that much recent American popular culture is not simply American, nor completely Western, nor, in concept, especially recent.
The proof starts mounting immediately, and irresistibly, in technically dazzling woodblock images that teem with beautiful colors, colorful characters and extremes of action and emotion. Stir in a string of narratively precise, melodramatic titles, and these prints may initially, if superficially, bring to mind a host of popular American genres: the comic book and its offspring, the action-hero figure as well as the pulp novel and television soap opera. 
 Consider the show's first three woodblock prints: "Warrior Defies Skeleton Conjured by Princess Takiyasha," "The Noble Warrior Minamoto Yorimitsu Slays the Earth Spider" and "Tokiwa Gozen Shields Her Children as She Flees the Enemy Taira Clan in the Snow." (The titles alone tell us that we are in the presence of characters whose triumphs and failures were familiar to a large and loyal public.)
In the first print, a giant skeleton looms over a samurai who, clearly undaunted by the apparition, continues to execute one of his colleagues. In the second, an enormous spider, its legs striped like a convict, is confronted by a ferociously armed warrior. In the third, a beautiful woman in a billowing kimono bends into the wind, her sandaled feet accompanied by those of two otherwise invisible children.
At the end of this first wall hangs "The Moonlit Fight Between the Boy-Hero Minamoto Yoshitsune and the Giant Warrior-Priest Benki on Gojo Bridge in Kyoto," a beautiful, peaceful landscape that might have been designed by Kuniyoshi's better-known contemporary Ando Hiroshige. Except that the peace is shattered by tones of red and black and two extravagantly armed warriors who charge from opposite ends of the arching bridge while a richly dressed spirit hovers overhead refereeing.
Few exhibitions are simultaneously as arcane and immediate as this one. Organized by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in collaboration with the Society for Japanese Arts and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, it contains 125 prints and provides a memorable glimpse into the world of Otagawa Kuniyoshi, whose early aptitude for drawing earned him at age 15 an apprenticeship in the studio of Utagawa Toyokuni, one of the most popular print artists of the previous generation.
After 1827, when his 50 Suikodenwarrior prints began to be published to great popular acclaim, Kuniyoshi became one of the most successful designers of ukiyo-e prints, popular images of urban leisure, in 19th-century Japan. In addition to his extravagantly turned-out bloodthirsty warriors like the Suikoden, characters based on medieval Chinese legend, he was also known for vivid depictions of scary ghosts and monsters, immense sumo wrestlers, beautiful ladies, grimacing Kabuki actors as well as more placid images of cats. Luckily examples of Kuniyoshi's preparatory studies have survived, and several, like "Samurai Killing a Giant Snake," are sprinkled throughout the show, where their quick, animated lines provide a sense of the artist's hand and the impression that images came to him almost fully formed.
This exhibition means to raise Kuniyoshi's historical standing. He was dominant during what was widely considered a period of decline for the woodblock print, especially the figure print, in which he came to specialize. His work was often considered coarse or decadent, an assessment that held sway in many quarters for years.
As the prominent art historian Sherman Lee has written of 19th-century printmaking in Japan: "As popular taste for figure prints became ever more garish, landscape became the only subject for the sensitive and original artist."
But this exhibition suggests that Kuniyoshi may have extended the tradition of the woodblock figure print in at least two ways. First, perhaps at the suggestion of a publisher, Kuniyoshi placed a new emphasis on tales of the past, portraying, sometimes in combination, mythic tales or ancient battles for power, in no short supply in a country torn by internal strife and warring shoguns. (He did this increasingly after 1841, when edicts outlawed the portrayal of Kabuki actors and other contemporary figures in an attempt to reduce excess and strengthen the economy.)
These tales centered on heroes whose exploits were already well-known but were rarely depicted visually. For example, Tokiwa Gozen and her foundlings were actual people, as were the "Enemy Taira Clan" from which she flees. To appease censors, these later images were often presented in series aimed at moral uplift; the image of Tokiwa Gozen is part of a series titled "Mirror of Women of Wisdom and Courage."
Second, there is that garishness, that magnetic visual vibrancy. Even by today's standards, popular and otherwise, Kuniyoshi had an incisive talent for translating dramatic events into dynamic images. He left no stone of visual possibility unturned: richness of color, extreme complexity of composition, opulent expanses of fur or patterned fabric, inventive renderings of ephemeral events.
These include the spurting blood of warriors ignoring their wounds, the monochromatic silhouettes of ghosts, falling or fallen snow, fire and showers of arrows that fill the air, as in "The Last Stand of the Kusunoki at Shijonamate."
Tattoos may also qualify for this last category, like the combination of Chinese peonies and lions that covers most of the bulky form of the battling bandit Roshii Ensei, jumped by supporters of the wrestling champion he has just defeated. (He stands on top of one assailant and thrusts a beam at another, just offstage.)
But since Japan is an island, it makes sense that the subject Kuniyoshi seems to have portrayed most extensively, after people, may have been water -- swaths of transparent blues and crackling, curling frisee-like whitecaps -- that swirls, rains, splashes, cascades and floods throughout these images, sometimes filling them top to bottom.
Perhaps Kuniyoshi has been underappreciated because he was in many ways an overt virtuoso in a society where covert virtuosity -- restrained if not invisible -- was often the norm, yet where every method of fabrication was, and often still is, refined to the level of an art form. One wonders if he appreciated this conflict, or even took a certain pleasure in emphasizing it. For while he catalogued a range of art forms in his images -- portraying opulent fabrics, suits of armor, weapons and saddles, ships and houses -- he also usually inserted them into roiling action scenes, where they were subjected to the destructive forces whose ultimate source was his vehemently fertile imagination.
"Heroes and Ghosts: Japanese Prints by Kuniyoshi, 1797-1861" remains at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street, through June 28.

Up There In High Dudgeon

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The trial lawyers who whipped Big Bad Tobacco are now trying to collect fees that run into billions of dollars. This has produced the usual outcries from people who hate to see anybody wallow in money, especially when the anybody is a lawyer.
Lawyers, like journalists, are alluring targets. It's shabby of me, but I take an occasional whack at lawyers myself. What is it about lawyers that sours the sweetest human natures? 
 Well, for one thing, lawyers complicate what is simple and complexify what is merely complicated. And, of course, they take their sweet old time doing it. The mills of the gods may grind slowly, but the mills of the law grind scarcely at all.
It is easy for a person to spend 80 or 90 percent of his life in the coils of the law if he is foolish enough to phone a lawyer or luckless enough to receive a hostile lawyer's subpoena.
Still, there is a lot to be said for lawyers. There is, for example, the lawyerly rebuttal to the medical doctor arguing that medicine was the greater profession: "While your profession was trying to cure disease with leeches, mine was writing the Constitution of the United States."
Sometimes they seem to have framed the Constitution so that lawyers would run things perpetually. They created a judiciary and instantly put one-third of the government in lawyers' hands.
The second third, a.k.a. the Congress, always contains such hordes of lawyers that the United States Government can be called, without too much exaggeration, a conspiracy of lawyers.
Why are reformers so hellbent on term limitations for Congress? Lawyer limitations -- limiting the number of lawyers in Congress -- would produce a far more representative body.
But back to billion-dollar fees for the tobacco-case lawyers: Part of the outrage is accountable to the way we think of the word "billion."
The billion is the unit in which we measure such cosmic magnitudes as the number of galaxies in the universe, the wealth of Bill Gates, Harvard's endowment and Congressional pork bills.
In these tobacco cases, however, the lawyers have a reasonable argument. Trial lawyers traditionally work for one-third of the take in civil suits.
This can be a dandy sum of money, especially in one of those mass-market cases where the lawyer sues on behalf of all humanity, which was basically what was happening in the tobacco affair. On the other hand, if his client loses, the lawyer gets nothing but the bills he runs up to develop the case.
In view of tobacco's long record of eluding efforts to nail it in the courts, trial lawyers in the tobacco cases were betting against the odds. This time they won the lottery. They want billions. Right-thinking people are outraged.
The fact about a big payday is that nobody deserves one, at least if he is raking in more money than I, the hard-working and underpaid salt of the earth without the likes of whom this great country would not exist, am making.
The problem here is that salt of the earth is not one of the high-end jobs in the present labor market. There are billions galore to sweeten Friday nights in this gigantic booming economy, but most of us had bad guidance counseling in high school, so got trapped in low-end work.
The big -- really big! -- paydays are pretty much confined to two lines of work. One is drawing a crowd. The bigger the crowd you draw, the bigger the pay.
This is why entertainers -- rock stars, Seinfelds, Spielbergs, Madonnas, Michael Jordans, Albert Belles, John Grishams, Greg Normans -- are paid the wealth of the Indies. In a world that lives to be entertained, they all lure hordes into the tent.
The other lucrative line of work consists of moving vast clumps of money from one pocket to the other. The legal rules in this line of work allow people who move the money to skim percentages of the money being moved.
With billions in constant movement, it's a great trade to be in. This explains why investment bankers, toilers in the stock markets and captains and pirates of global industry -- those buyers, sellers and mergers of multibillion-dollar blocks of money -- have private jets and 35-room weekend estates.
Thinking about it makes me purple with rage, green with envy, blue about my own personal red ink, and sullen enough to kick a lawyer.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Retail sales rose for the seventh consecutive month in May, the Government said today, bolstered by strong car sales and a strong job market that are helping to offset weaker exports to Asia.
With an assist from the strongest new-car sales in 15 months, retail sales rose a stronger-than-expected nine-tenths of a percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted $224.62 billion, after rising seven-tenths of a percent in April, the Commerce Department said. The gain exceeded private economists' forecasts of a seven-tenths of a percent rise. 
 Analysts said Asia's deepening economic woes made Japanese cars and other products cheaper for Americans and have prompted a flood of capital into the United States, bolstering demand.
"The consumer, partly because of the positive effects on America from Asia's ongoing problems, is proving to be a powerful offset to an Asian slowdown," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
In its report, the department said sales of new cars and trucks jumped 2.4 percent last month, double the 1.2 percent April increase. It was the strongest rise in auto sales, which account for a quarter of retail sales, since a 3.5 percent surge in February 1997.
Separately, the Labor Department said new jobless claims fell by 23,000 last week, to 315,000, the latest evidence that ample job opportunities were providing consumers with the income and confidence to keep spending freely.

HEADLINE: Pakistan, Facing Sanctions, Urges Citizens to Cut Back

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, June 11

 BODY:
With the economy facing sanctions because of the Government's nuclear tests, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called on Pakistanis today to tighten their belts.
"We have to pay a heavy price," he warned in a televised address to the nation. 
 Mr. Sharif called for selling his palatial Government offices and asked Pakistanis to drink less tea and to skimp on cooking oil.
Most strikingly, Mr. Sharif said, his Government would confiscate more than one million acres of farmland from feudal lords and redistribute the acreage to peasants and tenant farmers.
The economy is already faltering, and sanctions threaten much of the aid that Pakistan receives from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as well as from the United States, Japan and other countries.
Pakistan also formally announced a moratorium on nuclear tests today and invited India to join it as a "confidence-building measure" to reduce tensions. The countries, old enemies, have been tense since India and then Pakistan set off nuclear explosions last month.
"The Government of Pakistan has decided to announce a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing," the statement, from the Foreign Ministry, said. "We are ready to engage constructively with India and other members of the international community to formalize this arrangement."
In his address, the Prime Minister struck a patriotic and populist note, offering Pakistanis "congratulations on achieving this honor" -- becoming a nuclear power -- and linking the paring down of the economy to changes like land redistribution and the development of cottage industries for unemployed young people.
The vast stretches of farmland that the Government plans to seize, Mr. Sharif said, were given to the landlords "for betraying the nation in favor of the British" in colonial days, and some of the lands have remained in family ownership despite previous efforts at land reform.
"We have identified all these lands which are occupied illegitimately," the Prime Minister said. "The land should belong to those who grow on it with their sweat."
Mr. Sharif, a scion of a wealthy but self-made family of industrialists, is the first Prime Minister who is not from the feudal class that has long dominated politics. That class includes his rival, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, whose family has large landholdings in Sindh province.
The economy's biggest problem, Mr. Sharif said, was agriculture, which has been stagnant for years. All he asked of tenant farmers and peasants who would receive the farmland was that they turn Pakistan "into a granary."
The Prime Minister said he would set an example by turning over his family's assets to banks to pay off outstanding business loans. He would do that, he announced, even though the debts had been incurred because of what he said were punitive Government maneuvers against his family when Ms. Bhutto was in power. He described that time in considerable, and bitter, detail.
His Government, Mr. Sharif said, would halve expenses. It will not buy more cars, refrigerators, furniture or air conditioners, he said, and it will not hold receptions in hotels, and it will use half as much paper.
Government guest houses in provincial capitals and other Government buildings would be sold, including the Prime Minister's Secretariat, a new sparkling white and imposing building. It was not clear who might want it or what it could be used for.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Asian Crisis Lifts Bonds But Not Stocks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled yesterday even as Government bond yields fell to their lowest level in more than 20 years.
The disjunction of the two markets, which have normally moved in the same direction in recent years, is a result of the disquieting impact of the economic turmoil in Asia, where stock markets and currencies fell once again yesterday. The deepening problems in Russia are also playing a role. 
 Asia's problems are also influencing other markets. Japan's inability to right its economy, combined with comments from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin sent the dollar close to an eight-year high against the yen. And both the stronger dollar and Asia's weakening demand helped send an important commodity index to its lowest level in five years as oil prices fell more than 5 percent.
"There's a big part of the world much deeper in financial crisis," said Richard B. Hoey, the chief investment officer at the Dreyfus Corporation. Robert V. DiClemente, the chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney, called it "the most complicated environment I have ever had to analyze."
The bond market is benefiting from the rush of foreign investors looking for a haven for their money. The stock market is suffering from worries about earnings that could be undermined by both slower sales in Asia and the price cutting forced by the competition from lower-cost products from Asia that are now cheaper because of big declines in currency values across Asia.
The fall of stocks yesterday, on top of the decline Wednesday, left several of the major indexes just points above their recent lows. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller company stocks dropped 6.73 points, or 1.5 percent, to its lowest level since February. It is now off 9.6 percent since its record high in April.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 159.93 points, or 1.8 percent, to 8,811.77, off 4.3 percent since its May high, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 17.70 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,094.58., down 3.2 percent since its April high. The Nasdaq index finished 23.50 points, or 1.3 percent lower, at 1,749.75, off 8.8 percent from its recent high.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 23/32, to 106 25/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.65 percent, from 5.70 percent Wednesday and below the previous closing low of 5.69 percent Jan. 12. This is the lowest yield on the 30-year bond since it was first issued regularly in 1977, and analysts say that 30-year corporate bond yields are now at their lowest levels in about 30 years.
"The focus is international," said Matthew F. Alexy, the chief market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "The thing to watch here is the flow of funds from abroad."
The bond market also got a big boost yesterday from Mr. Rubin, whose Congressional testimony early in the day was interpreted by traders as indicating that the United States was not willing to step in to help slow or stop the fall of the rapidly weakening Japanese yen.
Although Mr. Rubin amended his remarks later, the dollar jumped 1.7 percent against the yen to 143.79, as traders took his comments as an invitation to sell yen. Many of the dollars they got went into notes and bonds, pushing prices higher.
Thomas M. Galvin, the chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said Mr. Rubin's remarks might have jarred some investors who feared a spiraling crisis. But he said that in the end the long-term stability and success of Japan were dependent on how Japanese officials handled the crisis. Intervention can only have a temporary impact, he said.
Mr. Hoey of Dreyfus said that a weakening yen could force China to devalue its currency and the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the United States dollar, and that would touch off another round of devaluations in that part of the world. The result for investors in United States equities could be dire, he said.
A stronger dollar would mean higher-priced exports, pushing down demand, and lower profits abroad when sales are translated back into dollars. The stronger dollar also makes imports cheaper and cuts into American profit margins.
Weakening Asian demand may also depress global oil prices, which have already been falling sharply. This may be good for consumers, but already troubled economies, like Russia's, that depend on oil revenues will have more difficulty recovering. Oil for July delivery dropped 73 cents a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $12.75, nearing a 10-year low.

HEADLINE: Gathering to Sing A Song of Their Past

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
Worn into the frayed burgundy carpet at the front of the Eldridge Street Synagogue are two footprints, the marks left by the succession of cantors who led congregations in prayer from the time the synagogue was the neighborhood shul of tailors and peddlers on the late 19th-century Lower East Side.
Those footprints were a poignant bit of history for the 300 cantors who crowded into the landmark synagogue on Monday, their collective voices resounding like the voices of 300 Pavarottis. And history was much on their minds as they gathered this week for the annual convention of the Cantors Assembly. The organization, affiliated with Conservative Judaism and the largest of three American cantorial groups, is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. 
 The cantors took pleasure reminiscing about the days when cantors were the stars of the Jewish world and people taking a break from High Holiday worship would argue the comparative virtues of Yossele Rosenblatt, Moshe Koussevitzky and Richard Tucker while their sons compared the center-field skills of Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays and Duke Snider.
In teeming Jewish communities like Borough Park in Brooklyn or Passaic, N.J., cantors would perform four or five weddings on a Saturday night. Abraham Shapiro, a retired cantor from Lynbrook, N.Y., recalled that when the legendary Leibele Waldman confronted one anxious groom who was about to faint, he took the matter firmly in hand.
"Listen," Cantor Waldman warned him. "I got four more to do tonight. I've got to get out of here."
But the convention also comes at a time when cantors have to grapple with changes in their profession unimagined a generation ago.
For one thing, the cantor is increasingly likely to sing in a soprano. Though female cantors were not given full status in the Conservative movement until 1987, 40 of the Assembly's 450 members are women and, more tellingly, women make up half the classes at the cantorial school of the Jewish Theological Seminary, the fountainhead of the Conservative movement. In the Reform movement, women are a sizable majority of trainees. (Orthodox Jews do not permit women to lead congregational prayers.)
"Many of the women who might have become cantors in our days had to make other career choices," said Erica Lippitz, one of the first two female cantors to graduate from the Jewish Theological Seminary and now the cantor of Oheb Shalom in South Orange, N.J. "The years have given us a whole new generation of women who, when they were teen-agers, could think about the cantorate as a first profession."
Another change in the cantorate is that congregations want their cantors to do more than sing, to be jacks-of-all-trades, virtually rabbis with golden voices, all for a salary that averages $70,000 plus benefits. Ms. Lippitz finds some members of the congregation relying on her to discuss troubling personal issues like divorce. Marla Rosenfeld Barugel of Congregation B'nai Israel in Rumson, N.J., a mother of two sons, teaches afternoon Hebrew school, prepares candidates for the bar and bat mitzvahs, supervises the Sabbath Torah readers and runs the weekly practices of the choir.
"My relationship with my kids is on my day off and over the phone," said Ms. Barugel.
Stephen J. Stein, an Akron, Ohio, cantor who is the Assembly's new executive vice president, said that when congregations want to economize, cantors -- known in Hebrew as hazzans -- are the ripest target.
"When a congregation looks at its budget and says, 'Where can we slash?', the role of the rabbi is never in question," he said. "They'll say, 'Let's go from a full-time cantor to a part-time and from a part-time to no cantor at all.' "
But on Monday morning, the profession's problems were far from the cantors' minds as they took time, jovially, to remember some of the great cantors of old.
At a panel discussion at the World Trade Center's Marriott hotel, they reminisced about the days when Yossele Rosenblatt's singing in Borough Park's Anshe Sfard or Harlem's Ohab Zedek not only filled a Kol Nidrei service on Yom Kippur, but an ordinary Sabbath. So crowded was his synagogue on a Sabbath that tickets were required, and a gentile Pinkerton guard would let those without tickets in with the warning, "You can go in, but don't pray."
The panel discussion was titled "Renew Our Days as of Old," after a verse from Jeremiah chanted when the Torah is returned to the Ark. But several speakers observed that the old days were not all that wonderful.
Cantors earned their bread by working most of the week as tailors, carpenters and salesmen. They had no job protections and the first effort to give them some would have merged them with the butchers' union -- an insult to the famously egotistic profession. Young Jewish boys were recruited into steppingstone choirs by a self-styled talent scout named Abe Nadler, who paid them 15 cents plus carfare for a night's work.
"He was not exactly a thin man," said Saul Hammerman, a retired cantor from Baltimore. "Maybe 450 pounds. That's after Yom Kippur."
Those assembled for the panel discussion said the profession's status began to change with the creation of the Cantors Assembly in 1948, which backed cantors with a powerful organization. Another milestone was a 1966 Federal tax ruling that determined that cantors were not just entertainers but clergy members, entitled to the same benefits and deductions as rabbis and ministers.
The cantors are also aware that they benefit from a nationwide scarcity. Many young people do not want to spend the five years in the Torah, Talmud and music studies required to become a bona fide cantor.
At the Eldridge Street Synagogue, just before the afternoon service, Dr. Ismar Schorsch, the seminary's chancellor, gave the cantors a kind of pep talk, reminding them that they were the ones whose reverential and mellifluous voices opened "the gates of righteousness" for worshipers.
"They want to feel something holy in their lives, which have been numbed by the pace of materialistic life in America," he said of the congregations. "One needs a guide, a source of inspiration. That comes from the hazzan."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
West Side Co-op Converts to a Condo

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Seeking to make apartments in their building more attractive to prospective purchasers and to ease their own monthly payments, shareholders in a nine-story co-op at 30 West 90th Street have converted the building to a condominium. The 47-unit building, which was converted from a rental to a co-op in 1985, is the first in New York City to switch from a co-op to a condominium form of ownership, according to real-estate lawyers.
The building, between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, became a condo in February, after a year and a half of negotiations among the co-op board, shareholders and the sponsor, the Beechmont Investment Company of Port Chester, N.Y., which held the building's $4 million mortgage and owns the remaining 25 unsold apartments. Rent-stabilized tenants of any of these unsold apartments will retain their rights to occupy the units. 
 An aim of all parties was to encourage sales and restore values at the 71-year-old building, where no units had been sold in at least six years.
"We were hamstrung by the debt on the property, which was difficult to refinance because of the high number of units the sponsor owned," said John T. Kaplan, who was president of the co-op board during the conversion. He said that with the switch to the condo form, "shareholders gained control of their own destiny with respect to their financing needs."
In the three months since sales began, contracts have been signed for 15 one- and two-bedroom units, which have 550 to 1,000 square feet. Average sale prices are $294 a square foot, or $250,000 for a 850-square-foot one bedroom, which is competitive with comparable units in the area, according to the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage.
Because condos, unlike co-ops, do not have underlying mortgages, unit owners first paid off their buildingwide loan, which was at an 11 percent interest rate, by assuming their share of that loan. The sponsor discounted the amount of the loan by 17 percent for each owner as an incentive to convert.
The individual co-op share loans on each unit -- which are similar to mortgages on houses or condominium units -- plus the proportionate shares of the buildingwide mortgage were then converted to conventional mortgages at 7.5 percent on what now are condo apartments.
The result was that while unit owners took on more personal debt, they were able to reduce their monthly costs by an average of 20 percent, said Kenneth R. Jacobs, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Smith, Buss & Jacobs, who represented unit owners in the conversion.
For example, after the conversion and refinancing, the total monthly cost, which includes taxes, the mortgage payment and maintenance fee, on a 750-square-foot apartment on the ninth floor that had been $2,109 when the building was a co-op was reduced to $1,630.
Mr. Jacobs called the conversion a "win-win" because the sponsor would be able to sell the units it controls more easily, while apartment owners not only reduced their monthly costs but gained "more flexibility in what they can do with their apartments."
The West Side building is part of small but growing group of co-ops nationwide that have changed to condos. Though it is believed to be the only co-op to make the switch in Manhattan, where there are 337 condo buildings compared with 1,388 co-ops, industry professionals say several others are undergoing or exploring the possibility, including a 197-unit co-op at 401 East 89th Street at First Avenue.
"As far as I am aware, this is the first co-op in New York City to be converted to a condominium," said Stuart M. Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Co-operatives. The New York State Attorney General's office said that it knew of several co-ops moving through the conversion process.
There are differences between the co-op and condo form of ownership. In co-ops, purchasers own stock in a corporation that owns their building and the stock entitles them to a proprietary lease to occupy their apartments. Co-op owners, through the board of directors they elect, have considerable power in their buildings, including the ability to reject or accept prospective buyers. In condos, buyers acquire the apartment and an interest in the common areas. Ownership of a condo can be transferred relatively simply.
Condos also are perceived to be easier to market than co-ops and sell for about 25 percent more on average, said Gary Brynes, director of the co-op and condo division at the Corcoran Group.
No one believes that co-ops will lose their predominance in Manhattan. "New Yorkers are not about to give up the exclusivity and ability to control who lives next to them," Mr. Saft said.
So getting all shareholders to agree to a conversion is a major hurdle. There are also the mortgage closing costs involved in paying off the co-op's mortgage and converting owners' share loans into mortgage loans. And shareholders as well as the co-op corporation will be liable to pay income tax on any gain resulting from the conversion. Nonetheless, when a co-op building suffers from high debt and many unsold apartments, a conversion to the condo format may be worth the effort.
Mr. Jacobs said 30 West 90th Street was able to address some of the issues more easily because the sponsor supported the conversion and discounted each unit holder's share of the buildingwide loan. He said that the three banks providing the mortgages on the condos also discounted their fees and that in many cases the closing costs were folded into the loans.
As for the tax consequences, the corporation expects to use the net operating losses accumulated over the life of the co-op to offset any taxable gain generated by the conversion substantially, said Albert Feuer, the tax lawyer for the corporation.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Remarks: Isolation Is Clearly Unworkable

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's address yesterday at the National Geographic Society in Washington, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company.
A stable, open, prosperous China that assumes its responsibilities for building a more peaceful world is clearly and profoundly in our interests. On that point, all Americans agree. But as we all know, there is serious disagreement over how best to encourage the emergence of that kind of China and how to handle our differences, especially over human rights, in the meantime. 
 Some Americans believe we should try to isolate and contain China because of its undemocratic system and human rights violations, and in order to retard its capacity to become America's next great enemy. Some believe increased commercial dealings alone will inevitably lead to a more open, more democratic China.
We have chosen a different course that I believe to be both principled and pragmatic, expanding our areas of cooperation with China, while dealing forthrightly with our differences. This policy is supported by our key democratic allies in Asia; Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand and the Philippines. It has recently been publicly endorsed by a number of distinguished religious leaders, including the Rev. Billy Graham and the Dalai Lama.
My trip has been recently supported by political opponents of the current Chinese Government, including, most recently, Wang Dan.
There is a reason for this. Seeking to isolate China is clearly unworkable. Even our friends and allies around the world do not support us -- or would not support us in that. We would succeed, instead, in isolating ourselves and our own policy. . . .
When I travel to China this month I will work with President Jiang to advance our Asian security agenda, keeping the pressure on India and Pakistan to curb their nuclear arms race and to commence a dialogue, using the strength of our economies and our influence to bolster Asian economies battered by the economic crisis and discussing steps we can take to advance peace and security on the Korean peninsula. I will encourage President Jiang to pursue the cross-strait discussion the P.R.C. recently resumed with Taiwan, and where we have already seen a reduction in tensions. . . .
In the past, China has been a major exporter of sophisticated weapons-related technologies. That is why, in virtually all our high-level contacts with China's leadership and in my summit meeting with President Jiang last October, nonproliferation has been high on the agenda. Had we been trying to isolate China rather than work with it, would China have agreed to stop assistance to Iran for its nuclear program, to terminate its assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, such as those in Pakistan, to tighten its export-control system? To sell no more anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran? These vital decisions were all in our interests, and they clearly were the fruit of our engagement. I will continue to press China on proliferation. . . .
Over the past decade, the number of mobile phones has jumped from 50,000 to more than 13 million in China. And China is heading from about 400,000 Internet accounts, last year, to more than 20 million early in the next century. Already, one in five residents in Beijing has access to satellite transmissions. Some of the American satellites China sends into space beam CNN, and other independent sources of news and ideas, into China.
The licensing of American commercial satellite launches on Chinese rockets was approved by President Reagan, begun by President Bush, continued under my Administration, for the simple reason that the demand for American satellites far outstrips America's launch capacity and because others, including Russian and European nations, can do this job at much less cost.
It is important for every American to understand that there are strict safeguards, including a Department of Defense plan for each launch, to prevent any assistance to China's missile programs. Licensing these launches allows us to meet the demand for American satellites and helps people on every continent share ideas, information and images, through television, cell phones and pagers. In the case of China, the policy also furthers our efforts to stop the spread of missile technology by providing China incentives to observe nonproliferation agreements. This policy clearly has served our national interests. . . .
Seeking to isolate China will not free one more political dissident, will not open one more church to those who wish to worship, will do nothing to encourage to live -- China to live -- by the laws it has written. Instead, it will limit our ability to advance human rights and religious and political freedom.
When I travel to China, I will take part in an official greeting ceremony in front of the Great Hall of the People across from Tiananmen Square. I will do so because that is where the Chinese Government receives visiting heads of state and government, including President Chirac of France and, most recently, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel.
Some have suggested I should refuse to take part in this traditional ceremony, that somehow going there would absolve the Chinese Government of its responsibility for the terrible killings at Tiananmen Square nine years ago, or indicate that America is no longer concerned about such conduct. They are wrong.
Protocol and honoring a nation's traditional practices should not be confused with principle. China's leaders, as I have repeatedly said, can only move beyond the events of June 1989 when they recognize the reality that what the Government did was wrong. Sooner or later they must do that. . . .

HEADLINE: Lawyer to Study Lilco Chief's Pay Package

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., June 11

 BODY:
Despite Gov. George E. Pataki's demand for his ouster, William J. Catacosinos is still gripping the chairman's reins at the new Marketspan Corporation. Today he presided over the company's first meeting of its board of directors.
But the directors, putting aside all other business at their closed meeting, devoted the entire three-hour session to the issue that prompted the Governor's attack: the $42 million payment that Dr. Catacosinos collected at the demise on May 28 of Marketspan's predecessor, the Long Island Lighting Company, where he was chairman. 
 Before considering what, if any, action to take, the new Marketspan board decided to hire an independent lawyer to conduct a fact-finding study and report back by the next directors' meeting, on June 26. The lawyer has not been chosen.
Marketspan officials said that the review would focus on what compensation was awarded and whether it was properly authorized and disclosed. "The board has a concern about the Governor's position and wants to get down to what the facts are," Vincent Tese, one of the directors who did not come from Lilco or Brooklyn Union Gas, which merged to form Marketspan, said in an interview.
At a news conference after the meeting, a company spokesman, Joseph McDonnell, said, "The outside attorney will review the Lilco board's actions to see whether they were appropriate, particularly in regard to disclosures."
The Governor contends that Dr. Catacosinos's $42 million, plus $25 million paid to 25 other Lilco executives, violated the contracts under which the state took over most of Lilco's electricity service and the rest of Lilco merged with the Brooklyn Union Gas holding company. Severance pay was barred by a no-layoff provision guaranteeing all 8,000 Lilco and Brooklyn Union employees new jobs at Marketspan, Governor Pataki said.
He had pushed for the state takeover to enable a 20 percent cut in electricity bills, which under Lilco were the highest in the continental United States.
"The Governor continues to believe Mr. Catacosinos should resign and give the money back," said Mr. Pataki's spokesman, Michael F. McKeon. "This was an extraordinary act of greed, and it must not stand."
The compensation dispute is said to have provoked an internal power struggle at Marketspan, with Dr. Catacosinos leading the Lilco faction and Robert B. Catell, Marketspan's new president and the former Brooklyn Union chairman, leading the other side.
Public officials have said that both factions were trying to gain the upper hand, with Dr. Catacosinos and Mr. Catell trying to oust each other. But neither side lined up a solid majority on the board -- composed of six directors from Lilco, six from Brooklyn Union and two independent directors (the last independent director is yet to be named). So there appears to be a truce and mutual strategic retreat, at least for now.
The company's spokesman described the scene at today's meeting: Dr. Catacosinos sat with Mr. Catell at his side as the directors gathered around the large wood conference table in the old Lilco headquarters in Hicksville, N.Y.
"Dr. Catacosinos and Mr. Catell will be working together to continue the process of bringing this new company forward," Mr. McDonnell said afterward. "The meeting was an open and frank discussion with participation from all of the members. It was not confrontational. It was collegial, cordial and professional. In no way was it hostile at all. The board sought to identify the key issues that had to be addressed and seeks to resolve this matter expeditiously."
Governor Pataki's appointee as chairman of the state agency that took over the electricity system, Richard M. Kessel, said: "While we're encouraged that the Marketspan board is investigating this matter, the only acceptable resolution is for Dr. Catacosinos to leave and pay back the money. The final chapter of this story is yet to be written."
Mr. Kessel's agency, the Long Island Power Authority, has long-term contracts to buy electricity from the old Lilco generators now owned by Marketspan and to hire the new company to operate the electricity system.
The compensation issue, already under investigation by State Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco and the Public Service Commission at Mr. Pataki's request, now faces yet another review.
The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, directed today that joint hearings be held by the Energy Committee and the Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions. Among the witnesses to be called are Dr. Catacosinos, Mr. Catell, Mr. Kessel and Maureen Helmer, chairwoman of the Public Service Commission.
A separate investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission has been requested by Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker and a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, and by Representative Charles E. Schumer, who is running for the Democratic nomination for the Senate.
Eliot L. Spitzer, who is running for the Democratic nomination for state attorney general, called Mr. Vacco inept and wrote to Janet Reno, the United States Attorney General, asking the Justice Department to investigate.

Workers at a Second Plant Go On Strike Against G.M.
Nearly 6,000 members of the United Automobile Workers union went on strike last night at a General Motors spark plug and speedometer factory in Flint, Mich., joining strikers at a nearby G.M. plant in a bitter fight that could close all of the company's North American assembly plants within days. 
 G.M. had already closed seven North American assembly plants and temporarily laid off 18,600 workers for lack of parts from the initial strike at a metal-stamping plant. Most of G.M.'s other 22 assembly plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico are now expected to quickly run out of spark plugs, speedometers and other parts. Page A1.
 
Asia Economies and Markets Slump
The Japanese yen fell sharply against the American dollar, reaching nearly an eight-year low and causing some other Asian currencies and stock markets to drop to their lowest levels in years. The falling yen appears to be the culprit in the latest bout of fear that the Asian financial crisis may be spreading into the most serious region-wide recession since the end of World War II. A1.
 
Asian markets were lower early today. After slumping on Thursday, stocks fell further in Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines in early trading today. But they stabilized in Hong Kong and rose in Indonesia. The yen continued to tumble. D6.

HEADLINE: Welfare Time Limit Questioned as People Reapply

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 11

 BODY:
Six months after Connecticut began imposing time limits on welfare, some people who were cut off are now seeking to have their benefits restored and their numbers may increase, according to an independent review of the state's new system.
The report, which was released today, raises questions about the effectiveness of Gov. John G. Rowland's much-heralded welfare program, one of the centerpieces of his administration. Mr. Rowland had pointed to a 25 percent decline in the number of welfare recipients from the start of the program in July 1995 to this April as proof that Connecticut's program was working. 
 The report by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a social policy research group, found that some people who left the program for jobs lost those jobs after one to three months and asked to receive benefits again.
While few people so far have been cut off without other income, the report predicted that that would happen more often as state workers began to monitor cases more closely and found more people not looking for work or otherwise not following the rules. The report also found that state workers had little contact with welfare recipients, leaving some people without all the help they needed and others getting state checks when they no longer qualified.
Connecticut was one of the first states in the country to impose a time limit on welfare benefits in an effort to get people off state assistance and into employment.
Today, Joyce A. Thomas, the State Commissioner of Social Services, said that the report showed that Connecticut was succeeding in one critical area: getting the message out that people must return to work. She also handed out charts showing a striking decrease in Connecticut's welfare rolls: from slightly more than 59,000 in July 1995, to about 44,000 in April.
While the state's strong economy played a major role in that decrease, Connecticut's time limit encouraged more people to go to work than would otherwise have done so, she said. In April, 56 percent of welfare recipients facing a time limit were working at least part time, compared with 14.3 percent of the recipients in a control group who were not under the time limit, according to the State Department of Social Services.
Ms. Thomas acknowledged that some were returning to welfare after losing their jobs, but she said the state was also helping those people find new jobs relatively easily.
The report warns that its data are not definitive. It dealt with one-quarter of the state's caseload and studied just the first three months after the time limit began.

HEADLINE: Many Asian Markets Fall Lower Still

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, June 12

 BODY:
The Japanese yen tumbled today to another eight-year low, and investors sent most Asian stock markets down further in some of the heaviest selling since financial turmoil began in Asia nearly a year ago.
The dollar sold here at a rate of 144.54 yen this morning, compared with 143.79 in New York late Thursday. It was the weakest level for the yen since the fall of 1990, when hostilities threatened to expand in the Persian Gulf. 
 The yen's slide is regarded as one of the main reasons for renewed instability in Asian markets because it is pressing other Asian currencies lower.
In Japanese share trading, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 148.06 points, or 1 percent, to 14,865.98 at the midday break, after a 2.12 percent drop Thursday. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index was down 11.36 points, or about 1 percent, to 1,167.45, after a 1.65 percent fall on Thursday.
The weakness reverberated to other Asian stock markets, although the rate of descent slowed in Hong Kong, where the benchmark Hang Seng index was relatively stable after having fallen more than 8 percent over three days. Late this morning, the Hang Seng was 25.49 points, or three-tenths of a percent lower, at 7,859.95.
Stocks plunged 5.4 percent in South Korea and 4.6 percent in the Philippines. They were down 2.8 percent in Thailand, 1.9 percent in Australia and 1.3 percent in Malaysia. Prices rose slightly in Indonesia.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
Flinty Chief Executive Whom Long Islanders Love to Hate -- William James Catacosinos

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
If he hadn't devoted the last 14 years to running Long Island's electrical utility, Dr. William J. Catacosinos might have had a second career as a mighty fine poker player.
Single-minded, flinty, competitive, unbluffable -- that's how people describe the 68-year-old chairman and chief executive of the Marketspan Corporation, the recently hatched corporate offspring of his erstwhile fief, the Long Island Lighting Company, and the Brooklyn Union Gas holding company. 
 "His nickname is 'The Cat' because he's so tenacious. You know, like a cat is strong, powerful and ready to pounce on its prey," said Jack Kulka, a Long Island builder who has been on friendly terms with Dr. Catacosinos (pronounced cat-a-koh-SEE-nos) for 25 years, even though he now heads a citizens group opposing the utility merger.
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo went head to head with Dr. Catacosinos over the terms of a 1988 state bailout for Lilco, which sought to pass a $4 billion debt for the Shoreham nuclear power plant on to Long Island electric consumers.
The Governor blinked first.
"He's gotten rich by outstaring people at the negotiating table," Mr. Cuomo later joked.
Just how rich is now a matter of hot debate.
At issue is the $42 million that Dr. Catacosinos, as Lilco's chairman, received when the much-maligned Long Island utility ceased to exist last month. The size of his compensation package has come to overshadow just about every other issue on the agenda of Marketspan, which has plenty to do with a payroll of 8,000 workers and a customer base of two million in Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens and Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
Gov. George E. Pataki, who negotiated the state-financed deal that resulted in the energy merger and Lilco's demise, has fiercely condemned Dr. Catacosinos's golden parachute. So have Long Island electricity consumers, who have filed three class-action suits challenging the package.
But people who know Dr. Catocosino, who has been criticized repeatedly over the years for taking pay raises while Lilco customers paid the highest electricity rates in the continental United States, say his deal for a healthy payout should not have come as a surprise.
"He knows how to take politicians to the cleaners, because in every deal he's negotiated with governors and Albany politicians, he's come out on top," said Wayne Prospect, a former Suffolk County legislator who is working to undo the Lilco deal. "It's a pig-out package."
The son of Greek immigrants, Dr. Catacosinos boasts the kind of personal history that makes all-American heroes. William James Catacosinos grew up in Washington Heights, struggled to learn English to catch up in school, and absorbed the values of thrift and enterprise by going to work at age 9, sweeping his father's Harlem grocery store.
He made it to New York University and earned a master's degree in business administration, then a Ph.D. in economics by simultaneously attending classes and working full time at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. He insists on the honorific "Doctor."
"I learned instinct," he once said about his childhood, "and I learned to survive."
But despite that storybook climb up the ladder of success, Dr. Catacosinos is the man that Long Islanders love to hate.
First, he took over and quickly became the personification of a utility that maintained famously rotten relations with its customers.
"We deal with utility issues around the state," said Larry Shapiro, senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "Nothing comes close to the extreme hatred that Long Islanders had for Lilco."
Second, he developed a reputation for arrogance.
In 1985, Hurricane Gloria knocked out power for parts of Long Island for nearly two weeks. Dr. Catacosinos was vacationing in Italy with his wife, Florence, a former airline flight attendant. He dallied. Long Islanders accused him of lacking feeling. They still talk about it as if it happened yesterday.
And finally, Dr. Catacosinos succeeded in making money for the shareholders of Lilco.
When he assumed the chairmanship in 1984, after serving on Lilco's board, the company had the astronomically overbudget Shoreham nuclear power plant on its hands, as well as well-organized community activists who wanted Shoreham never to open. It was suffocating in debt and spurned by Wall Street as one of the country's worst-run utilities.
It was a daunting job, even for a self-made millionaire like Dr. Catacosinos, a man who credits himself with "barracuda instinct" and made his fortune helping to found two companies and selling them at substantial profits to his bigger competitors.
At the time, he was 53 years old and talked of the Lilco challenge with something of a crusader's zeal.
"As my wife said to me, if you believe you can help, then you should do it, because all of us in this life have to give something back," he said in an interview at the time.
Dr. Catacosinos eventually turned Lilco around financially, winning praisefrom Wall Street and his shareholders, but attracting the enmity of just about everyone else. At first, he dismissed about 1,000 workers -- 20 percent of the work force -- as well as the utility's president and three vice presidents. Four years later, after torturous negotiations with the Cuomo administration, he was able to transfer to the ratepayers the cost of paying off the defunct Shoreham plant's debt.
With every achievement, Dr. Catacosinos won a bonus or a pay increase from a grateful board of directors. The ever-increasing size of his paycheck became a controversy that dogged him throughout his years as Lilco chairman and beyond.
"He's certainly been one of the most hated executives in the utility industry," said Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, a watchdog group that was appointed by a Federal court as part of a lawsuit against the utility in the 1980's. "He always seemed to have a knack for ignoring public opinion and public perception."
One year Dr. Catacosinos briefly won praise by refusing a pay increase of $50,000 after consumer groups complained. But Lilco executives apparently recognized that, post-Gloria and post-Shoreham, their chairman was doomed to draw public hostility like a lightning rod.
"He was never the warm and fuzzy guy that Lilco would put out front," Mr. Raacke said.
Dr. Catacosinos often said that he had three constituencies -- Lilco investors, employees and customers. But he didn't always disguise his impatience with that third group.
When a controversy broke out in 1993 over disclosures that Lilco had hired one of his nephews, a former business partner and one of his sons, William, in high-paying company jobs, the beleaguered chairman complained that nobody would get upset about such things at any other company in any other community.
"It's unrelenting," he told Newsday. "It never stops."

HEADLINE: Senate Fails Again to Curb Lawsuit Fees

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
For the second time in a month, the Senate rejected today a Republican proposal to limit the fees that lawyers could collect from successful lawsuits against tobacco companies.
The issue was one of the few critical ones remaining before the Senate in the comprehensive tobacco legislation, probably the biggest and most contentious bill before Congress this year. The Senate is not likely to consider legal fees again in connection with this bill, which has been in the Senate for debate since the middle of May. Indications were that a final vote could come next week. 
 Complaining that some trial lawyers stand to make tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars from tobacco lawsuits, Republicans failed on May 18 to impose a $250-an-hour limit on legal fees. Today, they raised the limit to $1,000 an hour and still lost, on a vote of 50 to 45.
The chief sponsor of the amendment, Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, said lawyers should be ashamed for seeking such large fees.
"The Federal Government," he said, "cannot put its stamp on legislation that diverts billions of dollars from taxpayers to pay trial lawyers' grossly excessive fees."
Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said he was flabbergasted that anyone could object to such a high ceiling on legal payments. "A thousand dollars an hour," he said. "There are a lot of people in my state who don't make that much in a month."
But Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, countered that the trial lawyers were heroes, not villains, having taken enormous risks in challenging the cigarette makers, and should not have their compensation limited. The lawyers brought suits "when we were asleep at the switch," Mr. Hollings said, making a sweeping gesture at the Senate chamber, "not doing anything about children smoking."
A former trial lawyer, Mr. Hollings expressed contempt for "the corporate billable hour fellow sitting on his duff and charging for it."
The bill still provides for an arbitration panel to decide proper fees in successful suits against cigarette companies.
The Senate also voted today for a Democratic amendment that would set aside some of the money raised from the higher prices on cigarettes to give grants to the states for child-care programs.
After disposing of the issue of lawyers' fees, the Senate turned to a less contested amendment that would restrict the tax deductions cigarette makers could take for their advertising expenses. A vote is not expected on that until Monday.
The most difficult remaining issue involves whether the Government's price-support program for tobacco farmers should be abolished and how farmers and communities that are economically dependent on tobacco should be compensated.
The basic bill would raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack over five years, give the Food and Drug Administration new authority to regulate tobacco, create smoking-cessation and research programs and impose stiff penalties on cigarette makers if the number of teen-agers who smoke does not fall to specified levels.
The chief sponsor of the legislation, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, suggested today that the time was near when the Senate should end the debate and vote on the bill. Negotiations seemed to be under way to work out an end game.
For the third straight day, the Senate, voting along party lines, rejected a cloture move by the Democrats to stop the debate. As long as Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, opposes cloture, Republicans will back him, and the move will fail. But it seemed only a matter of time before Mr. Lott offered a cloture motion himself. If that happens, the bill will probably be passed.
Mr. Lott said this afternoon that he had not decided what course to take.
The situation is more problematic in the House, where Republican leaders are opposed to higher taxes on cigarettes and want much less ambitious legislation.
The question of lawyers' fees is highly partisan and goes well beyond the tobacco issue. No one could say whether today's vote would affect the eventual outcome of the bill. Trial lawyers are among the Democrats' most generous donors and loyal supporters. For years, President Clinton and Democrats in Congress have fought Republican efforts to make it more difficult for consumers to collect money from damage suits over faulty products.
Republicans, on the other hand, depend on business interests for political support. Many businesses are generally afraid of damage suits and especially fearful that lawyers will use a windfall from tobacco cases to bankroll lawsuits against companies in other fields.
In today's vote, 12 Republicans, including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, broke ranks and voted to reject the limit on lawyers' fees. Only four Democrats, including Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, voted to impose the limit.
Many states have signed contracts with private lawyers, promising to pay a percentage of the damages if they won. But when these contracts were signed, no one had any idea how large the awards might be.
Mr. Faircloth calculated that if the lawyers received 15 percent of the total the Government would collect in the settlement of lawsuits under the tobacco legislation now under consideration, the total would come to $4 billion a year.
In Texas, for example, an expert hired by the state has determined that a group of lawyers would receive $92,000 an hour, if their claim is upheld for 15 percent of the state's $15.3 billion settlement with tobacco companies.
One thousand dollars an hour is much more than even the most elite lawyers charge. But those who sue the tobacco companies spend large amounts of time and their own money, and they make nothing if the suits are unsuccessful.
The archetype of the lawyer who took that kind of risk is Richard Scruggs, who put up $5 million of his own money to bring Mississippi's trailblazing suit against the tobacco industry. The industry settled with the state last year for $3.3 billion.
Mr. Scruggs has said that his fee will be determined by arbitrators. But even if he receives 1 percent, a very low contingency fee, that would be $33 million.
Mr. Scruggs, who is Senator Lott's brother-in-law (their wives are sisters), was in the V.I.P. gallery today watching the debate. "I didn't know whether to stand up and take a bow or put a bag over my head," he said afterward.
Because of his family connection, Senator Lott voted "present" on the amendment today.

Gloom Over Asia Economies Spreads as Yen Drops Again

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 11

 BODY:
It has been close to a year since Thailand devalued its currency, igniting a financial firestorm that hopscotched across Asia. Now, far from recovering, Asia's economies may be heading into a worsening decline.
In dismal succession over the last two weeks, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia confirmed that their economies shrank in the first quarter of 1998, and were likely to keep contracting the rest of the year. Japan, South Korea and Thailand are also in retreat, and even those that have managed to keep growing -- Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore and China -- are slowing dramatically. 
 The Asian financial crisis appears to be mutating into the most serious region-wide recession since World War II. By itself, a recession would not be surprising. Last year's crashing currencies and stock markets were bound to drag down fundamental economic performance. A recession, which would be declared officially after two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, is almost certainly under way. But its depth, the difficulty of a recovery and the gloom that suffuses the region have surprised even the pessimists.
"We're in for a really hard time," said Richard Margolis, a regional economist at Merrill Lynch & Company in Hong Kong. "Wherever you look around the region, you don't find a lot to be cheerful about. There is a general pall hanging over Asia."
The culprit in this latest bout of Asian contraction and gloom is the Japanese yen, which has plummeted against the American dollar and put enormous pressure on other Asian currencies. Today, the yen fell briefly to a nearly eight-year low against the dollar, settling in New York at 143.79 to the dollar after reaching an intraday trough of 144.21. Stock markets throughout Asia have plunged along with the yen. In Bangkok, where the crisis began, the stock market closed today at its lowest level in 10 years.
 In Tokyo early Friday, the yen weakened to 144.54 to the dollar, and stocks fell further in Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines. Shares stabilized in Hong Kong and rose in Indonesia.
The fear among investors is that a chronically ill Asia will infect the robust American and European economies. So far the negative effects have been negligible; if anything the economic plunge across the Pacific has been mildly positive for the United States because it has contributed to keeping prices of imported goods down and interest rates low, fueling spending by flush American consumers.
Now, though, there are more troubling symptoms: Companies in the United States that depend on sales to Asia are reporting anemic earnings, and over all, exports from the United States declined at a $9 billion annual pace in the first quarter of 1998.
Markets around the world have been on edge about the prospects for companies that do business in the region and stocks fell today not only in Asia, but in most of Europe and the United States as well. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 159.93 points.
Here in Asia, no relief seems in sight. After some predictions that major economies would bounce back quickly, perhaps in six months, most economists and analysts now agree that the region will be flat on its back for at least another year. A full recovery could take as long as five years.
Gary L. Greenberg, managing director of Van Eck Global Asset Management, said he had given up predicting a turnaround because it hinged on too many variables. "It's going to take longer than we thought," he said, ticking off a laundry list of problems ranging from insolvent banks and depressed real estate markets to the falling Japanese yen and the slowing growth in China.
Foreign sentiment toward Asia has turned bleaker in the last two weeks, with the slide in the yen's value. Japan's economic ills have dire implications because many analysts regard it as the locomotive that could propel Asia's recovery.
"Right now, the locomotive is in the rail yard," Mr. Margolis said.
Hard times have also aggravated political tensions, fracturing a public consensus that favored aggressive, growth-oriented policies -- even if that meant sacrificing political liberties. In South Korea, tens of thousands of workers walked off their jobs late last month to protest impending layoffs. In Hong Kong, a noisy crowd of 200 apartment owners marched to complain about the plunging value of real estate. In the most spectacular example, those tensions contributed in Indonesia to the ouster last month of President Suharto, who had ruled with an iron grip for more than three decades.
While Malaysia's political situation appears more stable, some analysts said it could be the next flash point, as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad tries to salvage an ambitious development program in a collapsing economy. Malaysia shares Indonesia's problem of latent tension between a native majority and ethnic Chinese, a minority of the population who control a large portion of the economy.
Even in South Korea and Thailand, where leaders identified with discredited practices were swept out in favor of reform-minded politicians, tensions remain. Political leaders face a backlash from a public desperate for relief from economic pain. Given younger Asians' limited experience with bad times, it is perhaps no surprise that the leaders have few remedies.
"They've never had to face this kind of thing before in Asia," said David K. P. Li, the chairman of the Bank of East Asia here.
Sometimes it seems that the politicians cannot do anything right. In Hong Kong, the administration announced a seven-point stimulus package that aims to bolster tourism and soothe the property market. Critics, including Mr. Li, derided the measures as "too little, too late." In Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir criticized the nation's central bank for setting interest rates too high, which he said strangled the economy. But he was contradicted by his own Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
Much of the tension can be traced to the role played by the International Monetary Fund, which has put together more than $100 million in rescue packages for Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. Far from being viewed as a neutral disburser of funds, the I.M.F. is often seen as a sort of fifth column -- blamed for everything from high interest rates to the mayhem in Jakarta.
The fund's defenders say it has succeeded in forcing nations like South Korea and Thailand to purge excesses like unregulated banks and "crony capitalism," in which the well connected receive sweetheart deals. Under pressure from the I.M.F., even Indonesia's new President, B. J. Habibie, is going after the excesses of his predecessor, Mr. Suharto.
"Koreans who know better know that without the I.M.F., the Government would have had to declare a moratorium," said Richard Samuelson, executive director of SBC Warburg Dillon Read in Seoul.
But critics said the fund's fiscal and monetary prescriptions -- which favor high interest rates and stable exchange rates, even at the cost of recession -- are strangling some Asian economies by choking off credit.
"A lot of people are questioning whether the I.M.F.'s policy is squeezing the economy dry," said an executive at a major Thai bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You're no longer just squeezing the cronies," he said. "You're making it impossible for normal businessmen to do business."
In South Korea, the I.M.F. has been unable to stanch the flow of loans from banks to the country's troubled conglomerates. Analysts warn that these infusions could land Korea in a domestic version of the foreign debt crisis that precipitated its near-collapse last year. They said the bad loans held by Korean banks could reach $90 billion by the end of the year, up from $50 billion at the end of 1997.
Few people disagree about the need for drastic reform in Indonesia. Since Mr. Suharto's ouster, the country's shattered economy has barely resumed functioning. Before Indonesia can even address its structural problems, economists said it must insure that basic commodities like rice, fuel, cooking oil and sugar are being delivered to stores.
"This is not just an economic but a political issue," said Mari Pangetsu, executive director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research center in Jakarta. Ms. Pangetsu warned that without basic commodities, Indonesia was ripe for another eruption of mob violence.
The I.M.F. recently announced that it would resume payments to Indonesia under a rescue program worth more than $40 billion. And last week, officials in Jakarta said they had reached an agreement with a consortium of foreign banks to stretch out the repayment of about $80 billion in foreign-currency loans owned by private companies.
Still, the country's ability to complete the structural reforms it has promised to the I.M.F. remains in question, given Mr. Habibie's struggle to consolidate power in the face of opposition from students and a restive military.
Even if the Government is able to pursue its economic program without further disruption, the economy could contract as much as 25 percent this year, according to some forecasts. Certain industries -- the fledgling auto business is a prime example -- have stopped producing altogether.
If Indonesia represents one pole of the Asian crisis, its next-door neighbor, Singapore, would seem to represent the other. With political calm and a stable currency, the prosperous city-state has few of Indonesia's weaknesses. Yet Singapore's growth has slowed sharply, and some analysts predict that even there, the economy will move into reverse by the end of the year.
Taiwan and the Philippines have also been bright spots in the Asian gloom. But they may not be able to continue defying the odds. The Taiwan stock market tumbled last week amid fears of a slump in the global semiconductor business, one of the island's biggest industries. And analysts are scrutinizing the newly elected President of the Philippines, Joseph P. Estrada, a former movie actor, to see whether his reputation as a man of the people will extend to a free-spending economic policy.
Asian political leaders have been frustrated by their inability to stem the tide of events. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Hong Kong, the former British colony, now under Chinese control, that is at the crossroads of Asian trade.
Hong Kong has huge foreign-exchange reserves, solid banks and the most stable currency in the region. Yet it is now suffering many of the ills that afflict less healthy Asian economies -- chief among them slumping trade. With anemic demand for its products and a weakening yen that undercuts its competitiveness, Hong Kong can do little to revive exports, which are the engine of its economy.
"Every Mercedes-Benz that we buy must be financed through export earnings," said Jan Lee, chief economist here of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
Worse, Hong Kong's long-term growth is tied inextricably to growth in China. While the mainland grew at an average annual rate of 11.4 percent between 1992 and 1996, the economy is tailing off there, too. Few economists expect China to achieve its 8 percent growth target for 1998, and there is concern that, despite repeated promises to the contrary, Chinese officials might feel forced to devalue the currency, the renminbi, sending others plunging.
For the immediate future, though, Japan may be the single biggest determinant of how long Asia's torment will last. Without a revival of consumer spending in Japan, analysts say, exports in the rest of Asia will continue to sag. And the weaker yen will continue to hobble other currencies.
"If Japan doesn't solve its problems, the region is in big trouble," said Rajiv Malik, a regional economist at Jardine Fleming International Securities in Singapore. "America thought Korea was a problem, but Japan is like a bomb a hundred times more powerful than Korea."

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
'Good and Evil,' but Always Charming

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga.

 BODY:
The genius of Savannah lies in its contradictions.
Here is a little city that is positively Cartesian in the logic of its layout. A grid of broad streets covers two square miles, punctuated by 21 squares, each with a statue, fountain or gazebo. Yet the rectilinear regularity never palls, because the streets and parks are shaded by magnificent live oaks, hung with garlands of Spanish moss. Could anything be less Cartesian than Spanish moss, with its inescapable sultry whiff of decadence? 
 Here is a city whose people, rich and poor, are so steeped in good manners -- in the smile, the soft word, the good humor of the Old South -- that drivers of garbage trucks wave at pedestrians as they pass. Yet there is nothing low-key or mannerly about Savannah's horticultural trademark, the azalea, whose Technicolor floral eruptions each spring couldn't be brasher.
How lucky Savannah is! Lucky in its founder, Gen. James Oglethorpe, a kind of contradiction himself as a practical idealist. Lucky in its escape from pillage during the Civil War, when Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who had sown such havoc on his march to the sea, rode unopposed into town and wired Abraham Lincoln on Dec. 22, 1864, "I beg to present to you as a Christmas gift the City of Savannah, with 150 heavy guns and plenty of ammunition."
And lucky in its bad luck, too; a century of postwar poverty -- not really poverty, I guess, more a lack of prosperity -- made it hard for the greedy to redevelop the charm out of the city in the fearsome name of progress.
Now the question is whether Savannah can survive its latest stroke of good fortune: John Berendt's vivid portrait of the city, its glories and its eccentricities, in "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," published in 1994, which has spent longer on the best-seller lists than any other nonfiction book.
The visitors who have flocked to Savannah to compare their impressions with Mr. Berendt's have changed the place, of course. It is still "off the beaten track, en route to nowhere but itself," to use his phrases, but the sound of the streets is no longer "an overarching hush." Tourism increased by 9 percent last year and appears headed for a similar increase this year.
Savannah is the fastest-growing port on the South Atlantic coast. A new convention center is scheduled to open late next year; the long-vacant storefronts along Broughton Street have begun to fill up, and The Savannah Morning News has added a regional business section to the Sunday paper. The spanking-new airport may be the best of its (modest) size in the nation.
But when my wife, Betsey, and I recently returned to Savannah for our first post-Berendt visit, the city seemed as sweetly seductive as ever, its beauty untarnished by newfound fame and fortune. It is still a bit provincial, self-absorbed but not self-satisfied. There is something reasurringly relaxed about a place that calls its minor-league baseball team the Sand Gnats.
Like Charleston and New Orleans, Savannah still dances to languid rhythms. In the humidity of high summer, the mood is even drowsier, as residents retreat to their shady, jasmine-scented gardens. If you want hustle and bustle, flash and dash, if you're searching for the New South, try Atlanta.
 
Buildings Bear Witness
For most of its history, Savannah has been a cosmopolitan place, as befits a seaport. Imports flow through the city and up the Savannah River to the cities and towns of the interior, and exports follow the same channel of commerce in the opposite direction. In addition to its original English settlers, it attracted, early on, Germans, Irish Catholics, Huguenots and Sephardic Jews. And it came to have a large black population as the influence of Oglethorpe's antislavery views waned.
The Sea Islands off the Georgia coast preserve a semi-indigenous black culture, where many speak Gullah, a patois that lies somewhere between English and certain West African tongues. Place and family names are often African. A slave rebellion took place in 1803 at a place called Ebo Landing, named for the Ibo people of Nigeria.
Savannah itself is exceptionally rich in African-American history.
Two buildings bear witness to a struggle for dignity that has been waged for two centuries. The First African Baptist Church (1788), which claims to be the oldest continuously active black church in North America, has loose floorboards beneath which runaway slaves once hid. Across town stands the unadorned little Second African Baptist Church (1802), where Sherman read the Emancipation Proclamation and promised newly freed slaves "40 acres and a mule." Almost a century later, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached there an "I Have a Dream" sermon that prefigured his historic speech in Washington.
John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, also preached in Savannah, but his message was apparently too dour for the colonials, and he returned to England.
Only five years after General Oglethorpe's arrival in 1733 to found the last of the original 13 colonies, a group of Jews landed here, and descendants of some of them, including Sheftalls and Minises, remain prominent in Savannah's economic and cultural life. Temple Mickve Israel, built in 1876, is the only Gothic Revival synagogue in the United States; its interior has cast-iron cluster pillars, a fine Spanish chandelier and good stained glass.
The temple owns the oldest Torah in America and a valuable collection of books and documents, including letters from Washington, Jefferson and Madison.
Some of Savannah's prettiest squares and best antiques dealers are clustered in the same neighborhood as the temple. Prices are high, but so is quality, at places like Alex Raskin, James Morton and De Loach. You sense something of the city's genteel traditions in these shops, as you do at the excellent E. Shaver, a 12-room trove of books and maps.
Savannah supports an ambitious symphony orchestra, conducted by Philip Greenberg; a spring Shakespeare festival in Forsyth Park and a College of Art and Design, plus a raft of painters, potters and other crafts people who came here to study and stayed. It is also home to the Telfair Museum of Art, the oldest art museum in the South, with heroic statues of five artistic eminences -- Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Phidias, Raphael and Rubens -- standing guard over its Corinthian entrance porch.
The museum's collection is a mixed bag: a lot of gloomy 19th-century Germanic kitsch, redeemed by first-rate American Impressionists (Childe Hassam in particular) and Realists (George Bellows, George Luks and Robert Henri, the latter represented by a smashing, Velasquez-like portrait, "La Madrilena," depicting a young woman in a scarlet gown). Also worth seeing is the elegant dining room with a Duncan Phyfe secretary and a pair of sinuous couches in cane and mahogany; a reproduction of a handsome block-printed 1819 paper, "Monuments of Paris," covers its walls.
At the moment, the museum is awaiting proposals for a new building from 14 prominent architectural firms, including Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, James Stewart Polshek, Moshe Safdie, I. M. Pei and Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates.
Whoever is ultimately chosen will have to excel to match its present palazzolike building, which is one of the legacies of William Jay, a young Englishman (1792-1837) who came to Savannah and in a span of only three or four years gave the city the best collection of Regency buildings in the United States.
Jay's greatest building, many critics argue, is the Owens-Thomas House, which is owned by the Telfair. Suggestive of the Regency villas of his native Bath, with a warm stucco exterior and walled parterre garden, and of Sir John Soane's London town house, it has a cast-iron veranda on the south side, the first use of that material for architectural purposes in the United States.
Inside, a dramatic, intricate staircase rises from the ground floor to a landing, then splits and doubles back to the second floor. The dining-room details are immaculate: a pair of beautifully curved doors, a plaster cornice of anthemia and a Greek-key cutout, high on one wall, filled with amber glass that allows sunlight to penetrate into the room. There are no proper windows in the north wall; my wife's cousin, Ashby Angell, told us that in the early 19th century, local people thought malaria was caused by a miasma from the river to the north.
My favorite Jay building is the William Scarborough House, built for one of the owners of the Savannah, the first steamship to cross the Atlantic. Though altered over the years, it retains its muscularly Classical facade, and the two-story faux-marbre entrance hall, supported by four stout Doric columns and topped by a sky-blue barrel vault, creates a powerful impression.
The house now houses the Ships of the Sea Maritime Museum, which displays ship models (including a superb one of the Titanic), scrimshaw, figureheads, navigational equipment and other things nautical and nice.
I learned an etymological lesson. One of the displays is a 19th-century ceramic cat, of a type placed in the windows of brothels in European port cities. If the cat's eyes were green, that meant come in; if they were red, that meant the house was full or the police nearby, and if the cat's back was turned, the house was closed. Hence, it was suggested, the term "cat house."
The museum is a reminder of the enormous role the sea has played in Savannah's history, and there will be another starting on July 2, when a dozen or so tall ships assemble in Savannah harbor. They will take part in a weekend festival here before racing north to Long Island and on to New London, Conn.
 
Exuberant Ornament
You can drench yourself in good architecture here. Close to the river, near where Oglethorpe lived, is the Customs House, whose columns are capped with tobacco leaves instead of the more traditional acanthus.
Down the river toward the sea stands the rugged, moated Fort Pulaski, which took 18 years and 25 million bricks to build but fell in 1862 after only 30 hours of bombardment. The presumed invulnerability of its heavy masonry was utterly demolished by 10 new guns that fired rifled projectiles instead of standard cannonballs. They changed the course of warfare forever.
In addition to Jay's houses, two others should not be missed: the Davenport House Museum, a Federal gem with a lemon-yellow entrance hall punctuated by a pair of slim Ionic pillars supporting a graceful arch, and the Gothic Revival Green-Meldrim House, where Sherman stayed, which is notable for iron verandas and, inside, exuberant plaster ornamentation in a not-quite-Gothic style.
But it is the ensemble that counts. There are now more than 1,000 restored houses, many with the side porches that low-country folk call "piazzas," some made of the distinctive "Savannah gray" brick, which is actually pinkish brown, some antebellum, some Victorian. Some were restored by the owners, others rescued from decades of decay by the pioneering efforts of the Historic Savannah Foundation, an organization of volunteers, mostly women. They started in 1955 at the Davenport House, which had become a seedy tenement.
The restored neighborhoods are alive with the sights and sounds of modern life -- a woman of classical profile pruning her oleanders, a baby crying, a cook frying chicken at a window -- and that lends them genuineness.
A lyrical place, Savannah produced some lyrical sons and daughters. You can see the graves of two of them at Bonaventure Cemetery, not far from downtown but otherworldly all the same. The songwriter Johnny Mercer ("Nov. 18, 1909-June 25, 1976 . . . And the Angels Sing") and the poet Conrad Aiken ("Aug. 5, 1889-Aug. 17, 1973 . . . Cosmos Mariner Destination Unknown").
 
All the Comforts of Savannah
 
Here is information about visiting Savannah, Ga.
 
Where to Stay
 
HYATT REGENCY, 2 West Bay Street, (912) 238-1234, is the best hotel in town. Its location is ideal: on the riverfront, within walking distance of the historic district. From many of the crisp, modern rooms you can watch big ships from Oslo and other distant ports creep upstream to dock. The staff is fabulously friendly, with the speediest valet-parking crew I've ever encountered. Rates: double-occupancy rooms range from $145 to $245 on weekdays and from $200 to $225 on weekends; suites range from $234 to $900 every day.
BALLASTONE, 14 East Oglethorpe Avenue, (912) 236-1484, was renovated last year but maintains its antebellum refinement. Built in 1838 and named for the stones carried in ships' holds for stability, the Ballastone blends the old (love seats and marble-topped tables) with the new (color televisions and VCR's in the 18 rooms). Books and films may be borrowed at the front desk. Rates: $155 to $255 on weekdays (Sundays through Wednesdays) and $255 to $375 on weekends; suites, $255 on weekdays and $375 on weekends.
KEHOE HOUSE, 123 Habersham Street, (912) 232-1020, is one of the better bed and breakfasts in a city full of good ones. A pretty house with superb Corinthian columns, built in 1892 for a rich ironmonger, it shares tranquil Columbia Square with Savannah's finest Federal building, Davenport House. Its 15 rooms are furnished with antiques and reproductions. No smoking. Rates: $195 to $250 for any day of the week.
MAGNOLIA PLACE, 503 Whitaker Street, (912) 236-7674, faces Forsyth Park, the leafy reserve at the heart of downtown Savannah. Many of the 13 rooms have fireplaces, and some have Jacuzzis. The decor is a bit too exuberant in places, but the welcome is warm, and the beds (some of them four-posters) comfortable. Despite the 12-foot-high windows, the place has a secluded atmosphere. Rates: $135 to $240 for any day of the week.
 
Where to Eat
 
ELIZABETH ON 37TH, 105 East 37th Street, (912) 236-5547, housed in an imposing Beaux-Arts mansion, is the creation of Elizabeth Terry, one of the best chefs in the South. Her credo is simple: "I do comfort food. One shouldn't be embarrassed about that." Winners include smoky shrimp with red-eye gravy, grouper with peanut sauce and cucumbers. Kind and knowledgeable service, wines carefully chosen by Michael Terry.
BISTRO SAVANNAH, 309 West Congress Street, (912) 233-6266, would be worth visiting just for the scored and grilled flounder, or the shrimp and tasso served over grits. The atmosphere is pleasant, too.
THE SAPPHIRE GRILL, 110 West Congress Street, (912) 443-9962. Chris Nason, who used to cook at Bistro Savannah, turns out delicious dishes here: meltingly tender buttermilk-marinated calamari with ginger and basil, better fried green tomatoes than I thought possible. But the night we were there, the din was awful and the lights so dim we couldn't read the menu.
LADY & SONS, 311 West Congress Street, (912) 233-2600, serves a lunch to make calorie-counters weep: huge tumblers of sugary, minty iced tea; rich, delectable cheese biscuits, offered by cheerful waiters again and again until you are about to burst; creamy crab soup laced, I think, with sherry-pepper sauce, and crisply breaded, sparklingly fresh fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce and great fries. Lively salads for people with more character than I.
MRS. WILKES'S DINING ROOM, 107 West Jones Street, (912) 232-5997, is a survivor from another age. Brimming bowls of food are delivered to common tables and left for emptying. Pork chops, a gazillion vegetables and banana pudding for lunch, maybe, authentically and deliciously prepared; but breakfast is best, with scrambled eggs, country ham, bacon, three kinds of sausage, grits and fine, flaky biscuits. Mrs. W. presides, ever the monosyllabic matriarch, in her plain little domain; she asks $5 for breakfast and $10 for lunch.
NITA'S PLACE, 140 Abercorn Street, (912) 238-8233, will give you a taste of Low Country soul food, served cafeteria style. Juanita Dixon cooks a few dishes every day from a repertory including fried chicken, pot roast, gumbo, macaroni and cheese, peach cobbler and wonderfully pungent turnip greens. One thing she makes every day: little cornbread pancakes called hoe cakes, a Savannah specialty. Postcards from friends around the world plaster the walls; Billie Holiday recordings set the mood, and everyone talks to everyone.

HEADLINE: Prosperous Times, Except for the Young

BYLINE: By William Finnegan; William Finnegan is the author, most recently, of "Cold New World: Growing Up in a Harder Country."

 BODY:
I once wrote an article about a young drug dealer in New Haven. Afterward, he and I kept in touch. In the mid-1990's, when a police crackdown temporarily suppressed the New Haven drug trade, he told me, "People are scared now, so they're just getting, like, jobs." His tone was pitying, appalled. Jobs were apparently only for the truly desperate.
This scandalous idea comes back to me whenever I hear that unemployment is low. It's the street version of what all economists know: that a huge number of jobs these days do not pay a living wage. John E. Schwarz, in a comprehensive calculation of opportunity versus need published last year, found there were 16 million more households in the United States than there were adequately paying jobs, a shortfall that has been growing since the 1970's and that, according to Mr. Schwarz, is unlikely to ease. 
 Young people -- not just those in the inner city, but all nonaffluent young people -- suffer the brunt of this shortfall. While the rest of us do a great deal of public worrying about the young -- about their sex lives, drug habits, crime rates, literacy and morality -- we seem strangely unconcerned about the fact that the economic prospects for most young people have been deteriorating for a generation.
Entry-level wages for male high school graduates, for instance, fell 28 percent from 1973 to 1997, in real dollars. (College graduates did less badly, but they also lost ground -- and it is crucial to remember that traditional four-year college graduates remain a distinct minority of workers.) These trends are long term and have not been reversed by the recent surge in wages.
Home ownership among younger families has also fallen sharply. In 1973, 43.6 percent of those ages 25 to 29 owned homes; by 1997, even after a slight four-year rise, only 35 percent did. Among 30-to-34-year-olds, the figure fell to 52.6 percent from 60.2 percent.
The great American middle class is, by any measure, shrinking, and more and more young people are being shunted into the ranks of the working poor. Demand may be high at the moment for software programmers and management consultants, but it is higher for janitors and cashiers. I think most kids sense that the class structure is turning harsher, without necessarily knowing the numbers. It is the context, certainly, within which they fashion the attitudes and personal lives that we probe and study with such concern.
But much of our fretting about the condition of America's children strikes me as guilt-propelled, even insincere, since their welfare is clearly not our highest priority. A recent United Nations survey of 152 countries found that the United States was one of only six with no national policy requiring paid maternity leave. The New York Times published a chart a few weeks ago showing the median hourly wage for various occupations. "Child care worker" got paid less than "animal caretaker" or "parking lot attendant."
Nationally, our child poverty rate rose by 26 percent from 1970 to 1996. It is today the highest in the industrialized world by a large margin. This mortifying prominence is not a matter of scarcity -- the United States is, after all, the wealthiest nation in history. It is, rather, a matter of priorities. In the same period, poverty among those 65 and older fell by more than 50 percent.
Disparities like these flow from political decisions. Our national devotion to the idea of unfettered markets may lead us to view economic forces as though they were forces of nature, irresistible as the ocean tides. But it is really governments that decide to deregulate, to tax one constituency and not another, to accommodate capital rather than labor and to direct social spending toward one group and away from another (less powerful) group, like poor children.
The Clinton Administration has made some recent efforts on behalf of the young and the working poor. It has pushed for increases in the minimum wage and for children's health insurance, and has introduced a modest package of grants and tax credits to expand child care for working families. But far more is needed.
We are not Western Europe, where fraying but still functional welfare states provide a safety net for society's more vulnerable members, and we are not Japan, where family breakup is almost unknown and very few children fall through the cracks. We are a country with a 50 percent divorce rate and sky-high rates of child neglect and juvenile crime, and our behavior toward our young people -- not our expressed concerns, but our behavior -- suggests that we are actually more interested in their shopping patterns (and, should they break the law, in locking them up) than in their well-being.
A New York Times/CBS News poll this spring discovered a reassuring "turn to the traditional" among American teen-agers. Big majorities of them said, in phone interviews, that they never drank alcohol, smoked cigarettes, took drugs or had sex. Although such polls are famously unreliable, this one's results were "a great relief," according to a Times editorial, and showed "that we have done more for them than we think."
I think we have done less. My generation -- we born-under-a-bright-star boomers -- reaped the benefits of a tremendous across-the-board investment after World War II in public works and social welfare, particularly in public education. Then, at some point in the 1970's or early 1980's, we seemed to collectively decide that paying taxes on our hard-earned incomes had become an undue burden.
The children of affluent families have not suffered from all the tax-cutting and privatization that followed. Most other children have. We would do far better to worry about what kind of country they will inherit -- whether more jobs can be made to pay a living wage, whether child poverty can be reduced -- than to fret about how many of them favor body piercing or how we might sell them more movie tickets.

Lurching Into Comedy With a Heart Attack

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
If you thought the Asian economy was bad, try assessing the state of film comedy on the basis of "Dirty Work." Phrases like terminally stupid and brain dead leap readily to mind.
About an hour into this leaden, taste-deprived attempted comedy about a couple of losers whose contribution to American capitalism is a revenge-for-hire business, a surprise arrives in the form of a funny joke about the circumstances surrounding a photograph in an old man's locket. The joke is crude, but almost everything is in this lifeless comedy. Still, it is a joke. 
 About the only thing roused by "Dirty Work," directed by Bob Saget, a host of "America's Funniest Home Videos," is the suspicion that sleeping pills have been administered to most of the cast, which includes Chevy Chase as a doctor in thrall to gamblers and Don Rickles as a nasty theater manager.
Others responsible for the low comic wattage of "Dirty Work" include Norm Macdonald, a "Saturday Night Live" alumnus who was a co-writer of the script and shares with Artie Lange the onerous burden of having to act in it.
Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Lange star as Mitch and Sam. Mitch is the good-looking one. Sam is the fat clown. Friends since childhood, they have reached their 30's without distinction. Mitch has lost 14 jobs in three months; Sam lives with his father, Pops (Jack Warden), a belligerent, impotent old man who spends most of his time shouting for whores.
After a tiresomely long buildup, the plot finally lurches into motion when Pops has a heart attack. Dr. Farthing (Mr. Chase) says that he needs a heart transplant but is too old to qualify as a priority case. But Dr. Farthing is a compulsive gambler whose creditors are in the process of breaking his arms and shooting off his toes.
So he suggests to Mitch and Sam that $50,000 might help matters, which prompts them to resurrect one of their childhood successes: creative revenge in the form of a business called Dirty Work, which consists of projects like removing the beard from an abusive bearded lady in a circus, planting dead fish in a lavish but loud home and loosing skunks into the audience at a performance of "Don Giovanni." For parched wanderers in the desert of comedy that is "Dirty Work," this scene makes memories of the Marx Brothers at work on "Il Trovatore" in "A Night at the Opera" seem like the happiest of hallucinations.
Far too often in "Dirty Work," the supposedly funny business happens offscreen, and the idea of putting popcorn in an automobile engine is considered so hilarious that it gets a reprise.
But Dirty Work brings about a romance for Mitch and a conflict with Travis Cole (Christopher McDonald), the community's devious and very wealthy real estate developer. So in the end, of course, all ends well.
P.S. Don't bother to hang around for the outtakes. They're not funny either.
"Dirty Work" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes crude language, beatings and simulation of sex between a skunk and a chihuahua.

HEADLINE: New Slant On the 60's: The Past Made New;
Experts Are Reassessing a Tumultuous Decade

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN 

 BODY:
Here's the wallet-size version of the sixties:
Before, there were the fifties, a placid decade of consensus, when Americans watched "Father Knows Best," pursued the same grassy suburban dreams and shared the same values. 
 Then there was a volcanic rupture, a cultural big bang that severed the era from the past. Student rebels, civil rights marchers and antiwar protesters challenged the authority of the family, the police, the military, the government and the university. The New Left eventually fell apart, but set the stage for a rights revolution that extended to women and homosexuals.
Neither liberals nor conservatives dispute the basic before-and-after storyline. Both concur it blasted away the existing order and led to undreamed-of personal license. What they can't agree on is whether this represented a fulfillment of American values or their betrayal, a disaster or a deliverance.
Now, however, historians are beginning to veer clear of the familiar good-sixties, bad-sixties debate as if it were a bumper-to-bumper feud over a single parking spot. Instead, they are challenging the traditional before-and-after narrative, arguing that the sixties do not represent as cataclysmic a break as portrayed or as exceptional a decade as the proliferation of college courses on the period would suggest.
Pivotal developments like the civil rights movement, urban decline and consumerism began years earlier, they say. Meanwhile, other crucial developments -- the religious revival, for instance, or the change in immigration patterns -- have unappreciated links to the sixties. Scholars are finally exploring just how much things changed and how much they stayed the same.
"Even though it's my livelihood, I make an argument against sixties exceptionalism," says Thomas J. Sugrue, who has taught a course on the sixties for seven years at the University of Pennsylvania. "It was a moment when many of the conflicts burst into the surface, but we misread other decades if we focus on the sixties as this moment of rupture or apocalypse."
Of course, much did change in the sixties : Hair was longer, sex was freer, protests were larger, soldiers were dying in Vietnam. Yet both left- and right-wing partisans have a motive to exaggerate the degree of radical change -- either to score ideological points or to justify or atone for their pasts. Bickering over the culture wars has in general helped drown out interpretations that emphasize links with the previous decades.
"Everybody has his or her own sixties, and it means a lot to them," says Allen J. Matusow, author of "The Unraveling of America: A History of Liberalism in the Sixties." "The reason the sixties still evoke such vehement reactions is because we're still fighting over what kind of a country and what kind of a culture we're going to have. But do people have a full understanding of what happened?"
Mr. Sugrue has probably gone the furthest in trying to replace the before-and-after narrative with the-same-only-more-so. "I believe that in my lifetime there will no longer be courses on the sixties," he said. "We'll teach the whole postwar period as a whole."
As an example, he points to the series of race riots that convulsed cities across America in the sixties, arguing that the ruinous decline of booming industrial cities was the product not of sixties racial violence, white flight and backlash, as some have argued, but rather of housing patterns, job discrimination and the deindustrialization that occurred in the forties and fifties.
The New Deal created a "newfound sense of entitlement" for all Americans, while wartime military service lodged the expectation of equal treatment in the minds of African-Americans, he writes in "The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit," (Princeton, 1998). Yet during the late forties and fifties, discrimination kept blacks in the lowest paying jobs and the worst neighborhoods. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of entry-level manufacturing jobs disappeared in the Midwest and Northeast. (In 1957, one in five black Americans was unemployed.) Detroit may not have burned until 1967, but Mr. Sugrue points out that a decade earlier, unemployed blacks warned of "widespread riots" if confronted with another depression.
Barbara L. Tischler, who edited the series "Perspectives on the Sixties," wouldn't go quite as far as Mr. Sugrue. Still, she notes, "I try not to say that the sixties are so different from any other time. There are many periods of dramatic political and social change. Is it more important than the period 1935 to 1945? I'm not sure I can make that case."
Ms. Tischler, who has taught courses on the sixties at both Barnard College and Columbia University, starts her students off with the notion that President John F. Kennedy continued the cold war policies of the Eisenhower Adminstration. If the United States was going to strut the superiority of capitalist democracies over Communist regimes around the world, then it was going to have to prove it at home. "That's why civil rights could become an important issue in terms of the cold war," she said: it was used as part of "the arsenal" against Communism, as was the war on poverty.
"I would really focus on continuity, particularly in the period up to about 1968," she says. "There was tremendous faith in the ability of people to change their own system." Peaceful protesters were drawing on traditions of American thought as old as the Revolution. They "took Locke and Jefferson very seriously," she said.
 
An Earlier Time Of Upheaval
Leslie Fishbein, who teaches a course on the sixties at Rutgers University, points out that other decades wrestled with similar countercultural bursts. The period between 1913 and 1919 witnessed a struggle for birth control; a sexual revolution that prompted marriage manuals to include discussions of the female orgasm; a backlash against Freud; experiments in diet and fashion (bohemians favored tunics and sandals); a cult of youth led by Randolph Bourne, and experiments with drugs that resulted in peyote parties on Fifth Avenue. "Sixties radicals tended to think of themselves as new Adams," says Ms. Fishbein, "and had little sense of how much of their concerns and experiments echoed those of their predecessors."
David Farber, who teaches a course on the sixties at the University of New Mexico, believes the rights revolution that began in the sixties did represent a "profound eruption" but agrees that the cultural changes associated with the decade had been brewing for a long time. The counterculture's hedonist impulses had their roots in consumer capitalism, says Mr. Farber, who wrote "The Age of Great Dreams: America in the 1960's" (Hill & Wang, 1994). The ethic of the marketplace has always been to encourage consumers to choose among products that made them feel good; from there it was just a short step to choosing among life styles that made them feel good, whether that meant using drugs or freer sex. Some advertisers even made the connection explicit: A 1969 print ad for Love cosmetics, for instance, reads: "Love today is different than it's ever been. It's freer, more natural, more honest -- more out in the open." Yet the eventual results of such freedom in the marketplace -- like sexually explicit song lyrics, books and movies -- has left people uneasy. Thus, Mr. Farber believes that the sixties have become "a kind of scapegoat for that unleashed cornucopia."
One area that seemed to change little but actually changed a lot was immigration. Reform of the immigration laws did reflect an extension of a civil rights movement that demanded equal treatment regardless of color. Yet by ending the 40-year-old quota system based on national origins, the Immigration Act of 1965 drastically shifted immigration from northern and western Europe to Asia and Latin America, altering the face of America far beyond anyone's expectations. Todd Gitlin, author of "The Twilight of Common Dreams: Why America Is Wracked by Culture Wars" (Owlet, 1996) says that although he paid "zero attention to it at the time," the law was "one of the the most consequential reforms of the Great Society."
In a freshman seminar on the sixties last fall at New York University, Mr. Gitlin asked his students to use their own family experience to examine the decade. A quarter of the class were either immigrants or the children of immigrants who probably would not have been here without the '65 law.
Religious life then has also been misunderstood. With theologians proclaiming the "death of God" and people turning to meditation and crystals, the decade is typically thought of as not particularly religious. Yet Michael Kazin and Maurice Isserman, who are writing a textbook on the sixties, note that "evangelical churches were growing like crazy." (Many of the new members ultimately joined the foundling conservative movement.) Nearly all the major denominations grew until 1965; by the end of the decade, theologically liberal denominations had begun losing members but conservative ones rapidly grew. The quest for spiritual authenticity that led exhausted leftists to New Age beliefs also led many people to evangelicalism. "They were looking around for a religious home and wanted something that was much more attuned to their personal needs than their social obligations," Mr. Kazin says.
Although Mr. Kazin and Mr. Isserman say religion went through a profound transformation, they also point out that such revolutions in religious life are cyclical in American history, and compare the sixties with the Great Awakening beginning in the 1730's and the early 1800's. "Like many Americans before," they write, people in the sixties "made sense of rapid social and moral change in religious terms." Commenting on the rise of evangelism, which Billy Graham actually began reviving in 1949 with his large, racially integrated crusades, they note that "Protestanism in the U.S. has always been a deeply personal faith."
 
Neither Right Nor Left
Unlike the youthful radicals of the sixties, today's students, at least the ones eagerly signing up for sixties courses, do not seem particularly animated by politics of the left or the right. They like both Mark Rudd, the one-time fugitive Weatherman, and Ronald Reagan, says Mr. Isserman, who teaches a course on the sixties at Hamilton College.
But like students in the sixties or the thirties, they are inspired by idealism. Ms. Fishbein says: "They have an enormous need to believe. It doesn't matter in what." Mr. Isserman observes that they are attracted to "the notion of making history" at a time when students don't feel they have much ability to influence events. "They are remaking the history of the sixties," he says, "to fit their own concerns and outlook."
Some things, it seems, never change.

Trash The I.M.F.!

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Recently several prominent former officials and economists have called for abolishing the International Monetary Fund. Congress is also holding back its next deposit to the fund, $18 billion, because a Republican Congressman, Chris Smith, won't allow the U.S. contribution to be made unless the Clinton Administration drops support for any worldwide family-planning program that includes abortions. Since all these smart people seem to think the world doesn't need the I.M.F., I say junk the place. Here's what the world would look like a year later.
WASHINGTON, June 13, 1999-- On the first anniversary of the closing of the I.M.F., the Russian ruble hit a new low today of 50,000 to the dollar. Russia's President, the former army general Aleksandr Lebed, who ousted Boris Yeltsin in a coup after the Russian economy collapsed six months ago, announced a new export program for getting Russia's economy back on its feet. 
 "From today forward," said President Lebed, "any Russian company capable of exporting any device, technology, weapons system or natural resource -- including highly enriched uranium -- is encouraged to do so to anyone who can pay hard currency. The U.S. Congress says it will sanction us for selling nuclear technology to Iran or India. Hah! What more can they do? Since they closed the I.M.F., 35 percent of Russia is unemployed. The Russian army has not been paid in six months. How's that for a moral hazard!"
Meanwhile, the former U.S. allies Korea and Thailand, with their economies in a tailspin from the lack of I.M.F. support, decided to go to the only other potential lender of last resort -- the U.S. Congress. Korea's President, Kim Dae Jung, told Congress: "We have been loyal U.S. allies for 40 years. I am the first liberal democrat elected President of Korea. All my years as a political exile, America was my model. You're not going to abandon me now? With 30,000 U.S. troops in my country and North Korea up there with a bomb in the basement?"
The Koreans have enlisted two former U.S. Treasury Secretaries, George Shultz and William Simon, along with the former Citibank chief Walter Wriston, to lobby Congress for an emergency $10 billion aid package for Seoul. Unlike I.M.F. bailouts -- where the burden is shared by many countries -- this Korean bailout will have to be a direct loan from the U.S. to Korea, with America bearing all the risks and costs alone.
That loan was jeopardized yesterday, though, when the U.S. Embassy in Seoul was ransacked, along with the Coke and Pepsi bottling plants, by an angry Korean mob. The mob was outraged by the conditions that the U.S. Congress wanted to impose on Korea in exchange for U.S. help: an end to all birth control in Korea and the right for any U.S. company to buy 100 percent of any Korean company.
"Too bad we don't have the I.M.F. around to impose these conditions, so everyone could blame it instead of us," mused House Speaker Newt Gingrich, in a rare moment of candor.
Elsewhere in Asia, human rights activists were appalled as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all declared martial law so their Governments could close down newspapers and stop rioting against businesses owned by ethnic Chinese, who tend to dominate Southeast Asia's economies. China warned that if the anti-Chinese rioting was not halted, China's navy would "not stand idle."
Meanwhile, Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, denounced the I.M.F.'s closure as yet another conspiracy to weaken southeast Asia, mounted by "the global Merchants of Venice -- and you know who I mean."
America's trade deficit hit an all-time high of $400 billion, as cheap exports from all over Asia's battered economies flooded the U.S. The Dow fell again today, to 6,660, as the dollar hit 300 yen.
The latest New York Times/CBS Poll showed two nativist-protectionists, Patrick Buchanan and Ross Perot, running neck and neck in the year 2000 Presidential race, after Al Gore and George W. Bush both dropped out because of lack of support.
Finally, the U.S. called for an emergency meeting of the world's leading industrial nations to try to establish some sort of international monetary fund to deal with the crisis. America offered to hold the meeting in a quiet estate in New Hampshire called Bretton Woods, but the other world powers, showing contempt for weak U.S. leadership, insisted on Shanghai.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rose in May Because of Higher Drug Costs

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Prices paid to producers rose during May for the second consecutive month, but the increase reflected record growth in the cost of prescription drugs, and analysts continued to forecast a low inflation rate for the year.
"There's nothing much to complain about," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. "If you look behind, what you see is there isn't any upward pressure on prices." 
 The Labor Department said today that producer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in May, matching April's increase. Still, prices fell at an annual rate of 1.6 percent during the year's first five months. In addition, crude oil prices declined to a 10-year low this week, suggesting that producer prices are likely to remain subdued in the months ahead.
Prescription drug prices increased by a record 10.7 percent last month, almost entirely because of a 600 percent price increase for "minor tranquilizers," Labor Department analysts said.
The department declined to say which drug companies raised prices, although Mylan Laboratories Inc. of Pittsburgh confirmed that it recently raised prices on some of its generic tranquilizers. "We have no immediate plans to increase prices again on those same products," Roger Foster, Mylan vice president, said in an interview today.
The Producer Price Index's core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, also rose two-tenths of 1 percent in May, unchanged from April's increase. Without the increase in drug prices, producer prices over all would have been unchanged in May and the core rate would have fallen about one-tenth of 1 percent, a Labor Department spokesman said.
Another economic report issued today suggested economic growth might be slowing. The Commerce Department said business inventories of unsold goods rose two-tenths of 1 percent in April, below March's increase of six-tenths of 1 percent and the slowest gain in three months. Business sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in April, a sign that a slowdown in demand might have begun. It was the first decline since January.

HEADLINE: As G.M. Idles Plants, Talks Make Progress

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 12

 BODY:
Strikes at two General Motors parts factories forced the auto maker to close some of its most profitable assembly plants today, increasing the number of temporarily laid-off workers to 50,900. But tensions started to ease in the dispute as negotiators began making slow progress.
Talks had been paralyzed until late Thursday by the fury of union leaders over G.M.'s tactics before the strikes. The company removed parts-making equipment over Memorial Day weekend from one of the two factories where workers have since gone on strike. 
 But General Motors agreed on Thursday to return the equipment to the factory as soon as the strike was settled, union officials said on Thursday evening and the company confirmed today. The G.M. concession prompted leaders of the United Automobile Workers to stop treating the strike as a showdown over what they perceived as strike-breaking tactics and allowed serious discussions to begin on how many jobs would be preserved at the two factories in Flint, Mich., people involved in the talks said.
Talks recessed at the factories late this afternoon, but negotiators agreed to return on Saturday morning.
Still, even as the negotiations continued, G.M. was closing five more assembly plants, bringing the total to 13 of G.M.'s 29 North American assembly plants. The factories closed today included two in Fort Wayne, Ind., and Pontiac, Mich., that make full-size pickup trucks and another factory in Janesville, Wis., that produces full-size sport utility vehicles. Full-size light trucks account for a tiny share of G.M.'s worldwide sales but close to half of the company's profits, according to Wall Street analysts.
"With these factories going down, it starts to cost G.M. real money," said Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who predicted that the strike would be settled by Wednesday or Thursday.
The resolution of the equipment issue now makes the strike similar to eight others that G.M. has faced over the last three years. In most of these factory-level strikes, the union has tried to insist that G.M. replace every worker who retires. G.M. has tried to eliminate jobs gradually through attrition while installing more automated equipment or buying parts from outside companies.
In each strike, negotiators have ended up splitting the difference, with the U.A.W. slowing but not stopping G.M.'s push to cut costs and become more competitive by producing more cars and components with fewer workers. But in some cases, negotiators have taken a long time to split the difference. A 17-day strike in 1996 at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, forced G.M. to close briefly all but two of its North American assembly plants while temporarily laying off 178,000 workers.
G.M. has tried in each strike to allocate as many parts as possible to the production of the most profitable light trucks while shutting unprofitable car factories first and has done so again this week. During the 1996 strike, G.M. agreed to a compromise several days after it finally ran out of brakes and shut down its Janesville factory, then its sole source of full-size sport utility vehicles, which earn profits of $10,000 each. But G.M. has since converted a factory in Arlington Heights, Tex., to production of the same models, and that factory remained open this evening.
The current labor dispute is complicated because it involves two different strikes. The first strike, which began on June 5, shut down a factory that stamps sheets of steel into hoods, fenders and other parts for full-size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. The second strike, which began on Thursday evening, closed down G.M.'s main source of spark plugs and various dashboard instruments, like speedometers.
At the stamping factory, G.M. contends that some workers have been trying to collect a full day's pay for half a day of work, while the U.A.W. wants G.M. to promise that it will replace 200 workers as they retire. At the second factory, the U.A.W. is trying to slow a long decline in employment that has already reduced the factory's work force to about 5,800 from 13,000 a decade ago.
G.M. has been building assembly plants and parts factories overseas to reduce costs, even as it allows its American work force to shrink. But G.M.'s overall international strategy is not part of the talks at either factory, which involve specific provisions of factory-level labor contracts.
Workers at several other G.M. factories have asked the U.A.W.'s permission to strike but have not received it and are unlikely to do so soon. The U.A.W. has to pay $150 a week in strike benefits to workers who walk out. But workers temporarily laid off by G.M. are usually eligible for unemployment compensation from state governments -- which could later demand the money back from G.M. through higher unemployment insurance premiums.
G.M. tried with little success during the Dayton strike to block the unemployment benefits on the ground that the temporarily laid-off workers were members of the same union that was on strike. The auto maker has not decided whether to try to block benefits this time, said Gerald Holmes, a G.M. spokesman.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Rebuff for India, But Talks May Be Closer

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 12

 BODY:
An Indian proposal for talks with Pakistan later this month on ways of lessening tensions in the subcontinent was quickly rejected by Pakistan today, but the exchange appeared to have moved both Governments closer to direct negotiations over the crisis set off by the nuclear tests that both conducted last month.
While New Delhi and Islamabad were testing each other over possible talks, a new sense of urgency developed as a result of decisions made today in London at a meeting of foreign ministers of the United States and seven other industrialized nations. 
 The foreign ministers announced that they would act together to postpone loans for everything but "basic human needs" by major international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
"We agree to support postponement of consideration of other loans by the international financial institutions," the foreign ministers said in a statement. They did not say how long a postponement they had in mind, however. The length of any delay has been the subject of disagreement by the Europeans on one hand and the United States, Japan and Canada on the other. United States law sets no limits on postponement.
India and Pakistan had both hoped that the United States would be isolated in its bid to cut off loans to the two nations by the international institutions, a step President Clinton included in the package of sanctions he imposed on India after its first nuclear tests on May 11, and in the identical sanctions on Pakistan he announced after Islamabad's initial tests on May 28.
By itself, the United States has the power to delay, but not to halt, billions of dollars of loans that are crucial to development in both countries.
After today's decision in London, Indian and Pakistani experts noted that the eight countries represented at the meeting have more than 50 percent of the voting power at the I.M.F. and the World Bank, enough to block loans and inflict major damage on the economies of both countries. But there are few people in either country who believe that economic pressure, however severe, is likely to achieve the ultimate objective stated in London: forcing India and Pakistan to sign existing nuclear limitation treaties and to abandon plans to develop arsenals of nuclear missiles.
In the last two weeks, Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan have both said they favored negotiations on nuclear weapons and other issues. But when India made a formal proposal today that senior officials open a dialogue on June 22 in New Delhi, India's capital, Pakistan promptly rejected the proposal, calling it "the traditional gimmickry of Indian diplomacy." Instead, Pakistan suggested that the talks begin in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, on June 20.
The rejection reflected differences between the two Governments over the agenda for the negotiations, in particular over the procedures for discussing the highly charged issue of Kashmir. But Western diplomats and officials in both capitals said the significance of the day's exchanges lay less in that maneuvering than in the fact that both Governments had signaled that they wanted talks to begin soon.
"After all that's happened, you'd have to expect that they'd play cat-and-mouse," a Western envoy in New Delhi said. "But it's clear that both sides recognize the need to start talking about nuclear weapons, and to do it soon, for their own sake and to show the world they understand the seriousness of the issues involved."
A clearer indication of how far New Delhi and Islamabad are prepared to go in restraining a nuclear arms race is likely to emerge when they begin talks. Although today's efforts to schedule talks proved abortive, there were signs that Mr. Vajpayee and Mr. Sharif were already looking beyond talks at the level of foreign ministry officials to a possible summit meeting in early July, when government leaders of seven South Asian nations are to gather in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
Dates for the annual regional meeting have been up in the air since the nuclear tests, with doubts whether the Indian and Pakistani leaders would attend, and if they did, whether they would meet. But Western diplomats said they were told by the Indian Foreign Ministry today that the Colombo meeting was likely to take place between July 9 and 12, and that Mr. Vajpayee and Mr. Sharif were likely to meet then.
When the two nations do meet, their discussions on nuclear weapons are likely to focus on several proposals including a formal agreement not to conduct any further tests, a step both Governments have said they are ready to take; a nonaggression pact, a proposal put forward by Pakistan that India has said it will consider, and a commitment by both nations not to be the the first to use nuclear weapons. That idea is favored by India but not by Pakistan, which has said it regards a nuclear arsenal as a counterweight to India's large advantage in conventional forces.
But Pakistan has said it will not abandon plans to develop a nuclear arsenal, as demanded by the United States and the other nations that met today in London, unless India abandons its arsenal. And India has said the only circumstance under which it will forgo the development of nuclear arms is if the established nuclear powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- agree to eliminate their arsenals, something all five have rejected.

HEADLINE: Lauca Ene Journal;
A Bolivian Legislator Who Just Says 'Yes' to Coca

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LAUCA ENE, Bolivia

 BODY:
Like congressmen all over the world, Evo Morales hugs babies and makes fist-thumping speeches. But that's where the similarities end. For starters, this Congressman chews coca leaves in public.
In fact, as Congressman Morales returned to his district recently, he was not at all embarrassed to be photographed caressing the coca bushes that grow on his property. During his election campaign last year, he ran on the slogan "Vote for coca!" He won 70 percent of the vote in a field of 10, which is perhaps not particularly surprising since his district, the tropical region of Chapare, produces 85 percent of the refined cocaine produced in Bolivia every year. 
 At age 38, Congressman Morales is the spokesman for six of the seven coca grower unions in Bolivia, and he is the single most powerful politician standing in the way of efforts by the United Nations and the United States and Bolivian Governments to fight the Bolivian cocaine trade.
Since President Hugo Banzer Suarez announced in January his intention to eradicate the coca industry in Chapare by the year 2002, Congressman Morales has been leading road blockades and accusing the President and his family of being international traffickers themselves -- charges that he has failed to substantiate but that have won him screaming newspaper headlines and considerable national television exposure.
"We'll see who wins in 2002," Congressman Morales said, while discussing future protest strategy with the Deputy Mayor of the town of Villa Catorce over an ample helping of stewed chicken and rice. "If in 2002 there is no coca in Chapare, Banzer wins. If our people are still growing coca, I win."
Cocky is a good word to describe the Bolivian legislator. He applauded and laughed when his colleagues made speeches against him in the halls of Congress recently, and he exchanged hearty greetings with policemen who man roadblocks in his district. When he plays soccer, he likes to wear the number 10, the number worn by Maradona, the great Argentine star. Still single, he was quoted in a 1995 Bolivian newspaper interview that one day he wanted to be married in a church made of coca leaves.
"He's an egotist, but when he enters the room he demands attention," said Oscar Torrico Alvarado, a center-left Congressman from neighboring Cochabamba.
Congressman Morales is controversial, to say the least, although a Dutch human rights group nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for protecting the rights of peasants who say they are doing nothing more than growing a crop that has been grown in the Andean region for hundreds of years.
After Congressman Morales openly called on coca growers to defend their lands against army and police units, the Government blamed him personally for the killing of three police officers and the wounding of 15 others in a string of ambushes staged since April. He has also been blamed for a rash of threats members of his organization have made to coca growers who have signed agreements with the Government to stop growing their illegal crops, a charge that he only partly disputes.
"Any threats have been spontaneous," he said.
The Government party is trying to strip him of the legal immunity from prosecution that he is granted automatically by being a federal legislator. But a majority in the Chamber of Deputies opposed the move to sanction him in large part because it would set a precedent that could someday backfire on a sizable number of Congressmen with questionable ethics. Meanwhile, Bolivian law enforcement agencies are trying to find out if he has any ties with international drug traffickers, but so far United States and Bolivian officials concede that they have come up nothing solid so far.
"He's a very capable union leader and he knows how to inspire and prepare young people," said Brig. Gen. Walter Cespedes Ramallo, the top Bolivian Army commander in Chapare. "But he has to know that to support coca cultivation in Chapare he is defending the interests of the narcotraffickers."
Traveling with Congressman Morales through his district is an object lesson on how coca permeates the politics and economics of the area that votes for him so resoundingly. Touring his district in sandals and blue jeans, he got out of his van to talk to a woman drying coca leaves on her front yard in the town of Villa Catorce as she complained about the increasing number of peasant associations in the region that were abandoning the crop for fear of Government reprisals.
"These are our problems," he said, nodding his head glumly. But then, shaking off his own concerns that the unity of the coca growers may be cracking under Government pressure, he added, "These are not really unions -- they have no members."
The main event of the day was a coca growers union meeting in this sweltering town of wooden shacks set on stilts. As he arrived, the growers were listening to radio reports of an ambush of a Government eradication team that left one policeman dead and three wounded.
"Did we lose any people?" he asked.
During the meeting a young woman flanked by her children began crying uncontrollably about the loss of income her family would suffer if the Government campaign was effective.
Sitting behind a pile of coca leaves, Congressman Morales responded, "It's time to stop crying and start organizing!"
Then he went into a blistering attack on the Government. "They speak of sedition and treat us like guerrillas," he said. "Banzer is using Chapare to distract the rest of the country from all the other problems the nation faces."
Discussing the attempts by his opponents in Congress to strip him of his immunity, he steamed, "Congress is the first mafia of the state. All they know how to do is lie and steal."
The 300 union members cheered, and many took copious notes to take back to their locals.
Like many of the people of Chapare, Congressman Morales originally came from the highlands to find a more prosperous life. He came from a poor subsistence farm family, worked in bakery and took up the trumpet as an adolescent, and even became a professional for awhile. His band specialized in playing the tinku and diabladas, traditional Indian fight and protest music.
He never finished high school, and entered the army. His life-defining epiphany, he said, came in 1978, when he took part in a military action against a march by coca growers protesting a military coup.
"When ordered to shoot, I shot over the heads of the protesters," he recalled. "I saw that the biggest defenders of democracy were the cocaleros."

HEADLINE: Reluctant Threat: West's Kosovo Policy Hinges on the Use of Force

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The United States and its allies remain reluctant to use force against the Yugoslav Army, despite NATO's decision on Thursday to put on a display of air power in countries bordering the Serbian province of Kosovo, officials of the United States and other NATO member-nations said today.
But Western policy, as it is being formulated on the run, hinges on the credible threat of force in order to prompt a negotiated solution between the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, and the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, who make up 90 percent of the Serb province. 
 In any case, Clinton Administration and NATO officials do not expect quick Russian approval for a Security Council resolution authorizing any use of force. The Serbs are traditional allies of Moscow, and Kosovo is, after all, an internationally recognized part of Yugoslavia.
But these officials say they are counting on President Boris N. Yeltsin to help persuade Mr. Milosevic, when they meet on Tuesday, to halt the violence against ethnic Albanians and to start negotiating seriously with their representatives.
If Mr. Milosevic ends up embarrassing the Russians by rebuffing Moscow's requests, senior American and NATO-country officials say, Moscow may be more willing to support a decision to authorize NATO to use force in or over Kosovo.
Prompted by Britain, the allies have done much this week to make the threat of force a credible one. NATO has agreed to displays of air power in countries like Albania and Macedonia, and to accelerated planning for a possible use of force in Kosovo, against a backdrop of tough talk today when Western foreign ministers met in London.
Officials are hopeful that the threat of force will be sufficient to deter Mr. Milosevic from continuing his military operations in Kosovo, where about 250 people have been killed, about 10,000 have become refugees and 60,000 or more have been displaced from their homes.
Mr. Milosevic argues that he is using his forces to put down an insurrection by the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence -- much as Moscow tried to put down insurrectionists in Chechnya without NATO's interference.
But the officials emphasize that force, no matter who wields it, will not bring a solution to the Kosovo problem. Only negotiations can do that, they say. And there is a growing consensus that Washington and NATO must press both the Serbs and ethnic Albanians to negotiate -- and to negotiate for an end neither side currently accepts.
The Kosovo Albanian leader Washington favors, Ibrahim Rugova, who favors negotiations for independence, is rapidly losing popular support to the Kosovo Liberation Army, Western intelligence officials say, and few ethnic Albanians favor talks with the Serbs. That suggests that if negotiations with Mr. Milosevic are to work, a representative of the K.L.A. must be involved.
"The problem right now is that you're negotiating with someone, Rugova, who can't deliver the people who have to be delivered to to make a settlement stick," a senior Western official said.
At the same time, the official conceded, little is known about the leadership and structure of the K.L.A. "We need to do a lot more work to figure out who and how" the K.L.A. is represented in any negotiations, he said, given that Mr. Milosevic may be unwilling to meet directly with a K.L.A. representative.
"We need to get a political process going to which both sides are genuinely committed, and right now we don't have that," the official said. Nor is the West acting with a firm agreement on what the outcome should be.
Washington and its allies favor enhanced autonomy for Kosovo within a federal Yugoslavia. But the ethnic Albanians, regardless of whether they favor the approach chosen by Mr. Rugova or the K.L.A., want independence and say a return to the status quo is impossible.
Mr. Milosevic, who took away Kosovo's autonomous status within Serbia in 1989, shows little sign of willingness to grant Kosovo much more than a return to the way things were.
Western officials acknowledge that any settlement must contain protections for Kosovo's Serbs and for the Serbian monasteries, cultural centers and historical sites that are central to the Serbs' self-image and ideology.
Some officials compare Kosovo to Northern Ireland, in the sense that an armed group is fighting for independence and that peace requires that it accept more realistic goals short of that aspiration. But Kosovo and the K.L.A. seem to lack a figure like Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, who can articulate a set of compromises to the men with the guns.
With divisions about how deep to get involved in Kosovo, Washington has been willing to be driven by the British and Germans toward a more confrontational policy toward Mr. Milosevic, including the imposition of economic sanctions. Still, American officials say they and NATO have been deeply involved with Kosovo policy in the first three months of this crisis, a marked contrast to Bosnia, where Washington kept its distance for nearly four years.
A senior official said, "at least we have the start of a policy." Serious negotiations can begin with stabilizing security in Kosovo and ending the violence, he added. "Then we can talk about political and constitutional arrangements. But there's going to be no quick fix in Kosovo."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT EXTENDS AN OIL DRILLING BAN ALONG COASTLINES

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Calif., June 12

 BODY:
Navigating a middle course between environmental advocates and oil companies, President Clinton announced today a 10-year extension of the moratorium on oil drilling off virtually all United States ocean coastlines.
Mr. Clinton also placed several marine sanctuaries off-limits to oil exploration, setting no expiration date. The areas include the Channel Islands and Monterey Bay sanctuaries in California, the Florida Keys, Gray's Reef in Georgia and the Olympic Coast sanctuary off Washington State. 
 The moratorium does not, however, affect areas off the Texas and Louisiana coasts, where extensive drilling has been going on for years, nor does it protect any areas, including the coastline of the southeastern United States, not already covered by the drilling ban first imposed by President George Bush in 1990.
Mr. Clinton, calling the oceans "the world's last great frontier," also signed an executive order today to expand programs to preserve and restore coral reefs in United States waters. He proposed new spending of $6 million to restore 18 damaged reefs in Florida, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam and Hawaii.
Speaking against the sparkling backdrop of Monterey Bay, the nation's largest marine sanctuary, the President said offshore oil activity threatened fish populations and fragile coastal ecosystems.
Although there have been relatively few drilling-related oil spills in American waters, Mr. Clinton said, "Even under the best of circumstances, is it really worth the risk?"
With worldwide oil supplies plentiful and domestic gasoline prices at near-record lows, extending the moratorium carries little political risk for the President.
The oil industry, always interested in finding new petroleum sources, said the President's decision to ban further offshore exploration worsened the nation's dependence on imported oil.
The ban, issued under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, covers virtually all of the coasts of the North Atlantic, California, Washington, Oregon, southwest Florida, New England, the Mid-Atlantic and the North Aleutian Basin of Alaska, according to the White House.
Drilling in these waters is banned through 2002; the President's action extends that period to 2012.
Environmental groups would have preferred a permanent ban on all drilling but gave Mr. Clinton credit for using his executive authority to halt the activity for 10 more years.
"The President's commitment is impressive and heartening," Mark Massara, director of coastal programs for the Sierra Club, said in an interview today, "but it doesn't go far enough."
Because Mr. Clinton used an executive order to extend the ban, the action can be rescinded by a future President or revoked in a national oil emergency.
"We need legislation from Congress to insure permanent protection," Mr. Massara said.
Todd Steiner of the Earth Island Institute was less generous in his assessment, calling Mr. Clinton's action "a drop in the ocean."
"He's giving us what we already had, a moratorium on drilling," Mr. Steiner added. "It's a politically popular thing to do, but it doesn't really take us anywhere."
The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's largest trade group, reacted more bitterly.
"The moratoria's extension is unfortunate," Chris Kelley, an institute spokesman, said, "because it ignores the near-perfect performance of the American petroleum industry in operating offshore in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner."
"This regrettable decision, which is not in the long-term interests of American consumers, is particularly bad policy at a time of record U.S. energy imports," Mr. Kelley continued, reading a prepared statement. "Ultimately, the extension means a smaller future supply of domestically produced oil and natural gas and a lost opportunity to create American jobs."
Katie McGinty, chairwoman of the White House Council on Economic Quality, said that criticism from environmental groups and the industry was a sign that the President had found a workable compromise.
"The President has charted the most prudent course here," Ms. McGinty said.
Mr. Clinton also used his appearance here, at the first National Oceans Conference, to announce other proposals, including an $800 million fund to repair and expand the nation's seaports and, to help sustain swordfish stocks, a ban on the sale and import of Atlantic swordfish weighing less than 33 pounds.
He also announced the Administration's intention to build two deep-sea observatories and to develop two high-technology undersea probes to explore exotic sea life.
"We propose to provide new submersibles and other advanced tools for mapping and exploring the world's last great frontier," Mr. Clinton said as a sailboat drifted across the bay behind him. "I'd kind of like to go down there myself some day."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Korean Stocks Tumble 8.1% In Recond One-Day Plunge

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 12

 BODY:
Investors stampeded out of the Korean stock market today, sending it back to the 11-year lows hit last month when worries about the pace of economic changes and labor unrest hurt share prices.
This time, fears that the Japanese yen's free fall would put pressure on China to devalue its currency, the yuan, unnerved both foreign and local owners of Korean stocks. 
 The key market index fell 8.1 percent, to 302.09, the largest plunge on record. The closing figure was the lowest since January 1987. In an abbreviated trading session Saturday morning, the index rose 1.5 percent to 306.66.
Many investors pulled their money out of the market on rumors that Tiger Management L.L.C, a New York investment fund headed by the well-known manager Julian Robertson, had sold large quantities of South Korean shares. Mr. Robertson has built up his fund's holdings in companies like SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile-phone company, and he has led a group of foreign investors pushing for greater shareholder rights in the country. Those efforts had given local investors greater confidence.
But those investors apparently ignored Mr. Robertson's other recent statements that the problems of several Asian countries are not yet close to being resolved. In fact, Tiger Management has been selling some, but not all, of its South Korean holdings recently, including today, according to a financial-industry executive.
In the United States, Fraser Seitel, a spokesman for Tiger Management, declined to comment on the firm's trading activities or positions.
The overriding force driving down the market was the yen's inability to regain its footing against the dollar after remarks Thursday by Robert E. Rubin, the United States Treasury Secretary, that were interpreted by currency traders as a signal Japan would get no help defending the yen.
"The major concern is no longer restructuring but currency," said Yoon Doo Young, chief strategist at Daewoo Securities in Seoul. "The yen has been depreciating far more rapidly than the market anticipated recently, and that gives China more reason to consider devaluation."
A weaker yen and a weaker yuan make Japanese and Chinese exports cheaper and increase competition over the long run for the exports of other Asian countries like South Korea, particularly since the Korean currency, the won, has remained relatively stable.
But Stephen E. Marvin, head of research at Jardine Fleming in Seoul, said there was little reason for the won to fall. He pointed to $35 billion held in reserve at the Bank of Korea, evidence of the country's comeback from severe indebtedness late last year.
Mr. Marvin also said concerns over the effects of the falling yen were premature because it took considerable time for currency fluctuations to have an impact.
Moreover, Mr. Marvin said, while South Korea and Japan sell many of the same products, they often cater to different segments of the same market. Korean computer-chip manufacturers, for instance, largely make basic chips, while the Japanese have branched into specialized memory chips and the like.
Additionally, according to Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry, only 35 percent of Japan's exports are denominated in yen, and most of those products go to Asia. The rest are largely denominated in dollars, German marks and British pounds and, thus, their prices are not adjusted unless the yen moves substantially and over a long period of time.
By some measures, however, the yen's weakness means some South Korean industries are verging on losing their edge against Japanese competitors, if they have not already done so.
Korean steel companies lose their currency competitiveness against Japanese steelmakers when the yen weakens to 9.5 won, and South Korean electronics makers lose their currency edge when the yen weakens to 10.5 won. The yen fell as low as 9 won today.
"We are having a very hard time," Mr. Yoon of Daewoo Securities said.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Hotel Rates Head for the Sky

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Looking for a hotel room in Manhattan? You have plenty of options.
You could book weeks in advance and pay $300 or so a night for a room at a modern midtown high-rise like the Crowne Plaza. If you're willing to pay a bit more -- say, $500 a night on average -- you could probably get something with less of a hassle at the Four Seasons or the Pierre. Or you could do what a growing number of visitors are forced to do: stay in New Jersey. 
 The hotel market in Manhattan, the most expensive in the nation and fresh off a record year in 1997, continued to tighten in this year's first quarter, compared with the first three months of last year, with the average cost of a night's stay creeping closer to $200.
"This is the highest first-quarter average daily rate in Manhattan's history," said Dexter Wood, a hotel consultant with Coopers & Lybrand.
The market has become so expensive that in the last 18 months, five hotels -- the Lowell, the St. Regis and the Carlyle, as well as the Pierre and the Four Seasons -- began charging an average rate of $500 on and off, with some suites running into four figures. No other city in the nation has even a single hotel with an average rate so high, industry experts said.
And even as prices rise, it is still difficult to find a room in New York unless it is booked far in advance. That fact has forced some visitors to stay in New Jersey or not come to the city at all.
"We cannot find a decent hotel room anywhere on Manhattan, it seems, for less than a fortune," said Alan Bennett of Sydney, Australia, who was planning to come to the city in August. "We have searched database after database and rung hotel chains' reservations centers, all to no avail.
"It has got to the stage where we are about to scrap our plans to go to New York and instead split our four or five days there between an extra day or two in Washington and Boston."
Those who do find a room are often in for a surprise.
"Three hundred bucks!" said Susan Jeans of Bayport, Minn., who booked her room at the Crowne Plaza in mid-Manhattan two weeks in advance. "We were expecting like $200."
The average price of a room in Manhattan rose to $189.70 for the first quarter of the year, according to preliminary figures from the Coopers & Lybrand Lodging Research Network. That is a 13.9 percent leap over the $166.58 average room price for the first quarter of 1997 and a smaller jump over the $187.91 rate for all of 1997. By the end of the year, Coopers & Lybrand expects average room rates to rise an additional 10 to 12 percent, surpassing $200, a figure reached briefly for the first time last fall and Christmas, the busiest months of the year for many New York hotels.
Occupancy rates are nearing records, too. For the first three months of the year, which are among the slowest for the industry in New York, hotels were 80.5 percent filled, according to Coopers & Lybrand. That's an increase of 5.4 percent over the first quarter of 1997, and only slightly down from 82 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997, which was the highest since 1979.
"Demand is unprecedented here," said Steven Pipes, general manager of Le Parker Meridien, a hotel in mid-Manhattan. "People wanting a room in the fall, if they don't starting making reservations now, in the early summertime, they will be missing out."
John A. Fox, a senior vice president with PKF Consulting, a hotel and real estate consulting company in Manhattan, said that business was good for many reasons: the strong local and national economies; a continuing shortage of rooms; the city's improved image, and a cheap dollar in many parts of the world, which makes it affordable for foreign tourists to come to the city and expensive for Americans to travel abroad. "The market has been on a steady upward climb since 1992," Mr. Fox said.
The city's decision in 1994 to cut its hotel tax to 15 percent from 21 percent, along with the state's elimination of its 5 percent hotel tax, may have had some impact as well. "When taxes are cut, demand usually rises," said Adam Brachet, a spokesman for Coopers & Lybrand. "It's not the whole potato, but it's part of it.
Bjorn R. Hanson, chairman of Coopers & Lybrand's hotel and casino division, said, "It's a hotelier's dream, rates rising at three to four times inflation."
As a result, 11 hotels are under construction now and 28 more are planned or proposed in Manhattan. It would mean more than 11,593 rooms and a slight increase in hotel jobs. According to the state's Department of Labor, hotel employment in New York City rose by 700 jobs, to 36,200, in April from a year earlier.
Mr. Hanson also said that hotels were curtailing discounts and weekend packages because the markets were so strong. "Everything is priced at a premium," he said. "And we are also finding that guests are spending more money in the hotels."
The city's hotel space squeeze has sent many corporate travel managers scrambling. J.P. Morgan & Company now often books people into the relatively spartan Club Quarters hotel in downtown Manhattan, which lacks amenities like in-room faxes and room service.
And with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau projecting 32.5 million out-of-towners coming to the city this year, including 5.9 million from abroad, many business travelers and tourists may find that accommodations in New Jersey are their only affordable or available alternative. But even there, the overflow from Manhattan is making it difficult to find a room.
Elizabeth Eismeier, the treasurer of Colgate University, could not get a room two weeks ago. "We tried a dozen or more hotels, plus a travel agent, plus the Williams Club," she said. "Friends checked the Cornell Club and the Yale Club -- no soap.
"So, the agent suggested the Marriott at Newark Airport. "It was just fine. It made me want to see if any of our real estate investment managers were investing in hotel development in New York City. Seems like the city needs that."
The visitors bureau advises people trying to find a room to call the Peak Season Hotel Hot Line at (800) 846-7666, which makes reservations for more than 80 hotels in various price ranges and can give availability information. A person really stuck, the bureau says, should try contacting hotels after 6 P.M. to check on reservations the hotels have canceled that have not been guaranteed with a credit card.
Even with all the new hotels going up, it is probable, according to Coopers & Lybrand, that only 4,000 to 5,000 of the approximately 12,000 rooms that are planned will be built; there are now about 54,600 rooms in Manhattan and 6,000 in the rest of the city.
"It's a drop in the bucket," said Mr. Fox of PKF Consulting.
Jeff Weinstein, editor in chief of Hotels magazine, said, however, that if the economy slipped, demand could fall -- just as additional rooms were being made available.
"And it won't be problematic for just the new hotels -- all hotels will suffer," he said. "Anytime the economy suffers, the hotel industry suffers."

HEADLINE: City's Plans for Governors I. Include Housing and Casino

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration plans to release two reports next week sketching out redevelopment proposals for Governors Island, including housing, schools, parks, a new hotel -- and a casino that would provide millions of dollars to finance the plan.
The reports come as civic groups, preservationists and others have sharply criticized the city and state for failing to move quickly to develop the historic island in New York Harbor. They worry that officials are squandering President Clinton's offer to give the federally owned island to New York City, provided the city and state come up with an acceptable public purpose for the site. 
 Governors Island, a 172-acre military installation for 300 years, was closed last year and is now virtually a ghost town. Its last inhabitants, the Coast Guard, left the island in pristine shape, but preservationists worry that the historic buildings could quickly slide into decrepitude. At the same time, park and playground proponents hunger for the island's recreational potential, and New York University and Columbia are looking at it as a possible home for classrooms and students.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has suggested several times that casino gambling could provide a windfall to finance other desirable development on the island, as well to preserve such historic treasures as Castle William, one of two forts that long guarded the harbor. But that plan has run into criticism from preservationists and some politicians, who have argued that a casino is an inappropriate use for the site and politically unrealistic as well.
The reports by independent consultants that the city will release next week will outline the economic pluses and minuses of various developments, as well as suggest changes to the buildings needed to achieve them, Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said yesterday.
The state, which has not taken a position on the island, said it would follow the city's lead. "We're looking forward to seeing what they come up with," said Michael F. McKeon, press secretary to Gov. George E. Pataki.
Concerned that the island's fate remains in limbo, the National Trust for Historic Preservation plans to include the site in its new list of the nation's 11 most endangered historic places, officials of the organization said. The designation, to be announced on Monday, will group Governors Island with such imperiled treasures as a Civil War battlefield in Virginia and an Art Deco hotel in Nevada.
Richard Moe, the trust's president, said he was worried that the empty buildings could deteriorate quickly. "Governors Island could be on a slippery slope to serious deterioration," he said.
Mr. Moe urged the Governor and the Mayor to appoint a commission to quickly come up with alternatives, before the opportunity to preserve the island is lost. Mr. Levine said the reports would answer this request.
The trust president compared Governors Island with the south side of Ellis Island, which, unlike the north side, has not been restored. Last year, the trust put Ellis Island on its list of most endangered places, an action it believes helped secure a $6 million Congressional appropriation to stabilize the buildings on the south side.
If New York does not take over the island by 2002, Federal law requires that it be auctioned for a price Congress has estimated at $500 million.
Financing is critical to any redevelopment plan. The Urban Land Institute, a Washington organization of real estate professionals, issued a report last year saying any development on Governors Island would probably need an initial infusion of capital to jump-start it. Mayor Giuliani has several times suggested that casino development may be a way to get this investment.
But that idea worries many of the groups most interested in the island's development. "We can't find anyone who thinks a casino will work here," said Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society. He worries that a bridge from Brooklyn to the island might be necessary to transport the crowds needed to support a large casino.
"You certainly want public access, but you don't want thousands and thousands of people," he said.
A collection of civic groups plan to present a plan in September for a number of uses. Members cite political difficulties with gambling. Marcia Reiss, policy director for the Parks Council, pointed out that gambling would have to pass the Legislature twice and a statewide referendum once. "I don't see it passing in New York," she said.

Japanese Economy Weaker Than Believed, Data Show
Japan's economy, the world's second largest, sank at a stunning annual rate of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, the Government said in an official report that painted an even bleaker picture than expected and confirmed that the nation is in a recession.
The report was released after Japan's battered stock market had closed for the day, but the yen kept falling, reaching another eight-year low against the dollar. Although the benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 8.29 points, it finished the week with a loss of 301.1 points or nearly 2 percent, and is down 13 percent from its March 2 high. Page A1. 

Korean Stocks Plunge 8.1 Percent
Korean stocks tumbled, returning to the 11-year lows they reached last month. The latest drop comes amid worries about the trade effects of the steep declines in the values of Asian nations' currencies. The key market index fell 8.1 percent, to 302.09 -- the lowest since January 1987. D3.
 
Producer Prices Rose 0.2% in May
Prices paid to producers rose rose two-tenths of 1 percent in May -- the same increase as in April -- largely because of a sharp gain in the cost of prescription drugs. Analysts saw no sign of a pickup in inflation in the data. Another economic report pointed to a slowdown. Business inventories of unsold goods rose two-tenths of 1 percent in April -- the slowest gain in three months. D14.
 
Goldman, Sachs Partners Meet
The 190 partners of Goldman, Sachs & Company met to consider a proposal to turn the firm, Wall Street's last major private partnership, into a public company. A Goldman spokesman said the firm would probably announce tomorrow whether or not the partners backed the plan to go public. D3.
 
Seagram Files for Tropicana Sale
Seagram expects to raise as much as $3.6 billion when it sells its Tropicana juice business in an initial public offering, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Seagram disclosed plans for an I.P.O. on May 21, when it agreed to acquire Polygram, the music giant, for $10.6 billion in cash and stock. D3.
 
Oil Drilling Moratorium Is Extended
President Clinton announced a 10-year extension of the moratorium on oil drilling off virtually all American ocean coastlines. The moratorium does not affect areas off the Texas and Louisiana coasts, where extensive drilling has been going on for years. A1.
 
Big Stake in British Cable Unit Sold
BCE, the Canadian telecommunications company, sold its 14.25 percent stake in Cable and Wireless Communications for 975.2 million ($1.59 billion), in a move to exit the British cable television industry. D3.
 
VW Unit to Buy Lamborghini
A week after Volkswagen won its bid to acquire Rolls-Royce, the German car maker is adding another storied name to its garage: The company's Audi unit has agreed to buy Lamborghini S.p.A., the Italian sports car maker. Terms were not disclosed, but analysts estimated Lamborghini's worth at $111 million. D2.
 
F.C.C. Scales Back Internet Plan
Under pressure from lawmakers who argued that the program would increase long-distance telephone rates, the Federal Communications Commission decided to reduce by more than 40 percent the budget of a plan to connect schools and libraries to the Internet. Long-distance carriers are required to provide most of the money for the program. Under the revised plan, $1.275 billion will be raised this year, down from an original maximum of $2.25 billion. A8.
 
New Global Initiative on Child Labor
The Clinton Administration is supporting a proposed treaty to outlaw the most exploitive forms of child labor. The new International Labor Organization initiative comes 25 years after the body first tried to curb such abuses. The new convention focuses on such extreme forms of child labor as working in mines and prostitution. A5.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Up 23.17 As Late Rally Salvages Prices

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market continued to cascade yesterday, falling sharply for the fourth consecutive session on renewed concerns about Asia's economic woes, before a rally late in the day pushed prices higher.
Heightened fears about another round of economic and financial turmoil in Asia have roiled stock markets around the world this week, but yesterday investors finished off a bad spell by buying back into the market in the last hour of trading. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had fallen as much as 128 points early in the day, ended up 23.17 points, closing at 8,834.94. For the week, though, the Dow lost 202.77 points, or 2.2 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure, rose 4.26 , to 1,098.84. But the Nasdaq composite index, which is packed with technology issues, fell for the third session, down 4.70, to 1,745.05.
Bond prices, meanwhile, dipped a day after a sharp rise pushed long-term interest rates to their lowest level in about 30 years. Yesterday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.66 from 5.65 a day earlier.
Although the economy appears remarkably sound, with hefty growth and low inflation, Wall Street analysts said the recent global selloff was once again raising the specter of troubles ahead. Even while yesterday's market eked out a gain, the trend has been unnervingly bearish. "The market's going through this classic Asia crisis meltdown drill," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "There's a fear that Japan and Asia are out of control."
Since mid-April, stock prices have been choppy and largely depressed, unable to gain much ground after a sharp run-up early in the year. Slowing growth in profits and a widespread belief that share prices have grown too expensive are said to be contributing to the weakness. But as Mr. Roach said, now, much like last October, there are reverberations from Asia.
The problem is that economies throughout Asia and the Pacific region are floundering, creating fears that the economic crisis could eventually disrupt the United States economy, which Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress on Wednesday was as "impressive" as any economy he had seen in his nearly 50 years of close observation.
The crisis in Asia is particularly acute in Japan, which has been sputtering for much of the decade. Yesterday, more bad news came when the Government said the Japanese economy contracted at a 5.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, confirming reports that the economy has fallen into a recession.
That downturn has drastically weakened the Japanese yen against the dollar, and economists fear a sliding yen might cause other Asian currencies to plunge, creating a ripple effect that could reduce demand for American products in Asia and cut into corporate earnings, which are already weakening.
Energy and technology stocks have been particularly hard hit in recent months. Oil stocks have fallen sharply with oil prices, and technology issues have slid because of falling earnings estimates partly because of Asia's impact on the industry.
Indeed, in early trading yesterday, the Nasdaq fell a full 10 percent below its all-time high of 1,917.61, a drop that constituted a benchmark "correction" in Wall Street parlance. But analysts said heavy computerized buying programs in the last hour of trading lifted blue-chip issues and even some technology shares.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks, which have long trailed the bigger issues, also fell yesterday, dropping 10 percent below its all-time high and leaving the index virtually flat on the year.
Gail Dudack, the chief investment officer at UBS Securities, said that the continuing crisis in Asia simply exacerbated fears about slowing profit growth in the United States.
"Wages are growing so much faster than pricing," she said. "The big risk is that profits are plateauing. What Asia means is that top-line growth will be hurt; we won't be able to sell them anything, and they'll compete with our products on price."
But Mr. Roach said fears that the yen's weakness would force China to devalue -- setting off a broader competitive round of devaluations -- was overblown. China and Japan do not compete directly in the export market, he said, and the Chinese economy remains strong and will probably be able to withstand the yen's turbulence.
"A lot of people are reacting as if Japan is unexpectedly imploding," he said. "Japan has long abdicated its role as a leader of Asia and an engine of global growth. And even if the Asian crisis continues, I think the global economy will be O.K."

HEADLINE: JAPAN'S ECONOMY APPEARS BLEAKER

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 12

 BODY:
The world's second-largest economy sank at a stunning annual rate of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to official figures released today that painted an even bleaker picture than many economists had expected.
While Japan's economy has been troubled for years, the latest, official numbers confirmed that economic output had declined for two consecutive quarters -- the definition generally accepted by economists for a recession. The numbers mean that for the first time since the oil shock of 1974, the economy declined for a full year -- falling by an annual rate of seven-tenths of a percent for the fiscal year ended March 31. It was Japan's worst postwar economic performance. 
 Concern about Japan's economic problems have been sending shock waves through Asia, weakening the yen and heightening fears that the crisis could spread from Asia to the United States and Europe.
Robert E. Rubin, the United States Treasury Secretary, characterized the data as "worse than expected" and reiterated his view that Japan must fundamentally change its financial structure and vigorously stimulate its economy, which is contributing to slumps in Asia, Russia and Eastern Europe.
"The center of the problem is in Japan, and it's a very serious problem for the world," Mr. Rubin said during an appearance in Mobile, Ala.
Japan's troubles are partly the legacy of its speculative economic bubble of the late 1980's, which resulted in $600 billion in bad loans that still hang over its banking system. Many economists say a recovery has been hobbled by a tax increase last year, excessive regulations and a consumer reluctance to spend. Although an enormous package of tax cuts and other stimulus measures is expected to help later this year, economists say the effects may be only temporary.
Japanese officials took care to release today's news after the stock market had closed for the day. Earlier, driven largely by the declining yen, South Korea's stock market fell by a record 8.1 percent, while the Nikkei 225 benchmark index dipped below 15,000 in the morning, before closing at 15,022.33, up 8.29 points. Most other Asian stock markets and currencies ended sharply lower.
A weaker yen makes Japanese products cheaper and more competitive, which could further damage the economies of Japan's neighbors and cause a relentless spiral of currency devaluations. That could destabilize financial markets around the world.
The impact on the United States thus far has been mixed, with consumers benefiting from cheaper imports and lower interest rates made possible, in part, by the slowdown in Asia. But United States corporate profits have declined recently, partly because of the weakness in Asian markets. There is fear as well that continued financial decline in Japan and East Asia could result in a panic that would spread to the United States and Europe.
Japanese officials again warned today that the yen was falling too far and too fast. By late today in New York it took 144.72 yen to buy a dollar, meaning the yen has fallen 3 percent this week alone. Since its peak in 1995, the currency has fallen nearly 45 percent against the dollar.
"I don't think it will cause a minus effect on the Japanese economy," Koji Omi, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said of the weak yen today, according to Kyodo News Service. But it poses problems, he added, "for the whole of the world economy."
Li Zhaoxing, China's Ambassador to the United States, called on the Group of Seven industrialized nations, which includes Japan, to take action to bolster the yen. "They know their situation; they know they have means available," Mr. Li said. "If there's a will, there's a way."
Some economists said Japan's economy may recover in the short term, partly because of the huge fiscal stimulus package. But others said Japan was teetering on the edge of a much greater tumble.
"Things could fall apart very quickly here and Japan could go like other countries in Asia -- completely fall apart, or it could linger on," said Brian H. Rose, an economist at LTCB Warburg Securities Ltd., a venture between Long-Term Credit Bank and the SBC Corporation.
Mr. Rose cautioned that Japan was now in the throes of an unpredictable transition to more of a market economy.
"Like Eastern Europe, if you introduce shock therapy and go from a nonmarket to a market, the short-term disruption is enormous," Mr. Rose said. He added, however, that once the transition was made, Japan could enjoy strong growth again.
Shimpei Nukaya, vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency, which released the economic numbers, said the negative impact on Japan's economy from the Asian economic crisis was bigger than the Government had expected and that the figures "underline the gloomy situation of the nation's real economy."
Sluggish for several years, Japan's economy fell into a recessionary spiral after a tax increase last year, imposed at a moment when the economy instead required a tax reduction, in the view of many economists. They have said that no adequate stimulus has yet been applied.
Sales are down at many medium-sized businesses, and mom-and-pop shops are particularly feeling the pinch.
"I have no customers, even at this hour," said Yasuhiko Sato, a 30-year-old vendor selling tuna fish at lunchtime. "I see shops closing down in this area. My bonus is very low. It's crazy."
Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency, said today that the number of corporate failures in May rose 37.5 percent from a year ago, to 1,791. It was the highest total for the month of May since 1984.
For Hachiro Hattori, a 75-year-old vendor of wrapping materials, the solution is to put his pension income into his ailing business.
"My wife and I can survive if we buy only food," he said.
Today's announcement offered new data only for the January-to-March period, but since Japan's fiscal year ended on March 30 the new figures meant that over the course of the last fiscal year the nation's gross domestic product fell seven-tenths of a percent.
That was the first annualized decline in output since 1974, when the decline was five-tenths of a percent. If the numbers released today are not revised upward, the 1997 fiscal year would mark Japan's worst economic performance since World War II.
Exports for the first quarter also declined by 3.8 percent, the first drop in a dozen years, as troubled Asian economies drastically reduced imports from Japan.
There are no reliable figures to assess economic performance since then but there is scant evidence of improvement. Still, with parliamentary elections next month, the Government is trying desperately to cheer people up.
The elections will choose representatives to the Parliament's Upper House, which is less important than the Lower House. Still, the election is an important gauge of public sentiment, and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto wants to do well to help his own standing and his ability to retain office.
Today Mr. Hashimoto won an expected victory when the Lower House rejected a no-confidence motion against his Cabinet.
Officials point out that the Government's $111 billion stimulus package seems about to be approved by the Parliament, clearing the way for a rush of public funds into the economy. The governing Liberal Democratic Party is counting heavily on the public money to pick up growth.
But industrial production was down 6 percent in April from the year before, corporate profits have tumbled 25 percent from the previous year, prices are falling ominously, and some economists warn that Japan may be sinking into a deflationary spiral. Economists fear a vicious cycle in which falling prices and profits lead to rising unemployment, which would curb consumption and bring down prices further.
"It's a deflation, that's pretty clear," said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Capital spending for the first quarter fell 5.1 percent, the steepest decline since 1965. The Government also released figures today showing that Japanese manufacturers plan to reduce spending by 4.4 percent on plant and equipment in the current fiscal year, which began on April 1. The decline was the first in four years, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
"It's certainly hard to see a way out at this point," said Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd.
Japanese Government officials have annoyed some analysts by seeming to play down the seriousness of the situation. They frequently had argued that the economy was simply "stagnant" or at a "standstill," refusing to acknowledge the decline. Indeed, many foreign-based economists have contended that Japan entered a recession many months ago.

U.S. Endorses Treaty On Child Labor Abuses

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 12

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman gave the Clinton Administration's support this week to a proposed treaty to outlaw the most exploitative forms of child labor.
Secretary Herman said she hoped that a mechanism to be included in the treaty calling for follow-up reporting of abuses would encourage countries to abide by their pledges to end economic exploitation of children. 
 The new initiative, at the International Labor Organization, comes 25 years after the body first tried to curb such abuses. But nearly two-thirds of the I.L.O.'s 174 member nations, particularly developing countries, chose not to sign it. The United States itself did not sign.
That convention barred children under 15 from working, except in the poorest countries where the age was set at 13. And no child under 18 could work in heavy industry.
The new convention takes a more limited approach, focusing on such extreme forms of child labor as working in mines and prostitution. The proposal could be ready for nations to sign next year.
Surveys indicate that about 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 work worldwide.
Ms. Herman announced that the Administration planned to ask Congress for $30 million -- a large increase over the current $3 million contribution -- for the I.L.O.'s project to help countries cope with child-labor abuses. More than 20 countries have applied for help in eliminating dangerous child labor.

Urban Renewal

BYLINE: By David France; David France is writing a book on F.B.I. surveillance of gay- liberation groups.

 BODY:
Off and on for months, a bulldozer has been scratching around on the grassy lot down near the end of my block, rattling me out of bed before 7 A.M. I would resent it less if I knew why. Dirt has moved from one pile to another, with no discernible program.
The very fact that excavators have arrived in my remote neck of the East Village is testament to the fate of J.R. He was the block's shady patriarch, our enigmatic alpha-neighbor. Until he went "away," as we've learned to say here euphemistically, he protected us from noisy progress. 
 For two decades, J.R headed up a vibrant heroin bazaar on the stoop next to a dingy midblock Laundromat. Appropriately, he and his colleagues dubbed themselves "the Laundromat Crew," and stamped their heroin "Laundromat" too. It was so enduringly popular among college kids that it has been mythologized in literature and music.
The Crew members lived among us -- or we among them -- in a bemused coalition: Puerto Ricans and yuppies, poets and punks. But the teeming sidewalks always belonged to the Crew. The rest of us were greeted vociferously when we passed. But pass we must. If I stopped to tie a shoelace, a firm voice would goose me along: Keep walking, keep walking, guy. I put up with the second-class relegation for 15 years. We all did. As long as J.R. was in charge, we knew, his would be the only crimes here. That was our dirty compromise.
J.R.'s career was a fixation of mine nonetheless. He was the first person who greeted me on the hot afternoon in 1981 when I landed here. He was 26 then and had spent time in the military, his only experience off the block. At 22, I had just arrived from Kalamazoo, Mich. Here we were, both ebullient, with little money and enormous ambition, I thought.
He was less generous. "Great," J.R. spat as I tramped past him in the lobby that day, "another white fag on the block." Over the years, as J.R. went gray and I went bald, his tolerance for me blossomed. I doubt he ever learned my name. But he never threw brickbats again.
Meanwhile, his customers lined up 15 deep outside the Laundromat to crease tiny envelopes into their palms. Rooftop spotters transmitted warnings to the sellers down below using cries of Spanish code words like Feo and Bajando. On some nights, their canopy of cries could seem as mysterious and beautiful as a jungle aviary.
They were purportedly doing $50,000 a week in business, though I often wondered where the money went. J.R. cultivated a Spartan life. He didn't even own a car. I have since learned that he helped many people with rent or veterinary bills they couldn't otherwise afford. But such token charity can't consume $2.6 million a year.
The denouement, when it came two years ago, was a scene out of a dime-store novel. In seeming slow motion, an army of officers arrived just before 11 P.M. A helicopter whirred overhead, projecting a cone of light over the dingy coin-op, where Crew members were handcuffed in clumsy succession. Well after midnight, J.R., then 41, made a Billy Jack-like appearance. The cops cuffed him with a flourish, I'm told by witnesses. His doting mother, who swings an unbending leg when she walks, gripped his shirt sleeve and unleashed a surreal and memorable cry.
I was curious to read that J.R., whom the tabloids would dub "Little John Gotti," didn't spring for a fancy attorney, and instead of fighting the charges, had his lawyer negotiate a plea. He was sentenced last fall to a dozen years, his first-ever trip to jail. The rest of the Crew got stiff sentences, too.
News of their disposition fluttered down upon the block like black organza. And the earth-moving equipment followed. All winter long the speculation was wild about what the new construction might bring. A police station. AIDS housing. N.Y.U. dorms. Last month, the construction crew posted a permit for 85 apartments over six floors, but one of the foremen undermined the sign's authority. "It's 125 luxury units on seven floors," he was telling people.
As I stood over the muddy hole the other day, I marveled at how one gaping mystery has supplanted another. And then a tempting idea entered my mind: What if there's no building at all? What if, somewhere in that turbid crevice, J.R. has stashed his treasure? Could this wheezing and pounding be directed by him, to remove or replace or replenish the hoard?
Then another thought struck: Keep walking, keep walking, guy.

HEADLINE: Schools For Sale

BYLINE: By Michael Winerip; Michael Winerip is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
It was easy to tell right away, walking into the large meeting room, that something hot was for sale and a lot was at stake. A dozen eager company reps -- stylish young men and women of all races and backgrounds -- stood behind two long tables with slick brochures and stacks of applications in English and Spanish. There were balloons and potted plants everywhere, cookies, pastries, coffee, juices and soft drinks, a room nearby to park the children.
By the time Kathleen Madigan, Ed.D, began her pitch on this April night, it was standing room only, more than 300 Jersey City parents. One father in the audience, Robert Silberman, was struck by how much the meeting felt like a sales presentation at the telecommunications company where he works, while others remarked on the speaker's evangelical tone. But what was being offered was neither cell phones nor God's salvation. The offering to this heavily minority audience in one of the poorest school districts in New Jersey was a free, publicly financed education for their children at a new charter school to be opened in September by Advantage Schools Inc., a Boston-based, for-profit company with schools in Phoenix and Rocky Mount, N.C. 
 "As we speak," began Madigan, Advantage's curriculum director, "I have kindergartners in Phoenix and North Carolina who can tell you the three phases of matter!. . .I have 5-year-olds in North Carolina who know where the prime meridian is!. . .We have 200 instructional days, 20 more than the public schools!. . .We go from 8 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon! Eight in the morning until 3:30!. . .We will have a phenomenal staff to make this a reality. We get to choose our teachers.. . .We don't say it's the child's fault, or they didn't have a good breakfast, or they came from this kind of family.
"This is how they're taught to walk down the hall," she said, marching, her hands folded in front of her. For an hour those parents sat, rapt, listening to one remarkable story after another. She told them how Advantage ran a direct-instruction school stressing basics, with teachers using daily scripts to drill students. She showed them videos of young black boys reading. "Our children on third level are reading the 'Iliad'; in fifth grade they read Homer's 'Odyssey.'. . .Most children don't like to rewrite. Oh no? Our children say, 'Give me one more chance!'. . .No child will fall through the cracks in our school."
And then she made an irresistible claim: "Every single one of our kindergartners in both schools is reading! Every single one! I don't get up here and say it unless it's true."
Kimlee Acosta, an employment agency worker and mother of two boys in the public schools, was sold. She found a pay phone and called her friend Christine Litaker, who was still at work. "You got to get down here," said Acosta. "It's freakin' great! They're going to start school at 8; they go to 3:30! My kids start school at freakin' quarter to 9." India Sloane, a home health aide with a daughter entering kindergarten, thought it sounded better than her local public school. "I'm going to apply her for this school," she said. "It have good qualifications for, you know, a child."
That night, hundreds of Jersey City parents signed up their children for a school that didn't have even a building or location yet, run by a company whose entire track record is two schools, each in existence for less than a year. The parents were willing to take the plunge, because while they didn't know fully what they were getting into, they knew they weren't pleased with what their children had.
Still, not everyone was converted. While Robert Silberman liked it, his wife, Karen, thought it sounded militaristic. "I guess we're having a disagreement," she said. And Sandra Oviedo has a son who's having problems with math in a school that uses a similar method. "It's not magic," she said. Even many parents eagerly signing on the dotted line were wondering if there really could be such a miraculous urban public school where every kindergartner reads.
This is the cutting edge of the school-choice movement, and it is stunning to behold because it is so radically different from what has come before in public education, and at the same time so much in sync with this era, when the free market is entrusted to deliver the best public-policy choices for us all. In the new education marketplace, public schools are expected to sell themselves aggressively, and the burden of figuring out what is real and what is hype falls not on regulators or district bureaucrats or boards of education but on parents. During the question period at that April meeting, Carlos Garcia asked what kind of guarantees went with all the company's promises. "What happens if my child does fall by the wayside?" Garcia asked. "I'm having that now, in another charter school."
"You're asking what recourse you have if we don't do what we say," Madigan responded. "I don't have a good answer for you. If this school doesn't do it, you tell other people and we don't keep in business."
In short: Let the buyer beware.
Each new school year brings more charters, and that in turn is pressuring public schools to sell themselves harder. Since 1991, when Minnesota passed the first charter legislation, 32 other states, including New Jersey (but not New York), have followed suit, and there are currently 786 charter schoools in America, with 400 to 500 more expected this fall. They tend to be in big cities, but exist in suburbs and rural areas, too, varying enormously in philosophy and quality. While most are run on a nonprofit basis, started by parents and educators, there are also about a dozen for-profit charter companies, including Edison, the best known, which will have 48 schools by fall, and Advantage, which will have 7 or 8. The movement has attracted support across the spectrum, from conservative businessmen like Steven Wilson, a founder of Advantage, to liberal public educators like Deborah Meier, who created the widely admired Central Park East public school in Harlem in the 1970's and recently started her own charter in Boston.
In Jersey City alone -- where six charters have been approved -- there is one started by white yuppies and one by the Urban League. There are charters that stress basics, and there is the Learning Community charter, which uses the Bank Street model and has a principal who warns parents that there will be little homework and no textbooks. When Kiwan Fitch is asked what she likes about that charter, she mentions the time her kindergartner, Brandon, dissected a fish.
Anyone in New Jersey who wants to start one -- parents, teachers, professors, businesspeople -- submits a plan to the state. If the state approves, then that plan -- the charter -- becomes the blueprint for the school. A charter school is free and open to any child who lives within the public-school district where the charter school is located. Typically, too many children want to attend and a lottery is held.
Financing is all tax dollars, and that is where the competition comes in, where things turn nasty: nearly every dollar that goes to a charter is subtracted from that district's public schools. Jersey City public schools currently receive about $7,000 from the state and city for each child educated. When a charter opens, it receives most of that $7,000 per child enrolled and the public school loses that $7,000 per child. So Advantage's charter, with 500 students, would receive close to $3.5 million in public funds that would have otherwise gone to Jersey City public schools. The numbers make it easy to understand the hard sell at that April meeting. Every family could bring in at least $7,000 to Advantage Schools Inc.; Kimlee Acosta's two sons were worth a cool $14,000.
Nor are public-school districts sitting by quietly as their funds and motivated students are skimmed off. Of 23 new charters approved this year in New Jersey, 14 faced legal challenges, most claiming they were an unfair economic drain.
Supporters of school choice say that rather than being hurt, good public schools will rise to the market challenge and improve. And you can see some of that in Jersey City, at schools like P.S.16, where the principal and parents are also out selling their school hard. Fortunately, P.S. 16 has lots to sell: it's a small school in a handsome old building in a gentrifying neighborhood of brownstones, with a poor yet upwardly mobile immigrant population whose children have some of the city's best test scores.
Mornings at P.S. 16, before school, Bob DiTursi, the principal, leans out his window, joking with parents on the sidewalk below. "I'm drumming up business," he says, pulling his head inside. He is not kidding. He wants 40 kindergartners for next September, enough so he can have two small classes of 20 each. Last fall, he fell short of 40 and it cost him. When the citywide classroom census was completed last October, he had only 31 kindergartners; the district decided that wasn't enough to justify two teachers and took one away, merging the children into a single, large class. Since then, when parents considering P.S. 16 for next year have visited, they've been discouraged by that overcrowded kindergarten. The principal fears that these motivated parents -- the ones whose children do best on the state tests that everyone follows in The Jersey Journal -- will go elsewhere. And so he has been hunting kindergartners, visiting downtown high-rises to pitch parents. He also has been giving out zone waivers to middle-class families who prefer P.S. 16 to their neighborhood school, P.S. 9, one of the city's worst.
P.S. 16 has had help, too, from Charlotte Kreutz, though she doesn't even have a child there yet. Kreutz, a designer married to an architect, believes in supporting her local public school and wants to send her 4-year-old, Georgia, to P.S. 16 -- if the kindergarten is not too large. In March, Kreutz created a flier that explained the kindergarten situation, titled "Consider P.S. 16, a Great School in Your Own Neighborhood!" She spent hours stuffing mailboxes and buttonholing parents. In this way, Kreutz lined up five families with children entering kindergarten who said they were leaning toward P.S. 16. Nothing is sure, however, as parents jockey on behalf of their children; several had their names in lotteries for charters, too. Even Kreutz was torn. "If Georgia's in a class of 30 kids, I'll be really unhappy. I don't know what I'll do. I don't want to be a bleeding-heart liberal making a point about public schools and sacrificing my child."
Every reform has limitations, and the problem with school choice is what happens to schools that have nothing to sell, schools left behind after the most-motivated families have made their choices and moved on. P.S. 39 is widely regarded as Jersey City's worst elementary school, a large, dark building at the end of a dead-end street surrounded by a 25-foot-high chain-link fence that makes it look like Riker's Island. The school has the city's lowest test scores and the most poor children, 94 percent qualifying for free lunches, many living on welfare in the Duncan Avenue projects. Midyear, the principal resigned. The week I visited, fights frequently broke out; the lunchroom was in chaos. The stereotype of bad inner-city schools is overcrowded classes, but so many parents work hard to get their children elsewhere -- whether a charter, a Catholic school or, by using a fake address, a better public school -- that at P.S. 39 average class size is actually small, 21.
At P.S. 39, in Laurie Ralph's third grade this year, a girl named Fathema often screamed, rolled on the floor like a dog and fought, making it impossible to accomplish anything some days. There were times the veteran teacher broke down crying. Fathema's mother, Peggy Smith, 30, says she doesn't know how to handle her daughter, either. One thing is certain: Smith won't be signing up her five children (three of them in special education) for a charter. She had never heard of charters. "I don't know too much about them," she says.
This year's Jersey City Teacher of the Year is from P.S. 39, Jerri O'Brien-Cass. She works long hours and learns about the personal problems her third graders face at home so she can help them better. For one boy who can't read and is failing, she sent home 17 notes requesting a parent conference -- with no response. P.S. 39 is on the losing side of the school-choice debate, and it enrages the teacher of the year. "If my best students, my Schnelle and my Phillip, are going off to charter schools, God bless them -- let them go if it gives them better lives," she says. "But that makes us like a prison. We'll be the Last Stop Incarceration Public School."
The answer from school choicers would be if P.S. 39 doesn't work, get rid of it and let the children of the Duncan Avenue projects choose among the city's best schools. In fact, Jersey City children can leave their neighborhood school and pick another if that other school's principal signs a waiver saying there is room. Unfortunately, most Jersey City schools are overcrowded, and schools in the more upscale neighborhoods are the most overcrowded. Those schools, which also have the top test scores, like P.S. 27, P.S. 38 and P.S. 6, average 30 in first grade. And Jersey City's Mayor, Bret Schundler, who is a national leader of the school-choice movement and regularly disparages his city's public schools ("They're a failure," he said), is not much help. While the state has tripled its annual aid to Jersey City schools in the last decade, the city's contribution has shrunk from $91 million in 1990 to $72 million this year. Schundler recently used his political clout ($34 million in city bonding power) not for public schools but to finance six new buildings to be occupied by charter schools.
This diversion of resources is public educators' worst fear and has so far kept charters out of New York. A push this spring to pass a charter bill by a coalition including the Republican Governor of New York, George Pataki, and Democratic legislators from heavily minority districts has been stalled by the association for public-school boards and the teachers' union, among others.
The school-choice debate is most importantly about how to design an effective public system to educate poor children, as Deborah Meier, the progressive educator, argues in "The Power of Their Ideas." The middle and upper classes, she points out, have always enjoyed school choice. If they don't like their public school, they can choose a private school or move to a suburb. Indeed, in the 1960's and 70's, thousands of white ethnic Jersey City families exercised choice by moving to suburbia. Today, Jersey City, the state's second largest district, has 32,000 mainly minority children -- a mix of Hispanics (38 percent) and African-Americans (41percent), along with immigrants. It is a place where several major reform efforts are going on at once, making it a good prism for viewing school choice. In 1989, the state took over Jersey City's public schools and still controls them, the longest-running takeover of a failing system in the nation. Of 39 charters approved in New Jersey since 1996, when the Republican Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, won passage of enabling legislation, Jersey City has 6, second only to Trenton.
Jersey City's Mayor Schundler has been a vocal school-choice advocate. He is a popular Republican in a Democratic city, a 39-year-old Harvard-educated bond salesman turned politician with a reputation as an urban reformer. The shift in Schundler's focus in recent years from vouchers to charters reflects a national switch by Republicans that has helped bring the choice movement into the mainstream.
In the early 1990's, Schundler's thrust was getting the state to approve publicly financed vouchers that children could use to attend Jersey City's Catholic schools (which have lost much of their white ethnic population) or other private schools. While vouchers have been opposed by most Democrats, teachers' unions and civil libertarians as a violation of the separation of church and state, the opposition of those groups did not count much in New Jersey by 1995. Republicans controlled the legislature and Governor's Mansion. Schundler was confident; a few states had passed pilot voucher programs. The Mayor looked to his ally, Governor Whitman, to lead the way.
He was hung out to dry. When forced to declare themselves, the suburbanite Governor and suburbanite legislative leadership had no passion for vouchers. Their constituents didn't need vouchers -- their suburban schools were first rate. And did they really want to raise taxes so inner city children could attend private schools? Trying to put the best light on it recently, the Mayor described it this way: "Whitman didn't push as hard as I thought. She feels complacency on this issue." Vouchers also would have aligned the party with the Christian right, an unpopular stand in a swing state like New Jersey.
Charters, on the other hand, were smack in line with mainstream Republicanism -- market- driven, secular schools that required no tax increase. While Mayor Schundler still wants vouchers, he is now pushing charters -- particularly "his" charter. The Advantage charter that so many parents signed up for that April night is known as "the Mayor's School." The Mayor hooked up with the for-profit Boston company; he is constructing a building with city bond money that will house the charter, at considerable savings to Advantage. So far, charter chains, including Edison, have not been profitable, but deals like this one could turn that around. Critics of the Mayor say he is doing everything possible to make "his" charter a success that he can show off if he runs for higher office.
That is not how the Mayor sees it. "I'm fighting for the kids; I'm fighting for the taxpayers," he says. "School choice is the civil rights struggle of this generation." Jersey City voters seem to agree. In April, all four on the Mayor's slate for the school board -- not one of them with a child in public school -- defeated a slate of candidates from the teachers' union that has long battled the Mayor over school choice.
The Mayor believes Advantage's approach, using constant drill and repetition, will work best "for children coming from less-advantaged homes. One problem these kids have is lack of confidence. They don't believe in their own potential. That discipline will be good for them. The teacher'll say: 'The Declaration of Independence was signed July 4, 1776. What day was the Declaration of Independence signed?' Disadvantaged children are shy to answer questions like this. This system doesn't allow children not to answer. The child gets used to his own voice, gets used to being told he's right. It's not that hard to give answers if someone just told you. They memorize back and know and get used to a lot of A's on quizzes. That may not be ideal in suburban Short Hills, but it's bringing a lot of value-added for our children." I asked the Mayor if he would send his daughter to the Advantage charter. She is 6 and attends a Christian school in Hoboken. No, he said, "I like a big dollop of Christianity with my education." But there were other reasons he wouldn't pick "his" charter for his daughter. "Those schools are best for certain children," he said.
All late winter and spring, parents feverishly researched school options. Angela George, a worker at an import company, visited every charter, got a book from the library on how to evaluate a school and called the Board of Education for a copy of its first-grade curriculum. Barbara Jeski, a Polish immigrant and single mother who works in housekeeping at a Manhattan hotel, speaks little English and so toured the Learning Community charter with her neighbor from the apartment upstairs, Amanda Merlino. Merlino has been advising Jeski on her daughter Patricia's education and suggested the charter might be better because of the smaller classes, 16 versus 28 at P.S. 25. But when Merlino heard about the school's progressive ways, she wasn't so sure. "It was more yuppieish than we expected -- there was this Chinese yup walking around with her nose in the air," she said of one parent. "But I kept quiet; I didn't say anything. I figure maybe this is an opportunity for Patricia to be around a better class of people, a mother and a father and both working. Maybe we have to do this for Patricia -- she has to know how to associate with rich people."
That Chinese yup was actually Christel Factura, a Filipino who immigrated in the early 1990's and, like her husband, is a computer programmer. Factura was impressed with the charter's cheery rooms, the willingness of teachers to let children progress at their own rate. She wouldn't consider her local public school for her kindergartner, didn't know its name. And if her son wasn't picked in the lottery? "Probably move to the suburbs," she said.
Carolyn Brewington, a single woman raising a troubled friend's son, heard about Learning Community from a neighborhood hairdresser who has a child at the charter and recommends it to her customers with hyperactive boys. "The public school can't handle my Tre," said Brewington, an office manager's assistant. "Monday, an hour after I arrived at work, the aide calls: 'Tre's throwing rocks in the classroom.' I know he's not easy. He has trouble sitting at a desk all day." What caught her attention was the charters' attitude on discipline. "If a teacher's reading a lesson and a child is in the corner with his feet up not taking part, it's not considered a disciplinary problem as long as he's not disrupting the class," she said.
In the course of visiting charters, I spoke to hundreds of parents. What distinguishes them is their motivation. They are out hunting something extra for their children. School-choice advocates try to debunk the idea that charters are elitist. They point out that charters tend to have a higher percentage of poor and minority children than most American schools, and in a sense they are right. Even the most "yuppified" Jersey City charter, the Learning Community school, is impressively integrated with 43 percent of its children poor enough to qualify for free lunches -- far more than in most suburbs. But, if you compare that charter to the Jersey City public-school district it competes with, the charter is skimming. The average Jersey City elementary school has 76 percent free lunches. In fact, all Jersey City's charters have fewer students qualifying for free lunches than an average Jersey City public school. Even the Advantage school in Rocky Mount, N.C., that Mayor Schundler says is so well equipped to serve Jersey City's poor, is skimming; 38 percent of its children qualify for free lunches versus 49 percent for Rocky Mount elementary schools.
This is common sense. The poorest, most troubled parents aren't running around looking for charters. The mother of the boy in O'Brien-Cass's third grade at P.S. 39, who hasn't answered 17 notes home, isn't shopping for charter schools. The family that P.S. 39's vice principal left school to help one March day because they were being evicted from the projects isn't shopping for charters. That is precisely one of the attractions of charters for motivated parents.
There are liberals who were surprised when articles began appearing about African-Americans in Democratic cities like Cleveland, Denver and Milwaukee joining Republicans to push for charters and vouchers. But parents like Tonia and Bobby Washington of Jersey City are part of a growing African-American middle class and simply want the best for their three girls. The Washingtons are no more worried about the implications of charters creaming off top students from public schools than whites were a generation ago when they moved to suburbia.
The Washingtons rarely see each other during the week. He works a day shift at the post office, and after he gets home, she leaves for the night shift at Newark Airport, servicing jets. That is the sacrifice they make for their children; they do not hire a baby sitter, partly to save money but more because they want to raise the girls themselves. Most mornings, on a few hours' sleep, Tonia walks their oldest, Sunaya, to P.S. 20, leading her in and watching her take her seat in her first-grade classroom. Afternoons, before work, she walks Sunaya home.
In February, the Washingtons put Sunaya's name on the waiting list for the Learning Community's first grade, in case a midyear opening came up. They also entered her in the lottery for next fall's second grade. It's not that the mother thinks the public schools are so bad. In fact, when her husband said, "They're not what they used to be when I----, " she interrupted: "That's not true, Bobby. They're getting better. I saw test scores in the paper." In the nine years after the state takeover, P.S. 20 went from 68 to 85 percent of eighth graders' passing the state competency test. "They're getting reading from that test," says Tonia. "The children will be up to standards. They keep taking and taking the test until they get it right." She's pleased with her daughter's progress. "She reads well; she writes very legibly. Her math skills are excellent." So why pursue a charter? "Just too many children at P.S. 20." It averages 28 in first grade. "Kids get neglected," she says.
Every week this spring, she called the charter principal, Michael Weinberg, to see if there was an opening. "I understand from Mr. Weinberg a family may be going to Florida," she said. "They keep saying the family hasn't moved yet." The Washingtons are Democrats -- "the party for the working people," says Bobby -- but vote for the Republican Mayor. "I like his ideas," he adds. "What they need is more charter schools around here."
School choice is not entirely new. in the 1970's, public schools known as magnets offered enrichment programs as an incentive to pull children from neighborhood schools. Originally, magnets were a way to improve racial balance voluntarily, but over time these schools became a place for smart educators to try new ideas. New York City's District 4, which includes East Harlem, is the best-known example of school choice relying on magnets. Still, magnet schools are ultimately controlled by a district's central office. If the Chancellor decides that New York's small magnet high schools should have larger class sizes, he can order it. A magnet is like a corporate subsidiary. A charter is like having your own business. Deborah Meier left New York to start a school in Boston because she felt the charter model offered more freedom for reform.
The best argument for choice is the schools created. At their finest, they are gems that challenge people to rethink public education. In "Miracle in East Harlem," Seymour Fliegel, a former New York City school administrator now at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, makes the point that when educators create their own school, they have a sense of ownership that energizes a whole building. Bobby Washington, the Jersey City postal worker, noticed it, too: "I walk into the public school, I see people doing a job; the charter is a mission."
Libby McDonald is an unusually creative woman, an Ivy League-educated writer and filmmaker, married to a lawyer, with a 4-year-old, Matilda, who is beginning to read and speaks Russian with her nanny and dad. In 1995, McDonald decided to start a charter. She spent months researching, took inspiration from Meier's school and on a February night invited over a few friends to discuss the idea. "Forty showed up -- that's how hungry people were," she says. Over the next two years she put in many 40- to 60-hour weeks, all voluntary, laying the groundwork. When parents needed $2,000 to advertise for a director, they held a potluck dinner. Seventy people donated much of the summer of 1997, turning part of the local Boys Club into the Learning Community school.
The first six months that the school was opened, the six teachers were absent a total of two days. In Debra Wittig's kindergarten, the 15 students spend their time in creative play. It is often noisy, but Wittig does not raise her voice. "Brandon," she says, "you may not scream in Philip's face." Wittig reads to them a lot, and they are constantly looking through books, but the education process is subtle, indirect. At one point, five girls sit in a circle taking turns holding the class rabbit for one minute each, passing it to the next person after they've counted to 60. During the spring rains, they were fascinated by worms washing out of the ground, so Wittig created a worm unit. "We had serious worm frenzy," she says. All over the room were charts of worm parts, giant papier-mache worms, worm stories written in "creative" spelling that is incomprehensible to a visitor. When I ask Wittig how many of her kindergartners read, she says, "Maybe 8 of 15."
Perhaps the most striking thing about charters is how, with smaller budgets than public districts -- they get no capital funds -- several have created schools with 15 or 16 in a class. It is the thing parents mention first. Most charters do this by paying teachers below union wage (a key reason teachers' unions are lukewarm to charters). The Learning Community charter hired young teachers for $28,000 to $30,000, while the average Jersey City public school teacher has 18 years' experience and makes $65,650.
But there is a Jersey City charter, Soaring Heights, that pays union scale -- a veteran kindergarten teacher, Joan Incognito, makes $67,800 -- and has 16 per class. "We started with those two premises," says the dean, Nancy Lomba. "Everything else we just had to make do." Part of school choice is allocating scarce resources, as a comparison between Soaring Heights (85 children in kindergarten through fourth grade) and P.S. 42 (167 in the same grades) makes clear:
P.S. 42 pays $224,000 to rent commercial space, plus $95,000 to three janitors and $23,751 for a security guard. The charter rents shared space in a church for $59,000, which includes cleaning and a buzzer security system. P.S. 42 has a teacher for gifted students ($41,700), a librarian ($75,600), three teachers' assistants (at $17,000 apiece) and an English-as- second-language teacher ($45,000). Twice a week, it has a music teacher ($34,500), art teacher ($28,000) and guidance counselor ($37,500). The charter has none of those. The charter has no playground or gym; kids play in the parking lot. It has no cafeteria; children eat at their desks. On the other hand, P.S. 42 has 31 in second grade, 25 in first and third -- while the charter limits classes to 16.
The opening of so many charters so quickly highlights how slow public systems are to adapt and how their budgeting process contributes to the lethargy. The capital budget for building a new Jersey City public school is totally separate from the operating budget. At P.S. 3, parents have been forming committees for 20 years to design a new school. The latest version calls for dividing P.S. 3 into a two-school complex with a 50-meter pool, two gyms, three ballfields, two libraries and two auditoriums -- at a cost of $40 million. When I asked Jersey City's Superintendent, Richard DiPatri, if it wouldn't be smarter to build a more modest school and use the savings to reduce class size, he says, "Parents want palaces." If P.S. 3 ever gets built (the more it costs, the less likely that is), it would in all probability become the most overcrowed palace in the city. That distinction now belongs to P.S. 17, opened in 1996 at a cost of $21 million, with the city's largest class size, an average of 30.
April 3 was the lottery for Learning Community, the "yup charter." Eighty parents had applied for 20 slots, and while the children picking numbered Ping-Pong balls from a box were cute, people were too tense to notice. When Carol Lester's number was called, she pumped her fist and gasped, "Yes!" The Washingtons' daughter, Sunaya, didn't make it, and they weren't sure what to do next year. Christel Factura's son didn't either. "We are going to find a place in the suburbs," she said.
The news was mostly bad for Charlotte Kreutz, the mother who had worked so hard to recruit kids for P.S. 16's kindergarten. Two of the five families she was counting on were sending their kids to the charter. The rest were making other plans. "It dropped to just me. I was feeling kind of isolated, a little panicky." But she was sticking to her plan, though she wouldn't know the class size till fall. She sat in on P.S 16's kindergarten and was impressed with the teacher, even with so many kids. "The kids seemed very attentive," said Kreutz. "She has a beautiful singing voice -- all of a sudden she broke into this lush soprano. The nursery school where Georgia is now, the teacher is tonedeaf."
The charter was no longer an option for Carolyn Brewington's first grader, Tre. He wasn't reading, and his behavior was worse. "He was suspended from school for two days. He and a class member were passing a knife." She asked P.S. 14's child-study team to screen him for special education. "One of the main incentives to keep Tre in public school," she said, "they give extra help."
There are great benefits for the reform of the moment, including the ability to attract new talent and money. The Clinton Administration, always quick to jump on a popular Republican idea, has been giving grants of up to $100,000 to charters to hire community outreach staffs to attract students.
But even in the glow of newness, problems have surfaced in Jersey City. Small schools are most reformers' goal, but can be fragile, held together by a few people. In December, Gateway, a small Jersey City charter, suddenly had three of its four staff members, including the principal, quit in a dispute. State officials supposedly overseeing charters were caught off guard; a monitoring team had yet to visit the school. Midyear, parents had to decide: stick it out or jump ship?
Charters are public institutions run by private groups. Will they keep themselves open to scrutiny when they have problems? I had scheduled an interview with Silvana Mazzella, a leader of ACORN, a community group granted a charter to open a school for 150 students. She stood me up and did not return dozens of phone messages. Finally, a director of another charter told me there were problems; the school would not open this year.
While there's evidence school choice can produce positive results, it's hard to say whether it's better than the many other reform efforts. New York City's District 4 (by creating an extensive magnet system) and the state effort in Jersey City (by installing state officials at the top to remake a corrupt system) have taken different routes yet seem to have produced similar results. A recent study by Paul Teske and Mark Schneider evaluating test scores in District 4 notes considerable improvement since school choice was implemented. The study concludes that District 4 is performing significantly better than other districts with similar demographics but no choice. It points out that test scores improved even at District 4's neighborhood schools.
As for Jersey City, since the state takeover, its elementary test scores have gone from the middle of the pack among the state's dozen largest, poorest districts to No. 2; 79.6 percent of Jersey City eighth graders passed the state's reading test in 1997, compared with 56 percent in 1991. And all its bottom schools, with one exception (P.S. 39), have improved scores, too. State officials have achieved this by letting principals control the hiring of teaching staff as well as giving them more say in their budgets. (Before the takeover, a crony of a former mayor, who was promoted from gym teacher to assistant superintendent, assigned teachers to schools depending on whom they'd supported in the election.) The state has added public- school pre-K classes and all-day kindergarten, and introduced Reading Recovery, a highly regarded national intensive remedial program. And when principals don't get results, they are gone. Citing the test scores and reforms, Whitman has pronounced the state takeover in Jersey City a success.
Of course, it is also possible to reach the opposite conclusion, as does Mayor Schundler, calling the takeover "a total failure." When Jersey City -- or East Harlem -- is compared with suburbs and the rest of the state, the results are abysmal. Of 455 districts in the state, Jersey City eighth graders rank 439th in reading scores. And while their test scores are climbing, everyone's have climbed since the eighth-grade test was introduced in 1991. As the market ethos has taken hold, parents and politicians have increasingly demanded school accountability, and by that they mean better test results. Schools are devoting more time teaching to the test, creating curriculums that prepare kids for the tests.
And this will intensify as charters spread. Now charters are making hay off parent concerns about test results in big cities. Soon charters will feel that heat. The Advantage school in Rocky Mount isn't a year old, and already Cheryl Ellis, an administrator, is being pressured to include prep units for North Carolina's competency test. "It makes me want to throw up," she said. "We're all being measured by the test, the test, the test."
During an interview, DiPatri, the Superintendent appointed by Whitman to run Jersey City schools, mentioned test scores right away. "Ten years ago, Jersey City was at the bottom," he said. "Now we're far above all the other big ones, except Union City." Later, when I checked old scores, I realized Jersey City never was at the bottom; depending on which big districts you used for comparison, it was in the middle of the pack, or as high as fourth at the time of takeover. After discussing this with DiPatri's executive assistant, Joanne Kenny, she said: "I agree. We like to put our own spin on it." The flip side of school choice is test spin.
Theodore Sizer, founder of the Coalition of Essential Schools, has tried to move educators away from assessment based on tests and toward more complex methods like portfolios that show a range of a child's work and creativity. He points out that test scores correlate most closely with social class: "If you look at a lot of test scores, they match family income." Indeed, after nine years of state takeover in Jersey City, with all the innovations, if you look at the test results for the 27 elementary schools, the school with the most middle-class kids, P.S. 27 (63 percent free lunches), is at the top, and the poorest school, P.S. 39 (94 percent free lunches), is at the bottom. And there is considerable correlation: the more free lunches, the lower the test scores. The exceptions are schools like P.S. 16 (84 percent free lunches) dominated by immigrants. While poor in this country, they often came from middle-class backgrounds in their homelands.
When I asked to meet a top eighth grader at P.S. 39 -- a predominantly African-American school with many second-generation welfare families -- the guidance counselor introduced me to Edward Adu Jr. Edward's family immigrated to Jersey City two years ago from Africa. He is the P.S. 39 valedictorian and the only child accepted to attend Academic High next year, Jersey City's elite high school. In Ghana, his father was a skilled mechanic, and Edward attended a private school where he took 13 subjects a day, learning English and several other languages on top of his native Twi. He knows little of America beyond P.S. 39; while he has stood on Jersey City's docks and looked across the Hudson to Manhattan's skyscrapers, he has never visited there. When asked what has surprised him about America, he says, "It seems the schools in Africa are better than here."
One night, three hours into a Jersey City school-board meeting full of squabbles, the complexity of school reform suddenly hit me smack in the ears. An angry parent was screaming at the Superintendent: "Since you came in '89, our test scores has gone nowhere! What are you planning to do, Mr. DiPatri, to bring our children's test scores up? I don't see no improvement, no improvement at all!"
The sales pitch that accompanies school choice dazzles, promising to deliver more, better, sooner, when the reality is that education is an intricate process filled with subtle challenges like how to foster curiosity. When I asked Robert Slavin of Johns Hopkins, Grover Whitehurst of Stony Brook and Courtney Cazden of Harvard whether that Rocky Mount charter really could have all its kindergartners reading, the experts answered me with questions. What did the school mean by reading? Learning the phonetic code? Comprehending words being sounded out? Basic literacy? Developing a lifelong love for books? Slavin, whose own direct-instruction reading method, "Success for All," is used in 750 schools, questioned whether it was even desirable to push all kindergartners to read. If a child's too young, he asked, will that child be frustrated and turn off?
In May, I flew to Rocky Mount to see the school where every kindergartner could read, opened last fall in a vacant J.C. Penney. Advantage had done a lovely remodeling job, painting the rooms white with muted green and purple trim. Students wore uniforms and did indeed fold their hands as they walked the halls. The school has been well received; 900 have signed up for 690 slots.
Shortly after greeting me, Joshua Solomon, Advantage's spokesman who had flown from corporate headquarters in Boston to escort me, said, "All the kindergarten kids read, you know."
Everything is taught straight from workbooks developed by the Engelmann Becker company. So while classes are large -- 30 in most grades -- they can be broken into groups taught by anyone, since all the instructor is doing anyway is reading straight from the text. In fact, 15 fifth graders in a top math group are taught by Colleen Burnham, the school receptionist. "All you have to remember," she said, "is you can't go off the script."
I mentioned to Ellis, the school's curriculum coordinator, that I had heard students were reading the "Iliad" and "Odyssey." "Actually," she says, "we didn't get to that this year." I asked if all 96 kindergartners were reading. "Actually we have six that aren't," she said. "We pull them out for extra help." Still, 90 of 96 reading sounded good.
During the morning, there is no play in kindergarten. They sit in groups for a half-hour each of reading, math and language-arts drill, and in between work independently, filling in blanks on work sheets. I've never seen such a quiet kindergarten. In math group, the teacher says: "87 minus 1 equals 86. Everyone what's the answer?" and snaps her fingers.
"87 minus 1 equals 86," they chant.
"49 minus 1 is 48. Everyone what's the answer?" snap
"48."
"Christopher, 43 minus 1, what's the answer?" snap
"88," says Christopher.
"Again, 43 minus 1 is snap 42. 43 minus 1, what's the answer Christopher?"
"42."
I asked the teacher, Christine Marsh, if she would allow a few to read to me. I'd brought my own beginning books; I wanted to know if they could read something basic they'd never seen. I requested readers from the lower groups. The first boy looked at the first line of "The Haunted House": "I am a ghostie." He couldn't even read "I." Marsh went to the second line looking for a word he would know and pointed to "the." The boy said, "T." "I'm surprised," Marsh said. "That was one of the first words we learned."
I handed the second boy "Raindrops." The first page says, "Drip, drip, drop." He couldn't read it. The teacher gave him hints about the pictures of rain falling. Finally for "Drip, drip, drop," the boy guessed, "Rain, drop. . .no, I don't know."
After many prods from the teacher, the next child, a girl, in agonizingly slow fashion, sounded out "Drip, drip, drop." After more hints on the next page -- "Rain is falling on my house" -- she got "Rain is," but could not get "falling," "my" or "house." She was a tiny girl, and it was touching to see how mightily she worked at it and how much her teacher wanted her to read.
Like kindergarten teachers all over America, at the start of this day Marsh had written on the board: "Good morning. Today is Monday. The date is May 11, 1998." I asked, if she changed "Good morning" to "Good afternoon," how many could read it. "Maybe half," she said.

HEADLINE: It Just Looks Paranoid

BYLINE: By Charles McGrath; Charles McGrath, editor of The Times Book Review, has written for the magazine about Saturday-morning television and prime-time dramas.

 BODY:
Pretend for a minute that you're an alien, sent to Earth to assess its suitability for takeover. Right away you'd notice that the black earthlings and the white earthlings tend to live apart; that they both worship particularly large earthlings in open-air stadiums and that earthlings residing outside the crowded urban centers broil sacrificial meats on little outdoor altars. Eventually you'd pick up on smaller, possibly more significant things -- Sunday evening, for example, and how in many households as the hour of 9 approaches, the eating utensils are quickly and ceremoniously cleansed and stored and the younger offspring are clothed in loose-fitting cotton garments and then made to lie dormant in darkened chambers, while the elders and the proto-elders (many of them adorned with bits of metal on their teeth) drift into their communications centers, as if in answer to the eerie whistling music now emanating from their cathode-ray scopes, and for the next 60 minutes or so remain motionless, enraptured, while contemplating images of other earthlings engaged in negotiations with. . . aliens just like you, with the same long spatulate fingers, the same greenish ichor coursing through their cooling systems! In such a case, you'd probably conclude that you had arrived too late, and that the earthlings had already been colonized.
Such a weekly visitation does in fact take place in 90-odd countries all over the globe. The force behind it is the Fox television network and the producers of "The X-Files." In five seasons, this offbeat sci-fi series has more than doubled its ratings, and is now watched by almost 20 million households (making it television's third most popular drama), not counting those who also tune in to the nightly reruns of old episodes on the FX channel. But mere television-watching isn't the half of it. As Andy Meisler, author of Volume 3 of "The Official Guide to the X-Files," one of a half-dozen or so reference books spawned by the show, has said, "You sometimes get the feeling that the actual show is just an excuse for all the other stuff." The other stuff is the stuff that cults are made of. 
 There are now more than a thousand Web sites devoted to "The X-Files," many of them emitting the ozone whiff of spaciness that pervades the show -- which is essentially about a shadowy department of the F.B.I. devoted to investigating extraterrestrials and paranormal occurrences. Among the sites are dozens specializing in "fan fiction" -- short stories that invent new plots and scenes for the show's two main characters, the F.B.I. agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder -- and even a feverish subgroup preoccupied with getting these two, whose relationship on screen is famously platonic, into bed together. There is also a Web site that collects sound files from the show that, when played backward, turn out to reveal hidden meaning. "Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?" for example, in reverse becomes: "Sky of fruit baskets with the 8-year-little-old" -- an unmistakable reference, if you go in for this sort of thing, to Mulder's younger sister, Samantha, who, in one of the show's key events, is mysteriously abducted.
The show's creators, meanwhile, have not neglected to churn out paperback novels, a series of young-adult books, CD-ROM's, posters, postcards and assorted tchotchkes. And they hope to extend the franchise still further with a feature-length film (opening later this week) that will supposedly expand on plot developments introduced in this season's last televised episode but also make perfect sense to first-time viewers -- if there are any left.
For 13 weeks this spring, the X-Files Expo, a sort of roadshow and revival meeting, wended its way across the country, drawing throngs of the faithful and, not incidentally, priming them with clips from the film in a portable, Dolby-equipped theater. The atmosphere was more than a little reminiscent of the fervor surrounding "Star Trek" and its many conventions and big-screen spinoffs, yet unlike "Star Trek," "The X-Files" has accomplished the transition to cultdom while the show itself is still being shown in prime time -- it's a cult without any apparent tinge of campiness or rerun quaintness.
Almost from the beginning, a good deal of critical ink has been spilled in an effort to account for the popularity of "The X-Files," which began simply as a chiller in the tradition of Darren McGavin's old supernatural detective story, "Kolchak: The Night Stalker." Much of the attention has centered on the so called "mythology" of "The X-Files" -- roughly a fifth of the 117 episodes so far, which constitute an intricate and ever-evolving serial tale of U.F.O.'s, alien abduction, unsavory biological experimentation and government conspiracy and cover-up at the very highest levels. The secret of "The X-Files," or so the argument goes, is that the mythology taps into the most authentically anxious parts of our post-modern Zeitgeist -- our fear of government and cancer (which are practically interchangeable), along with our ongoing fascination with the notion of extraterrestrial entities. The program's creator, Chris Carter, has said: "The show's original spirit has become kind of the spirit of the country -- if not the world. There is a growing paranoia. With the Berlin wall down, with the global nuclear threat gone, with Russia trying to be a market economy, there is a growing paranoia because, as somebody once said, there are no easy villains anymore."
For the very same reasons, however, you could make a compelling case that at no time in recent years have Americans been less paranoid, especially about their own Government. We're fearful these days not so much of political plots as of random evil -- the sort of unpredictable violence perpetrated by rogue states, by weapon-toting militias with only a handful of members, by our children even. The show touches on these threats, but only glancingly, and then to suggest that they're really manifestations of some vast meta-force.
Rather than probing our deepest fears, "The X-Files" cleverly reintroduces into our lives something like the feeling of paranoia without the content, a pleasantly creepy frisson that awakens us to all those thready webs of coincidence; they don't mean anything exactly but they're pretty cool all the same. If "The X-Files is about anything, it's really about nostalgia -- for a time (which may never have existed, really) when a belief in global conspiracy held out the promise of a universe that could be comprehended.
That the "The X-Files" culties themselves don't necessarily believe that life is one dark plot was reinforced for me when I caught up to the X-Files Expo in Miami. "Please," one visitor to the expo, a middle-aged airline pilot, said when I asked him if he believed in government conspiracies. "Just look at what's going on in Washington now. What makes you think they could get their acts together sufficiently to accomplish anything?"
This was in April, at the expo's halfway point. The publicity material had promised sites that were appropriately spooky -- airplane hangars, abandoned military bases and the like -- but the Miami expo took place in the Coconut Grove Convention Center, a windowless, nondescript hall that more often plays host to gatherings of gun and knife sellers and people taking the postal exam. For atmosphere there was a dry-ice machine pumping out fog, and a sound system loudly recycling Mark Snow's "Twilight Zone"-inspired X-Files theme song: woo woo woo woo WOO woo.
The exhibits consisted of a pretty skimpy prop museum (wardrobe items mostly: Scully's trench coat, Mulder's sleeveless sweatshirt), and a number of stations where you could have your picture taken with a camera that supplied a digitalized background, so that it looked as if you were sitting right in Mulder's basement office, say, or standing on a lonely, spooky stretch of blacktop and experiencing an interval of what the show calls "lost time." ("I'm going to use this for my Christmas card," one guy told me.)
I did encounter a couple of authentic weirdos at the Miami expo -- a man in the autograph line, for example, carrying what looked to be a fetus in a jar -- and I spoke to a University of Miami undergrad who told me he was pretty sure that all the Governments in Europe had recognized the existence of extraterrestrials. I also talked with a young man, a student at Miami Dade Community College who was wearing a Hebrew-lettered "X-Files" cap of his own design. "This is a show I can relate to," he told me "Sometimes I'll just see an episode and I'll be saying, 'That's me!' Like the episode about the cockroaches -- anybody who knows my character knows about me and cockroaches. I also see a lot of Mulder in me. I used to think maybe I wanted to be a physicist -- that was when I was watching 'MacGyver' -- but now I think I might want to join the F.B.I."
Most of the crowd -- a preponderance of high-school and college-age kids, but lots of grown-ups too -- was clean-cut and normal-seeming. As far as I could make out, the chief distinguishing characteristic of the expo attendees, the only thing setting them apart from the rest of the citizenry, was their detailed, encyclopedic knowledge of "X-Files" mythology. They were extremely curious about the black oil, for example -- that strange toxic sludge that may just be the squeezings, in effect, of the Tunguska meteorite, or may be a petroleum-based form of shape-shifting alien intelligence. And many were alert to the show's Sophoclean subtext -- the vexed question of Mulder's true parentage. (Nobody knew what to make of the faceless, speechless creatures who turned up on recent episodes, torching would-be abductees with flame throwers.)
In truth, the "X-Files" mythology, which has evolved accidentally, and partly in response to real-life exigencies (Scully's disappearance during Gillian Anderson's brief maternity leave, for example), defies mastery. Not even the show's writers fully understand it. The narrative momentum is as much backward as it is forward, continually revisiting old themes -- Samantha's disappearance, U.F.O. sightings, government experiments with tissue obtained from smallpox vaccinations -- and uncovering additional layers of duplicity. You can't even be sure any longer who's dead and who isn't. That icepick-like device that used to dispatch unwelcome aliens, causing gook to seep from behind their ears, seems in retrospect to have worked only temporarily; and the Cigarette-Smoking Man, fatally wounded a couple of months ago and exiled to a shack in Quebec, is now back in Washington, plying his evil trade.
The new movie, it is said, will tie up a great many loose threads and resolve some longstanding difficulties, but let's not hold our breath. The show's constant revisitation of its own material makes the reruns as valuable and as timely as the new programs. (It's not uncommon, in fact, for an "X-Files" episode to score higher in the ratings the second time around.) And except for Mulder, no one is really interested in getting at the heart of things anyway. The true "X-Files" conspiracy is not about who will rule the world; it's conspiracy for its own sake -- a Penelope-like web constantly unraveling and then reknitting itself -- and for the sake of making an otherwise random universe seem much more weird and interesting.
Chris Carter, who is 41 and who edited a surfing magazine before getting into television, grew up in Southern California, and among his formative experiences, he has said, were horror movies, programs like "The Twilight Zone" and "The Night Stalker" and the televised Watergate hearings. We probably could have guessed. "The X-Files" is in a way a melding of 70's politics and special effects. Carter's genius has been to show us what paranoia looks like, and it turns out to be the best-looking thing on TV. Rain-slicked blacktop, looming trees, lots of ice and fog and mist. (Until recently the show was shot in Vancouver, making use of the principle, first discovered by the producers of "Twin Peaks," that the Pacific Northwest is automatically strange and sinister-seeming.) "The X-Files" spends more on production values than do most other hourlong dramas, and spends it in particularly original and inventive ways. It's darker, shadowier and filmed from more unusual angles than most movies, let alone television shows.
Even the villains, those nameless middle-aged men who not only manipulate our Government but also in effect run the solar system from a mysterious, dark-paneled club on West 46th Street (it looks a lot like the Council on Foreign Relations, actually), are revealed as much by how they look as by what they do. The better the haberdashery (as in the case of Well-Manicured Man, as he's known), the more heinous the deeds. They all have a faintly jowly, Nixonian cast to them, come to think of it -- even the possibly well-intentioned fellow known as Deep Throat.
And it should be noted that originally, the most creepy of them all, the deeply vile Cigarette-Smoking Man, didn't speak. He didn't need to. The sight of him taking a drag on one of his ever-present Morley's, inhaling so deeply that his eyes squinted, and then letting the smoke leak from the corner of his mouth in snaky gray-blue tendrils, was proof enough of his cancerous soul. He lit up for the first time, we discovered last year, in a self-congratulatory moment after successfully engineering the assassination of J.F.K. (He was also, not surprisingly, behind the death of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rodney King riots.) And after kicking the habit for a while, he went back to the weed when his attempt at making a legitimate go as a freelance writer, under the nom de plume Raul Bloodworth, predictably came to naught.
What "The X-Files" really demonstrates, you might say, is what the world would be like if global politics were more like office politics, where the bad guys are always the suits, and if the cosmic set designer had been the sort of person who watched a lot of 70's TV and read a lot of Whitley Strieber. It's a darkly beautiful world, lighted by periodic explosions and fireballs, where even the bees and the trees and the ground underfoot may be less than benign, and it's a world that seems to fairly thrum with energy, however unearthly, and possibility.
For all its hipness, though, "The X-Files" also has an old-fashioned noirish quality. The gadgets are far from cutting-edge, and the sci-fi elements -- flying saucers, poltergeists, giant sewer-dwelling worms and the like -- are the stuff of drive-in movies. The show transports us out of our confused post-cold-war era to a time when the various ills of the world come from somewhere else, and are so large and so pervasive and so vague that they defy understanding. In this mythic realm, conspiracies and government evil-doing become not the object of outrage, except among a chosen few, but merely a fact of life, no more alterable than the weather.
If the world of "The X-Files," with its all-encompassing conspiracies, is strangely comforting, it is also enervating. Many of the people you encounter literally have no wills of their own. They respond robotically to signals received by mysterious bits of metal implanted in their necks. Others are animated not by passion, for the most part, but simply by power or the quest for knowledge. Scully and Mulder aren't just cool; they tend to operate at a lower emotional temperature than any characters I can remember, either on television or in movies and books.
It's not simply, as has so often been noted, that they have shown no sexual interest in each other (except in an episode last season when Eddie Van Blundht, a geeky janitor who had an extra layer of dermis and could change his appearance at will, turned himself into a Mulder duplicate and, after plying Scully with a bottle of wine, succeeded in awakening her interest: "I really feel like I'm seeing a different side of you tonight!" Scully said). Scully and Mulder don't seem lastingly keen on anyone else either (though Mulder, we gather, does have a fairly serious interest in pornography), and their relations with everyone tend to be almost clinically flat and empty of affect.
Mulder is practically a zombie (Scully has lately, in response to a cancer scare, manifested an occasional semblance of an inner life), and he leaves us with the uncomfortable feeling that this is the price that being a believer exacts. It's a little like becoming an artist -- you have to give up everything else. Think of the sexless, pasty-skinned Lone Gunmen, the obsessive conspiracy theorists who turn up occasionally to furnish Mulder with a crucial bit of microfilm: they seldom go out except at night.
This theme of loneliness and disconnection may be the hidden message of "The X-Files," in fact -- the show's real secret: that true belief, of whatever sort, requires too much self-surrender, and chances are that any belief will be mistaken anyway. (The alien-cover-up story, the script reminds us from time to time, may itself be a cover-up -- a hoax designed to distract us from what is really going on.) The truth is not, as Mulder would have it, "out there," but rather right here, on our television screens. "The X-Files" has taught us that it's more entertaining, and probably more epistemologically sound, to believe in everything and in nothing at all.

HEADLINE: Strategies From Engineering Design Firm

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
OIL and water may not mix, but mixing oil and chemicals can be advantageous. Thirty-three years ago, Peter H. Spitz, a chemical engineer, recognizing that petroleum companies could benefit by integrating with chemical companies, assembled a handful of chemical engineers and founded a company in Manhattan called Chem Systems, an engineering design firm, based on technical, economic and commercial industry expertise, which offered a range of services to companies in the chemical and petroleum industries that were eager to improve their business positions.
"It was a very original concept at the time, but vertical integration of companies like Exxon into the chemical industry was logical, an advantage for the petroleum companies, who were already producing the raw material," Kenneth M. Stern, a managing director of Chem Systems, said. 
 Today, Chem Systems, now based in Tarrytown, employs 90 consultants who are chemical engineers with advanced chemical engineering and business degrees. The company, considered a leader in its field, has a total of 160 employees in offices in Tarrytown, London, Tokyo and Bangkok.
"Our clients range from global major companies contemplating entry into new market regions to developing countries wanting to turn a profit with their natural resources," Mr. Stern said. "Our assignments range from a single product analysis to extensive strategy and feasibility studies that can occupy three to five consultants working every day for months. For example, when Exxon wanted to transform raw materials into a product -- polyethylene -- they called on us to evaluate the available technology and advise which was the best for them. We were also asked to evaluate the market. Was there a market for their product? What price would people pay for it? We show clients how to get into a market or how to get out of a market. This is accomplished with third-party objectivity."
Chem Systems assignments, lasting from weeks to months, are carried out for clients all over the world. "Our consultants travel a great deal," Mr. Stern said. "Currently, we're on assignments in Tokyo, Saudi Arabia and Canada." He added that the company's fees range from $10,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars. On April 1, Chem Systems took another profitable step forward: it was acquired by International Business Machines.
"I.B.M. is a great fit for us," Mr. Stern said. "In I.B.M. we have a partner that understands the challenges chemical producers and petroleum refiners are facing and is creating innovative information technology solutions to solve them. Our clients have been very positive about the acquisition and realize that it will benefit them."
Mr. Spitz, who serves as a Chem Systems director of strategy and financial practices, said: "The merger of our firm into I.B.M.'s consulting operations is a very logical step at this point of our development. Our growth in consulting revenues will now increasingly come from helping clients around the world to use information technology in order to become as efficient as possible when faced with growing competition."
The new name of Chem Systems is Chem Systems, an I.B.M. Company, and it is functioning as part of I.B.M. Global Service Consulting Group.
Mr. Stern said that the Chem Systems staff remains intact. "We have 80 people in Tarrytown, 45 consultants and 35 support staff, and we're in our same offices," he said. "The only change is that a couple of I.B.M. consultants have moved in with us. As for the reactions of our employees, they're all very upbeat and see the acquisition as a positive move, which will give our company broader opportunities. The combination of our industry knowledge with I.B.M.'s global reach, research and development and information technology skills has created a unique resource for chemical and petroleum companies that not only want to survive change but thrive on it."
I.B.M., based in Armonk, formed the Consulting Group about five years ago to help companies manage change and use information technology to create a competitive advantage. The group's specialties include business transformation and technology consulting, and it is one of the fastest-growing consulting organizations in the world.
"We wanted to expand our chemical and petroleum industry expertise," said Edward R. Kornberger, director of chemicals consulting at I.B.M.'s process and petroleum industry consulting group. . "Chem Systems is a leader in chemical industry consulting. Our acquisition brings together two companies with complementary capabilities. Chem Systems will operate as part of I.B.M. Global Services Consulting Group and will support the I.B.M. process and petroleum industry solutions team in helping chemical and petroleum industry clients change for competitive advantage."
I.B.M.'s worldwide search for the right chemical and petroleum consulting partner took 12 months. "We were looking for a company known for strategic planning and process technology," Mr. Kornberger said. "Combined with our information technology and implementation services, we have the ability to come up with creative solutions to clients' problems. We scoured the world for the right company. Finally, Eric Leone in London, who is vice president of our global consulting business, recommended Chem Systems, a company right in our own backyard."
With 5,000 consultants worldwide, I.B.M. Global Services Consulting Group develops solutions to complex business problems, helps companies manage change and enables corporations to realize a competitive advantage through the innovative use of information technology, said Mr. Kornberger, who added that the companies' skills and offerings complement each other well.
"We don't intend to change Chem Systems except to provide the means to grow its services and its geographic reach," Mr. Kornberger said. "Chem Systems will keep its separate identity."
As for Chem Systems, I.B.M. was not the privately held company's first suitor. "As the leader in chemical industry consulting, we have had a number of other large companies approach us," Mr. Stern said. "We turned them down because we had the sense Chem Systems would have disappeared into some organization as a back-room operation. I.B.M. has assured us from the beginning that we would retain our autonomy."
Mr. Stern also said that the growth of I.B.M.'s Consulting Group was a factor in Chem Systems' decision.
"It is one of the fastest-growing consulting organizations in the world, doing $800 million last year," he said. "It's a very aggressive company that already occupies a unique position in our industry, which bodes well for the future."

HEADLINE: FILM;
An Unrepentant Leftist Moves Back Into Sight

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
SURPRISINGLY perhaps, given his distaste for the prevailing social order, Ken Loach was never an angry young man. Shy and soft-spoken, he was almost 30 by the time he set off down the path that three decades later earned him recognition in Europe as the dean of leftist movie makers. Until then, he simply personified the new social mobility of postwar Britain: born of a "working-class Tory" father, he did his military service in the Royal Air Force, studied law at Oxford University, tried his hand at acting and then joined the BBC as a television director.
Yet at the BBC, he turned radical, making his name in 1966 with a television docudrama called "Cathy Come Home," which for the first time denounced homelessness in Britain. And well into the 1970's, in the tradition of Italian neo-realists like Vittorio De Sica, Mr. Loach continued to make television and feature films with strong social content. Then, in 1979, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher started her conservative revolution, and financing evaporated for his kind of socialist realism. 
 "If the British movie industry at the time had any perception of what I did, it was that I made films in an impenetrable dialect, driven by a kind of hard-line Marxist view, which no one would want to see," Mr. Loach, 61, recalled in a recent interview over coffee at a bookstore in central London, "and, if they did want to see them, they wouldn't understand them anyway."
By the late 1980's, however, the pendulum had begun to swing away from Thatcherism. Britain had changed: it was no longer a nation with an economy dominated by Government-owned industries and powerful trade unions, and awareness of the social cost of factory and mine closings was growing. Suddenly, thanks to backing from Britain's Channel Four Films, Mr. Loach was able to work again. Starting in 1990 with "Hidden Agenda," set in troubled Northern Ireland, he demonstrated with a series of small-budget movies that he was just as energetic and politically committed as he had ever been. For some in Britain, his ideological drumbeating seemed antiquated, but he was unfazed.
"Carla's Song," which was made in 1996 and opens in New York on June 26, is the fifth movie of his comeback. The others are "Riff-Raff" (1991), about union-busting in the construction industry; "Raining Stones" (1993), about a grim housing project in Manchester; "Ladybird, Ladybird" (1994), about a distraught single mother of four, and "Land and Freedom" (1995), about the Spanish Civil War. "My Name Is Joe," which was finished recently and has no release date in the United States yet, was well received at the Cannes International Film Festival last month, with Peter Mullan winning the best actor's award for his role as a reformed alcoholic struggling to rebuild his life in a rundown Glasgow neighborhood.
"Carla's Song," though, is unusual in that Mr. Loach takes his story outside Britain. He did this once before, in "Land and Freedom," which follows a young Englishman who volunteers to fight against Franco's forces in the late 1930's. But in "Carla's Song" he has tackled an international conflict that until recently at least was highly topical: the war that pitted the United States-backed contras against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista Government during much of the 1980's.
Set in 1987, the film starts in Glasgow. George, a bus driver played by Robert Carlyle ("Trainspotting," "The Full Monty") meets and is smitten with Carla (Oyanka Cabezas), a young Sandinista exile who dances on sidewalks to make ends meet. He offers to help her, but Carla is hesitant, only slowly revealing her pain at fleeing Nicaragua's war and at abandoning a badly wounded boyfriend. George tries to distract her, taking her for a drive around Loch Lomond in his double-decker bus. But eventually he concludes that she has to return home and that he will go with her.
In Nicaragua, speaking nothing but English with a strong Glaswegian accent, George feels he has arrived on a different planet. But through Carla he meets peasants who boast of the Sandinistas' land-distribution program, and he learns that the United States is trying to crush the revolution. He is also caught in a contra attack on a Sandinista village and wonders just what he is doing there: he has followed a woman and found himself in a war.
"We didn't want the usual device of the fearless reporter or the person who goes there with the aim of discovery," Mr. Loach explained. "The point was to take a guy who is a humorous, thoughtful guy but who doesn't even know where Nicaragua is. We wanted a person drawn in against his wishes."
The idea for the film came from Paul Laverty, 41, a Glasgow lawyer who did human-rights work in Nicaragua in the mid-1980's and who in 1992 sent Mr. Loach a movie treatment out of the blue. The director encouraged Mr. Laverty to try his hand at screenwriting, and after three years of writing and rewriting, the script for "Carla's Song" was completed. (Mr. Laverty also wrote "My Name Is Joe.") Of course, by the time the Nicaraguan section of the film was shot, early in 1996, the fighting was long over and the Sandinistas had been voted out of office. But Mr. Loach was soon persuaded that the United States had been the guilty party in the war.
"My judgment in the end was that if the Americans had not intervened," he said, "a lot of things that went wrong with the Sandinistas would not have gone wrong because it came out of their inevitable inability to keep the revolution afloat."
Mr. Carlyle, who has been a great admirer of Mr. Loach's political engagement since they worked together on "Riff-Raff," said that like his character in "Carla's Song," he had experienced deep culture shock arriving in Nicaragua.
"In no way can you be prepared for that kind of third-world poverty," he said. "It affected me profoundly. A lot of people who know me well said it changed me. It made me see things differently."
That is the kind of reaction that Mr. Loach seeks among his audiences. He harbors no illusions that his films can change the world, but he believes that an alternative voice should be raised. "I think all you can do is to put your shoulder to the wheel of the people you are supporting," he said, "to add whatever little weight you have to that side, though it's not very much."
In Britain, Mr. Loach was until recently a member of the Labor Party, although he frequently complained that the party was untrue to its working-class roots and leftist ideals. In "Questions of Leadership," a four-part television documentary in the early 1980's, he even denounced the trade-union movement for not standing up to Thatcherism. But that film was never seen: the union leadership said it was defamatory, and Channel Four refused to broadcast it. Finally, in the early 1990's, Mr. Loach resigned from the Labor Party, and for last year's general elections he made a television commercial for the tiny Socialist Labor Party, headed by Arthur Scargill, who led the coal miners' strike broken by Mrs. Thatcher 15 years ago.
KEN is incredibly passionate about his beliefs," Mr. Laverty, 41, said. "You meet him and you see this gentle, mild-mannered man, but that's only half of him. He has a very strong backbone; he's very courageous. Who else would have dared make a film about Northern Ireland back in 1990?"
David Aukin, who helped finance many of Mr. Loach's recent films as head of Channel Four Films, said that the director was showing "more warmth and sensuality" than he did 20 years ago but that today's generation of British movie makers still viewed him as uncompromisingly political. "The new directors are above all determined to find audiences, which has led them to be somewhat dismissive of Ken," said Mr. Aukin, who is now joint chief executive of HAL Films, a Miramax-backed British production company. "They see that the old generation failed to engage audiences here."
Yet for all the open expression of his political views, including his disaffection for Tony Blair's Labor Government, Mr. Loach still prefers not to describe his movies as political.
"To be a bit perverse," he said with a soft smile, "the Americans have no trouble sending us right-wing films because right-wing films are seen as mainstream films. But if you make a film with a different perspective, the word 'political' is used to denote it. So I slightly object to the use of 'political' to describe left-wing films when, with right-wing films, no one uses that term, which is a bit of a switch-off."
But if this sort of pigeonholing is a problem in Britain and the United States, it is Mr. Loach's willingness to take political risks in his movies that has given him a loyal following in Europe. The film festivals at Cannes, Berlin and Venice, for example, routinely compete for his movies, which invariably pick up one prize or another. At Cannes this spring, "My Name Is Joe" was featured in prominent articles in several magazines and newspapers, and Mr. Loach was extensively interviewed on the primary French Government-owned television channel, France 2. In Britain, his new film was mentioned just in passing.
"The idea that you would go to the cinema to explore the issues we try to explore is fairly alien to audiences here in Britain," he said with resignation. "Our view of cinema has always been narrow, and it's getting narrower. But the European tradition is broader. They're still willing to see cinema as an important medium rather than just as entertainment."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Scotch Plains, N.J.;
A Town That Harkens to Simpler Times

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
THE three-block downtown of this community, along Park Avenue and Front and East Second Streets, seems to reach back to simpler times. Its 75 businesses include half a dozen antiques stores, two hobby shops, gift shops, a model-train store, a comic-book store, two shoe-repair shops, a doll hospital and a silversmith. Nearly all are housed in small 19th-century structures.
On Park Avenue and Front Streets, at one end of the downtown, is the Stage House Inn, which has been the town anchor since 1737 when it became a tavern and a stop on the Swift-Sure Stage Line from New York to Philadelphia. Among its early patrons was the Marquis de Lafayette. 
 The building, the oldest section of which was constructed in 1682, is now a French restaurant and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
"Our downtown is stressing smallness and quaintness," explained Raymond Pardon, who owns a nut store and is president of the Scotch Plains Business & Professional Association.
According to Mayor Joan Papen, the township government and the association are cooperating on a plan to enhance the business district. It includes building a fourth municipal parking lot to supplement the three lots along Park Avenue.
A gazebo, which will serve as a town bandstand, has just been completed on the town green near the Town Hall on Park Avenue and new signs have gone up encouraging visitors to the downtown to "enjoy the hometown feeling."
David F. Drake, the proprietor and chef at the Stage House Inn, said he felt the new development plans were missing the mark. He would like to see the Town Hall moved from Park Avenue to allow expansion of the business district.
"If you want the downtown to prosper," he said, "you have to increase foot traffic. That means you need more stores."
Settled in 1684 by Scottish immigrants, who dissented from the teachings of the Church of England, the area was originally named Scots Plain, after George Scot, the group leader.
The most significant historical event to take place in the township was the Battle of the Short Hills on June 26-27, 1777. The British Gen. William Howe, frustrated by the Continentals' guerrilla attacks on his troops, sought to lure George Washington's 8,000-man force out of the Watchung Mountains, which overlook Scotch Plains.
Howe moved his 12,000 troops from the New Brunswick area to Perth Amboy, feigning an evacuation to Staten Island. Rather than boarding ferries, the British and Hessian soldiers wheeled back toward Scotch Plains, only to be detected by Continental scouts. During the two days of fighting, the rebels suffered more than 200 dead or wounded and 64 captured. The British side lost about 70 soldiers and had 11 captured, but it was turned back.
There are about 100 historic structures in Scotch Plains, 35 of which are on the National Register of Historic Places, with 20 predating the Revolutionary War. There are also several homes with tunnels underneath, where runaway slaves were hidden before the Civil War. But most of the houses in Scotch Plains were built after 1930.
Detached homes make up about 75 percent of the town's 8,000 dwellings. They range in price from about $150,000 for a small prewar colonial or postwar Cape Cod near the business district, up to about $950,000 for some custom colonials on 1.5 or more acres in the southwestern section. Last year, one palatial, six-bedroom house with a five-car garage and five fireplaces in the southern section of town sold for $1.3 million.
Ruth Tate, a sales associate with the Coldwell Banker real estate agency in neighboring Westfield, said that lately she had been receiving multiple bids on houses just days after they hit the market.
AS evidence that Scotch Plains is in a seller's market, Mrs. Tate pointed out a four-bedroom colonial on Oxford Road that sold for $285,000 in 1993 and was resold in April 1998 for $345,000. Another home, a split level on Shawnee Path, went for $216,000 a year ago and is currently on the market for $259,900.
There are half a dozen condominium developments, with a total of about 600 units. The largest and most expensive is the 294-unit gated town-house condominium community of Southwyck Village in the southern section. Depending on location and condition, the units, all of which have three bedrooms, go for between $155,000 and $200,000, according to Mrs. Tate.
At the lower-priced end of the condominium scale are the two-bedroom apartments in the 28-unit King James Court on Front Street, which sell for between $130,000 and $150,000.
The township has just over 1,000 rental units in seven complexes. The largest is the 320-unit Lamberts Mill Village, where one-bedroom units rent for $920, two-bedrooms for $1,150 and three-bedrooms for $1,210.
Among the newer residents are Brian M. Greenberg, 28, and his wife, Sherry A., 29, who purchased a 30-year-old, five-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath split level on the southern side of town and moved in a year ago from Manhattan. Mrs. Greenberg is a clinical assistant professor of nursing at New York University and Mr. Greenberg is a computer consultant based in Manhattan.
"We wanted an easy commute to the city and didn't want a starter house," Mrs. Greenberg explained. "We looked closer to Manhattan and found that the houses in our price range were small."
Although they have no children yet, the Greenbergs said they wanted a town with a good school system. They also like the fact that Scotch Plains has a compact business district.
"Right now, we are not asking much from the town because of our work schedules," Mr. Greenberg explained. "But when we have children, we will. So far, we've found Scotch Plains to be friendly. We have many neighbors in their early 30's."
Scotch Plains and the neighboring Borough of Fanwood share the 4,300-student Scotch Plains-Fanwood Public Schools system. It consists of five elementary schools, two middle schools and the 1,050-student Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School.
The system is headed by Superintendent Carol B. Choye, who was named Superintendent of the Year for 1997 by the New Jersey Association of School Administrators. She was awarded a $1,000 United States Savings Bond, which she said she would give one of the graduating seniors as a college scholarship.
Over the past five years, the system has grown by more than 400 students, due mainly to the construction of about 400 new homes and the turnover of existing homes by empty-nesters to young families. This has led the school system to add modular classrooms to three of the five elementary schools. According to Dr. Choye, 4,350 students are enrolled for the school year starting in September, reflecting a growth of 50 students.
OF last year's 262 graduating seniors, 90 percent went on to higher education. Their combined average verbal and math scores on the S.A.T. was 1060, compared with a state average of 1005, with one Scotch Plains student scoring a perfect 1600.
The class was awarded a total of $1.6 million in scholarships. The high school offers 11 advanced placement courses in English, math, foreign languages, the sciences and economics.
Besides its public schools, Scotch Plains has two co-ed Roman Catholic parochial schools -- the Union Catholic High School and the k-8 St. Bartholomew Elementary School. Annual Union Catholic tuition is $5,256 a child, with a $500 discount for each additional child. St. Bartholomew's tuition for parishioners ranges from $1,825 to $3,730 for one to three children; for nonparishioners it is a flat $2,625 per child.
The community also has a very active Y.M.C.A. and is home to the Jewish Community Center of Northern New Jersey.
Scotch Plains has nine municipal parks, the largest of which are the 29-acre Brookside Park off Hetfield Avenue and the 29-acre Scotch Hills Country Club off Jerusalem Road. Brookside, which was recently remodeled, has a pond, a roller hockey rink, a basketball court and a softball diamond. The annual membership fee at the country club, which has a nine-hole golf course, is $25; the greens fee is $7.
The town is also home to the county-owned Ashbrook Country Club and the private Shackamaxon Country Club, both of which have 18-hole courses.
There are no supermarkets in town. Most residents do their grocery shopping in neighboring Westfield, Watchung or Fanwood and their serious shopping at the Short Hills Mall seven miles away.

Asking Rents for Midtown Office Space Keep Rising

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
DEMAND for office space in midtown Manhattan has driven the average annual rental rate to over $40 a square foot for the first time this decade, according to figures compiled by Newmark & Company Real Estate. The average asking rental per square foot rose from $37.99 at the end of last year to $40.25 at the end of March, for an increase in the quarter of 5.92 percent.
Other real estate companies have different ways of measuring the market, but all agree on the direction: up. 
 "Transactions with rents in the 50's are no longer rare," said Franklin C. Speyer, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield. "The economy is good, and there is no lack of tenants willing to pay to stay in New York."
Indeed, officials of Julien J. Studley, a tenants' broker, report that there are at least 15 buildings in midtown where the asking annual rent is over $60 a square foot. Other parts of the city have seen rental rates rise as well, but not to the levels seen in midtown.
Mr. Speyer said that financial services companies, fueled by the booming stock market, were leading the expansion in the use of office space, but added that entertainment, advertising, insurance and other service companies were also contributing to the demand.
In all, an estimated 120,000 jobs have been added in the city since 1993, a period of no new building.
"We have just emerged from the longest period of no new building since World War II," said David W. Levinson, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG. "Building stopped in 1990, and the Durst building won't open until next year," he said, referring to 4 Times Square, the 49-story tower now being built on Broadway between 42d and 43d Streets by the Durst Organization.
"That is an extraordinary period of no new supply," he said.
Nor is there likely to be much added, at least in Manhattan, he said. Although three more buildings probably will be built in the Times Square area, the Reuters news agency will occupy most of one -- 3 Times Square, across from the Durst building -- and together they are not expected to have a big impact on the market.
"There are 200 million square feet of space in midtown," Mr. Levinson said. "The most you can add is five percent. Midtown is already built." Midtown is generally defined as the area south of 57th Street to the mid 30's, river to river.
The result, most brokers say, is that the market has tipped decisively in favor of landlords. Not only are asking rents going up, but concessions, notably periods of free rent and allowances for building tenants' offices, are shrinking rapidly as well.
"There is no new space, so the price is going up," said Robert Emden, an executive managing director at Grubb & Ellis. "Buildings that were in the mid-40's this time last year were at $50 by the end of the year. Now the market is being tested again, and the $60 barrier is being broken."
Mr. Emden said that with a robust economy, most companies were more interested in generating more business than in containing costs, although at least one law firm, which he did not identify, is considering putting two associates in each office to conserve space.
"The current market is making it very tough on our clients," said Richard Podos, vice president of Equis New York, a tenants' broker. Mr. Podos said that concessions today were even lower than at the last peak, in 1988. At that time, free rent and work allowances amounted to about 20 percent of the total value of a lease, he said. That rose to as much as 35 percent at the bottom of the office market about five years ago.
TODAY, he said, concessions are only about 10 to 15 percent of the value of a lease. "It's going to get a lot crazier before this bull market runs out," he said.
Mr. Levinson of Insignia/ESG said that some companies were trying to hedge against future price increases by leasing space now in anticipation of future growth. "We have clients who are taking space they don't expect to need until five years from now," he said. "They are going to the trouble of putting in subtenants to protect themselves. That only happens in this kind of an environment."
Many real estate executives warn that a continuing increase in the cost of office space will drive companies to New Jersey and Westchester County, where some speculative building is already under way or planned. And the executives caution that landlords who push for the last penny and adopt arrogant negotiating tactics at the top of the market can expect little sympathy from tenants when the inevitable downturn arrives.
"I find it troubling to be in a market where you can have a handshake on a deal at $40 before lunch, and then the owner goes to lunch, talks to his friends or employees, and comes back and announces that the price is $45," said Mitchell Steir, an executive vice president of the Julien J. Studley company. "This increase in prices will not go on forever. We are in something of a frenzied window now, but people are going to realize that space in Westchester is half the price of Manhattan and they will start to move out."
Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, agrees that the sky is not the limit for landlords. "Rents this year will not increase as much as they did last year," he said. "We're almost to the point where new construction is justified and we will see building in New Jersey and Stamford as long as the financial markets stay strong."
Tenants are not completely without leverage in negotiations with landlords, particularly in renewal leases for space already occupied, said James S. Meiskin, president of Plymouth Partners, a tenants' broker. This is because there is a substantial cost in bringing in a new tenant.
"The owner will have to spend $5 a foot to demolish the space and another $35 to rebuild," he said. "There will be down time, and commissions to be paid. In all, it will probably cost an owner $60 to $70 a foot to bring in a new tenant."
He said that tenants should begin renewal talks with their landlords several years before their leases expire so they can take advantage of the owner's wish to save the expense of finding and installing a new tenant.
And, of course, not all tenants are created equal. Owners want tenants with a strong financial base -- known in the trade as credit tenants -- who will be able to keep up their rent payments even if the economy goes sour.
Such tenants will be able to drive better deals than such service providers as law firms and advertising agencies, which have little in the way of assets and have suffered in past slumps.
During the last boom, midtown south, generally the area south of the mid 30's toto Canal Street, served as a safety valve for midtown, with old loft buildings converted to offices.
That area is largely filled, but there is some speculation that development may shift to the west side of Manhattan, in the 30's. Vornado Realty Trust, for example, has invested heavily in the area around Penn Station.
THAT may occur, but for most tenants that kind of an address is not acceptable, said Andrew Roos, executive vice president of Williams Real Estate. "Most tenants are going to pay a few bucks more to stay where they are, rather than move to a fringe area," he said.
Referring to two of the most discussed ideas of recent years, having employees operate without permanent office space or work from home, Mr. Roos added, "You don't hear much about hoteling and work at home any more. Corporations have found there is a synergy in keeping all their people under one roof."
Many real estate executives agree that the current demand for office space is ultimately driven by the stock market. Not only does the boom in stock values make people feel wealthier, it puts executives in a state of mind that expanding their business is more important than squeezing expenses.
"Interest rates are low and the economy is good, so the mood is expansive," Mr. Emden observed.
But if the stock market were to drop sharply in value, that attitude could be reversed very quickly.
"If the market goes down 3,000 points, all this comes to a halt," Mr. Speyer said. "When the stock market dropped in October 1987, we felt it the next day, even though it took six to seven years to completely play out."

Housing Developers Look Inland From Riverfront

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WHILE housing is sprouting like wildflowers along the Hudson River coastline, it is also taking shape on interior streets in some waterfront communities.
Much of the off-the-river activity is occurring in Hoboken, but projects totaling 1,000 residential units are, or soon will be, going up in Jersey City and Edgewater. Most of the inland projects, like those on the river's edge, involve upscale rentals, which generally are leasing for 10 to 15 percent less than their waterfront counterparts. A few involve condominium apartments and lofts. 
 With much of the waterfront in these communities spoken for, though not necessarily being developed, builders are moving inland in an effort to capitalize on what they say is an increasing demand for housing in these old port towns.
The inland activity is benefiting from a ripple effect from a tight housing market in Manhattan as well as along the Hudson's west bank, where the rental vacancy rate is virtually zero, according to Marketing Directors, a marketing and consulting firm in Manhattan.
Since there is "no massive amount of product" coming onto the riverfront at one time, demand is ahead of supply, said Carol M. Smith, the company's director of marketing. Off-the-river projects, she added, "can get away without water views" if they compensate on price and are close to other amenities, like transit links.
In Hoboken, 933 residences have been completed inland in the last three years or are now under construction and an additional 1,203 have been approved or are proposed, city figures show. Though 2,500 riverside units were approved in that same period, just 196 rentals are under way on the northern end of the waterfront as part of a project called the Shipyard, which eventually will contain 1,160 units.
Developers have focused on the southwestern portion of the city, putting up housing where vacant lots or older residential and commercial buildings once stood. That area, like the riverfront, missed out on the 80's construction surge.
For Brownstone Communities, with offices in Hoboken and Millburn, the area is ripe for the kind of urban infill housing the company builds -- town house and loft-style condominiums. The company is involved in four such projects, totaling up to 130 residences. As its name implies the houses are being designed to recall the brownstones for which Hoboken is known. Dean Marchetto of Hoboken is the architect.
"Hoboken is the most vibrant waterfront community with an established residential core," said Brian M. Stolar, a company principal. "So rather than be an extension of the riverfront we decided to create new neighborhoods."
This week the company is expected to start its newest project -- 14 condominium apartments in seven two-family homes and four loft units in an eighth structure that can be divided into as many as eight units. The loft structure will stand at the corner of First and Madison Streets and the others will extend along either street. Each two-family structure has two garages; the loft building has four parking spaces.
Prices will range from $273,000 to $420,000 for the condominium apartments, with 1,500 to 3,000 square feet of space; and from $170,000 to $479,000 for finished lofts with 850 to 2,300 square feet, which is a full floor.
"We are appealing to professional couples who want or need to be closer to their jobs," said George Vallone, another company principal.
Nearby, work will start this summer on a 301-unit, two-building rental complex called Century Towers. It will rise on nearly an entire city block along Observer Highway, between Park Avenue and Garden Street; the block is now occupied by surface parking, an old truck garage and vacant lots. The project will provide underground parking for 469 cars and a 12,000-square-foot corner park.
"The rental market is strong all over Hoboken," said Richard Miller, a principal of the Pegasus Group L.L.C. of Hoboken, the developer. "And being three blocks from PATH will be an advantage."
Monthly rents for the studio to three-bedroom apartments, with 550 to 1,250 square feet of space, will be $1,250 to $2,800, he said.
THE activity is spreading into the northwestern sector of Hoboken, which, like its waterfront, once was a thriving industrial hub. Last month city officials rezoned the area to mostly residential, as well as retail uses, said Robert K. Drasheff, director of Hoboken's Department of Human Resources, which oversees community and waterfront development.
"The city, which has tried since 1985 to bring industry back to the area, decided to promote what it does best -- residential construction," Mr. Drasheff said. These properties now will be brought back on the tax rolls, helping to expand the city' s tax base, he added. One project proceeding in the area is the Curling Club, which will have 240 two-bedroom rentals in four buildings along Grand Street between 11th and 12th Streets. It replaces the Ferguson Propeller Works, which manufactured propellers for ships. The developer is the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, whose principals are Charles Kushner and his brother, Murray.
"Because the waterfront is so hot the peripheral areas of Hoboken are growing," said Charles Kushner. "They are no longer off the beaten track."
Rents for the units, averaging 1,050 square feet, will start at $1,800 a month. The project, which will have underground parking for 225 cars and a health club, will be completed by the end of 1999.
In Jersey City the focus of luxury residential development is still the waterfront because there is enough vacant land left to develop and it is where the city's high-rise zoning is in place, said Robert Cotter, the city's planning director. So far about 4,200 of the planned 15,000 riverfront units have been or are being constructed.
Still, a few developers have ventured off the river. Four blocks inland, for instance, developers plan to transform a parking lot at the corner of Montgomery and Warren Streets into a 220-unit rental, called the Siena, with a 340-car parking garage. Construction will start in September on the 23-story building, which will also have 20,000 square feet of ground-level stores.
The developer is a joint venture between Panepinto Properties of Jersey City and the Applied Companies of Hoboken. Applied has long been active along the shoreline and is involved either alone or with partners in three riverfront projects, including the Shipyard in Hoboken.
"With the market so strong we see an opportunity to capture the spillover in select inland pockets, which, while not as sexy as riverfront sites, can do well if the right product is offered," said David B. Barry, a vice president at Applied.
Mr. Barry said the site was between two PATH stations and close to Newark Avenue, a major retail strip that is now being upgraded. Rents for the studio to three-bedroom units, with 540 to 1,700 square feet of space, will range from $1,050 to $2,300 a month.
Mr. Cotter, the planning director, said that four-story buildings along two blocks of Newark Avenue between Erie and Grove Streets, whose upper three floors were once used as warehouses, were being renovated. The ground level will remain as retail space, but the upper floors will provide up to 50 apartments.
Stuart Z. Kopperweiss, president of the private, nonprofit Jersey City Economic Development Authority, said that the city upgrades the exteriors at no cost to the owners and provides low-interest loans of up to 30 percent of the cost of interior renovations.
He said that the "slightly more than $1 million" cost of the facade renovations would be borne by sales-tax revenues from the city's Urban Enterprise Zone.
In Edgewater, development is filtering to the west side of River Road, which divides this pencil-shaped community and parallels the river. Construction will start there next month on a four-building, 24-unit rental complex that is to replace a row of empty apartment buildings. The developer is Daibes Brothers, a local concern that, alone or with partners, is also involved in many of Edgewater's riverfront projects, totaling about 1,000 rental apartments.
"There is no question that the market is pushing development off the river," said Fred A. Daibes, who runs the company with his brother, Joseph. "Recyling old residential sites was just a matter of time because they are more valuable now as vacant land."
Rents for the one bedroom apartments, with 650 to 850 square feet, will be $1,400 to $1,700 a month, said Mr. Daibes.
The company also plans to redevelop the now empty Alcoa plant site one block from the river into a rental complex with 410 to 460 apartments.

Towns Implementing Ridge Development Limits

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
TRAVELING along Interstate 91, some motorists tend to slow down as they gaze at the 44 mountains that pass through 30 communities along the central corridor of Connecticut from the Massachusetts border almost to Long Island Sound.
In a symbolic gesture to cooperate in the preservation of these mountains, called the Trap Rock Ridges, 17 towns in their path signed an agreement called the Metacomet Ridge Conservation Compact last April 22, Earth Day. 
 Heavily wooded and largely inaccessible, most of the ridges are undeveloped, visited only by intrepid hikers on the Metacomet and Mattabesett Trails along the crest. That dry, rocky environment is home to the rare electric blue skink lizard, the falcate orange-tipped butterfly, prickly pear cactus, stands of Torrey's mountain mint and delicate purple hair grass.
Recently the relentless push of housing development has begun creeping up some of the mountains, sending the towns scrambling to implement a 1995 state law allowing them to restrict development on the ridges. The measure was co-sponsored by Representative Mary M. Mushinsky of Wallingford and State Senator Thomas P. Gaffey of Meriden, both Democrats.
Several towns have worked on new regulations, and among the compact towns Meriden, Durham, Berlin, Simsbury, Middletown and Farmington have passed or are in the process of passing zoning that limits or prohibits development within 150 feet of the tops of the ridges.
But before the regulations can be enforced maps must be drawn detailing how and where development, clear-cutting of vegetation and any new quarrying operations are to be restricted or prohibited. Existing quarries are not affected.
The rest of the 17 compact communities -- Branford, North Branford, Guilford, East Haven, Wallingford, Middlefield, Plainville, West Hartford, Avon, Suffield and Bloomfield -- are still wrestling with zoning proposals or adding to existing limitations along their ridge lines.
"We encourage the towns to do what they can, whether through purchase, regulations or donations," said Norman Zimmer, author of the compact and a member of the Meriden Conservation Commission.
Historically, royalty and wealthy individuals have favored the tops of mountains as strategic and awe-inspiring sites for castles, fortifications and baronial mansions. But these ridges, said Mr. Zimmer, "must be preserved esthetically and recreationally" because "they are the Central Park of Connecticut."
The significance of the ridges, said Representative Mushinsky, "goes back to the dinosaur era, when they were formed. They rise above the rest of the state -- a continuous series of parallel basalt ridges, which at one time were lava. One side is a sheer scarp, the other side is a slope, but rocky and difficult to develop."
The name trap rock, she believes, evolved from a Swedish word trappa, meaning step, describing the configurations that formed layers of basalt in the Jurassic and Triassic periods.
"What triggered the legislation," she said, "was one landowner who wanted to put his foundation right on a section of Connecticut's Blue Trail system."
Existing development on the ridges varies widely from none at all in Meriden, which is surrounded by seven ridges, to about 30 homes built over several years on Avon's ridges, where 10 additional houses have been approved for construction and an additional eight are in the approvals pipeline. They will be priced from $800,000 to $3 million. Stephen Kushner, Avon's town planner, said that the views justified the prices.
So far, restrictive measures have been hailed by townspeople who regard the majestic chains of mountains as among their most precious assets. In addition, "they are major water-recharge areas," said Mr. Zimmer. "Water percolates down through the ridges to reservoirs at the base of the mountains," he said, adding that development could contaminate the water.
But the new rulings are causing confusion and resentment among individual ridgeland owners and developers who contend that their holdings are being rendered worthless. Contractors, too, who have been mining the century-old ridge quarries, crushing the rock to build roads, houses, hospitals, storm sewers, schools and an endless array of construction projects are suddenly concerned about future supplies.
"The stone that's mined in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire is the best in the world," said Joseph LaRosa, owner of LaRosa Construction in Meriden. "Perhaps they could designate certain areas for new quarries" -- a practice, quarriers say, that has been followed in some Western states.
TOM FRANCOLINE, a developer in Avon and chairman of the Connecticut Developers' Council, is concerned that "building materials in this part of the country are extremely expensive."
"But it will be a lot more expensive," he said, "to bring stone in from elsewhere, adding to fuel consumption and pollution."
Meriden's City Council approved the new zoning last year, based on a model set of regulations that conforms to the 1995 state statute and was distributed to all the towns. But the city's Planning and Zoning Commission rejected the Council's map of some 30 affected properties, the final step required to put the regulations into practice.
"They stated that we ought to work on compensation for property owners," said Stephen Zerio, chairman of the Economic Development Committee of the Council.
Compensation promises to be a major bone of contention. "I need to be compensated for five acres on which I pay $350 a year in taxes," said Ross Gulino, a landowner and developer. Taxes on undeveloped ridge land in Meriden, designated by the town as excess land, are extremely low. and levied at a fraction of the full rate. Assessor Steven Hodgetts said "one person is paying $25 a year on three acres, another with 315 acres is paying $14.50 an acre," or $4,567.50.
Mr. Gulino contends that "pretty much all" of his five acres are within 150 feet of the top. "I planned to market it as a single lot or maybe three lots," he said. "If the legislation goes through I will wind up with 50 feet or less, not enough to build on."
In 1995, as vice president of BRG Realty, a family-owned firm, he was a principal in the purchase of a predeveloped subdivision of 40 lots on 41 acres at the base of the mountain, plus the remainder of the slope including the top parcel. Fifteen lots at the base sold for $60,000 to $100,000 each. "Lots at the top would have added value because of the view," he said.
Pauline Travers, a Meriden widow with 20 acres, lives on the lower half. The rest is within 150 feet of the summit. The new zoning, she said, "will devalue my land -- it won't be very salable for me or my children." Disturbed by what she perceives as insensitivity on the part of thousands of people who favor the new zoning, she said "they don't own -- they just like to look at the view."
No doubt a protracted period of adjustment and probably a spate of lawsuits is in store as the various towns struggle to create regulations that will pass muster at the state level. Of the towns that adopted new zoning, Berlin does not allow quarrying and prohibits development higher than 350 feet above sea level.
Simsbury does not allow clear-cutting and requires replacement of trees in some cases, and Middletown may limit houses to one story or require moving them to lower ground if they interfere with views of the ridge line. Farmington, where development has produced some clear-cutting and "houses that stick out when you look up at the ridge," according to Elizabeth Dolphin, assistant planning director, is trying to deal with existing regulations that have produced disappointing results.
Mark Branse, a Glastonbury lawyer who drew up the model regulations for the 17 compact towns, said that most of the confusion comes from flawed interpretations of the model and ignorance of the state statute. On the subject of compensation, he said:
"General law states that government may regulate land use to protect the public welfare, but it cannot regulate it down to where it has no value. Any regulation will cause diminution of value. What is reasonable is what courts debate regularly."
"Buyers of ridge land knew it was difficult to get up there and to build on it," he continued. "However, the regulations allow what is deemed reasonable use of the property so as not to make it worthless."
In the case of Mr. Gulino, he indicated that the courts might not sanction compensation for losing the use of one piece of property when the owner has sufficient property nearby that is viable and profitable.
"The state statute only allows restriction," said Terry Tondro, professor of law at the University of Connecticut. "If a town had a flat prohibition, affected landowners could go to the state statute, which takes precedence. The statute was designed to protect ridgelines, using the word restrict rather than prohibit."
"The goal of zoning is not the maximum enrichment of property owners," said Mr. Branse, paraphrasing a Connecticut Supreme Court decision.

HEADLINE: Crisis Seen In Housing Of Mentally Disabled

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
ALONG with many other aging parents of the developmentally disabled, 74-year-old H. Arthur Alonso, a widower, is angrily pointing his finger at Gov. George E. Pataki.
Since 1995, when the Governor took office, there has been little money for new beds in group residences to help people like Mr. Alonso's 38-year-old daughter, Jerilyn, one of the 4,000 developmentally disabled people in Westchester and 180,000 in the state. 
 "Everything's on hold, and I'm just getting older and more worried," Mr. Alonso said. "Maybe some people don't consider their mortality, but I need to know that when I die, Jerilyn will be all right."
For now, his daughter, who has Down syndrome and a heart condition, lives at home in Pleasantville and attends day-care programs.
But her father is keenly aware of the fragility of that arrangement. "What will happen to her when I go?" he said.
Earlier this spring, the Governor vetoed a $5.7 million proposal in the budget to pay for additional housing for the developmentally disabled, leaving intact, though, a $15 million allotment.
With a waiting list of 6,400, a growing demand and only 500 new beds becoming available this year for retarded people still living at home but needing to move into a state program, Mr. Alonso said the situation was becoming worse. "It's like climbing a greased pole," he said.
Deborah Sturm Rausch, a spokeswoman for the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, denied that the situation was as grave as some have portrayed it.
She said that in addition to the 500 new beds, up to 600 already in use would most likely become available this year through attrition.
Despite those figures, advocates for the disabled and people who work with the developmentally disabled are worried. In Westchester, Commissioner Steven J. Friedman of the Department of Community Mental Health, said that 106 people "need to be placed right away." Just three years ago, the county was placing 80 to 100 people a year in group residences. "Last year it was 42, this year only 15 to date," he said.
Rochelle Kessler's son Stuart was born 34 years ago during a rubella epidemic, and like Ms. Alonso he is waiting for a spot in a group residence or for an apartment for the disabled. Hearing impaired and developmentally disabled, Mr. Kessler can dress himself, assist with dinner preparations and work at some jobs, like stocking shelves in a store or putting clothes on a rack.
But his mother, a widow living in White Plains, worries about who will look after him in the years to come. "I need to see him settled," she said.
With the discovery late last month that 26 retarded adults were living in homeless shelters in Westchester, parents like Mr. Alonso and Mrs. Kessler observed that the situation had reached crisis proportions.
Although the precise reasons for their homelessness is not yet known, it is believed that some of the 26 had been living with aged or frail parents who could no longer care for them, and they wound up at the county-supported homeless shelter at County Airport in Harrison.
Sometimes, though, the social and economic problems of the developmentally disabled are complicated by what social workers refer to as a dual diagnosis. In addition to their congenital physical and mental problems, they may have acquired alcohol and drug problems, which precipitated their homelessness -- in much the same way that those problems can result in homelessness in other segments of the population, social workers and mental health specialists said.
At the very least, developmentally disabled adults are an extremely vulnerable population -- especially when they live on the street or enter the homeless shelter system -- and they often become the prey of drug dealers and other criminals, said Linda Venezia, director of Community Services at Westchester ARC, formerly known as the Association for Retarded Citizens, an organization in White Plains providing residences, advocacy, case management and other services for the retarded.
Whatever the causes of their homelessness, the recent discovery of the 26 in Westchester's Social Services system has prompted state lawmakers like Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh, to worry about how deep and broad the problem is.
"This may be just the tip of the iceberg," Mr. Brodsky said, announcing that he would seek $275,000 to provide rent subsidies and counseling for the 26 adults. He called the situation "deeply appalling."
State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican from Yonkers and for many years the leader of the Senate committee on mental health, said he would seek legislation giving state officials no more than 30 days to place a homeless retarded person in a community residence. "It's atrocious that 26 people with developmental disabilities have fallen through the cracks," he said. Mr. Spano is also organizing a meeting between county and state officials to determine what can be done to prevent future problems.
But for many parents and advocates, the politicians' recent efforts amount to too little too late. "They should have been on the case a long time ago," said Mary C. Green, a board member of GROW, the acronym for Group Residences of Westchester, an advocacy group for the retarded. "They should have been pressing for solutions all along."
The situation was called to the attention of state officials months ago, Commissioner Friedman said. It was identified as a top priority early this spring in the county's mental health report to the state, which reported that there was a group of people with special needs -- including mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse -- who were homeless in Westchester.
"This is nothing new," Mr. Friedman said, speculating that GROW was raising it now as a symbolic issue in the wake of Mr. Pataki's veto.
The State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities said that even though Westchester acknowledged the problem in a report, it failed to alert officials individually at the state level. Nevertheless, Ms. Rausch, the spokeswoman, said her office had dispatched a team of clinicians to Westchester two weeks ago in response to the present crisis.
She said that by the time the group arrived at the airport, 11 of the 26 homeless people had left and their whereabouts were unknown. Of those who remained, one refused service; two, according to the clinicians' assessments, were not afflicted with developmental disabilities; four were referred to other agencies with problems like alcohol abuse; five were in need of minimal support and supervision, and three needed residential care.
In large part, the situation has its roots in what is known as the Willowbrook decree, a 1975 Federal consent order, which inspired a statewide policy shift replacing state institutions with community-based residential care. The decree ordered New York to transfer large numbers of retarded people to group homes, which were to be leased or bought by the state.
But according to a report issued in 1984 by the Community Residences Information Services Program, a clearinghouse for the establishment of group residences, public opposition to the group homes was a significant obstacle to the state's intentions. "Despite legal mandates, public policy, proven benefits of family-like living for clients and the compounding needs for such homes, many local governments and neighborhoods have continued to oppose and impede these homes," the report said.
On the whole, though, the large institutions in New York that served as warehouses for the retarded -- like the Staten Island Developmental Center at Willowbrook, Letchworth Village in Thiells and the Wassaic State School at Harlem Valley State Hospital in Wingdale -- have been emptied in the last two decades.
The need for group homes has not abated, though, since the population of developmentally disabled people who were living at home in 1975 is now aging and in need of vacancies in the community residence system.
Also, as Mrs. Green of GROW observed, new people keep coming into the system. "People with developmental disabilities haven't stopped being born," she said.
Richard Sweirat, the executive director of Westchester ARC, expressed concern about the desperation that was building among parents who have raised their retarded children at home. Some aging parents, he said, are so frantic that they have made suicide pacts "to take their developmentally disabled child with them" because they cannot trust the system to assume responsibility.
"It's a terrible tragedy to face to begin with when you have a child with these problems," Mr. Sweirat said, "but now there are all these other problems on top of that. It's time for this story to get out with all its gory details."
Parents of developmentally disabled children can call GROW's help line at 493-1318.

HEADLINE: New Stamp Honors Mme. C. J. Walker

BYLINE: By ANNE C. FULLAM 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON

 BODY:
A NEW stamp issued by the United States Postal Service commemorates the country's first self-made female millionaire, Madame C. J. Walker of Irvington, whose riverfront mansion begun in 1916 and completed in 1918 still stands.
Madame Walker, who was black, created a line of hair-care and skin products for black women. The 32-cent stamp was the third in the postal service's Black Heritage series. Previous honorees were the abolitionist Harriet Tubman and Jackie Robinson. 
 "This is the only home I ever want to own," said Harold W. Doley Jr., a 25-year member of the New York Stock Exchange and owner of Doley Securities of New Orleans and Manhattan. In the 1980's, Mr. Doley was an ambassador to the African Development Bank in Ivory Coast.
"It's magnificent," Mr. Doley said of the 34-room ivory Italian Renaissance house, which features marble staircases, a three-story pipe organ and sunken gardens. "And it contains the history of Madame Walker and what she did.
"She's in the Guinness Book of World Records as the first female self-made millionaire in America. Not black millionairess, but the first female of any color to make millions on her own."
Mr. Doley's connection to Madame Walker spans several decades.
"I grew up in New Orleans," he said. "We were at Tuskegee at a picnic at my aunt's home, and I met someone who said he was a great-grandson of Madame Walker. His name was Walker Perry. He talked about Madame Walker and the history. I grew up in a family business, and I wanted to go into business. I was always interested in business history."
Years later, Mr. Doley took his children to visit the great houses along the Hudson River. A stop was made in Irvington.
"So, my interest goes back a long way," Mr. Doley said. "I came here in training in 1968 to be a stockbroker, but I didn't get in to see the house until later, 1991. We lived in Scarsdale. I negotiated with the owner for two and a half years before buying it."
Enrico Caruso, a Walker family friend who often sang at parties at the mansion, named it Villa Lewaro, using the first two letters of the names of Madame Walker's daughter, Lelia Walker Robinson.
"People coming by here used to annoy me at first," Helena Doley, Mr. Doley's wife, said. "I could quit my job and give interviews, lead tours and answer the phone full time."
Kept from the reach of developers' bulldozers in 1988 by preservationists adamant about saving the ancient copper beeches and gingkos on the property, Madame Walker's 20,000-square-foot mansion was a dream come true.
Designed by Vertner Woodson Tandy, the state's first licensed black architect, the house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
"J. P. Morgan was born across the street," Peter Oley, the Village Historian, said. In a village noted for its history, including its namesake, Washington Irving, Madame Walker's house is notable.
"She said that she wanted to be on Broadway in Irvington, because if you were going to Albany you had to pass," Mrs. Doley said. "She saw it as a symbol to her people."
Born Sarah Breedlove on Dec. 23, 1867, on a plantation in Delta, La., Madame Walker was the daughter of former slaves. Both parents died in 1874 in a yellow fever epidemic, and Sarah moved to Vicksburg, Miss., to live with a sister, Louvenia.
In 1882, at 15, she married Moses McWilliams. Three years later, Sarah gave birth to a daughter, Lelia. Mr. McWilliams died of unknown causes in 1887, and Sarah and Lelia moved to St. Louis.
By 1905, mother and daughter were living in Denver, and it was there that Sarah developed the formula for Wonderful Hair Grower, her first product.
"She claimed the formula was given to her in a dream," Mrs. Doley said. "She was having trouble with her hair. It was falling out. There were very few products for women of color. The texture of black women's hair: there was nothing to condition it. Tugging away at it, and it falls out."
A pomade, the product allowed the user to comb hair without breaking its strands.
"She worked, and she marketed," Mrs. Doley said. Selling door to door, she pioneered a concept that would later be used by other cosmetics manufacturers.
"She was a marketing genius," Mrs. Doley said. "She put out newsletters to her agents telling them how to sell. She got women out of washrooms and kitchens. She gave them good commissions. Some of them opened their own places of business.
"She helped with self-determination. Her parents were slaves and then tenant farmers. She was the first generation born free. We get a lot of interesting letters from women who were agents or the children of them."
In 1906, Sarah Breedlove married Charles Joseph Walker and changed her name to Madame C. J. Walker. Two years later, the Walkers moved to Pittsburgh, where Madame Walker opened Lelia College, a now defunct school of cosmetology. Then they moved to Indianapolis, where she built a factory.
Traveling across the country, selling her products and speaking to black organizations, she divorced C. J. Walker in 1912. She became a grandmother in 1913, when her daughter adopted a young woman named Mae Perry.
After a sales trip to the Caribbean and Central America in 1913, she moved to Harlem in 1916. A year later, she convened the first Madame C. J. Walker Hair Culturists Union of America Convention.
In 1917 she tried to talk to President Woodrow Wilson about making lynching a Federal crime, but her request for an appointment was never granted. Instead, she became the largest donor at that time to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, with a gift of $5,000.
She died of a heart attack induced by high blood pressure on May 25, 1919, at 51, a year after Villa Lewaro was completed. So distraught was her daughter, A'Lelia, who had changed her name, that she seldom visited the house, preferring to stay in her brownstone in Harlem.
During the Harlem Renaissance, the house was opened occasionally for huge parties, attended by luminaries like Langston Hughes, W. E. B. DuBois and James VanDerZee, the photographer who chronicled the Harlem Renaissance.
In 1933, Lelia died at 48, also of the effects of high blood pressure. Lewaro, which had been bequeathed to the N.A.A.C.P., was sold for use as a nursing home, which operated on the site for 55 years. The Doleys moved into the house in November 1993.
Madame Walker's products are again being made by Walker Enterprises at 2701 North College Avenue, Indianapolis, Ind. 46204; (317) 921-1080. Visitors to Indianapolis might want to see the Walker Theater, which Madame Walker had built after she was barred from a whites-only establishment. Information on the theater is available by calling (317) 236-2099.
A designer's showcase to benefit the United Negro College Fund is scheduled from Sept. 12 to Oct. 13 at the house. Information is available at (914) 949-3881.
So inspirational is the Walker residence that one neighbor moved to Irvington just to be near.
"A woman across the road said her mother moved here 30 years ago just to look at it," Mrs. Doley said. "You can't live here and not feel in awe of her, feel her presence and think of her."

 BODY:

Pavel Tchelitchew Show
A show of more than 70 paintings and drawings by Pavel Tchelitchew opens today at the Katonah Museum of Art, continuing through Sept. 6. 
 Its title, "Landscape of the Body" is appropriate to the artist's obsession with the human form, which he interpreted realistically, surrealistically, anthropomorphically and clinically, lifting innovation in figurative painting to new heights.
Officials at the museum believe that in spite of his genius he has been largely omitted from art history books. This show -- the first major museum exhibition of his work since the 60's, and its 56-page catalogue, which includes a 7,000-word curatorial essay and a chronology of the artist's life -- is expected to make a substantial contribution to the scholarship of American art history.
The Tchelitchew estate and fortune were lost in the Russian Revolution of 1918, causing the family to flee the country. Pavel Tchelitchew lived in Berlin for a time, designed sets and costumes for the Ballet Russe in Paris and came to New York in 1934, where he had his first show at the Julien Levy Gallery.
Several programs related to the exhibition begin next Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., when children are invited for a day of body, face and mural painting, making sculptures from recycled materials, and other artistic pursuits. The fee is $15 in advance, $20 at the door.
Admission to the museum, Route 22 at Jay Street, is $2, free to children under 12. Call 232-9555 for details.
 
Waterfront Planning
The future of Westchester's waterfront towns will be the subject of a conference at Marymount College in Tarrytown on Tuesday from 8:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. For a second year the Historic River Towns of Westchester and the county's Planning Department have convened a conference to review plans evolving from discussions with the various communities and to benefit from exchanges of ideas.
They include the Mayors of Croton-on-Hudson, Peekskill, Tarrytown and Yonkers; Joyce Lanning, the County Planning Commissioner; David Sampson, Executive Director of the Hudson River Greenway Communities Council; Charles A. Gargano, State Commissioner for Economic Development, and people in the construction industry, tourism and environmental preservation.
Some riverfront towns have proposals of their own, which the conference is seeing to fold into a coordinated regional approach, focusing on zoning, views and vistas, waterfront trails, abandoned industrial sites, environmental concerns and the interests of residents weighed against tourism.
The final event will be an artist's exhibition and tea from 3:30 to 5 P.M., when the 11 contributing artists will be present. The paintings, prints, pastels and photographs are representations of the Hudson River and will be hung in Rita Hall on the Marymount campus from 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Tuesday and from 2 to 5 P.M. on Wednesday and Thursday.
Conference tickets at $25 include lunch. They may be got along with directions and more information by calling 747-3600, extension 7300.
 
Public and Managed Care
"Consumer Protection in an Era of Managed Care and Provider Networks" is the topic of a conference on Friday from 8:15 to 11:30 A.M. at Pace University's Graduate Center, 1 Martine Avenue in White Plains.
The increasingly uncomfortable relationship between the public and its health care providers will be addressed by Alexander Grannis, chairman of the New York State Assembly Committee on Insurance; R. Channing Wheeler, chief operating officer and president of tristate operations at United Healthcare, a national health management company; Arthur E. Weintraub, president of the Northern Metropolitan Hospital Association, representing more than 60 health care institutions in the Hudson Valley, and Francis J. Serbaroli, partner in the Manhattan law firm of Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft and a vice chairman of the State Public Health Council.
Topics under discussion will include consumer protection legislation at the state and Federal levels, how quality and consumer satisfaction are monitored within the managed care industry and other issues considered to essential to consumer protection.
To register at a cost of $50 call 422-4298.
 
Evening Party, 1824
Decorations and music for a candlelighted evening party circa 1824 will be ready for visitors at the John Jay Homestead in Katonah on Friday from 6 to 9 P.M. Tours of the home of America's first Chief Justice will be conducted, and refreshments are included in the $5 admission charge. Children will be admitted for $2, people older than 62 for $4.
Visitors may picnic on the lawn as the sun sets and stars appear. The house is at 400 Route 22, and the number to call for information is 232-5651. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: A Million-Dollar Home? Ho-Hum.

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST 

 BODY:
THE million-dollar home -- a phrase that not long ago summoned up images of mansions and perhaps even liveried servants -- has become so commonplace in the most affluent New York suburbs that in some communities more than half the homes now on the market are priced above $1 million.
A $1 million price tag, brokers say, no longer necessarily implies luxury living. Rather, a $1 million house in some areas is almost, well, ordinary. 
 Indeed, in the most sought-after sections of Greenwich, Conn., such as Belle Haven and Round Hill, $1 million is now considered entry level, said Susan Hughes, vice president of David Ogilvy & Associates and president of the Greenwich Association of Realtors.
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, describes the phenomenon as a "crowding into the winner's circle."
"Driving the market are baby boomers, who are entering their peak earning years, raising families, and settling into the communities where they want to be for the long haul," said Dr. Hughes. who is not related to Susan Hughes. "And so they're bidding up prices in these areas."
 While new luxury-home developments are common now throughout the region, the proportion of $1 million-plus properties is still small in most towns. But in a few areas, primarily those with established reputations as comfortable havens for the well-to-do, sales of homes for $1 million or more make up an increasingly significant chunk of the market.
These areas include Greenwich, New Canaan, Westport and Darien in Connecticut; parts of Westchester County, including Scarsdale, Rye and Larchmont; on Long Island, the villages on Nassau County's North Shore, as well as the Hamptons in Suffolk County; portions of central New Jersey, including Far Hills, Harding Township, Bernardsville and Mendham Township, and the Saddle River area in Bergen County.
"Basically, what you're talking about is supply and demand," said Mrs. Hughes. "There is such a demand for large family homes with certain amenities that it pokes the prices up. And because land prices are so high, people are also building larger homes and expanding homes, so the high-end stock is growing."
"It's a reflection primarily of the tremendous rise of value in the stock market," said Lee E. Koppelman, director of the Center for Regional Policy Studies at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
The demand for high-end housing in the suburbs is even more pronounced now than it was during the region's last period of great prosperity between 1979 and 1985, he said. And the high cost of housing in Manhattan is a contributing factor. For those with $1 million or more to spend on housing, Mr. Koppelman said, "it does occur to people that they'll get an even bigger bang for their buck by investing in an estate property in the suburbs."
The trend toward buying more costly and larger homes appears to have gained momentum. In Greenwich, for example, the average selling time for houses priced between $1 million and $1.9 million has dropped 40 percent since last year, to just 86 days, according to Nancy A. MacDonald, manager of the Greenwich office of William Pitt Real Estate. For houses priced above $2 million, the sale time is down 30 percent, to 185 days, she said.
In the first quarter of 1998, 49 homes sold for $1 million or more in Greenwich, about 30 percent of all homes sold, according to figures compiled by William Pitt. Ten years ago, only 17 homes, or 18 percent of first-quarter sales, were sold for more than $1 million. In 1984, the $1 million-plus percentage was zero in the first quarter.
"I maintain that if you bought a house in Greenwich in the early 80's, that was terrific," said Ms. MacDonald. "If you purchased for $200,000, $250,000 you could probably get $1.5 million for that house. And that's pretty darn good."
The ceiling on prices is lifting as well. A 24-room mansion on the Greenwich waterfront sold this year for a record $15 million.
The mansion, called Haroldlyn Manor, is a Georgian-style house with a private yacht mooring on six acres. It was once a summer home for Donald J. Trump, who purchased it for $3.7 million in 1984, according to the Greenwich Town Assessor's office.
"A million dollars will buy you a comfortable family house in Greenwich, but nothing fancy, nothing with extravagant amenities," said Mrs. Hughes. "The fancy bedrooms, a finer kitchen, a very large family room -- houses with these things are generally not available under $1.4 million."
And yet, despite the cost, houses just keep getting bigger, noted Bernard Yudain, a longtime Greenwich resident who is a columnist for the Greenwich Time newspaper. "Even some of the big old houses were never this big," he said. "There used to be more of a sense of proportion of house to lot size. Now we're seeing huge houses on relatively small lots. I said the other day, jokingly, that some of these buyers are bringing the wrecking ball people to the closing with them."
Last Monday the Representative Town Meeting, citing concerns about "oversized houses," passed a resolution urging the Town Planning and Zoning Commission to give the highest priority to amending building and zoning regulations to develop "appropriate" floor-area ratios, lot sizes, coverage and setbacks.
Greenwich is not the only affluent town where the wrecking ball has been swinging. "Fifty percent of buyers are looking for what's here," said Joan Quigg, owner of Joan Quigg Realtors in Saddle River. "The other 50 percent is looking for what they can knock down. That wonderful, classic Saddle River look, which was so understated -- well, all that is now to buyers is just a beautiful piece of land."
"People are very demanding," she added. "They want high ceilings, and a very, very good kitchen -- whether they do takeout for the rest of their lives, it doesn't matter. They want a wonderful master bedroom and bath, and a great room off the kitchen."
More than half the 53 properties currently on the market in Saddle River are priced above $1 million. The shift toward more $1 million homes began in the 80's in Saddle River, Ms. Quigg said, but then stopped during the economic downturn.
The market picked up again in 1994, and has climbed upward since, she said. Last year, the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service recorded 25 sales above $1 million in Saddle River; according to Ms. Quigg, as of May 31 this year, 13 had already sold in that category. And new homes in Saddle River are selling for closer to $2 million, she said. .
In many cases, these buyers are making what Ms. Quigg described as "the leap to the big house." That is because, according to brokers, the typical high-end buyers in the suburbs these days are two-income couples with young children. And often they are purchasing their first home.
"It seems to me my borrowers are getting younger," said Craig Atkinson, a senior financial services officer with Sterling Capital in Stamford. "I'm amazed that people in their early 30's are buying $1 million homes."
On a $1 million house, the usual loan amount would be about $750,000, Mr. Atkinson said. "The mortgage interest deduction is about the only tax deduction any of us have anymore, so a lot of buyers like to maximize the mortgage amount," he said, noting that exceptions are often made to allow a mortgage of up to 80 percent of the sale price for customers with adequate assets and income.
The monthly payment on a $750,000 mortgage at a fixed, 30-year rate of 7.375 percent, said Mr. Atkinson, is $5,180, $4,500 of which is initially deductible as interest. Buyers who opt for an adjustable-rate mortgage at a 6.625 interest rate for the first five years pay $4,802 a month, he said, about $4,080 of which is deductible.
Customers rarely borrow more than $1 million, Mr. Atkinson said, because the maximum deduction allowed is interest accrued on a $1 million mortgage. An additional deduction is allowed for interest on a second mortgage of up to $100,000. "A lot of the really big deals get done in cash or through private loans," he said.
All-cash deals are sometimes used as a negotiating tactic, according to Sheila Rice, director of the Fine Homes Division of Prudential Long Island Realty. Buyers offer to pay in cash as an incentive for the seller to come down on the price. Once the deal goes through, she said, they often refinance.
The high-end market in her North Shore territory, which includes both horse country and beach communities, is enjoying a tremendous upswing after an extended slump that lasted well into 1996. "Then, you could list a home at $1.7 million and it would sell for under a million," Mrs. Rice said. But prices are recovering rapidly, she noted.
ACCORDING to data compiled by Prudential, as of June 1, 14 houses had sold for at least $1 million this year in the villages of Brookville, Old Brookville, Upper Brookville, Matinecock, Mill Neck, Muttontown, Lattingtown, Laurel Hollow, Lloyd Harbor, Lloyd Neck, and Oyster Bay Cove. An additional 36 listed in that price range are under contract, Mrs. Rice said.
Should they all come in at more than $1 million, she said, the five-month total will have already surpassed the 1997 year-end figure of 44 million-dollar sales. In the majority of the villages, more than half the inventory is currently priced above $1 million, Mrs. noted.
Though the hamlet of Locust Valley in the Town of Oyster Bay is often perceived as the center of wealth on the North Shore, Mrs. Rice pointed out that some of the most expensive homes in the area are found in Lattingtown, the Brookvilles and Muttontown. Generally, she said, the closer to Long Island Sound, the higher the home prices.
Million-dollar bank investment properties are moving particularly quickly, she noted, because "buyers think they're getting a bargain on foreclosures." A recent example was a 12-year-old contemporary in Oyster Bay Cove with peeling paint, an overgrown yard and a pool full of murky green water. A foreclosure listed at $1.199 million, the property sold in a single weekend.
North Shore properties often come with two or more acres of land. In contrast, a half-acre is "a lot of land" in the $1 million-plus market in Scarsdale, said Joan Frederick, an associate broker in the Scarsdale office of Julia B. Fee. A couple of new five-bedroom homes going up on .33-acre lots in the Fox Meadow neighborhood close to the village center in Scarsdale recently listed at $1.375 million. In portions of the Heathcote section, which is less densely developed, one-acre lots alone start at $1 million, according to Mrs. Frederick.
Prices fluctuate on either side of the million-dollar mark in the older neighborhoods of Edgewood, Fox Meadow and Green Acres, depending on how well the houses have been maintained and the degree to which they have been updated.
One five-bedroom brick colonial in Green Acres went on the market earlier this year for $1.075 million on a street where houses generally sell for $700,000 to $1 million, Mrs. Frederick said. The 80-year-old house showed so well that the owners received multiple offers and wound up getting $1.202 million. In 1984, the same house sold for $510,000, according to Mrs. Frederick.
About a quarter of the homes now on the market in Scarsdale, or 45 houses, are priced above $1 million. The number of $1 million-plus sales began climbing in 1994, when 22 homes sold in that price range. Last year the number was 33, and this year, as of May 27, 25 homes had already sold at more than $1 million each, Mrs. Frederick said.
MANHATTAN is also experiencing an upswing this year, in what was already a heady high-end market. "Increasingly, when you're talking about the $1 million market, you're talking about every part of Manhattan," noted Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth, Warburg Associates, a Manhattan real estate brokerage. "A spacious three-bedroom apartment can run you $1 million on 110th and Riverside. And certainly there are any number of 2,500-square-foot lofts that can run you $1 million."
Mr. Peters said that $1 million-plus sales by his brokers in the first four months of 1998 on the East and West Sides and downtown indicate that if the current pace continues, volume in that market could be up as much as 80 percent by the year's end.
According to Lawrence Sicular, a broker and appraiser for Brown Harris Stevens, the $1 million market currently accounts for 37 percent of all sales on the Upper East Side and Central Park West. That is up from 33 percent in 1997, and 25 percent in 1996. "It's a strong but conservative market," he noted. "So the biggest price increases are for the best located and largest apartments."
The same is true of properties selling for $1 million or more in the suburbs. In Greenwich, according to Ms. MacDonald of William Pitt, a home that recently sold in the prestigious shore community of Belle Haven was snapped up almost immediately, despite a price that would once have been daunting even by Fairfield County shorefront standards.
"The people had been in the house for 40 years," she said. "It was incredible waterfront property. They probably paid $50,000, if that, and they were holding out for $3 million. I'm sure they got close to that, if not that."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
A Prolonged Party For 'Annie' at 20-Plus

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
"OPTIMISM!" shouts one of the street people of lower Broadway. "That's something I haven't heard since 1928." Stunned, he is reacting to an orphaned 11 1/2-year-old redhead who insists that "the sun'll come out tomorrow."
It is hard to know if the audience at Tuesday's opening of "Annie" at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which appeared to consist of a trillion little girls, got it. What they did get was the rush of a real live big-time Broadway show and the terrific brassy sound of the old-style score, briskly conducted by Sue Anschutz. Here is a young person's ideal guide to the joys of musical theater. 
 Even though it is being promoted as "Annie: Direct From Broadway," where it closed in October, the show has come directly from Memphis to Newark, the 30th stop on a "20th-anniversary tour" scheduled to conclude when "Annie" will be 22.
Even if this "Annie' is only a retread, the stopover here may be the beginning of a real theater mission for the inviting arts center, for this is the first full-scale Equity production to play the 2,750-seat Prudential Hall.
It is hard to believe that the chaperones and others of a certain age in the audience would be coming upon "Annie" for the first time. It would be best for them to pay no mind to the sanctimonious remarks by Martin Charnin, the show's lyricist and director, about the musical's Dickensian shadings, including child abuse. For such is the retro-cartoony tone of Thomas Meehan's funny book that its lines could well be contained within the balloons of a comic strip. Even given a story of homelessness, rampant unemployment and the power of a billionaire's "war bucks" to heal, "Annie" is an inoffensive entertainment by Mr. Charnin and Charles Strouse, craftsmen who in this case knew musical-theater territory and charted it expertly.
Remarkably, "Tomorrow," the show's signature song and the first one written for it, is the only one Mr. Strouse composed in a post-Beatles style; the rest of the score is period-perfect. Too bad the touring show omits "We'd Like To Thank You" (Herbert Hoover), a lamentation of the Depression, with a Weill-Brechtian edge. "You Make Me Happy," added for Miss Hannigan in the Broadway revival, is also omitted from this staging, which runs two and a half hours even with other minor deletions.
In a cast with talent to spare, Alene Robertson, an excellent Miss Hannigan in the vastly superior 1996 revival at Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn. (where "Annie" was born in 1976), is relegated to a series of small roles and understudying Sally Struthers. And Christine Kienzle, who was a sizzling Evita at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn in 1996, is the understudy for Lily, Rooster Hannigan's ditzy accomplice. That's show business: cut songs in one place; waste talent in another.
Ms. Struthers, who replaced an ineffectual Nell Carter as Miss Hannigan in January, may not be the revival's lifeline, but she does give it life. She takes a stranglehold on the role and hurls it right up to the fourth tier, succumbing to the D.T.'s even before she takes a swig from her ever-handy flask ("it's medicinal"), dismembering a doll and stumbling into walls.
There is no question that Ms. Struthers, a well-known spokeswoman for children's rights, is giving a performance, but only to a point. A vamping sex-starved harridan more than a child-hater, Ms. Struthers is not a masterly comic villain, but an emphatically hard-working, heavy-breathing one.
Brittny Kissinger, the 9-year-old understudy who replaced the intended Annie on Broadway two weeks before previews amid a publicity blitz that came to be called "the 'Annie' wars," is in full command of all an ageless runaway must be. She is a belter. She has a wily way with an obscenely rich old man and a woebegone stray dog. She can sell a line, get a laugh and, now, connect with Conrad John Schuck (Oliver Warbucks) in a warm and winning way that eluded them early in last year's Broadway run. Mr. Schuck gives a steely man a thoroughly convincing meltdown, but only for Annie.
With sketchy scrims and sets, from the Warbucks manse to the tenements of Hell's Kitchen, the Performing Arts Center is presenting a well-traveled, truncated "Annie" that exhibits the compromises and the contradictions of theater in the material world: a first-class company going tourist in a sumptuous space.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Tighter Leash for Dog Walkers

BYLINE: By INGRID EISENSTADTER 

 BODY:
THREE hundred thousand pooches live in New York City. For dog walkers, that's a lot of plastic bags.
But those who earn a living with a leash are not complaining. They are doing a land-office business. The prices, experience and services of these operations vary widely, and they range from part-time endeavors run from home by unemployed actors to companies with offices and full-time employees. But, though the field is diverse and largely unregulated, few people doubt that it is growing. 
 "There are no statistics about how many individuals walk dogs professionally, but new services seem to pop up every day," said Robin Kovary, director of the American Dog Trainers Network, a nonprofit nationwide referral service. One reason: "In the 90's more people are working long hours, so dog walking is a great convenience," she said.
But growing reliance on dog walkers means that more animals will be lost, injured or even killed on their watch.
Simka, a 1-year-old 40-pound German shepherd mix, ran away from a dog walker on the Upper West Side one evening in March. The walker had a second dog and so could not pursue Simka until it was too late.
"Something must have frightened her," said Phyllis Heller, the dog's owner. "She got out of her collar and ran away."
Ronnie Reiman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that last Christmas her Coton de Tulear, an exotic French breed, got away from his walker. The dog's cost: $2,000.
Although Ms. Reiman got her dog, Valentin, back -- "I put posters on anything that didn't move from Houston to 57th Street, river to river" -- Ms. Heller still has not found her dog, despite similar posterings.
These incidents, coupled with the inclination of businesses to distinguish themselves from one other, are making safety a big subject on the dog-walking circuit.
Consider Flo Phillips, a self-employed dog walker on the Upper East Side. A pet-care provider for more than a decade, Ms. Phillips said she has had one client almost seven years. "I walk that dog twice every day," she said. "He's like my nephew." That means she knows the dog and the dog knows her, in contrast to larger companies, which may assign different walkers to a pet on different days. Such familiarity may make runaways less likely.
Ms. Phillips says her charges are safe for another reason: she walks just one animal at a time. Pack walking may keep prices down for the pet owner and increase income for the business, but, as Ms. Heller learned, a dog walker who is holding one animal can't chase another that is getting away. Moreover, dealing with multiple dogs is not easy. "If something goes wrong," Ms. Kovary said, "you become a human maypole."
Ms. Phillips said she frequently sees dogs left alone on the street while their handler makes another pickup. Doormen will not let packs of nonresident dogs into the buildings, she said. That can leave the dogs vulnerable to theft or injury.
Cliff Zager, owner of the K-9 Club on the Upper East Side, has built a business doing just what Ms. Phillips dislikes: walking dogs in packs. Pets in his care get a two-hour daily walk in groups of 7, occasionally even 10. But he has made efforts to promote safety.
"Each pack has two handlers," Mr. Zager said, and for additional security all the dogs are on chokers. Because these devices tighten when animals pull on them, they help prevent dogs from slipping their leashes and give handlers greater control over the animals. (Virgilio Pires, owner of Mandrake Dog Walking, the service that walked Simka, said that since the dog's loss he puts all his dogs in chokers.) Moreover, all pairs of K-9 walkers report to street-level supervisors who coordinate the pickups and drop-offs on their routes. As a result, Mr. Zager said, dogs in his care are never left alone.
Puddles Pet Service has taken a high-technology route. Its dog walkers are computer-tracked using customized software, said Dominique Brandwen, the owner. When they arrive at a customer's home, they dial an 800 number to log onto the system. The call is automatically matched against the dog-walking schedule so staff members know if the schedule is being met. If the call is not made, the computer will alert office employees.
Puddles walkers carry beepers so they can be called in emergencies and, Ms. Brandwen said, "I have a round-the-clock assistant who carries an alphanumeric pager and a cellular phone at all times."
These devices are most often used for last-minute changes in plan, Ms. Brandwen said. If, for example, a pet has to be picked up at the vet's instead of home, beepers insure that the dog won't be stranded.
Ms. Brandwen said she also conducts background investigations of new employees for criminal records. She offers health insurance to encourage employees to stay and thus build up a corps of capable, experienced workers.
Whether all such practices improve pet safety is unclear. Pet owners and others add to these strategies their own set of safety tips and suggestions. For example, Ms. Heller said, "Always ask your service, 'What would you do if my animal were lost?' "
Owners should make sure an animal has identification. As Ms. Heller has found, a pet can slip out of a collar and tag; for that reason, some pet owners tattoo vital information on the pet or even implant an identifying microchip under its skin.
If an animal is lost, call the Center for Animal Care and Control, which oversees the city's animal shelters. The Manhattan number is (212) 722-3620. Call promptly, because the animals may be destroyed after 48 hours.
Posting fliers can work, too. But when Ms. Heller put up her 2,000 notices, "they were all removed by the Department of Sanitation," she said.
Distraught and desperate, the next day Ms. Heller "papered the whole Upper West Side three times," she recalled.
But still no luck. "I don't have a body; I don't have a dog," Ms. Heller said. "I will feel guilty for the rest of my life."

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Kicking Some Sand Into Powerful Faces

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
HERE'S some excellent beach reading: a pair of business books that are light enough to tote (83 and 102 pages, respectively) yet anything but scrawny.
"Team Rodent: How Disney Devours the World," by Carl Hiaasen, and "News Is a Verb: Journalism at the End of the Twentieth Century," by Pete Hamill ($8.95 each), are part of a new series by Ballantine's Library of Contemporary Thought -- short paperbacks by high-profile writers on everything from sports to the Supreme Court. 
 The waxing of Disney and the waning of newspapers are the chosen subjects of Mr. Hiaasen and Mr. Hamill. And well-chosen they are: These terrifically constructed complaints seem to have burst full-blown from some longtime mental fumings.
"Team Rodent" was published last month and immediately made it onto the New York Times business best-seller list. In the book, Mr. Hiaasen, a best-selling crime novelist and a columnist for The Miami Herald, attacks -- informatively and hilariously -- the Disneyfication of the globe, with special attention to Florida and Times Square. (The latter, a once "skanky oozepot" of sleaze, tested our taste and tolerance, he argues. And revulsion, unlike the Mickey and Minnie garden statues at the enormous new Disney Store on 42d Street, is "essential to the human experience.")
The author says that over all, the Walt Disney Company is well run and even progressive in its policies toward its gay employees. And he discloses that he has made the parental pilgrimage to Disney World in Orlando, Fla. So what does he hate about the House of the Mouse?
For starters, its wholesome-image machine. The company produces gritty rap music through its records unit, he notes, and distributes violent movies like "Pulp Fiction" even as it makes "101 Dalmatians." One extremely funny chapter chronicles a frantic day last year when Disney's Hollywood Records division released, then withdrew, an album that contained filthy lyrics by a group called the Insane Clown Posse.
Mr. Hiaasen also condemns the company for the trample of tourists into Florida -- soon to reach about 46 million annually -- and for what he calls endless "roadside schlock" set up to relieve these Disney World pilgrims of any leftover cash. Paradoxically, he says, the only relief now from the ugly sprawl (once cattle ranches and fruit orchards) is the verdant Disney complex itself.
But his biggest complaint is against Disney's sheer power -- over our imaginations, municipalities and media. The company "touches virtually every human being in America for a profit," he writes, with its theme parks, movie companies and television networks. For baby boomers especially, he notes, Disney is the "benign enchanter-protector," an image embedded "in the collective parental psyche."
Mr. Hiaasen's sharp irreverence works wonderfully, as he takes jabs at Disney's new cruise ship and privately owned Caribbean island; its chairman, Michael D. Eisner, and what he calls its "shell municipality" in Florida -- the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a kind of parallel government, a "Vatican with mouse ears," in the words of a friend he quotes.
A special gem is the chapter on the "world's largest press party" given at Disney World to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the resort's 15th anniversary. The 5,200 people in attendance were offered mounds of food and souvenirs. They also got the chance to see a respected colleague -- a weary Nick Daniloff, the U.S. News and World Report writer wrongly jailed by the Soviets for spying -- welcomed back to America with outstretched arms. The furry arms, of course, of Mickey Mouse.
 
TABLOIDS IN TROUBLE "News Is a Verb" gets its title from its author's belief that it's bad business -- not just bad judgment -- for newspapers to compulsively cover the rich or famous when they haven't done anything newsworthy. Our papers, he writes, are "runny with the virus of celebrity."
Mr. Hamill, a novelist and longtime New York journalist who was the editor of The Daily News for eight months last year, loves newspapers. He remembers when tabloids had hard-hitting news missions, social campaigns and beautifully rendered comic strips. And he hates the "reader-driven" coverage that he says dumbs down articles in both tabloids and broadsheets.
What's more, he says, all of this is killing, not reviving, an already ailing newspaper industry.
Profits may be up these days because of a strong economy and robust advertising, he says, but the overall weekday circulation of the nation's dailies has stagnated over the last few decades.
The nation's publishers and top editors know exactly what they're doing, he writes, citing a recent Editor & Publisher poll in which 65 percent of newspaper executives agreed that newspapers cover "politics and personalities at the expense of policy." About 48 percent characterized the national press as "shallow and inadequate."
To get the readers back -- particularly women and immigrants -- newspapers must cover health and safety issues, municipal government and, especially, foreign policy, Mr. Hamill says. And publishers must forge alliances -- with the immigrant press in our cities and with newsstands in unfashionable neighborhoods.
Mr. Hamill's arguments, backed by a fascinating foray into New York press history, are lively, compelling and persuasive. "Sooner or later, the reader wises up" when news isn't newsworthy, he says. "Sometimes sooner. Always later."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IN EUROPE: THE MULTINATIONALS;
For Americans, an Indirect Route to the Party

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
A CASE can be made that one way for Americans to invest in Europe is to buy stock in American companies that do big chunks of business here.
The argument goes like this: As European nations go about marrying their national currencies, the wedding will be catered in large measure from the United States. 
 To understand how, consider the following:
European economies and stock markets are booming. Monetary union and the year-2000 computer problem are forcing European companies to bolster technology investments, which have lagged woefully behind those in the United States. So, with markets still reeling in Asia and with earnings growth slowing in the United States, American multinationals may well be relying more than ever on Europe to maintain profitability.
"The conclusion is that United States companies are uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends," said Joe Rooney, chief equity strategist at Lehman Brothers Securities in London.
That is partly because Europe remains the bedrock of American business overseas, even if Asia has grabbed most of the headlines in recent years.
James E. Carlson, an economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said direct investment abroad by American companies has been so vigorous in recent years that the value of the goods and services they produce and sell outside the United States is now three times the total value of all American exports. And fully 60 percent of that external activity is in Europe.
Indeed, some global mutual funds are picking the American stocks in their portfolios partly on the basis of their exposure to Europe.
Fortis Global Growth, with $173 million in assets, owns American multinationals simply because they rank among the "best-managed growth-oriented companies anywhere in the world," said Jim Byrd, the Fortis executive vice president who manages the fund. Yet, he added, in his stock-picking, "Asia is a disaster, and Latin America is tied to Asia, so Europe wins by default."
Several American companies in his portfolio have recently expanded in Europe: Tellabs Inc., a manufacturer of phone equipment that plans to acquire the Ciena Corporation; Cisco Systems, a Tellabs competitor; the Enron Corporation, the energy company, and Service Corporation International, the funeral-home chain.
Many analysts say that there is no reason to be indirect about investing in Europe. Buying American stocks to enjoy Europe's boom, they note, can deny a portfolio the benefits that come with diversifying into a variety of markets.
And buying into Europe through the shares of American multinationals can be expensive; companies like General Electric, Coca-Cola or Gillette, all with strong European businesses, also trade at high price-to-earnings multiples, said Doug Wilde, an equity strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York.
"We see real opportunities in Europe by specifically tapping into European shares," he said.
Still, some American companies will reap direct benefits from forces at work in Europe. For example, said Mark Howdle, European equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in London, Europe's retailers and makers of brand-name products are likely to suffer as the euro lets Europeans scour the Continent for the cheapest goods. In turn, he said, benefits will accrue to American pioneers in electronic commerce, like Amazon.com, which recently acquired Internet booksellers in Britain and Germany.
Likewise, said Jeffrey Weingarten, global strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, Europe's big investment in technology will pay off for American companies like I.B.M., Intel and Microsoft.

HEADLINE: Where Single Boomers Are Stayin' Alive

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
THE first time Hara Taicher ventured out to a nightclub on the Upper East Side, she met Jerry Steinberg. No one wants to rush anything, but it appears to be love.
That happy tale would not be so unusual, except for the ages of the people involved. As romantic and social venues, nightclubs these days are generally the province of 20-something hipsters sporting tattoos and black miniskirts. But Ms. Taicher, a therapist, is 43, while Dr. Steinberg, an internist from Israel, is 49. 
 The 17-month-old club where they met, Decade, would never be confused with Balthazar, Spy, Moomba or any of the other night spots of the moment, where gatekeepers barely acknowledge a suit with a comb-over or a skirt with, well, gray roots.
With its elegant menu, wine cellar and late-70's dance music like "Shame" by Evelyn (Champagne) King and "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor pulsating from the sound system, Decade is geared to baby boomers looking to meet the same.
"This relationship is a place I've been really looking to get to for a long time," Ms. Taicher said. "Before I heard about Decade, I would never have gone to a club."
With growing ranks of people over 35 finding themselves single in a social world not set up for them, a niche is arising for clubs that cater to those with more years, more money and more unapologetically discriminate taste.
Never mind that baby boomers -- the original inventors of the New York singles scene back in the 1960's and 70's -- would seemingly have outgrown meeting people at bars. Some, no doubt, have. But plenty of others have been tempted back out again -- sometimes after a divorce, sometimes after years of frustration with less adventurous ways of meeting mates -- by nightclubs specially designed to put them at ease.
Decade is reminiscent of the Stork Club, where cocktails, dining and dancing all came under one roof. Beneath a flattering amber glow, patrons can enjoy a dinner of pan-seared salmon or braised lamb shank in an upstairs dining room that overlooks the dance floor. There is a private dining room in a 4,000-bottle wine cellar, and a room with private humidors for regular customers, at the top of the winding staircase.
"If you've been in a 20-something singles bar, you know that's no place for a grown-up," said Pepper Schwartz, a professor of sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle. "Quite honestly, you wouldn't want to compete in visual attractiveness with people in their 20's and 30's, who are arguably at the height of good looks and good bodies."
In New York City, besides Decade, on First Avenue, in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge, the over-35 crowd is hanging out at the popular Rhythm Revue Dance Party at the Roseland Ballroom in midtown, a giant monthly high school reunion of sorts that plays 50's, 60's and 70's music for some 2,000 enthusiasts, who remember the words from the first time around. The racially diverse, sold-out crowd likes to get its groove on until the wee hours.
On a recent Saturday, the disk jockey Felix Hernandez, spinning songs like "Mickey's Monkey" by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, "Cold Sweat" by James Brown, and "Heatwave" by Martha and the Vandellas received raves from the crowd that was jolted back to adolescence.
On the dance floor, crunchy granola met bargain basement chic as the partygoers danced the night away, including those who were emulating the look of Barry White and Chaka Khan. Some people even dug out their 60's radical clothes, including a man in a dashiki, who spent most of the evening cruising the periphery of the dance floor, giving off vibes that were too powerful for the women.
Those who prefer a more staid setting can nurse a glass of champagne at a growing number of revolving singles parties at private homes and upscale restaurants like Tavern on the Green and Maxine's, said Marion Smith, a New York City party planner, who has been in business for more than 20 years. In New York magazine, ads for baby boomer dating parties have doubled to about 30 in the last five years, Nancy J. Fedder, vice president of the magazine's classifieds, said.
Women are more likely to attend these kinds of soirees than men, which makes sense: women over 38 are more likely to be single than men in New York City. In 1996, the latest year for which figures are available from the United States Census Bureau, almost 59 percent of the single baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1961) in the city were women, and just 41 percent men. That's partly because the mortality rate of men in this age group is higher than for women.
"It shows why women in this age group would be nervous about their chances of getting married," said Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College. "And some of the men who are left are likely to be gay, especially in New York."
Natalie Brody considered this phenomenon when she conceived Decade. "I designed this place with women in mind. I know what it's like to be a single, divorced mother," said Ms. Brody, who has since remarried. "I want women who come here to feel comfortable."
Through its music, Decade allows boomers to recapture the heady, free-love days of the 60's and 70's that evolved into the "disco inferno" nights of the 80's before the AIDS scare -- which essentially erased the singles scene. Studio 54 died. Dinner became the social thing to do in the 80's. Then after the stock market crash in 1987, which marked the beginning of a recession, people started to stay home and rent videos.
"I went to Studio 54," Ms. Brody said. "I'm typical of that era. I have created that environment for people to come with their memories."
While a sexual undercurrent permeates the air, the over-35 patrons who frequent Decade are certainly more cautious about dating than they were in their youth.
Take Alan Stone, for example, a smartly dressed 51-year-old businessman, who has been divorced for seven years and has two grown children. He should know better than to try to meet Mrs. Right at a bar, but he says Decade is different. It draws people who are interested in long-term relationships, he said.
"I was a Woodstock kid," he said. "It was always bell-bottom jeans and crazy shoes. I was down in the Village all spaced out. But you grow up. You get more mature. You have your children. You want a career. So, you tend to mellow out, not rush things."
Robert A. Bell, 52, an investment banker and real estate investor, who lives on the Upper East Side, is a regular at Decade.
"Decade has filled a void, created a niche for people 35 and older on the Upper East Side," he said. "By the time you reach 35, you are somewhat mature. Manners are somewhat expected. People aren't necessarily shy about saying exactly what they're looking for in a person."
Bobby Zarin, 51, a real estate investor and owner of Zarin Fabrics in downtown Manhattan, who is separated, said supper clubs like the Rainbow Room satisfy the refined tastes of some boomers, but it plays big band, not disco.
"Most clubs are like Life in the Village, which has a very crowded dance floor," he said. "They have V.I.P. rooms for stars and actresses, and you just sit back on a sofa and have drinks. At Decade, you have food, plenty of people in my age bracket that now have money to spend. This club is not dealing with kids who have no money. You have the music of my generation in a nice atmosphere."
Anna Glynn, 43, a real estate broker from Staten Island, was at Decade with three friends on a recent Saturday evening to celebrate her sale of a $335,000 house on Todt Hill. She said the atmosphere at Decade was female-friendly, meaning men who were looking for dates were not sizing them up like morsels of meat.
Ms. Glynn, who has been divorced for 12 years and has a 16-year-old daughter, said she planned to return to the club in the hopes of meeting a mate. "My friend met a man there six months ago," she said. "Now they're engaged. Why not come back? Where else would I go?"

HEADLINE: INVESTING IN EUROPE: THE STRATEGIST;
New Currency, New Opportunities

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
FROM his vantage point as the chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank, Hanspeter Ackermann sees expanding opportunities for investors in a unifying Europe. As portfolio manager of the bank's closed-end New Germany fund, a $665 million growth fund invested primarily in midsize German companies, Mr. Ackermann is deploying money to pursue some of those opportunities. And as a Swiss citizen, he sees firsthand the significance of being inside or outside the euro club. SHARON R. KING
 
Q. How will investing in Europe change as a result of the creation of the single European currency?
A. The top-down style of selecting stocks, where you analyze country, industry and then go down to the stock level, probably becomes irrelevant. The opposite of that is a bottom-up manager, which basically is our style. We really don't look at macro themes, but much more company-specific data.
The concept of the country fund itself at some point will probably have to be wider. I can imagine that some funds might consider changing to a more European-based fund.
Q. How should American investors be thinking about the part of their portfolio that they will invest in a changing Europe?
A. Before, you had different countries, like Germany and France, individually fighting for market share. They all looked insignificant relative to a large country like the United States. Now this is changing. You have a major competitor -- let's just call it Europe. It has a much more powerful industrial base. It will not be inhibited by any cross-border taxation or inefficiencies.
What we're going to see here is a major structural change, much higher efficiency. I think that there will probably be more money allocated to Europe than in the past.
Q. What about countries that remain outside the monetary union?
A. For a country like Britain, it's probably less of an issue to be in or out, because it's a much larger economy with much less dependence on Europe. The U.K. has had more cross-border alliances with the United States than with Europe, so it will be easier for the U.K. to stand outside and to remain outside.
In the case of Switzerland, I see difficulties for that country to stay out and to compete with the border restrictions.
I'm not sure how much the financial sector will be affected, but you could see some impact mainly from the currency translation on other manufacturing sectors.
Right now the Swiss franc is relatively strong, and that's obviously damaging the export industry. But currency fluctuations may make it difficult for corporations to plan ahead. For the smaller European countries, sooner or later they're going to be forced into the same situation, where there will be an overwhelming economic case for joining the European Monetary Union. So, my guess will be they're all going to join over time.
Q. Will companies in countries outside of the monetary union have growth problems?
A. Yes. Distribution will be a problem.
I'm from Switzerland. When I walk through customs in Europe, they treat me like any other passport holder. But if you are part of the union, they basically just wave you through.
The same effect will probably occur on any distribution or licensing agreement. You would rather give the members of the union preferential treatment. So obviously there's an advantage to being part of the union.
Q. From an investment standpoint, will countries outside of the monetary union be riskier?
A. They should be. You're dealing with higher currency risk; then you have the economic risk of not gaining access to the same markets. There's even a risk of size, which means a liquidity risk.
Q. How do you pick stocks for the bank's funds?
A. There are five criteria. The most important is earnings momentum, to which we allocate roughly one-third of the investment decision-making.
Another third would be management. We look at the track record and the commitment to enhance the company's value. The final third is split between the financial strength of the company and its overall value versus the industry, the stock's history and the market itself.
Q. What are some stocks you own that fit your criteria?
A. One of our biggest holdings is Adidas. We have 8.6 percent of the fund in that company. They have acquired Salomon, the ski producer. When we look at other companies like Nike, or Puma in Europe, most of them have lost market share to Adidas-Salomon. And this is one of the few true growth stories in Germany, in our belief.
This company has excellent management. We see roughly 20 to 25 percent earnings growth consistently into the year 2000.
What's not included in that figure yet is the effects of the Salomon acquisition. Salomon has had its strength mainly in France, and Adidas has had its strength mostly in Germany. But now there should be a massive benefit from synergies.
We also like Continental A.G. We have about 4.3 percent of the fund in that. Continental has had compound earnings growth of about 25 percent for three years, and I think it has been overlooked by the market.
What's interesting is that they're really a leader in technology. There's huge free cash flow, and 1998 should be a turnaround year for the company as margins increase.
In Europe there are two other major tire companies, Pirelli and Michelin. In our view, there's no room for three major companies in Europe, so at some point you're going to see a merger or an alliance.
In Wella A.G., the beauty products company, we've seen a management turnaround. In the past, Wella's management has not been very open, and they came to a point in 1995 where the management disappointed and earnings fell by about 50 percent. That obviously shocked the market.
The perception was: We cannot trust that firm anymore. But the company did make changes within the management to come back and regain the confidence. I think we were one of the first to recognize that they are pursuing a much more shareholder-friendly attitude.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IN EUROPE: THE OVERVIEW;
A Joy Ride, So Far, in Euroland

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
AFTER a bout of winter blues that has dragged on for much of the last decade, European business has finally come back to life.
The best evidence is in the Continent's stock markets. From Spain to Germany, market indexes have outpaced those in the United States, with some climbing a third or more in just the last six months. 
 But the boom in Europe is more than a bull market. Europe is going through at least four historic financial transformations -- each of which is likely to alter the investment landscape for years to come, all of them likely to benefit investors:
 
CURRENCY UNION On Jan. 1, some 11 nations led by France and Germany will adopt the euro as a common currency, creating a unified economic entity almost as big as the United States. The euro looms behind every other major trend in Europe, accelerating the broad movement toward greater competition and free-market capitalism.
 
ECONOMIC CONVERGENCE For the first time this century, interest rates and inflation are now almost as low in Spain and Italy as they are in Germany. Thanks largely to the stringent economic requirements for joining the "euro club," governments across the Continent sharply reduced budget deficits and yoked themselves to austere monetary policies. Now the reward is at hand, in the form of faster growth and stable prices.
 
CORPORATE OVERHAUL Under growing competitive pressure worldwide, European conglomerates are embracing Wall Street's priorities: profits and the concept of "shareholder value." Companies that once were opaque to many investors are now listing their shares in New York and opening up their books. They are also slashing costs, selling off businesses that do not perform and merging like mad to shore up the rest.
The revamping has cost millions of European workers their jobs, and companies are still not as profitable, on average, as their American counterparts. But the renewed strength is measurable.
 
A STAMPEDE TOWARD STOCKS Perhaps the most profound change is the surge in equity investing by individual Europeans. As recently as two years ago, Europeans avoided stocks in favor of cautious securities like government bonds. Now they are flooding the stock markets with tens of billions of dollars, and most analysts expect the torrent to become even bigger in the next few years.
Analysts say the deluge has been driven by two big changes. One is lower interest rates, which have eroded returns on bonds. The second is the growing weakness in government-run pension programs, which are amassing mountains of commitments without the means to honor them. The result is a rush to mutual funds and a political trend toward promoting American-style private pension funds, which in turn become huge buyers of equities.
"You are looking at a set of circumstances that occur only a few times a century," said Phil De Cristo, head of operations in Continental Europe for Fidelity Investments. "We look at Europe as being our prime engine of growth over the next five years."
None of that means that Europe is a safe bet. For one thing, prices have climbed so far, so fast, that some markets may already be dangerously overvalued. For another, though most experts are increasingly confident that the new European Central Bank will establish stability and credibility for the euro, there is still ample room for problems. And even if the euro proceeds according to plan, it will create losers as well as winners.
Even so, European economic prospects are better than they have been in years. Total economic growth should reach 3 percent this year, possibly outpacing growth in the United States. Already, annual growth rates for Portugal, Spain and Finland are rising by about 4 percent, while Ireland is up by more than 8 percent.
"If you combine the prospects for economic growth, low budget deficits, low or negligible inflation and low interest rates, you have an economic proposition that is almost embarrassingly rich," said George Hodgson, head of equity research at the Dutch bank ABN-Amro.
 
Here Comes the Euro
Though the debut of the euro next year will have little direct impact on Europe's growth and prosperity, the preparations have had a huge effect on governments, companies and investors.
European political leaders reached the point of no return on May 3, when they formally decided to introduce the euro on Jan. 1 as the currency of 11 countries: Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Finland.
Britain, Denmark and Sweden decided to stay out of the monetary union, though they met the qualifications to join. Greece was the only member of the European Union that could not meet the standards, and it hopes to join in several years.
The euro has already transformed economic policy across the Continent, as governments slashed budget deficits and generous social programs. In the process, inflation was nearly eliminated in historically turbulent countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal. Interest rates in these so-called "Club Med" countries have plunged by half in just two years. Not surprisingly, stock markets in Madrid, Lisbon and Milan have soared faster than almost any others in Europe in the last year.
The advent of the euro also promises to alter profoundly Europe's capital markets. Though the actual bills and coins will not begin to circulate until 2002, stocks and bonds will be traded in euros on Jan. 1. In effect, that creates a huge new European market for stocks and bonds that could eventually rival Wall Street in global importance.
"With the European Union, what we are talking about is redefining the idea of a home market," said Mr. De Cristo of Fidelity. "You are creating a massive new entity, which is Europe or Euroland."
For corporations trying to raise capital, that is both good and bad news. On the one hand, it makes it easier to tap a much bigger pool of potential investors. But it also exposes them to bruising new international comparisons.
According to Salomon Smith Barney, for example, the average return on equity for Italian companies was about 9.9 percent last year. By contrast, German companies earned about 12 percent and Finnish companies earned nearly 21 percent. (In the United States, return on equity averaged about 20 percent.)
 
A Scramble for Position
Competition is also heating up in the real world, the market for goods and services. Even though the European Union already permits almost entirely free trade between member nations, the babble of different currencies continues to cloak price differences between identical products in different markets. In Germany, a cottage industry of automobile "re-importers" buys up Mercedeses and Volkswagens in neighboring countries and then re-sells them to Germans at prices lower than those of German car dealers.
In the new Europe, the camouflage disappears and price pressures are expected to increase. "The single currency will put pressure on manufacturers," acknowledged Manfred Gentz, the chief financial officer of Daimler-Benz. "But the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages, and that kind of competition is healthy anyway."
It had better be, because the scramble for position in the pan-European market has contributed to an accelerated pace of mergers and acquisitions. Daimler-Benz's stunning deal to take over the Chrysler Corporation, the third-largest American auto maker, was merely the most visible of many huge deals, others of which have involved European banks, retailers, chemical companies and steel producers. In dollars, the value of European mergers jumped to $484 billion in 1997, from about $170 billion in 1994.
"The whole philosophy behind the single market was to enable European companies to enjoy the same economies of scale that companies in the United States and Japan were perceived to enjoy," said Mark Howdle, head of European equity strategy at Salomon Smith Barney.
When they are not merging, Europe's industrial conglomerates have become increasingly preoccupied with improving their performance. One example: Royal Philips Electronics, the Dutch manufacturer of consumer electronics, saw profits nearly evaporate two years ago as a result of several flopped products and a disastrous alliance with Grundig A.G., the troubled German manufacturer. After severing ties to Grundig and cutting 6,000 jobs, Philips has bounced back with high profits and a soaring stock price.
While individual stories do not add up to a trend, there are broader signs of improvement. Excluding Britain, Europe has seen corporate return on equity climb to more than 14 percent in 1998, from about 11 percent in 1996, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
But that remains well behind performance in the United States, and pessimists interpret the numbers to mean that Continental Europe remains shy about serious revamping.
Optimists, though, see the data as evidence that European companies still have much opportunity for rapid increases in profitability. "The party is only beginning," said Mr. Hodgson.
 
Winning Fabulous Prizes
"We call it the Stock Market Game, but we take it very seriously," said Peter Nemec, host and producer of "3 Sat Borse", Germany's most popular television show for investors. A lot of other people take it seriously, too.
Every Friday night over a six-month period, three investment advisers compete on Mr. Nemec's show, offering their best stock picks. Each adviser is given an imaginary pot of 100,000 German marks, and the one whose pot is biggest at the end of six months wins the game.
Once upon a time, few people were interested. But today, as many as a million viewers tune in. And when contestants tout their newest favorites, traders say, those stocks routinely surge on Monday morning.
"The public has finally discovered stocks," exulted Mr. Nemec, who could barely scrape together 100,000 viewers when he started in 1988. "When I go to shopping on Saturdays, the shopkeepers recognize me and start asking me what stocks they should buy."
It is difficult to overstate the change in mind-set among investors in Germany, and, indeed, across most of Continental Europe. European investors who till recently favored the safety of bonds are a key force behind the bull market. Last year, they poured more than $70 billion into stock-oriented mutual funds, up from just $10 billion in 1996. In Italy, where interest rates have plunged by more than half in the last year, $7 billion flowed into stock funds in April alone. Spanish investors have been on a similar rampage.
In Germany, private households have more than doubled their stock holdings in the last three years, to about $300 billion. When Deutsche Bank started a new mutual fund for small European stocks last April, investors contributed more than $300 million in the first few days.
Such lemming-like behavior often is observed in overripe markets. And Europe's mobilization of money does not necessarily mean that its markets will continue to soar.
"Liquidity can be a dangerous animal," Mr. Hodgson said. After all, in an electronic marketplace where trillions of dollars move around the world every day, mutual fund and pension managers routinely redirect their money when conditions change.
Analysts also note that stock valuations are at historic highs in both Europe and the United States. Spain's red-hot stock market has retreated about 10 percent in the last month, apparently because investors became convinced that stock prices had lost touch with reality.
"European valuations look very rich," said David Bowers, an equity strategist for Merrill Lynch in London. "There isn't much room for disappointment."
But there are echoes in Europe's boom that make many investors take heart. The flood of money, they say, is reminiscent of what happened in the United States during the early 1980's, when inflation finally subsided and the bull market began to take off. As in the United States, European investors have proved dissatisfied with diminishing bond returns and low interest rates on savings.
"People who have gotten along on gilt-edged bonds suddenly realize that they have to get their returns up," said Jonathan Freeman, an investment banker at Beeson Gregory, a London-based stock brokerage firm. "It is a new game for a lot of people, but I think you are going to see it for a long time."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IN EUROPE: THE CHOICES;
The Old World Gets a New Market Map

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
WITH the birth of Euroland less than seven months away, it's high time for a deep rethinking of how American investors approach Europe.
Euroland is popular shorthand for the one-currency, 11-country monetary union and financial market area that will come into being on Jan. 1. It brings with it many promising opportunities for companies and investors alike. At the same time, it threatens to make some familiar investing strategies obsolete, and it raises the question of whether betting on just this single-currency market is a good idea. 
 Americans have shown a surging interest recently in Europe, with record flows of cash into European stock mutual funds. But the American financial services industry does not appear to be in a rush to change what it is now offering its investors and seems to be ignoring products like a Euroland index fund or a broad choice of actively managed Euroland mutual funds.
In fact, some argue that focusing on just the 10 active Euroland stock markets (Luxembourg has none) would mean missing good returns elsewhere in Europe.
"The Euroland concept, from a narrow perspective of creating funds, is a flawed one," said Nicholas Bratt, the head of the global equity group at Scudder Kemper Investments. "We would simply buy the best company we could find in Europe regardless of is specific domicile."
Investors face more questions than just geography. The role that indexes and index funds will play in the new region's markets is far from certain. And perhaps most important is the developing shift to a new investing style that selects stocks by sector rather than by country. Here is how these themes may play out in the new Europe.
 
Sectors vs. Nations
Before Euroland, European equity strategists began by picking a country, based on the forecast for interest rates, growth, earnings and inflation. Then they chose stocks in countries with the best outlook.
That system, analysts argue, will not be as effective now, because the new European Central Bank will try to keep interest rates and economic performance more in line for all Euroland countries.
That does not mean there will not be differences within Euroland, but it does mean that the era of making millions by exploiting them is over.
"Now it will be what sectors are most promising and what are the best stocks in that sector," said William P. Sterling, global strategist at BEA Associates, an investment management firm.
This new style spells trouble for popular closed-end single-country funds which, unless they adapt, will struggle to produce attractive returns, some analysts say.
"It slams the lid down on single-country funds," said Michael T. Porter, a country fund analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. (Article, page 6.)
Exchange-listed American depository receipts, another familiar way for Americans to invest in Europe, should remain attractive. Because they are priced in dollars, trade on American exchanges and conform to American accounting rules, they are easy for Americans to follow. (Unlisted A.D.R.'s trade over the counter and need not meet American standards.)
As always, an A.D.R.'s dollar value depends on movements in both the price of the underlying European stock and the value of the currency. Monetary union will eliminate the currency fluctuations among member nations, but their shared currency, the euro, will still rise and fall relative to the dollar.
Only a minority of top European companies trade as A.D.R.'s, however, and for some investors, the exposure they offer may not be broad enough.
For example, the Bank of New York compiles an index of 107 exchange-listed A.D.R.'s for Euroland, but many of the top 10 stocks in market capitalization for each country are missing. The bank is designing a product that would allow American investors to buy the A.D.R. index, but there are no details yet.
 
Seeking a Gauge
American investors love index funds, which simply buy all the stocks in a widely followed index like the Standard & Poor's 500. No Euroland analogue yet exists, and creating one will not be easy. One obstacle will be distinguishing for Americans between Europe and Euroland.
Dow Jones Indexes, along with the French, German and Swiss stock markets, has started a family of indexes for Europe and for Euroland collectively called Stoxx. Morgan Stanley Capital International introduced a 335-stock index for Euroland on April 30. Standard & Poor's, The Financial Times of London and Goldman, Sachs & Company have a 351-stock Eurobloc index, and The Financial Times and the London Stock Exchangehave a 100-stock index.
But these companies have been more successful in selling their indexes to fund managers and institutional investors as benchmarks for performance than in bringing index trading to American investors. None has a retail product ready to see daylight, though Dow Jones is promising one.
Suzanne M. Crosby, director of global marketing at Morgan Stanley, said, "Marketing Europe from a U.S. perspective is not a big revenue opportunity now."
Not even the Vanguard Group, the index fund leader, has plans for a Euroland fund. "We take a long-term view of things," said Brian S. Mattes, Vanguard's spokesman. "It must be a durable investment need, and it must go on for years." The company doesn't think Euroland passes the test.
Index investing by country can be done through the World Equity Benchmark Shares, or Webs, traded on the American Stock Exchange; they are based on Morgan Stanley country indexes. But no pan-European or Euroland Webs are planned.
 
Europe vs. Euroland
While there is hardly a rush to offer Euroland plays directly to American investors, plenty of analysts in the United States and Europe are trying to anticipate Euroland's effects and to spot ways to profit.
One is the index effect. The new indexes that aspire to become benchmarks include stocks that received scant attention in the country-picking era but will now be bought simply because of index membership.
"The visibility gainers are the ones in the smaller countries like Ireland, Austria, Portugal and Belgium," said Mark Howdle, European equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
Euroland will also provoke major shifts in existing portfolios, analysts argue. Money managers in specific European countries who view Euroland as a single market will de-emphasize domestic stocks and buy across borders. This shift, which seems to have begun, will move prices of many issues.
Ian Scott, the European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, noted in a recent report that the weighting for German stocks in a Euroland index would be around 27 percent, but by his estimate, German institutions and money managers now have 70 percent of their assets in German equities.
"On this evidence, there is plenty of scope for German institutions to diversify their portfolios," he wrote.
Some analysts argue that smaller-company stocks will be hurt most, as they are sold by money managers to make room for bigger stocks from other countries.
Murali Ramaswami, global head of equities derivative research at Lehman Brothers, said that while European stocks in general were becoming more sensitive to industry factors than to country factors, some companies and sectors would continue to be country-sensitive. He found commercial banks in France, Germany, Italy and Spain to be in that category.
Conversely, he said, the most industry-sensitive stocks varied from country to country: property and casualty insurance in France; mining, metals and minerals in Germany, and automobiles and utilities in Italy.
An increase in cross-border mergers within Euroland will also buoy some stocks, analysts predict, as consolidation picks up speed in oil, construction and -- especially in Italy -- in financial services.
Consumers taking advantage of monetary union to travel and to buy second homes may help some Euroland companies. On the other hand, the simplification of cross-border comparison shopping may hurt profits of airlines, retailers and brand-name goods makers accustomed to tailoring their prices from country to country.
But analysts point out that these factors do not add up to a night-and-day difference between investment opportunities inside and outside Euroland. American mutual fund managers seem to prefer Europe to Euroland as a playing field in both stocks and bonds.
Analysts agree that the unified Euroland government bond market will be larger and more liquid than the present array of national markets. But many say it is not an attractive bet right now, while potentially more enticing markets for corporate bonds and junk bonds will take time to develop.
Peter Askew, executive vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming International in London, said fixed-income investors would do best in a broader European or international bond fund that can take advantage of European opportunities outside Euroland.
Some analysts are betting on Greece, which hopes to join the union in the second round a few years from now. The required sharp cuts in Greek interest rates would mean big capital gains for bondholders, in the kind of "convergence play" that paid off handsomely as Italy and others prepared for Euroland's birth. (Article, page 7.)
N. Graham Allen, the managing director for global fixed-income at Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles, likes Britain, the biggest European player not in Euroland, for the same reason; he thinks Britain will decide to join before too long.
Equity analysts also say it is difficult to ignore Britain. A Euroland stock fund, Mr. Bratt of Scudder Kemper said, "omits the largest stock market in Europe, and that seems undesirable to me." He said his company's closed-end New Europe fund also includes emerging markets like Poland and Hungary that he would be loath to exclude by investing solely in Euroland.
Stock markets are performing well across Europe, so for American investors, the question of Euroland versus all of Europe may seem academic. The important choice is whether to invest in Europe, by any definition, or not.

3 MacArthur Fellows Are Adding Value to the World of Money

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
EVERY year since 1981, it has been a cross between a Pulitzer and a lottery: the fellowship program of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which awards sizable, no-strings-attached grants to a diverse group of creative thinkers.
To choose recipients, the foundation uses a confidential group of nominators and a selection committee. Earlier this month, the foundation announced 29 such fellows -- distributing grants, to be paid over five years, that ranged from $220,000 to $375,000, depending on the recipient's age. 
 Among the winners were three whose work involves innovative perspectives on money matters: a rancher who has taken steps to preserve his Southwestern way of life; a geographer who studies how labor and political issues help mold a cultural landscape, and an economist who aims to apply the ideals of feminism and the left to calculations of productivity.
 
Nancy Folbre
Melding the Political And the Economic
Nancy Folbre has made a career as a feminist and an economist -- and of showing that the two titles are not mutually exclusive.
Since earning her doctorate in economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1979, Ms. Folbre, 45, has focused much of her research on nonmarket work, like child-rearing and caring for elderly relatives. She contends that these unpaid roles, often filled by women, should be included when determining a nation's productivity.
Ms. Folbre, now a professor at the university, defines this and other "care work" -- like teaching and nursing -- as largely "first-name-basis" jobs that involve helping others in a close way. Because such work is not valued economically, "care is being driven out of business," she said.
What results is more than just a scarcity of people to fill those unpaid and underpaid roles, but, she argues, a reduction in the quality of the work.
"We've made a lot of progress in getting people to recognize the worth of quantitative work," she said. "But also, what is the quality of it? Is it rich, is it careful, is it high quality? Economists should care about quality as much as quantity."
Nurses, for example, say they have so many patients that "they no longer have time on their job to hold people's hands," she said. She considers quality care a "public good" and likens it to a clean environment: "Everyone enjoys and benefits from it, but it's hard to get people to actually pay for it."
News of the $280,000 award came while she was in Europe attending a conference of the International Association for Feminist Economics, a group she helped found. The European Union and other nations already have plans to survey the worth of nonmarket work; in that regard, she said, "the United States is lagging behind."
Ms. Folbre said she would use some of the grant to support the Center for Popular Economics, a nonprofit group where she is a staff economist that runs workshops for advocates of social change. Its mission of economic literacy is in accord with her conviction that an economy can be changed at the grass-roots level.
"If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't bother," she said. In fact, her first project with the windfall will not be a scholarly work but a revision of her popular book, "The New Field Guide to the U.S. Economy" (New Press, 1995) a cartoon-enhanced review meant to provide intellectual ammunition for people with a liberal bent.
Such individuals, she said wryly, need to be able to refute comments like " 'That's very nice and very sweet but that's not efficient; we can't compete in a global economy if we spend money on health care and education and welfare.' "
Ms. Folbre said: "It's important to give people a vocabulary of economics to be able to engage in debate." JULIE FLAHERTY

Hospital Nurses' Vote Ends an 18-Month Labor Dispute

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR 

 BODY:
After an 18-month labor dispute, Long Island College Hospital and its nurses' union have agreed on a new contract. The 600 nurses voted to ratify the deal late last week.
Elaine Charpentier, a lead negotiator for the union, the New York State Nurses Association, characterized the contract as a compromise. It offers the nurses better job security and the hospital some givebacks. 
 "The economics are sparse," said Ms. Charpentier, referring to the compensation the nurses will receive. "But with this contract, the nurses worked with the hospital to help it out financially, and the hospital did its part to insure their jobs." For example, the new contract will minimize the hospital's power to lay off nurses, allowing no more than 15 dismissals between now and the contract's expiration in June 2000.
According to Ms. Charpentier, the hospital had planned to lay off as many 180 nurses in the future.
But the contract also includes concessions by the nurses, such as suspending for two years their annual $900 length-of-service, or step, salary increase. That suspension will save the hospital -- and cost the nurses -- an estimated $1.5 million.
The contract, much of which is retroactive to January 1997, includes a variety of other provisions, such as early-retirement incentives for nurses with 20 years of experience.
In a statement, Long Island College Hospital said, "We are pleased to bring this matter to an amicable resolution."
The new agreement came about shortly after Alvin Blyer, the regional director of the National Labor Relations Board, issued a complaint that the hospital had negotiated in bad faith by withholding cost-cutting information during contract talks. The hospital has denied the claims in the complaint, issued June 4. But on Friday, Mr. Blyer said he had signed off on a request by the nurses' union to withdraw the complaint, averting a potentially acrimonious and costly hearing on it in August.
The previous contract for the nurses at the 551-bed hospital expired in January 1997. The hospital, after declaring an impasse in the negotiations in May 1997, imposed a number of cost-cutting measures that it said it needed to stay solvent. These measures, which are invalidated by the new contract, included the reduction of nurses' starting salaries by $4,500. RICHARD WEIR

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Creating a Cosmic Map Worthy of Dr. Seuss

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON 

 BODY:
COSMOLOGISTS intent on understanding the origin of the universe are faced with an insurmountable problem: there is no way to do a controlled experiment. They can speculate all they like about how the cosmos unfolded from the great explosion called the big bang, but they can't directly test their ideas by growing universes in a laboratory, nurturing them under different conditions and seeing which ones live or die.
Evolutionary biologists are faced with a similar problem -- they can't rewind the tape of history and study the various ways life could have marched forth from the primordial soup. But they are blessed with a powerful fallback. They can study a variety of creatures and, through the process of induction, piece together a persuasive story. 
 There can be no such thing as a cosmological anatomist, jumping from universe to universe gathering data on how different ones behave. With no real universes to study other than their own, cosmologists have turned to the next best thing. They build computer simulations of the original fireball and watch it explode. Last week, at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San Diego, Dr. August Evrard of the University of Michigan described the biggest simulation yet: the entire visible universe, 10 billion light years across, captured in a Cray computer at the Max Planck Society's computing center in Garching, Germany.
Artificial life (simulating living creatures) and artificial intelligence (simulating minds) have been joined by artificial cosmology, the art of creating a universe in a box.
With money coming from many sources here and abroad, Dr. Evrard said, it was hard to put a dollar figure on the project. "Whatever the exact numbers are," he added, "I'm confident that the taxpayers in all countries involved will feel they got the whole universe for a pretty fair price -- especially when compared to the cost of building observatories."
In a mere three days, 10 billion years of cosmic history can be replayed inside the supercomputer, tended by an international team called the Virgo Consortium. What results are colorful computer images showing how the matter in the universe may have been distributed at various times in its life. Each of these snapshots occupies 28 billion bytes of memory and can be compressed to a mere 16 billion bytes, small enough to fit on a few hard drives. One can almost imagine tiny galaxies, solar systems and planets with creatures clinging to them, like Dr. Seuss's Whos of Whoville, faintly calling: "We are here! We are here!"
 
Playing God
If only the grain were so fine. The artificial cosmos is more like the rough simulations of the Earth people have mounted on stands in their offices and dens. By giving the globe a spin in the wrong direction, one can play God and make the sun rise in the west. Though one can see continents and countries and a few of the largest cities and mountains, there are no buildings, people or trees.
The smallest things in the new man-made universe are rather coarse lumps of matter called particles, each representing 10 galaxies. Anything more detailed is washed away. No matter how hard you squint, you aren't going to find the Earth, the Sun, or even the Milky Way. The idea is to concentrate on the big picture, by studying how tiny ripples in the embryonic universe could have been amplified into the sprawling structures that appear today.
In fact, an earthling, digitized and projected into the artificial world, wouldn't see a thing -- not even starlight. For reasons of economy, all that was actually simulated was the invisible dark matter, currently believed to make up as much as 90 percent of creation. In the grand scheme of things, we creatures of luminous matter, the very inventors of the simulation, were deemed irrelevant.
But as computer power and memory size increase, the universe will inevitably be captured with a finer mesh, becoming more detailed and inclusive. One can imagine increasing the resolving power until each separate galaxy snaps into focus. Make the simulation finer still and the swirls and arms would emerge. Then the individual stars would come out. Solar systems would congeal from the stellar dust.
Why stop at the planetary level? The cosmologist Frank Tipler has proposed, to the consternation of most of his colleagues, that life and intelligence are a necessary ingredient in the shaping of the universe. A true simulation would thus have to include simulated creatures -- artificial life.
 
Calling M.C. Escher
So let the simulated atoms cooked up in the simulated stars form molecules and cells and plants and animals. If their nervous systems evolve enough excess brain power, the inhabitants will need something deep to think about. At some point they might start wondering about the world around them, and start building artificial spaceships and probes. They might even mimic creation on their own simulated computers.
Several years ago, the computer scientist Edward Fredkin came up with the entertaining notion that our own universe is a simulation running on some kind of giant computer. Why not have within it the simulation of another universe, and within that the simulation of another, and on and on -- a cybernetic house of cards? Pull the plug on one universe and all those it is supporting come crashing down.
Cosmologists like to tell the story about the little old lady interrupting a lecture by the great thinker, who is earnestly describing the scientific view of the cosmos. In some versions it's Bertrand Russell, in others Albert Einstein. "You've got it all wrong, sonny," the woman says. "The Earth is sitting on the back of a giant turtle."
The scientist, amused, answers, "Oh, and what is that turtle standing on?"
"Another turtle," she says. And before he can interrupt with the obvious objection, she adds: "Don't waste your time asking. It's turtles all the way down."
That's the problem with models of the universe -- it's so tempting to mistake them for the real thing.

Abraham Lincoln, Deadbeat

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
House Republicans last week excoriated their fellow Americans as a bunch of deadbeats casually running up debts and then disingenuously pleading bankruptcy to wipe their slates clean.
A record 1.4 million people declared bankruptcy last year -- evidence, lawmakers said, that a tighter law and more personal responsibility were in order. 
 The Republicans did not mention that one of their party's most prominent members was a self-declared "insolvent debtor" who would surely have filed for bankruptcy had the current laws been available to him.
In 1832 a young man named Abraham Lincoln bought a small general store in New Salem, Ill., with a partner. On credit, they acquired the inventory of other nearby stores.
The economy was booming, but the two prairie entrepreneurs could not make a go of it and began sliding into debt.
Lincoln sold his share, but when his partner died he became liable for $1,000 in debts, according to Gerald Prokopowicz, a scholar at the Lincoln Museum in Fort Wayne, Ind.
Creditors hauled Lincoln into court, and the sheriff seized his only assets -- his survey equipment and his horse. The store, in Lincoln's phrase, "winked out."
As a budding state legislator in 1835, Lincoln introduced a bill to provide relief for insolvent debtors. But it didn't pass, and Honest Abe was still repaying his debts "well into the 1840's," said Kim Bauer, curator at the Illinois State Historical Library.
It was so onerous that Lincoln called it "my national debt." KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

What China Sees in Clinton

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
THE Chinese have an old saying, describing donkey dung, that pokes fun at their culture's obsession with appearances: "Shiny on the outside, smelly within."
Looking good is important, in other words, even when a situation is imperfect. 
 President Clinton's visit to China, scheduled to begin June 25, is likely to be about appearances more than anything else. No real diplomatic breakthrough looks possible, since the United States and China remain far apart on key issues like Taiwan and human rights. With the Clinton Administration extra sensitive to recent accusations that it sold out national security for business interests, no big commercial deals are likely to be showcased either.
 
Showtime
That's fine with China's leaders, who care about appearances above all. Even without substance, the first visit by an American President since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square is tremendously important to Communist Party bosses in Beijing, largely for the way it symbolizes approval of their rule. Playing host to the President of the United States, and doing it well, shores up the legitimacy of Chinese leaders before their own people.
For this reason, some of China's critics in Washington have called on Mr. Clinton to avoid, at the very least, participating in a welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square -- the traditional red-carpet welcome that Beijing insists upon. Many members of Congress argue that China should be punished for its abysmal record on human rights and arms proliferation. In response, Mr. Clinton made the case last week that sticking to a policy of cooperation and engagement with China offers more reward than risk.
But both sides of this debate gloss over the larger and far more important reality: contacts between the two countries are now primarily characterized by a deeply enmeshed commercial relationship -- not to mention an array of educational and cultural exchanges -- that leaves the two governments to play a steadily smaller and less significant role.
In 1972, President Nixon's visit to China was critically important to any Chinese or American citizen who wanted to do business or even travel between the two countries. In 1998, whether or not President Clinton travels to China will have little noticeable effect on the billions of dollars of goods now traded in each direction, or on the hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Americans who travel between the two countries to work, study and teach. To them, President Clinton's visit represents little more than an affirmation of an economic reality that is streaking far ahead of politics.
The countless Chinese consumers who sip Coca-Cola and wear Motorola pagers reflect the commerical ties between China and the United States that are here to stay, no matter what Congress or the White House has to say. Even if the United States were to revoke China's normal or "most favored nation" trading status -- a step no Administration has taken since it was first granted in 1980 -- the only effect would be higher American tariffs on some Chinese exports, while American sales within China would no doubt continue to roar ahead.
 
Smile
With this economic reality as the backdrop, and with Mr. Clinton's visit concerned with gloss over substance, he and his Chinese hosts next week will likely concentrate on camera angles.
The ideal, for Chinese leaders, is a seamless cascade of televised images showing Mr. Clinton in one picturesque Chinese setting after another, alternately wowed by the majesty of the Great Wall and charmed by the humble kindness of villagers -- and, most important, standing shoulder to shoulder with President Jiang Zemin, as they look out on the world as equals.
The nightmare, in the Chinese view, would be an unexpected disruption of Mr. Clinton's trip by political dissidents. That could be interpreted by the Chinese people as an embarrassing sign that their leaders are not in control.
That nightmare actually occurred when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union visited China in May 1989. Student demonstrations engulfed Beijing in the weeks before his arrival, and during his five-day visit protests spread to cities throughout the nation. It wasn't until weeks later that the democratic clamorings were brutally subdued.
Both dissidents and the authorities are mindful of the Gorbachev experience. Dissidents in China know that when a major foreign leader comes to town, the authorities are loath to crack heads in public, making it a good time to get out a message. And the authorities know they know. So China's security services are now working overtime to snuff out any flicker of dissidence well before Mr. Clinton's arrival.
Such repression and the overall importance that China's leaders attach to the Clinton visit are measures of how insecure they are, not only regarding their own authority, but also regarding China's place in the world. China plays an odd role on the world stage, wielding veto power at the United Nations in a way that the West generally views as responsible, even as Beijing is having a hard time shedding its reputation as a rogue inclined to irresponsibly traffic in arms and missile technology.
China's ambiguous international stature may reflect a deeper conflict in its sense of itself. Despite the nation's size and growing economic power, its leaders mix an ancient sense of superiority with a more modern realization that China is inferior to most of the world in terms of wealth and technology.
Mr. Clinton's visit is indeed largely symbolic. But looking good is important when the situation is imperfect.

HEADLINE: Bickering In the Clubhouse;
Lawsuits Against Golfing Giant Disrupt a Manicured Kingdom

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
THAT makes a perfect country club? It should be "a haven of refuge" dedicated to "the genuine care and comfort of our members," said Robert H. Dedman Sr., founder and chairman of Club Corporation International, a leading operator of country clubs and other such genteel gathering spots.
It should be a civilized place, he said, one that can be proudly shown to your friends, where the staff addresses you by name -- "at least four times during each visit" -- and always remembers your favorite cocktail. And while it should be a place where your opinions are sought and respected, "a club is not meant to be a debating society and a place of disputation." 
 A surprising number of the company's clubs, though, have become just that. In the last two years, at least 7 of Clubcorp's 70 country clubs have produced lawsuits filed by either members, homeowners or, in one case, a club's co-owner.
The complaints -- roundly rejected by the company -- go to the heart of what many members look for when they pay thousands of dollars a year to join a club: privilege and prestige.
These are not the clubs found in the novels of Auchincloss and O'Hara. Of the 10,000 or so country clubs in America, about half are that sort -- nonprofit "equity clubs" owned and operated by members. Most of the rest are run for profit, usually by a management company like Clubcorp, which might lease the club property or own it outright or in partnership.
Several of the lawsuits contend that in Clubcorp's case, members lose out. The company, which makes reciprocal privileges among its clubs a big selling point, lets too many outsiders use the clubs in popular resort areas, some unhappy members contend. These include members of the Indian Wells Country Club in California, familiar to armchair golfers as a regular site of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic tournament, who are seeking arbitration of the dispute.
Others accuse Clubcorp of breaking its promises to maintain high standards and of draining away club resources. A few cases have involved accusations of remarkably rough-handed tactics by the company, steps that seemed intended to silence critics -- even when those critics were club members.
Terry A. Taylor, senior vice president and general counsel for Clubcorp, acknowledged that the number of lawsuits against the company is higher than it has been for several years but emphasized that it is still "negligible for a company our size." Moreover, he said, the company has already prevailed in some disputes and expects to do so in all of them.
In an interview at the company's clubby Dallas offices, Robert H. Dedman Jr., who succeeded his father as chief executive last year, grew angry at questions about the flurry of litigation. "This is a very, very minor issue," he said. "Occasionally we may not make everybody happy. But we have built an excellent business" by pleasing members.
Indeed, it is Clubcorp's reputation for treating members with kid gloves that makes all the disputes so surprising. "That is the most litigation against a management company that I've heard of," said James Singerling, a 35-year veteran of the golf industry who is executive director of the Club Managers Association of America, in Alexandria, Va.
Besides country clubs, Clubcorp owns six golf resorts, including the Homestead in Hot Springs, Va., and the Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, where the 1999 United States Open will take place. It also owns or operates 70 city dining clubs, including the Metropolitan Club in Chicago, and 24 city athletic clubs, like the San Francisco Tennis Club.
In all, it says, its clubs had almost 230,000 members as of January, making it a giant in a fragmented field. Its principal rival is the American Golf Corporation of Santa Monica, Calif., perhaps best known for its management of top-notch public courses.
Here in its hometown, there is considerable speculation that Clubcorp, which is now family-controlled, will soon sell shares to the public, and Mr. Dedman Sr. does not deny it. "The closer I get to all my stock going to public institutions -- which is where it will go -- the closer we will come" to some change in the company's status, he said.
But if Clubcorp is the best proof of the money to be made by marketing what the company calls the "private club experience," the disputes show that careful attention to the fine print and a clear understanding of how clubs are governed are as important to potential members as a strong tee shot and a grasp of golfing etiquette.
 
Limited Rights for Members
The Dedmans reject the suggestion that Clubcorp ignores the wishes of members -- even though, unlike those who belong to member-owned clubs, they have only those rights Clubcorp gives them, aside from contract-law protections enforceable in court. Members of for-profit clubs, the Dedmans point out, have no obligation to finance club deficits. And since they are typically leading citizens, they have no trouble being heard, Mr. Dedman Jr. added.
Clubcorp's surveys show that 87 percent of members think their clubs "met or exceeded" expectations; the rest, he noted, can always leave.
Attracting enough members to replace those who do resign has been a challenge, at least in recent years. Mirroring industry trends, Clubcorp added just 25 net new members in 1993, when club dues lost their status as a tax deduction, and membership shrank slightly in each of the next three years, according to company financial statements.
In 1997, though, membership at clubs it has owned more than 18 months grew by 3,171, or about 1.6 percent. (Though private, Clubcorp files financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission because it has so many employee shareholders.)
Still, steadily adding clubs in the 90's, Clubcorp has grown into a major force in golfing, with assets at the end of last year of just over $1 billion. In 1997, it reported revenues of $840 million, up 34 percent over five years, and profits of $121.9 million, up 119 percent in that period. And it is poised to grow larger, with a $300 million credit line that it intends to use for additional acquisitions.
The company bears the strong stamp of Mr. Dedman Sr., described by one industry executive as "the Henry Ford of the club management business." His energy is legendary: in just four years after high school, according to a company biography, he earned degrees in engineering, economics and law, served two years in the Navy and worked full time for two years during law school. From humble Arkansas roots, he rose to become personal counsel to the oil billionaire H. L. Hunt.
In the mid '50s, noticing how the new Thunderbird Country Club improved property values in the area of Palm Springs, Calif., he envisioned a company that would develop and manage clubs for profit. In 1957, he opened Brookhaven Country Club in Dallas, with three 18-hole courses, and it became the seed of Clubcorp. Today, he is regularly included in Golf Digest's listings of the most powerful figures in golf and is in the top third of Forbes's list of the 400 richest Americans.
At the company, Mr. Dedman and his son, who became chief financial officer in 1987 after a three-year stint at Salomon Brothers, are known as "Robert" and "Bob" -- the son preferred that to "Bob" and "Bobby." Outside, both are known as tough businessmen -- the younger Mr. Dedman's personality is "stronger than bull meat," said Byron Barlow, a member of Clubcorp's Las Colinas Country Club in Irving, Tex.
But Mr. Barlow, among a half-dozen members whose names were supplied by Clubcorp, had nothing but praise for its performance at his club. "They have the strength of management, the continuity of management and the economies of scale to make the deal work, and member satisfaction is very high," he said, though he added that Las Colinas voted to decline reciprocal privileges rather than open its doors to members of other Clubcorp properties.
Others on the list were similarly delighted. "Clubcorp made a lot of commitments up-front, some of them oral, and I can't think of a single one they have not lived up to," said Bob Millan, at Glen Oaks Country Club in West Des Moines, Iowa.
 
Dispute Over a Tower
If all members were as happy as these, Clubcorp's lawyers would not have been so busy lately.
Among those who are not happy are the clients of M. David Bland, a lawyer who represents homeowners in the Village of Raintree, a 1,600-home planned community just outside Charlotte, N.C., who have sued Clubcorp over its operation of the Raintree Country Club.
"Almost every single time they told us something, it turned out not to be correct," Mr. Bland said. Clubcorp took over the lease to operate Raintree in November 1985. The club, its golf course and the community's other open spaces are owned by the homeowners associations.
In August 1992, the homeowners sued Clubcorp's local affiliate, filing a complaint that accused the company of defaulting on the terms of its lease by exceeding a pre-existing membership limit and by allowing the club to deteriorate. The lawsuit dragged on, and in July 1996, Elizabeth Smith, president of a Raintree homeowner group, saw construction equipment rolling onto a knoll on the edge of a fairway.
It was there, it turned out, to build a concrete bunker the size of a two-car garage, on top of which would be a 150-foot cellular-phone tower. Furious, Ms. Smith got her camera and called her lawyer, Mr. Bland.
In January 1997, when there was no response to his letter warning that homeowners considered the tower a violation of Clubcorp's lease, the homeowners terminated the agreement, according to court records. Clubcorp resisted, and Mr. Bland obtained a court order last June evicting the company.
Mr. Taylor, the company's general counsel, said there was nothing illegal or improper about the tower, which he said is simply "a flagpole, and somewhat attractive at that."
The court has appointed a receiver to run the club while Clubcorp appeals, but Mr. Bland pointed out that an appellate victory would simply give Clubcorp the right to defend itself in the original 1992 lawsuit -- which, he said, had been rendered moot by the eviction order.
The long battle has left its scars on the club's atmosphere, Ms. Smith said. "My friends tell me that it is just not as much of a warm and friendly place," she said.
Raintree was not alone in complaining that Clubcorp exceeded membership limits. Discontent over golfers with reciprocal privileges using members' supposedly private fairways is cited in almost all the recent disputes. But it is an especially sore point at Indian Wells.
In 1994, Clubcorp joined with a nonprofit corporation formed by club members to buy the mountain-ringed property at auction. The members' corporation contributed half the purchase price of about $15 million and kept title to the land; Clubcorp acquired the clubhouse and other physical property, along with the right to operate the golf oasis as a private club.
But by 1997, the number of visiting golfers led to an angry exchange of letters between Clubcorp's local manager and the chairman of the member-owned corporation.
"There is a considerable amount of unrest at Indian Wells," wrote Richard Roemer, chairman of the members' company. "Management has opened the golf course to outside play and tournaments during the May-through-October period to such an extent that the club is, in effect, a public facility."
The manager, Doug Howe, had argued in an earlier letter that the revenue generated by visiting players was essential, because the club had not attracted enough new members. The dissident members countered that it would be easier to sell new memberships if that was the only way golfers could enjoy the club -- and if Clubcorp had operated Indian Wells as a first-class club.
Fred Sardella, an outspoken member of the nonprofit corporation's board, as well as the club's advisory board, complained that Clubcorp "just didn't do what they said they would -- this is not a private club, as they promised it would be."
Mr. Roemer's December letter, which requested arbitration, gave Clubcorp formal notice that in the members' view it had failed to comply with its lease.
Mr. Dedman Sr. visited Indian Wells a few weeks ago, meeting with both the advisory board, which reports to Clubcorp management, and directors of the nonprofit corporation. The dispute, still unresolved, resulted from "miscommunication" between those groups, he said.
Clubcorp reports that on average, only about 1 percent of the rounds played at its clubs are by golfers exercising reciprocal privileges.
Clubcorp seems to have resolved a similar dispute at the handsome Canyon Gate Country Club, situated within a gated community in Las Vegas -- but not before being sued by a half-dozen members over the number of visiting golfers. Records subpoenaed from the club showed that "often more than 20 percent of the tee times were going to unaccompanied nonmembers," said Douglas A. Mitchell, the lawyer who represented Canyon Gate members.
Mr. Taylor, Clubcorp's general counsel, said the plaintiffs represented a small group of malcontents. The suit was settled, Mr. Mitchell said, when Clubcorp and the members negotiated limits on outside play. So far, he said, his clients seem happy.
 
Disputes Over Accounting
Some disputes Clubcorp has faced in recent years focused on allegations that it had drained away assets and maintained haphazard ledgers to obscure misuse of revenues.
 In one such case, Clubcorp was sued in 1996 by two members of the Errol Estates Country Club in Apopka, Fla., after it announced plans to convert the club into a semipublic course. The case was settled when Clubcorp sold the facility to members in 1997.
But the dispute was long in developing, said one member of the club's advisory board, Grant Shrum. For years, Mr. Shrum said, excessive use and poor maintenance had caused the golf course to deteriorate seriously. "They just used up the assets of this club," he said.
Mr. Taylor denied that, saying Clubcorp had simply decided Errol Estates could not survive economically as a private club and was happy to sell it to members. The lawsuit, he said, was simply an attempt to push down Clubcorp's asking price.
The members are now rebuilding the club and attracting new golfers, Mr. Shrum said. But he added that the club found itself with a financial overhang from Clubcorp's accounting practices.
Errol Estates, he said, must raise nearly $2 million in the coming decades to meet its obligation to refund deposits that Clubcorp had collected from new members. Though the company had promised refunds after 30 years, it did not set aside money for that purpose.
Rather, according to Clubcorp's financial disclosures, it treated such deposits at its clubs as tax-free, long-term loans, which exceeded $380 million in 1996. James Hinckley, president of Clubcorp's country clubs and resorts division, said the deposits were treated as income by each club, which used them to finance capital improvements or other expenses. Deposits will be refunded out of cash flow, Mr. Taylor added, and remain a liability of each club.
Perhaps the nastiest dispute over Clubcorp's financial record-keeping pits it against Tohato Inc., a Japanese snack-food company and a partner in the Pinewild Country Club development adjacent to the Pinehurst resort in North Carolina. In 1996, Tohato sued Clubcorp, accusing it of fraudulently enriching itself at Tohato's expense. When two Tohato executives in Pinehurst publicly accused Clubcorp of "racketeering" and other crimes -- and encouraged law-enforcement agencies to investigate -- Clubcorp sued for libel. This month, it won a preliminary injunction silencing the executives.
While law-enforcement agents have questioned participants in some Clubcorp disputes, their agencies will not comment. Clubcorp says the inquiries were prompted solely by false statements from Tohato.
 
Trouble for Critics
Despite these messy disputes, Clubcorp executives emphasize that a vast majority of members are happy, and that may well be true. But the bylaws at many of its clubs and its aggressive legal tactics make it risky for club members to be anything but happy -- at least publicly.
At the Pinehurst Country Club, a private club for local residents on the grounds of the Pinehurst Resort, members had obtained a consent decree from a prior owner that gave them significant protections, including limits on dues increases and excessive play by resort guests. But in 1990, six years after Clubcorp bought the resort, it precipitated a legal battle when it sought to reinterpret the consent decree. After members prevailed at trial on many points, the company won a reversal on appeal in 1996; the case is awaiting reconsideration by the lower court.
In November 1995, in the midst of the dispute, one club member, Edmund E. Dietrich, wrote a letter to the local newspaper, citing employee complaints that tips were not being fully disbursed to them. According to court documents, Clubcorp's lawyers demanded a retraction. Mr. Dietrich, 72, agreed to apologize if Clubcorp would show him records refuting the employee complaints. He returned from a holiday trip in December 1995 to find that Clubcorp had sued him for libel and slander.
Clubcorp withdrew the suit in October 1996, just before Mr. Dietrich was to inspect the financial records. But Mr. Dietrich incurred more than $5,000 in legal fees and many anxious moments, he said later.
Mr. Taylor said Clubcorp sued because its Pinehurst employees asked the company "to take a stand, because what he said was not true." Local managers simply felt Mr. Dietrich "went too far, and they decided that enough was enough," he added.
Criticizing Clubcorp has also produced anxious moments for some members of the Porter Valley Country Club in Northridge, Calif. A group of members there have sued Clubcorp, accusing it of exceeding the club's membership cap and then lying to the advisory board about it.
Mr. Taylor said the lawsuit was based on allegations from a disgruntled former employee and was without merit. "I fear truthfully that some of those members joined that action without realizing what they were getting into," he said.
But Clubcorp is making things clear. As it is entitled to do under club bylaws, it has added a pro-rated amount of its substantial legal expenses to the plaintiffs' monthly statements of club charges. Not surprisingly, several plaintiffs have withdrawn from the suit.
Was all this "disputation" avoidable? One has to consider the source of the complaints, Mr. Dedman Sr. said. "I've never been aware of any of these disputes being started by highly successful people who run highly successful businesses," he said.
"And I am not aware of any lawsuits we've lost."
Still, Mr. Dedman attributes his company's success to gracious accommodation, not legal aggression. "Our No. 1 rule has always been that the members are always right," he said with a grin. "Our No. 2 rule is, anytime a member may appear to be wrong, remember rule No. 1."
And his company's culture drills that lesson into the hearts and minds of its local club managers through an extensive program of management training, top executives said. As Mr. Dedman Jr. put it, "We're actually in the relationship business."
 
Looking Before You Putt
AS more people can afford to join country clubs, "you'll find that this becomes a much more scrutinized industry," said James Singerling, executive director of the Club Managers Association of America.
And careful scrutiny is a member's best protection, said L. Louis Mrachek, a lawyer with Gunster, Yoakley, Valdes-Fauli & Stewart of Miami, which specializes in country club litigation.
Prospective members should study membership documents and the club's bylaws and articles of incorporation, or ask someone they trust to do so, Mr. Mrachek said. Only then, he said, can they fully understand their rights. And once they become members, they should monitor any bylaw amendments and act quickly if the change is unfavorable.
Beyond bylaws, state contract law may require that bylaw changes be "reasonable" and not alter the "basic concept or scheme" of the club, Mr. Mrachek explained. But the only way to challenge such changes may be to go to court, which can be risky if club bylaws hold dissident members responsible for the club's legal fees, lawyers said.
Member-owned clubs are not immune from dissent, said Terry A. Taylor, Clubcorp's general counsel. "In fact," Mr. Taylor said, "given the factions that usually arise in member-owned clubs, I would suspect that if the member is so inclined, he or she could have more influence on operations at one of our clubs."

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Oh, THAT George Bush;
Wins of the Father Are Visited on the Son

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
MORE than two years before Election Day, polls say a Republican front-runner in the 2000 Presidential race has already emerged. He is a one-term Governor who has never run for national office but has, according to one recent poll, already overtaken Vice President Al Gore, the popular Democrat who has been running for the White House for 20 years.
But this isn't just any governor. This is George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas, not to be confused with his father, George Herbert Walker Bush, the former President who also lives in Texas. 
 And therein lies a problem that is confounding pollsters as they consider the campaign ahead.
Governor Bush's political abilities notwithstanding, there is growing evidence that these early polls -- which also show Mr. Bush dominating a primary field of experienced Republican candidates -- prove little more than that the public has yet to distinguish between the former President and the current Governor. Many of the people who tell pollsters they favor Mr. Bush are actually thinking of the father. There really is no other explanation for why, two and a half years before the election, a figure so new to national life would have catapulted to the front of the Presidential field, pollsters say.
This is no small matter. Polls are a driving influence in Presidential politics, and probably never more so than during this formative period before the real campaign. The public may pay only passing attention to the embryonic race now, but polls establishing Mr. Bush as the front-runner pay a dividend in the form of financial donations and early endorsements, as contributors and politicians try to be first in line behind the eventual winner.
 
Inflation
And polls shape news. A poll by the Gallup Organization and USA Today showing Mr. Gore losing to Mr. Bush (50 percent to 46 percent) produced an article last month headlined, "Poll Gives Bush Edge Over Gore for 2000."
All of which has given Mr. Bush -- the Governor -- a decided advantage over rivals who can't claim a President as a parent.
"The number is inflated to such an extent that it's likely to freeze the field, and keep other candidates from lining up supporters," said Mark Halperin, the political director of ABC News. "Because no one else is even close to him, it feeds on itself."
None of which is to take away from the junior Bush's assets as a candidate. He is young, 51 (his father turned 74 on Friday) and vibrant, a powerful presence, a strong speaker with popular positions on major issues; he also comes from a state that has produced its share of Presidents. Many Republican leaders, people who really can tell George W. from George H. W., consider him the front-runner on merit. From that perspective, the happenstance of Mr. Bush's last name only hastened the inevitable.
When it comes to the public, though, things are a muddle, and that worries some pollsters. "We've had to make an adjustment in our polling," said Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster. "In our NBC-Wall Street Journal polling, we often refer to him as either George W. Bush of Texas, or Governor-of-Texas-George-Bush, as a way of saying to the voters, 'No, you're not voting for the old man, you're voting for the son.' It is a clear adjustment. We're trying to get as accurate a gauge as we can."
The Gallup poll identifies Mr. Bush as "Texas Gov. George W. Bush," while the Harris Poll refers to him as Bush Jr., the Governor of Texas. The chairman of the Harris Poll, Humphrey Taylor, argued that was enough. He said his polling showed growing support for Mr. Bush and that such a trend shows that voters are familiar with him. (He was the choice of 7 percent of Republican respondents in January 1997, and 13 percent this past February).
But the practice of giving Mr. Bush a title in polls raises another problem: It confers a hint of prestige that other candidates identified only by name do not have. Lamar Alexander, for example, is the former Governor of Tennessee, but pollsters never call him "Governor Alexander." Thus, pollsters worry, a technique used to blunt one advantage Mr. Bush enjoys with voters might simply give him another.
There is already hard evidence that at this early stage of the campaign voters do not know the difference between two career politicians from Texas who look and sound like, well, father and son.
A New York Times poll conducted from May 19 to May 21 asked respondents their opinion of "several members of the Bush family, starting with the former President." President Bush is held in high esteem: 73 percent of the registered voters in the poll had an opinion of George Bush, and 66 percent of them regarded him favorably.
 
George Who?
The question then moved to Barbara Bush before settling on the son, who was identified both as "George W. Bush" and "Texas Gov. George W. Bush." In this sequence of questioning, more than 70 percent of respondents had no opinion, positive or negative, of Mr. Bush the Governor. That is in line with what pollsters expect for someone who has never run for President before, and it calls seriously into question the accuracy of other polls that show him leading the Presidential race.
William D. McInturff, a Republican pollster, said his firm identified Mr. Bush as the Governor of Texas in some experimental polling earlier this year. But if he works on the 2000 race, he said, he would adjust his procedures for a more accurate measurement of the Governor's standing.
"If we were doing this for real," Mr. McInturff said, "and there was real money at stake, we would ask people after they pick him, 'Can you tell me a little bit about what you know about him?' so you could see what percent are talking about the former President."
Republican voters are more likely to know the difference between the two Bushes, and Mr. Bush's opponents will certainly do all they can to help voters distinguish the governor from his father once the race begins in earnest. But there is also a cynical view of the uses of confusion: that voters who are confused with pollsters now will remain confused when it comes time to vote. From that perspective, the polls today are entirely correct even if the voters are entirely wrong.
"It's going to take a long time to sort this one out," said Stephen Hess, the Presidential scholar. "There's no way you can do it with showing each respondent a picture of George Herbert Walker Bush and a picture of George W. Bush and saying which one are you for?"
Mr. Hess sighed. "I don't know what they can do. We're just going to have to live with this one."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
West Africa Trembles With Nigeria

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: FREETOWN, Sierra Leone

 BODY:
THERE was something more than faintly American about the first speech of Nigeria's new military head of state, following the sudden death on Monday of the country's iron-fisted President, Gen. Sani Abacha.
Much as a new President of the remaining superpower might, upon taking office after the unexpected death of an American leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar hammered away at the theme of unshaken adherence to his country's "international commitments." He sought to comfort allies and serve notice of Nigeria's resolve to potential foes. 
 And as could be expected upon the death of an American President, General Abacha's death unleashed a flood of eulogies praising his immense qualities as a statesman. Fittingly, after the death of the leader of a great country, no fewer than seven African heads of state rushed to pay their respects.
From Senegal to Gabon, the late general's peers spoke glowingly of a man devoted "body and soul to his country," or solemnly regretted the passing of one of "Africa's most illustrious sons." None even hinted that Nigeria is arguably in worse shape economically than at any time since independence from Britain in 1960, that there have never been more political prisoners, that high-level corruption had never been so brazen, or that outside Africa, General Abacha was often dismissed as just another despot plundering an unfortunate citizenry.
 
Ripples of Concern
In his own his country, where General Abacha was loathed far more than admired, many Nigerians undoubtedly scratched their heads in puzzlement over this seeming hypocrisy. But the point that those who disapproved were missing is that for much of Africa, any political transition in the continent's most populous, most complicated and arguably most fractious country -- especially one as unexpected as General Abacha's sudden death by reported heart attack -- is a cause for major concern far beyond Nigeria's own borders.
South Africa and Egypt may have more powerful armies, but no African country is more involved in the security arrangements of its surrounding region than Nigeria. South Africa may have a higher level of industrialization, and tiny oil states like Libya and Gabon much higher per capita incomes, but no African country's economic health is more vital to its neighbors.
Oil-rich Nigeria can submerge its neighbors in its economic woes or float them when it is flush. Beyond that, as the world's seventh-largest oil producer and the United States' biggest trading partner on the continent, it is perhaps the only African country whose sudden disappearance from the map would cause more than a moment's ripple in international markets.
The American Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, has often spoken of the United States as the world's one "essential nation." But in West Africa, such is the weight of Nigeria, with its 105 million people, large military forces and hyperactive foreign policy that many would quibble with America's self-designation.
Just ask Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, the democratically elected President of Sierra Leone, a country 1,000 miles to the west of Nigeria, who was overthrown in a coup 13 months ago by a combination of renegade soldiers and rural rebels who invaded the capital, Freetown, looting and burning all in their path.
Washington quickly sent the Marines to evacuate Western residents, saving them from the mayhem but doing nothing to relieve the country's distress. The United Nations, likewise, took no action. The only country that proved willing and able to help put out the flames was Nigeria.
General Abacha sent warships to blockade the rebels, starving their economy, and airplanes to bomb the insurrectionists' positions. When all of that didn't suffice, he mounted an intervention by land, losing dozens of soldiers but succeeding in the goal of restoring order -- and, by the way, President Kabbah.
Sierra Leone's President showed his gratitude by suspending his attendance at the annual Organization of African Unity summit in Ouagadougou to fly to Nigeria within hours of the news of General Abacha's death; there he expressed condolences and, one imagines, sought security assurances from the new team in charge.
 
Fears of Chaos
"There is going to be no change in the foreign policy of Nigeria, because like no one else, at the center of Nigerian policy stands Africa, and that will never change," the bluff commander of Nigerian forces in Sierra Leone, Brig. Gen. Maxwell Khobe, said in an interview. "When there is trouble in our region, we will be there, because to go absent would mean letting the fire spread."
But for all of Nigeria's can-do interventionism in Sierra Leone, and a previous successful, if drawn out, peace-keeping effort in Liberia, the warm words for General Abacha and his nation were motivated not only by gratitude for Nigeria's contributions to regional security.
Just as central in the minds of other regional leaders as they mourned the dictator's passing was the possibility of Nigeria's disintegration amid an anti-military uprising, revived regional tensions and ethnic hatreds. Seen from this angle, Nigeria more resembled another recent superpower, the crumbling and potentially dangerous Soviet Union, than it did a triumphant United States.
Few African countries have experienced anything like the devastation of the Nigerian civil war at the close of the 1960's, which began with a secession bid by the oil-rich southeast. And, as that conflict showed clearly, no other country on the continent has anything like the ability to inundate its neighbors with refugees.
General Abacha may deserve some of the posthumous accolades being given to him by his fellows as a great statesman, pan-Africanist or nationalist, but no leader before him left power with his country in a more degraded and potentially explosive state. Indeed, before an officially declared week of mourning was half over, angry protesters, readily citing the recent example of "people's power" in Indonesia, were facing off with soldiers in the streets of Nigeria's capital, Lagos.
Ghana's President, Jerry Rawlings, a former soldier who himself twice took power in coups after uprisings and was only later elected as a civilian, was one of the few African statesmen to speak candidly last week about the downside of General Abacha's legacy: a fractured and volatile nation.
"Let's say a prayer for Nigeria," Mr. Rawlings said in an interview with the BBC, minutes after learning of General Abacha's death. "For the commanders and the politicians not to do anything that could cause the disintegration of Nigeria, which would take us all downhill."

HEADLINE: Questions About Those Links Links

 BODY:
"Duffers Need Not Apply" (May 31), by Adam Bryant, examined a study comparing the golf handicaps of chief executives to their companies' stock market performance. The study found a pattern: that if a chief executive is a better-than-average golfer, his company is likely to deliver above-average returns to shareholders.
The article drew varied responses from readers. Many questioned the findings and methods of the study, saying that it did not include enough executives or that it incorrectly excluded seven chief executives whose data distorted the trend lines. 
 In the study, which he conducted for The New York Times, Graef Crystal, editor of a newsletter on executive compensation, ranked 51 executives by their market performance, then divided the list into three groups: the top and bottom quarters and the middle 50 percent. Averaging the golf handicap indexes and performance ranking for each group showed that, over all, the top-performing companies were led by the best golfers. Mr. Crystal says that he applied three statistical tests to screen out the seven executives with extreme data, and that they were not removed to achieve a desired result.
 
To the Editor:
Readers would be wise to learn the golfing term "mulligan" before taking the study's results seriously. (A mulligan is a shot that was not hit well and is replayed without penalty. It is arguably the best part of my golf game.)
I took the data on the chief executives used in the study and performed a regression analysis. I found that lower golf handicaps did improve a company's performance and that the effect was statistically significant at a traditional level. Just looking at the golf handicaps could explain 17 percent of the variation in a company's stock performance. The problem, however, was that the study took a "mulligan" when it excluded seven chief executives whose golf handicap and company performance ran counter to results.
When these seven are included, the regression results show virtually no effect from golf handicap on company performance, the results are not statistically significant and less than a quarter of 1 percent of the variation of company performance is explained by the chief executive's golf handicap. In short, there appears to be no relationship between the two.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
3 MacArthur Fellows Are Adding Value to the World of Money

BYLINE: By MINDY SINK 

 BODY:
EVERY year since 1981, it has been a cross between a Pulitzer and a lottery: the fellowship program of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which awards sizable, no-strings-attached grants to a diverse group of creative thinkers.
To choose recipients, the foundation uses a confidential group of nominators and a selection committee. Earlier this month, the foundation announced 29 such fellows -- distributing grants, to be paid over five years, that ranged from $220,000 to $375,000, depending on the recipient's age. 
 Among the winners were three whose work involves innovative perspectives on money matters: a rancher who has taken steps to preserve his Southwestern way of life; a geographer who studies how labor and political issues help mold a cultural landscape, and an economist who aims to apply the ideals of feminism and the left to calculations of productivity.
 
William McDonald
Preserving His Home on the Range
A fifth-generation cattle rancher in the Southwestern border town of Douglas, Ariz., William McDonald is still recovering from the shock of being recognized by the foundation, let alone being awarded $285,000. The Malpai Borderlands Group, an organization he helped found in 1992, was intended, he said, to find common ground among ranchers, environmentalists, government and just about anyone else with an interest in Western lands.
"We could see the handwriting on the wall," said Mr. McDonald, 46, who has 350 head of cattle on 21,000 acres in and around Douglas, in the southeastern part of the state, near both the Mexico border and the New Mexico state line. "We are concerned about what our children would deal with as ranchers. Western ranchers who lease land were seen as environmental 'despoilers.' We're also dealing with an increasingly harsh regulatory atmosphere. Development was gobbling up areas where open space was and is."
Mr. McDonald and his group of 20 other landowners in Arizona and New Mexico saw everything they held dear as equally threatened -- from the region's jaguars, an endangered species, to the area's ranching community and the open space and grasslands on which it depends.
"We are trying to work through the tough issues that tend to divide us in the West -- grazing fees, endangered species, growth," he said.
The group's members say that to maintain their way of life, ranchers must join with environmentalists, onetime adversaries, to protect the area from development.
"The cattle market has been depressed for some time, and the cost of land is such that you can't buy a ranch and pay for it with the cattle, so you have to get another job," Mr. McDonald said. "Or sometimes people get stuck with inheritance taxes they can't afford or younger generations lose interest in ranching. These things cause the owners to sell and subdivide their land, and that raises the value of the surrounding land, and it just feeds on itself from there."
In one initiative, some members of the group have signed on for "grassbanking." The arrangement permits one rancher's cattle to graze on a nearby range so that the grasses do not become overgrazed and the land can regain its natural state. In return, the rancher signs a "conservation easement," held by the Malpai board, prohibiting subdivision of his land in perpetuity.
Members have also moved cattle around to maintain vegetation in certain areas, and avoided ranching in areas where there are endangered species. And members have helped the Nature Conservancy buy land to remove it from the reach of development.
In another initiative, the Malpai group is trying to develop a "unique product that people would like to eat," Mr. McDonald said. "There will be some reward to the producer who tries to do it right -- by using animals raised in a friendly manner, and that would then lift the economic situation for some of us."
Still, he said, such a venture is not essential to the group's mission. "Ranchers don't need to be wealthy," he said. "They just love the way of life. It's enough to make a living with assurances that they can make one in the future." MINDY SINK

MARKETS
Charging Into Reverse
No one else has had the power to move markets in recent years the way Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has. With the mer-est hint that the central bank might need to take aim at inflation, the markets ducked for cover. But last week he signaled to investors that he saw no immediate need to strike against inflation by raising interest rates, telling the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that "the current economic performance, with its combination of strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the American economy." So what happened on Wall Street? The stock market ducked for cover. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 8,834.94, down 202.77 points. But the bond market surged, sending Government bond yields to their lowest levels in more than 20 years, with the long bond at 5.66 percent. 

THE ECONOMY
Producer Prices Rise
The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in May, reflecting higher prices for energy and prescription drugs. That followed an identical increase in April. . . . With an assist from the strongest new-car sales in 15 months, retail sales rose a stronger-than- expected 0.9 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted $224.62 billion, the Commerce Department reported. The gain, the seventh in a row, exceeded private economists' forecasts of a rise of 0.7 percent. . . . If a bill passed by the House becomes law, retailers may even be paid for all those sales. The bankruptcy laws would be tightened, making it far more difficult to buy now and escape paying later.
 
TOBACCO
A Bill (and Its Riches) Advance
If a middle-income husband and wife both smoke, their outlook is win some, lose some, financially at least. Employing a certain inside-the-Beltway logic, the Senate voted to use part of the money that would be raised from higher cigarette prices to give an income-tax break to married couples with annual incomes below $50,000. The measure was billed as fighting the income tax code's marriage penalty; the vote gave additional strength to anti-smoking legislation that has been before the Senate for three weeks. The Senate also voted to use some of the cigarette money on drug-abuse programs. . . . In a setback to the tobacco industry, a Florida jury found Brown & Williamson Tobacco liable for a smoker's death and ordered the company to pay $1 million in damages.
 
BANKS
Deal After Deal
Norwest and Wells Fargo agreed to a $34 billion merger, the latest in a string of blockbuster unions that have created a cadre of giants and a few dozen also-rans in the once-sleepy banking industry. The banks' merger frenzy has been driven by stalled revenue growth and heightened competition from mutual funds, brokerage firms and credit card companies. . . . Credit Suisse First Boston bought Brazil's leading investment bank, Garantia S.A., for $675 million, making the Swiss-American group the largest underwriter and stock trader in that hotly competitive emerging market.
 
AUTOS
At G.M., Strikes and Layoffs
Angry over what they called unmet demands for job security, hundreds of striking workers chanted "U.A.W.!" and toted red placards at the gate of a General Motors spark-plug factory in Flint, Mich., joining striking workers from a metal-stamping factory. The increasingly bitter fight could lead G.M., the world's largest auto maker, to close most of its North American assembly plants within days. G.M. has already closed seven assembly plants and temporarily laid off 18,600 workers for lack of parts, and it could temporarily lay off up to 200,000 more workers. . . . Honda and Ford endured a multimillion-dollar embarrassment, agreeing to pay millions of dollars in Federal fines for selling cars that were designed to pass emissions tests but were certain to run substantially dirtier on the road.
 
THE F.D.A.
Taking Aim at Supplements
In a case to be heard tomorrow in Federal court in Salt Lake City, the Food and Drug Administration is waging a pivotal battle against the fast-growing dietary supplement industry, which is not subject to the same rigorous requirements for scientific testing as the drug industry. At issue is Chinese red yeast sold in this country by Pharmanex under the name Cholestin to lower cholesterol. The F.D.A. calls the product, which is sold in both health food outlets and the giant Wal-Mart chain, an illegal, unapproved drug because it contains an ingredient, lovastatin, that is the key component of the cholesterol-lowering drug Mevacor, made by Merck.
 
COMPANIES
U.S. Sues Intel
The F.T.C. filed antitrust charges against the chip maker, accusing it of threatening and injuring three computer makers, including Compaq, the leading maker of personal computers, to coerce them to turn over rights to patented technologies. Intel disagreed. . . . Boeing said it would cut production of its wide-body 747 aircraft next year because of slow growth in Asia. Starting this year Boeing will cut more jobs than the 12,000 previously announced. . . . Nabisco announced a $524 million reorganization plan that will include factory closings and laying off more than 3,000 employees. . . . Controversy swirled around a $42 million golden parachute that William J. Catacosinos received as New York State partly took over the Long Island Lighting Company, the troubled utility he led. He now heads Marketspan, the successor company.
 
RUSSIA
A Warning From the I.M.F.
The I.M.F. has told the Russian Government that it needs to slash its budget deficit and overhaul its antiquated tax system if it is to qualify for billions of dollars in extra loans, Russian officials said. Fund officials also want Russia to strengthen its banking system and have suggested that the operations of Gazprom, the huge natural gas monopoly, be split up. Seeking to improve its tax picture, the Russian Government arrested the head of the State Committee for Statistics, Yuri Yurkov, and his top deputies and accused them of manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid taxes. Adding to the unrest, miners from the Vorkuta region, above, who have not been paid in four months, protested in Moscow.

Money and Chinese Are Always Spoken Here

 BODY:
Charles Schwab & Company, the discount stockbroker, has opened a Flushing, Queens, office that caters to Chinese investors. The branch, at 37-01 Main Street, provides financial services in Cantonese and Mandarin. Account managers speaking those dialects are always available; Chinese-language signs share equal billing with those in English.
It is the first Schwab office on the East Coast tailored specifically for Chinese-speaking investors, and fifth in the nation. 
 On hand for the opening was Charles R. Schwab, the company's chairman. "In cities all over the United States," he said, "immigrants are integrating themselves into our economy and hoping to share in America's growth. Schwab will continue to help meet the needs of these investors by providing innovative services -- via the Web, phone and branch office."
The branch opening coincided with the inauguration of Schwab's Chinese Web Trading Site (http://www.schwab.com/ chinese), which the company describes as the first United States Web site that enables investors to place orders and check account information in Chinese.

Boilermaker to Expand, And Hire, Locally

 BODY:
A. L. Eastmond & Sons, a manufacturer of industrial boilers and steel storage tanks, plans to expand its 73-year-old, family-run business at 1175 Leggett Avenue in Hunts Point in the Bronx.
Earlier this month, the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation approved an $800,000 loan for Eastmond to buy the former home of Western Bed at 440 and 444 Tiffany Street, four blocks to the southeast. Some of the money, to be issued by the New York Empowerment Zone and administered by the development corporation, will be used for job training. The financing will help Eastmond create 50 new jobs, half of which must go to neighborhood people. 
 "A. L. Eastmond & Sons is committed to employing and retaining workers in the Bronx so we can continue our expansion into new markets," said the company's president, Leon Eastmond.
Eastmond will also buy the space at 1190 East 156th Street, directly behind its Leggett Avenue headquarters, with the financial backing of the Empire State Economic Development Corporation. The total expansion will come to 48,000 square feet.

HEADLINE: Ban on Film Has Poland Debating Censorship

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
A documentary that takes a caustic look at the Polish operations of the American direct-sales company Amway has set off an unusually strenuous debate here about press freedom.
The Polish-made film "Welcome to Life," which is dominated by hard-sell pep rallies that are a hallmark of the company and by the motivational jargon of its distributors, was stopped from being shown on television by a court order sought by the company. 
 Amway argued that in seeking the injunction it wanted to protect its reputation and its employees.
But to more than 50 Polish editors and journalists from across the political spectrum, the successful court action was reminiscent of the old Communist way of doing things.
"A court ban amounts to a return of preventive censorship," the editors said in a petition to President Aleksandr Kwasniewski.
The signers included Jerzy Urban, who was the spokesman for the Communist Party in the 1980's and is now the editor of a ribald weekly newspaper, Nie.
The court action touched a raw nerve in Poland because Amway has represented itself since the collapse of Communism as a sure way for Poles to become entrepreneurs and live the rich life of their dreams. The company says it has enlisted 80,000 Poles as distributors of its home-care products and has said that it sees expansion into former Communist countries as essential to continued growth.
But in China, concern over exploitation of naive people led the Government in April to ban all door-to-door sales, although Amway can supply retail outlets with its products.
Founded in 1959 in Ada, Mich., Amway has been a controversial, closely held company. Its business practices have been the subject of court cases in the United States and Canada. In 1979, the Federal Trade Commission ruled that Amway was not an illegal pyramid scheme, but ordered the company to stop setting prices at which distributors sold products.
Since the injunction was imposed in March, the country's biggest newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, has published the sound track to the film. The film is a best-seller on the video black market in the southern town of Cracow.
Some of the dialogue goes like this:
"As a former member of the Communist Party apparatus, I was surprised to see so many smiling, happy people clapping to the rhythm of music," says a middle-aged Polish distributor. "My immediate association was of a Communist Party feast. Back in 1993, this sort of thing was a complete shock to me. I simply did not believe that there could be so many happy people in these difficult days of political and economic transformation."
Another Polish distributor says: "There are people who have inborn leadership qualities, people such as Napoleon, or even Hitler, though it may seem to be a very negative example. He too was a leader who knew how to attract the masses, the whole German nation."
The film goes on to show a meeting in a large hall where a man on the stage shows how door-to-door distributors should get householders to accept motivational tape recordings that the distributors sell. He demonstrates how a distributor should come within an inch of hitting a would-be customer on the head with a tape, forcing the person to accept the tape as a way of protecting himself. Much of Amway's business, the film says, is devoted to distributing motivational tapes intended to make distributors think the Amway way.
A spokesman for Amway, Piotr A. Czernowski, said in an interview that the film was unfair but that he had cooperated with the filmmaker, Henryk Dederko, at the start of the project. Mr. Dederko received financing from the Government television station to make the documentary, which was to be shown first on that channel.
"The Polish media believe that there should be freedom of any expression without having any responsibility," said Mr. Czernowski. He said Amway was concerned that the film would "negatively affect their business."
Journalists and editors say the case brought by Amway has already had a chilling result. Not long after the court ruled against the screening of "Welcome to Life," a prominent Polish businessman won an injunction against Mr. Urban's weekly, Nie, that prevents the planned publication of an article about him.

Weaning the World Off Michael: Not a Pretty Picture

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
When Michael leaves us, I will also miss the breathless crushes he evoked in other men. There has been nothing like it since Mickey Mantle made middle-aged men cry by showing up, for a fee, at their birthday parties. Muhammad Ali makes big boys melt with a frozen half-smile. But the Mick and Ali reached their powers long after they retired, when their fans had grown into their nostalgia years. Michael will make his fans swoon again tonight with his tongue hanging out, rising to the hoop.
And what a range of fans. The chairman of Harvard's Afro-American Studies Department, Henry Louis Gates Jr., describes Jordan in The New Yorker as "both hulking and suave, and it's easy to see why he has become a totem of black masculinity; he makes Bill Cosby look like Uncle Ben." 
 In an open letter to Michael in the fanzine, Slam, Scoop Jackson writes that the few things that he, a "brotha," could depend on were "Santa Claus, tax season, Tanqueray and you." And in last week's Fortune cover piece, Roy S. Johnson calculates that the "Jordan effect" has helped pump $10 billion into the economy.
What a loss! Post-Michael, the courts will be empty and young men will run through the streets barefoot. Stock markets will crash and greed will again be a sin. Desperately diversifying, David Stern will declare American football, played by either sex, the true national pastime.
It'll be just fine. As you can see, I'm already in grief therapy. Actually, we have been in the post-Michael era for some time now; once there was public discussion of having to live without him, we were already getting used to living without him. There's always videotape.
Some think we entered the post-Michael era two years ago when Reebok's new Allan Iverson sneaker sold out more quickly in certain cool stores than did the latest Air Jordan from Nike; the hip had marked Jordan as establishment, without edge.
Others think that Jordan's time passed when he had no authoritative response to the charges that Nike was exploiting Asian workers. In the booming 90's, few realists expected Michael to feel the pain of sweat-shop fingers, but they did expect him to know about them. So much had been made of Michael's involvement in his many business interests -- he helped design the shoes, smelled the cologne, tasted the hot dogs, sat on the board of the sunglasses company -- that he looked flabby or bogus by not at least saying, in his detached, friendly, pragmatic way, that maybe in Indonesia the Nike dollar was a reasonable alternative to not working at all.
But, no, already more of a suit than a jock, Gates's "greatest corporate pitchman of all time" and "the ultimate winner-take-all celebrity" wiggled; he promised to look into the situation. After the season.
We looked past that. After all, Michael has given us more moments than anyone since Ali, and his public image is as elegant and clean as Joe DiMaggio's.
He has never had a scandal stick or been involved in a major legal action. So he liked to gamble. The spinners said that proved how much he needed competition; he said he was no Pete Rose.
Michael's baseball sabbatical was an endearing Roman holiday -- the world's greatest basketball player, just like you and me, had a secret dream that failed. Michael came back and gave basketball its last good years. As Commissioner Stern well knows -- why else would he float a challenge to the National Football League? -- the N.B.A. is probably over as a growth industry. The end of the Bulls, expansion, violence, a star system that promoted Dennis Rodman and Latrell Sprewell, as well as Jordan, damaged brand equity far more than the slacker Shaq, Reggie (E.T. II) Miller and Kobe Bryant can repair.
Trust Nike to already have covered its assets; still the monster, although slipping, it is branding more and more women and soccer teams with the swoosh. Nike owns Brazil, which may someday be as huge as Michael. And there's always Tiger Woods, who may be boring but has already paid for himself by helping to fuel the golf renaissance. Can you believe that Jack Nicklaus is building a course in the Bronx?
Speaking of morality, Michael's passing may affect that wonderfully cynical HBO sitcom, "Arliss," now in its third season. In the first new show, the super agent Arliss arranges a heterosexual photo-op for a client who has been having trouble getting a contract as a backup quarterback because of rumors he is gay. In the second show, Arliss arranges better contracts for a linebacker on steroids and a running back feigning injury. With Michael's aura gone, Arliss may look like just another excellent ESPN documentary.
The final arbiter on all this, The Sporting News, rated Michael the most powerful person in sports last year, the first athlete to make No. 1 (up from No. 27 in 1997).
The Sporting News looked beyond the hulking and suave brotha worth $10 billion yet was still breathless in its own hard-core, straight-arrow fashion. Michael proved himself a true role model "by showing up for work, well-prepared, enthusiastic and respectful."
If he takes that away with him, post-Michael will be the apocalypse. Who will make the shoes?

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Legacy of Lilco: No-Fault Failure

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
IN the history of bad decisions, the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station stands out, a single project that has polarized the politics of Long Island for a generation, boosted electric rates high enough to repel industry for miles around, uselessly monopolized the talents of hundreds of engineers and thousands of skilled craftsmen for more than a decade and sucked more than $5.5 billion out of the economy. 
 Shoreham even doomed its builder, the Long Island Lighting Company, in a business where failure was long considered impossible.
 
A $42 Million Parachute
But as Lilco went out of existence last month after 87 years, and its chairman, William J. Catacosinos, walked off with a severance benefit of $42 million, it became clear that Shoreham was such a huge mistake that no one had to take the blame.
It was as if the entire calamity had been caused by a force of nature that could not have been foreseen or avoided. And managers like Mr. Catacosinos, who were paid extraordinary salaries in return for their presumed expertise, operated at a level where personal responsibility turned out to be irrelevant.
Surely in the course of more than two dozen announcements about construction delays and rising costs either a Lilco executive or the public service commissioners could have asked whether the company -- building a plant four times larger than the biggest similar plant then operating -- was ready to plunge into the nuclear era. But the Public Service Commission raised barely an eyebrow before the very end.
"How do you hold them responsible in 1998?" said Richard M. Kessel, an early Shoreham opponent and now the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, a public entity that has taken over partial ownership of the Lilco system. The commissioners left long ago, Mr. Kessel said. And it's a shame, he added, that they can't be hauled out of retirement and forced to eat their words. Or sent a bill for $5.5 billion.
In 1984, the Lilco managers most identified with Shoreham, including the chairman, Charles R. Pierce, were themselves shown the door.
Dr. Catacosinos, who had been a director for six years and had a doctorate in economics, was installed as chairman. At the time, he said he wanted to "give something back" to the community.
In Albany, turnover at the Public Service Commission was gradual and regular, unaffected by the debacle on Long Island.
When Dr. Catacosinos became chairman, Lilco had estimated the cost of Shoreham at about $4 billion. It seemed likely then -- and has turned out to be true -- that the hardware and fuel for a conventional plant that would produce equivalent power would have cost a few hundred million dollars.
But Dr. Catacosinos fought to the end, firing up the reactor to run at low power, a step that strengthened his hand in negotiations with the state for a buyout of the plant. Once the plant was operating, even at low power, it had a demonstrated value. If the state wanted to shut it down, then an argument could be made that the state -- or Lilco customers -- should pay. Ultimately, the state decided the reactor should be dismantled because it would be impossible to evacuate the area during an accident.
And the start-up raised the cost of abandoning the plant by $100 million, because even brief low-power operation created substantial radiation. All told, while Dr. Catacosinos was chairman, the price of the project went up another $1.5 billion or so.
Shareholders lost their dividends and most of their capital investment, unless they held on through the whole ordeal. Many of them, especially Lilco employees saving up for retirement, did not.
With about a million Lilco electric customers, the price comes to more than $2,000 for each man, woman and child on Long Island.
So what happened to all that money? It went from customers to steamfitters and electricians, as wages, and to people who had loaned money to Lilco, as interest. Late in the game, some of it went to the truck drivers who carted off the rubble.
But some of the money came out of the workers' pockets. In 1984 Lilco announced a 5 percent pay cut for most of them, triggering a six-week strike, the only one in the company's history.
Paul C. Parshley, a former utility analyst at Lehman Brothers and a longtime specialist in nuclear companies, keeps a collection of Lucite plaques given to the bond underwriters for the plant. He pulled them off a shelf last week when asked who else had benefited.
Lots of Wall Street firms did well handling the bonds that raised billions for construction, he said. And they profited again by handling the sale of Lilco's transmission and distribution assets to Lipa, the newly formed power authority, as well as the merger of Lilco generating plant and gas system with the parent company of Brooklyn Union Gas.
The new company is called Marketspan, and Dr. Catacosinos heads it.
No matter how badly utilities blunder, they are so big and so important that they never actually go away; they just assume new names and forms.
Marketspan has a 15-year contract to use Lilco's generating stations to supply power to Lipa, and an 8-year contract to deliver that power over Lilco's old transmission and distribution system.
 
Unfair Hindsight
"It's been a tough road," said Ellen Balzarini, a spokeswoman for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local 1049, which represents the people who climb the poles and tend the turbines. They now work for Marketspan and are pleased that they did not lose any jobs, she said.
There are only 2,800 of them now, including contractor employees, down from 3,600 workers 18 years ago.
It is possible, of course, to view the succession of bad decisions unfairly in hindsight. "It was an oil-dependent company, really the only one in the country of any size," said Edward J. Tirello, a stock analyst now at BT Alex Brown. "Natural gas was hard to find, and if you believed the scenario at that time, of $100-a-barrel oil, that made the plant O.K. The problem is everyone fast-forwards to now."
Oil has been under $20 a barrel for most of the last few years, and OPEC no longer seems like such a threat.
And a repetition seems unlikely. Utilities do not make construction mistakes like Shoreham now because they barely build power plants at all; now most are put up by entrepreneurs, who favor small plants that can be built quickly. They do not have to make long-term guesses about demand.
This is small comfort on Long Island. Irving Like, a lawyer from Babylon who organized the first opposition to Lilco's nuclear plans, said that around the country electricity prices are falling because of deregulation and competition. Lipa's exclusive contract with Marketspan would delay the benefits of competition on Long Island.
Still, there is some good news.
Rates should fall by 20 percent because dividends will no longer be paid and because financing will be done through tax-free bonds, said Mr. Kessel, Lilco's old nemesis.
But he added: "It's a frustration. If there are people out there who somehow want justice, they're not going to get it. The people who created this mess are long since gone."

HEADLINE: Reinforcing Diplomacy on Kosovo

 BODY:
The mock air attacks NATO plans to carry out tomorrow in the Balkans are a timely and reasonable response to the growing military violence being orchestrated by Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, in the Serbian province of Kosovo. As seen with Iraq earlier this year, diplomacy backed with a show of force can move a leader with a history of failing to respond to gentler forms of international persuasion.
As the Kosovo crisis grew more severe in recent weeks, Washington first tried to encourage a negotiated solution by offering Serbia relief from economic sanctions. When that failed to dissuade Mr. Milosevic from military action, America and its allies issued a series of clear warnings that their patience was running out. 
 All outside powers, including Russia, now agree that Mr. Milosevic's forces have been primarily responsible for the increasing violence against Kosovo's Albanian majority population. That includes the deaths of some 200 civilians, the expulsion of more than 50,000 people from their homes and the flight of 10,000 or more of these uprooted refugees across international frontiers. Most recently, the Yugoslav Army has sown deadly land mines along Kosovo's border with Albania, raising the risk of a broader regional conflict. NATO hopes that its simulated air raids against targets in Kosovo's immediate neighbors, Albania and Macedonia, will convince Mr. Milosevic that he must end the violence and begin good faith negotiations.
This show of force is part of an international diplomatic strategy. The Clinton Administration is right to stress that its goal remains a diplomatic solution, not a military one. Russia's President, Boris Yeltsin, can help diplomacy succeed if he takes a firm line with Mr. Milosevic in Moscow on Tuesday. Mr. Yeltsin should quickly dispel any illusions Mr. Milosevic may have that his big Slavic brother will defend him no matter how outrageously he behaves in Kosovo. Instead, Mr. Yeltsin should use his considerable influence to warn the Yugoslav leader that he must rein in his forces immediately.
That kind of blunt diplomatic message from Russia coupled with NATO's demonstration of air power should convince Mr. Milosevic that he should back off. If it does not, before Washington contemplates moving any further down a path that could lead to American military intervention, the Clinton Administration must do what it has not done to date. It must spell out the specific political goals it means to achieve in Kosovo, what role military force might play in advancing these and what kind of limits -- chronological, geographical and operational -- it is prepared to impose on any American mission.
Without such clarifications there cannot be the kind of informed debate a democracy requires before considering the use of military force.

HEADLINE: Working to Share Water in the West

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: DIVIDE, Mont.

 BODY:
An old cowboy saying holds that "whiskey's for drinking and water's for fighting," a testament to the vital role rivers play in the semi-arid Western landscape, and the rancor that comes with dividing a limited supply.
The battle has intensified in recent years, as fishermen, outfitters and environmentalists entered the fray, demanding that ranchers, who divert water for grazing and irrigation, leave enough in the rivers to sustain trout and the aquatic ecosystem. 
 These days, however, the din of the war over water is quieting. Different sides are coming together on rivers around the West to do something that was anathema to many ranchers who hold their right to water as sacred, guaranteed by law: They are working with their opponents and talking of compromise.
"We sat down at our first meeting and everyone sat in their own corner," said Randy Smith, a cattle rancher near Glen, Mont., and chairman of the Big Hole Watershed Committee, which was formed three years ago and includes fishermen, environmentalists, outfitters, ranchers and representatives of Federal and state agencies. "Then we found out that we were all there for the same thing, to keep the river the way it is."
Watershed committees are "a rejuvenation of Jeffersonian democracy," said Matthew McKinney, director of the Montana Consensus Council, which brokered the formation of the Big Hole group. "And it seems to be picking up steam."
A study of these committees by the Natural Resources Law Center at the University of Colorado estimated there were 300 such groups in the West, 200 of which were formed in the last three years.
The Big Hole River, which cascades out of the Bitterroot Mountains on the Montana-Idaho border, arcs through the southwestern corner of the state and nourishes vast meadows of emerald green hay along its banks. During the long stretch of winter, the hay is fed to cattle.
The cold, clean waters that purl over rounded boulders support another "crop" -- fat, wild and wily brown and rainbow trout. Another kind of fish, a rare species called arctic grayling, is found here.
The Big Hole is one of Montana's fly-fishing jewels. Fishermen come from around the country, and spend considerable sums of money. A service industry comprised of outfitters and fly-fishing equipment shops and lodging has grown up in the sparsely settled valley.
The conflict on the river comes in midsummer after the mountain snows that feed the stream have disappeared and early summer rains have ended. Irrigators continue to pump water from the river to keep hay meadows wet until August. During a drought in 1994 river levels dropped to a trickle, and many trout died, including the grayling.
There was widespread outrage, and talk of legislation to change water laws. Many people favored declaring the grayling an endangered species, and the low water in the river renewed calls for Federal protection of the fish, which could bring new regulations. That, says Mr. Smith, was when local ranchers realized something needed to be done.
During the past three years, the committee has met in the cinderblock Grange hall in this tiny town to come up with solutions. The biggest achievement so far has been a dry-year plan, which spells out how ranchers will voluntarily cut back on water use during a drought and fishing would be halted to protect the grayling and other species, but there has not been a dry year since the committee was formed. Wells have also been drilled on some ranches so water will not have to be pumped out of the river.
"You have to make choices when things get tough," said Mr. Smith. "You might have to give up your hay crop, or part of it," to leave water in the river, he said.
Some see these committees as an integral player in the future of the West. For decades, many ranchers, loggers and other rural Westerners have chafed at what they feel is the heavy hand of regulation. Decisions are made in far off Washington, they say, by bureaucrats who don't know the reality of extracting a living from the land. Debates over resource issues have become polarized and vituperative. The water committees, some hope, will change that.
"Westerners are making a much more responsible claim to authority over these lands than ever before," said Daniel Kemmis, former Mayor of Missoula, Mont., and now director of the University of Montana's Center for the Rocky Mountain West, a regional public policy institute. "There's too much complexity in these ecosystems for a thin layer of Federal agents to know enough to manage them."
Many of the groups' agreements are untested on controversial issues however, and compliance is voluntary. And there are some on both sides of the issues who are extremely wary of this new creature.
"Some committees are capable," said Reed Benson, executive director of Water Watch, an environmental group in Portland, Ore. "Others seem to be dominated by local economic interests who want to make it look like something is being done."
These committees "are given too much responsibility" he said, "when they are still really an experiment."
Ranchers are wary as well. At the recent meeting in Divide, one rancher, angry the group had accepted an award from an environmental group that had sued to cut back cattle grazing on Federal land, announced he was quitting. "I'm appalled and dismayed" he said, and walked out.

HEADLINE: China Officially Lifts Filter on Staggering Pollution Data

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 13

 BODY:
For 20 years, local officials carefully measured this city's air pollution levels and equally carefully hid the results -- fearing that the truth might tarnish the capital's image or lead to social unrest. This continued even as Beijing's famously blue sky turned ever more gray and its surrounding hills disappeared behind an acrid mist.
So it seemed a small miracle when, on Feb. 28, Beijing joined 38 other Chinese cities that have started to issue weekly air quality reports in the last year. In newspapers and on television, they parade a sometimes eclectic mix of statistics -- from levels of nitrous oxides produced by car exhausts to the concentration of tiny particles from coal burning in the air. And Chinese citizens for the first time have hard information on the air they breathe. 
 Despite technical flaws, the tangled mass of data has confirmed what many Western scientists have suspected and at times measured: that the air in China's cities is among the most polluted in the world, and contains the highest levels of pollutants harmful to health. Recent research suggests that bad air causes 178,000 premature deaths a year.
The severity of the pollution, now openly acknowledged by the Government, has propelled environmental issues onto the agenda of the Chinese-American summit meeting that is to take place later this month. Chinese officials say they are eager to have Washington's technical help in the battle for cleaner air.
But more than that, the Government's candor has created a new political dynamic between the Government and its people, feeding an environmental consciousness.
"The air is bad -- you can read it in the newspapers," said Zhang Jiyan, from her roadside bathing-suit stand in downtown Beijing. "Look, you can't even see tall buildings a few streets from here."
People who six months ago might have peered out the window and seen fog, or wu, now realize that it is pollution, or wuran. And their anger in turn has encouraged local governments to develop more ambitious, if not always realistic, efforts -- for example, requiring car owners to install catalytic converters.
"Releasing the numbers is a revolutionary concept for the people and the Government," said Lu Xinyuan, of the State Environmental Protection Agency. "We were worried that the people would complain that air pollution is too serious. Instead, the consciousness of people has been raised. And they feel the Government trusts them with the facts, so we are gaining points by doing this."
Others suggest another motive: the weekly barrage of frightening statistics has generated popular support for otherwise unpalatable Government moves, like shutting down inefficient state-owned enterprises, with the inevitable loss of jobs.
"Why are they being so open about this?" asked one Western diplomat. "It's because it dovetails with their economic agenda. This way when the factory gets closed, the people want it to be closed, even though the real reason it has to be closed is not for pollution but for economics."
These days in Beijing, everyone is complaining about the air. Since the weekly air quality reports began three months ago, the city's air has ranked 4 on its 1-to-5 pollution scale (5 being the worst) every week but two, said Yu Xiaoxuan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
Level-4 pollution can have serious health effects on people with heart or lung problems, and could make others feel uncomfortable as well.
Many Beijing residents suspect that the truth is even worse -- after all, theirs is a leadership that until a few years ago shaved degrees from summer temperatures in news reports in the name of morale. Elderly people who used to exercise outside in the early morning -- when pollution is usually worst -- are postponing their exercises until later in the day, and "fresh air" tours of the countryside have become popular.
At the Beijing Children's Research Clinic, mothers carrying hacking children and newly prescribed medicine are quick to complain. Two-year-old Long Fei "often gets sick with colds and infections," said his mother, who identified herself only as Lin. "You see it on TV. The air is not good, that's the problem."
According to the World Bank, 5 of the world's 10 most polluted cities are in China, and despite some recent successful efforts to combat the problem, pollutant levels are two to five times the World Health Organization guidelines for safe exposure.
"China is still among the world's most polluted countries," said Qu Geping, chairman of the National People's Congress's Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Committee. "Among 600 cities, 70 to 80 percent can't even meet our own air standards."
For years now, Mr. Qu has campaigned for greater openness in this field, prodding China's cities to abide by a generally ignored 1987 law that required them to release data about their air. But last year the State Council stepped up the pressure, and starting with Nanjing in May 1997, dozens of cities have now complied.
Still, many experts worry about the reliability of the reports, according to Todd Johnson, an environmental economist at the World Bank, since local environmental bureaus are often understaffed, relying on old equipment and techniques.
Experts also find the reports sometimes incomplete or confusing. A number of cities, including Beijing, report only some of the vast number of statistics they measure. And many report air quality according to an "air pollution index," with scores derived from a formula that combines harmful and innocuous pollutants in such a complex manner that even specialists have trouble interpreting its significance.
Dr. Wang Lihua, a professor of environmental health at Beijing Medical University, and her former student Dr. Xiping Xu, now at the Harvard School of Public Health, have been studying pollution in Beijing more than 15 years. They say they do not entirely understand how Beijing determines daily rankings.
"I don't always trust the data," Dr. Xu said. "But in the end, whether the number is 100 or 150 is not so important -- we know it's very high. And this is a very good step to publish the information, to let people gain knowledge."
The most serious pollutant in most Chinese cities is tiny airborne particles, measured as total suspended particles, produced primarily by the burning of coal and, increasingly, car exhausts. Mexico City's notoriously bad air contains different types of pollutants, mostly small chemical compounds that are not thought to be as dangerous to health.
In China, coal also produces sulfur dioxide, the source of acid rain. Cars add nitrous oxides.
In terms of suspended particles, "Chinese cities are among the worst in the world -- that's just a fact," said Mr. Johnson, the World Bank official. "Because they are so dependent on coal, I can't think of any city in the world that's as bad as the worst cities in China."
In China, which has only limited access to oil and natural gas, coal powers huge factories, fuels restaurant stoves and heats homes. In Beijing, where coal produces 80 percent of energy, mountains of it fill courtyards, especially in winter, and bicycles towing carts piled with coal briquettes are everywhere.
On top of that, there are 1.3 million cars registered in Beijing today, compared with 200,000 a decade ago. And the average Chinese car produces 10 to 15 times the exhaust of its American counterpart.
Medical researchers have begun to document the toll that air pollution is taking on human health here.
In studies, Dr. Xu of Harvard and colleagues in China have found that urban air pollution contributes to increased deaths, premature births and low birth weight. They have also found that breathing Beijing's air depresses lung function in otherwise healthy individuals and that on polluted days, the number of hospital visits skyrockets.
"In a city like Beijing, you've got 20,000 excess deaths at the end of the year," Mr. Johnson said. (Beijing's population is 12 million.) "You throw in a few badly polluted days and the old person dies a few months earlier than otherwise."
The asthma rate has reached 5 percent in some areas around factories. Specialists at Beijing Children's Hospital now see 60 wheezing, coughing children a day.
Dr. Hu Yiji, the hospital's director, said he believed secondhand cigarette smoke was the biggest culprit, but acknowledged pollution as a problem. "We tell parents if they smoke, to quit," he said. "And then we advise them to take the kids to the suburbs when they can."
The central Government recently announced plans to spend 1.2 percent of the G.N.P. on pollution control and is desperately seeking an alternative to coal. It is pumping natural gas to Beijing from Shaanxi Province. It is negotiating with Russia to import gas. It also has plans to close down urban factories and convert coal into electricity near the coal mines to keep the pollution out of the cities.
At best, these changes could reduce reliance on coal to about 65 percent in 2000, from 75 percent this year. But they could have a big impact on urban air pollution.
Cars have proved an easier problem to tackle. As of Jan. 1, Beijing has banned the sale of leaded gas, and as of next year all new cars must have catalytic converters. The police recently started spot checks of tailpipe emissions, and fewer than 40 percent of cars tested on the first day passed. Polluting owners have their licenses revoked and are instructed to install catalytic converters, at a cost of about $100.
Beijing has long required yearly emission checks, but enforcing such laws is difficult. In a poor country like China, there is persistent tension between wanting cleaner air and not having the money to pay for it.

HEADLINE: Lilco Is Dead, but Its 'Curse' Lives in Uproar Over Officials' Payouts

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., June 13

 BODY:
Like St. George slaying the dragon, Gov. George E. Pataki finally vanquished the dreaded beast that had terrorized Long Island's economic and political landscape for decades. The Long Island Lighting Company, notorious for the highest electricity bills in the continental United States, was gone at last.
Or so it seemed on May 28, when Lilco officially went out of business, sold its electricity service to the state and merged its remaining operations with Brooklyn Union Gas to form the Marketspan Corporation. 
 But then, like a surprise ending in a horror movie, the monster sprang back to life for one more rampage -- with the revelation that Lilco had dished out $67 million in special payments to 26 executives, including $42 million for its unpopular chairman, Dr. William J. Catacosinos, who is continuing in the same role at Marketspan.
Politicians across the state were outraged, led by the angry and embarrassed Governor himself. Mr. Pataki denounced the payments as "outrageous" and "disgraceful" violations of the takeover agreements. He demanded that Dr. Catacosinos (whom he now pointedly called "Mr.") return the money and be removed as Marketspan's chairman.
"It's the old Lilco curse -- it never seems to go away," said Richard M. Kessel, who started fighting the utility as a consumer advocate 25 years ago. He now heads the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency that took over the electricity service.
While the current furor is capturing statewide attention, it is but the latest chapter in the seemingly unending saga of Lilco.
Over the years, the Lilco phenomenon even drew the attention of the White House: President George Bush once urged the opening of the company's nuclear power plant at Shoreham. That ill-fated project was destined to become the only nuclear plant in the nation to be completed but abandoned before it produced power commercially.
Lilco made history right up to the end. The recent state takeover entailed the nation's largest municipal bond issue -- $7 billion -- more than double the previous record. And the bond sale itself has touched off a Federal investigation into how the underwriters were selected.
Founded in 1911 from the merger of several smaller companies, Lilco grew to become one of the nation's biggest -- and most troubled -- utilities. Its service area extended from the Rockaways in Queens through Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and it served a population of nearly three million.
When Lilco expired, it had about 5,000 employees. Under a no-layoff policy, all of them transferred to Marketspan and never missed a day's pay.
But only Dr. Catacosinos and the other 25 executives got special payments, which were authorized by the board of directors and defended as their contractual entitlements. The payments are being investigated by the State Attorney General's office, the Public Service Commission and the State Assembly, and are being challenged in shareholder lawsuits.
Dr. Catacosinos has repeatedly declined to respond to telephone requests for interviews. The payments have been defended by Joseph McDonnell, a Marketspan spokesman and a former Lilco executive who also received a payment. He said they were proper under the executives' contracts with the company.
For Lilco's 96,000 stockholders (about a third of the individual share owners were Long Islanders), the company provided roller-coaster investment chills and thrills.
When Dr. Catacosinos took over in 1984, the company's stock price had dipped to $3.75. By the time the company was disbanded, it had climbed to $29.81.
The roots of Lilco's troubles date to the mid-1960's, when company officials began their plan to build Shoreham.
That project, originally estimated at $65 million, eventually cost 100 times more -- about $6.5 billion. (As in most other Lilco issues, not everyone agrees on what the project actually cost.)
Public opposition to the Shoreham plant grew over environmental, safety and cost concerns. At one point, hundreds of suburbanites rallied at the plant's gates, and protesters scaled the fences. Reflecting the mood of voters, politicians won elections railing against Lilco.
Despite such opposition, Lilco forged ahead with construction and won a Federal license to operate the plant.
In the end, public opposition was so great that Lilco struck a deal with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1989. The company closed the plant and sold it to the state for $1. In return, Lilco was guaranteed rate increases to pay off the Shoreham debt.
But that debt became an albatross to Lilco. Its electricity rates soared, costing the typical homeowner $100 a month and cutting into the bottom line of local businesses.
Even as they attacked Lilco, local politicians added to its costs by jacking up the assessments on its power plants, including the one at Shoreham. Lilco passed the high property taxes on to its customers in their monthly bills.
As exasperation with Lilco grew, the State Legislature created the power authority to confront the problem. Under Governor Cuomo, the authority made several unsuccessful bids to take over the company.
In 1994, Mr. Pataki -- who had attacked the idea of a state takeover -- ousted Mr. Cuomo, helped by strong support on Long Island.
Mr. Pataki had a change of heart on the takeover issue, however, after a court ordered officials in Suffolk County to refund Lilco more than $1 billion in excess taxes levied on Shoreham. The refunds could have meant huge tax increases in Suffolk.
The purpose of the takeover deal was not only to lower electricity bills, but also to prevent those tax increases, sparing Suffolk officials -- most of them Republicans like the Governor -- much political pain.
After the takeover, the power authority immediately cut electricity rates by an average of 20 percent. It also plans to send refund checks of $101 to each customer in Suffolk and $232 to each customer in Nassau and the Rockaways.
Much of the savings is due to the authority's use of low-cost, tax-free bonds for financing.
Ralph Nader has called the deal a prime example of "lemon socialism," meaning the use of public money to bail out private sector failures, and opponents see it as a giveaway to Lilco shareholders.
Critics say that because of the authority's plan to delay debt repayment, the rate cuts cannot be sustained.
They also contend that because the authority has long-term contracts for Marketspan to supply electricity and operate the old Lilco system, the monopoly has simply been locked in under a new guise.
Even in the latest Lilco chapter, the critics say the executive payments are a mere side issue to a multibillion-dollar folly. They blame Mr. Pataki -- not Dr. Catacosinos -- and say that the Governor's attacks on the payments were a pre-emptive strike to deflect charges that he was fooled by Lilco.
For the Governor and Mr. Kessel, the head of the power authority, "to express outrage and shock about the benefit package is totally disingenuous," said Jack Kulka, chairman of the Initiative for Competitive Energy, a coalition of opponents of the takeover. "The $67 million revelation proves they were both outsmarted by Catacosinos, so now they are practicing political damage control."
Assemblyman Paul E. Harenberg, who wrote the law creating the power authority, said: "Just last week they were all shaking hands, but unfortunately the Governor and Kessel were asleep at the switch while Catacosinos was robbing people blind. They ought to reopen the negotiations."
Mr. Kessel defends the deal, saying it will provide "the biggest across-the-board rate cut in the nation."
But he conceded that "the good news is temporarily overshadowed by Lilco's last act of greed."
And Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said: "Governor Pataki gave Lilco billions of dollars, and some of it found its way to Catacosinos's pocket. If there is somebody Long Islanders should be angry at, it is George Pataki, not Bill Catacosinos." Mr. Catacosinos's responsibility was to the shareholders, Mr. Shapiro added, "and he did a good job of that."
Many of Lilco's former customers are delighted to be rid of the company but are wary of the new arrangement, judging by random interviews.
As for Dr. Catacosinos, public hanging is one of the more polite suggestions customers made.
"I'm certainly glad Lipa took it over," said Randy Daub, a security chief from Oyster Bay, "but I'm very unhappy with Catacosinos and his $42 million. I'd be glad to see more of a rate cut, but anything was better than having Lilco. The service was fine, but the rates were outrageous."

HEADLINE: Speakers Stress Racial Healing At Service for Dragging Victim

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: JASPER, Tex., June 13

 BODY:
In an overflowing Baptist church where his small-town family shared pews with big-city politicians, James Byrd Jr. began his odyssey today from victim of a gruesome racial slaying to symbol of the nation's need for racial healing.
Speaker after speaker at Mr. Byrd's funeral said his death last Sunday -- which the authorities say came at the hands of three white men who beat him and dragged him in chains from a moving pickup truck, dismembering his body -- should bring whites and blacks together in outrage and determination to end racial violence. 
 "Dr. King would say that unearned suffering is redemptive, that there's power in the blood of the innocent," said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has been at the side of the Byrd family for most of the week. "Brother Byrd's innocent blood alone could very well be the blood that changes the course of our country, because no one has captured the nation's attention like this tragedy."
Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Byrd had entered the pantheon of the nation's racial martyrs and victims, and he proposed that the town of Jasper erect a monument in his memory as a tangible protest against hate crimes.
Several of the politicians and national black leaders who spoke acknowledged that Mr. Byrd's family was uncomfortable with the idea of turning him into a national symbol, and would have preferred to have had a quieter service without the political rallying cries. But they said the need to invest this death with meaning was too great.
"We know, Clara, that you wanted to be left alone," said Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, referring to one of Mr. Byrd's sisters, Clara Taylor. "But we can't. We have to be with you. We have to be with this family and we have to be here in Jasper. Because we can ill afford to have what has happened here happen any place else across this land."
The Byrd family had already given up its hope for a truly private funeral, although it did ban reporters and photographers from Greater New Bethel Baptist Church, where Mr. Byrd's father is a deacon and his mother a Sunday school teacher. Only 200 people could fit in the sanctuary, leaving 600 others to listen to a public-address system outside.
Most of the speakers -- including Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, and Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who serves as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus -- had never met Mr. Byrd, an unemployed 49-year-old man whose ambles about this town of 8,000 made him a familiar figure to many of its black residents. Neither had many of the black mourners who came from around Texas, or the presidents of regional N.A.A.C.P. chapters, or advocates like the Rev. Al Sharpton from New York.
But the random brutality of Mr. Byrd's death seemed to strike both fear and a sense of responsibility in many black leaders, several of whom said any member of the community could have been similarly violated.
One of the few speakers who knew Mr. Byrd well was the pastor of the church, the Rev. Kenneth O. Lyons, who grew up across the street from the Byrd family in east Jasper. Alone among those who spoke, he declined to make his old neighbor into an explicit symbol, instead preaching an old-fashioned eulogy in answer to a question Mr. Byrd asked him long ago about the message of his church.
"We need to talk Jesus," Mr. Lyons said, to rousing responses from the audience inside and out. "We tried everything else, so brothers and sisters, we need to try Jesus." He made only an indirect reference to the violence of the crime when he reminded his listeners that Herod had beheaded John the Baptist.
There were several white residents at the funeral, and throughout the day, many townspeople wore yellow ribbons and kept their car headlights on. Flags in Jasper, which is about 30 percent black, flew at half staff at several shopping strips. But later in the day there was a reminder that not everyone was viewing Mr. Byrd's death with the resolute serenity asked for in the church.
About 15 black men dressed in paramilitary uniforms and carrying rifles and shotguns marched from the sheriff's office into Mr. Byrd's neighborhood, urging black residents to arm themselves.The group of gang members, followers of the Nation of Islam and members of an organization calling itself the New Black Panthers, was led by Khallid Muhammad of New York, a former aide to Minister Louis Farrakhan. They drew little attention from Mr. Byrd's neighbors, who preferred to remember a gentle friend in the way his family most desired.

HEADLINE: WORLD CUP '98;
Who Needs Ronaldo? Germany Has Bierhoff

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: NICE, France, June 13

 BODY:
While the Americans have camped at an isolated vineyard for the World Cup, with only Beaujolais grapes to keep them company, Germany has chosen the fun and sun of the Riviera.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl dropped in for a visit on Friday. And Coach Berti Vogts has brought along classical music to the Cote d'Azur, better to help him relax by the pool while he works on his tan. 
 And why shouldn't Vogts be so serene? While the Americans are desperately looking for someone -- anyone -- who can put the ball into the net during Monday's opener in Paris, the German team enters the match with four of the best forwards in the world.
Vogts will choose two, most likely Jurgen Klinsmann, making his third World Cup appearance, and Oliver Bierhoff, the latest scoring sensation in the Italian League who has revived a career that once seemed destined to end without the slightest hint of international recognition.
It was not the great Ronaldo of Brazil who led Italy's Serie A in scoring this season. Nor was it Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina. Nor was it the Italian stars Roberto Baggio or Alessandro Del Piero. It was the tall, slender Bierhoff, an economics student, who plunked in 27 goals for Udinese, earning himself a handsome $12 million transfer for next season to help resuscitate the fallen giant AC Milan.
"It's a bit strange to be called a superstar in the same breath with those other athletes," the 30-year-old Bierhoff said. "I hope I am able to bear the pressure and perform to expectations."
At 6 feet 2 inches, he is tall for a striker. While Klinsmann roams the flanks, Bierhoff is a classic center forward who waits like a poacher in front of the goal for the chance to score. Like a basketball forward, he is an expert at backing in and using his arms in the low post. For each goal that he scores in the World Cup, he said, his sponsors will contribute a total of $6,700 to Unicef.
"You have to be aware that he uses his body and his arms to push you away," said Thomas Dooley, the American sweeper who was born in Germany. "He's very tall, so it's easy for him. He's very good in the air; you have to try to hold him when he jumps."
Upon signing with AC Milan, Bierhoff said he hoped to outscore Ronaldo in the World Cup, just as he outscored him in the Italian League. He said he felt the need to get noticed. Perhaps that is because he went so long without recognition. Playing in the World Cup seems almost like a dream, he said.
"Sometimes I think I have to wake up," Bierhoff said.
His father, Rolf, is the director of a regional power company. As a young player in Essen, Germany, Bierhoff admittedly played like the rich kid that he was. He was reluctant to dive on the ground for balls, he said, and at the end of every match, his jersey remained an unstained white. His father cured him of this fastidiousness by having him dive 50 times in a row onto wet grass covered with a scrim of ice. Three or four repeats of this drill convinced the shivering teen-ager that daintiness was not an admired trait in soccer.
"I had to learn to get dirty," he said.
Still, he kicked around the German Bundesliga for years, moving from one team to the next without exciting anyone, and finally, during the 1990-91 season, Bierhoff struck out for Austria, where he scored 23 goals in 32 league games for Salzburg. That got him a ticket to the Italian League, but Inter Milan farmed him out right away to Ascoli in the second division. Ascoli didn't want him either. Bierhoff told Agence France-Presse that one day about 100 fans surrounded his car, spitting at him and issuing threats and insults.
The team's president told him not to bother coming back to practice, Bierhoff said. Stubborn, he would not leave. A new coach came in and encouraged him and, a season later, Bierhoff led Italy's second division in scoring with 20 goals. That got him a promotion to Udinese for the 1995-96 season, and caught Vogts's attention when he was putting together Germany's team for the 1996 European championships.
"That was my baddest experience but my most important experience," Bierhoff said of Ascoli. "Now, if I have some difficulties, I'm not falling down. I have only to think about that time."
Bierhoff scored only twice in the 1996 European tournament, but he delivered his second goal in sudden death overtime to defeat the Czech Republic in the championship game. Once a nobody, he was now a national hero.
"I was so low, I could only go up," Bierhoff said.
He added, "It was very important to do something on the international level."
Bierhoff has improved his conditioning, and the explosiveness in his legs, by using weights, and his goal scoring has provided him with muscular confidence. He has scored 17 goals in 26 appearances with the national team.
As for the Americans, Bierhoff said he knew little about them, except that it was important for Germany to play its own game. The three-time World Cup champions tend to start slowly and build throughout the tournament. "But we've been warned," Bierhoff said. "The Americans aren't some little team. They've beaten Brazil. We know we have to be 100 percent now. But at the end we are one of the favorites, and we have to accept it and show that we're a good team."

HEADLINE: BENEFITS DWINDLE ALONG WITH WAGES FOR THE UNSKILLED

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Since the 1970's, the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled workers has widened sharply. But new research shows the inequality does not stop there.
Discrepancies in job benefits and the quality of work life have also grown, pointing to a bigger chasm than previously recognized. 
 "Unskilled workers get the short end of the stick -- and it's getting shorter," said James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago.
Study after study has shown that the gains from post-1970's economic growth have eluded unskilled workers. The median wage of those with only a high school diploma fell by 6 percent, adjusted for inflation, from 1980 to 1996, while the earnings of college graduates rose by 12 percent. Though there have been indications in recent months that a scarcity of workers in the surging American economy has begun raising wages for those on the low end, the gain has been modest so far and not enough to counter the decades-long trend.
Besides, wages alone provide an incomplete picture of a worker's standing. Though economists have long recognized the need to incorporate working conditions and fringe benefits in any comprehensive analysis, they have been stymied by a lack of detailed data.
Until now. Brooks Pierce, an economist at the United States Department of Labor, used confidential data regularly collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics from businesses to measure trends in total compensation. The results are striking: While specialists had long assumed that benefits acted as a leveling influence, particularly because of Government-required benefits like Social Security and unemployment insurance, the opposite is true.
In 1982, people in the top one-tenth of the work force made $24.80 an hour, 3.95 times the $6.28 an hour for workers in the bottom one-tenth. By 1996, the wage gap had widened, with the high-end workers averaging $25.74 an hour, or 4.72 times the $5.46 an hour of those at the bottom. Wages for the purposes of Mr. Pierce's study are all expressed in 1997 dollars to account for inflation.
The decline among unskilled workers is hardly surprising given the increasing demands of an information-driven economy. But to understand it requires a look at total compensation, which places a value on benefits like health insurance, vacation time and pension plans.
By Mr. Pierce's calculation, the total compensation in 1982 of workers in the top 10 percent -- $35.16 a hour -- was 4.56 times that of workers in the bottom 10 percent -- $7.72 an hour. Fourteen years later, the ratio had increased to 5.43 to 1, with highly paid workers having gained $1.73 an hour and low-end workers having lost 93 cents an hour.
Benefits led to a greater discrepancy in earnings between high- and low-wage workers in both 1982 and 1996. Moreover, they were responsible for one-tenth of the increasing disparity between the working elite and the working poor over the 14 years.
Benefits have long been perceived as a great equalizer. In percentage terms, after all, a bare-bones $3,000 medical insurance package adds more to the compensation of a worker making $20,000 than a full-frills $10,000 package for an executive earning $200,000.
The catch, according to Mr. Pierce, is that a growing number of workers at the bottom of the pay scale have lost access to key employer-provided benefits.
More than 80 percent of workers received paid holidays and vacations in 1996, but less than 10 percent of those in the bottom tenth received paid leave of any kind. Similarly, about 70 percent of workers have pension plans, while less than 10 percent of those in the bottom can count on any employer-financed retirement benefits. Access to health insurance follows a similar pattern.
Employers generally cannot deny benefits to lower-wage workers without putting the tax-exempt status of those benefits at risk. So how is this disparity in benefits possible?
Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University whose own research on medical benefits confirms Mr. Pierce's findings, points to loopholes that allow companies to deny benefits to workers just starting out and to workers not classified as full time. "Employers are figuring out all sort of ways to discriminate between employees they wish to keep and those who come and go," he said.
None of this would come as news to Mary Mendez, a 40-year-old single mother who sorts apples in a packing plant in Wenatchee, Wash., for $7.71 an hour. Her employer takes such a strict view toward paid absences that she was docked for the hours she missed while recovering from a minor accident at the plant. And while the company does offer health insurance in an industry where fringes are rare, she must contribute $21 a month to cover her child.
In other cases, employers have turned to temporary and contract workers, whose pay packages do not include time off and other benefits. United Parcel Service even endured a strike in which a big issue was the company's desire to use more part-time workers to hold down costs.
Perhaps an even bigger surprise than the lack of benefits is how little people with especially demanding or unpleasant jobs are compensated for difficult working conditions.
Job hazards, everything from working in extreme temperatures to working a dangerous, lonely night shift at a highway convenience store, would seem to command higher wages than similar work under less taxing circumstances.
Lillie Reed says her job as an aide in a nursing home in Stamford, Conn., is dirty, sometimes dangerous -- and getting harder.
A few years ago, each nursing assistant cared for seven patients. Today, it could be as many 16 on weekends. "The people coming to the home are older, sicker and angrier," she adds. "It's really tough lifting them, dressing them and keeping them clean."
By looking at arguably the best measure of job conditions, the risk of injury, a new study by Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas, found that workers on the low end of the wage scale were falling ever further behind.
In 1979, workers in the top quarter of wage earners lost 38 percent more days to on-the-job injuries than workers in the bottom quarter, Mr. Hamermesh found. By 1995, the pattern had reversed. High-wage earners lost 32 percent less days than low-wage earners.
It is hard to believe that only workers at the top end of the wage scale are interested in their own health and safety. One possible explanation for the failure to reduce injuries among low earners, suggests Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton University, is the declining power of labor unions.
While employers may know how dangerous a job is and how much it would cost to make it safer, individual workers rarely do. A union may be able to even the playing field by tracking health and safety issues and negotiating improvements.
Another explanation, favored by Mr. Hamermesh, is that all unskilled workers -- union and nonunion -- have lost much ground over the last two decades as skilled workers added so much more to corporate productivity. "Over all, workplace safety hasn't changed much," Mr. Hamermesh said. "High-paid blue-collar workers with hazardous jobs have simply become low-paid blue-collar workers in hazardous jobs."
In sheer number, construction workers are probably the group most affected. Asbestos workers in New York City are a good illustration. In the late 1980's, the union wage for removing asbestos insulation from old buildings was $31 an hour. But in the 1990's, an influx of largely Polish immigrants eager for even hazardous jobs led to a rise in nonunion removal companies and a collapse in wages for both groups.
"Contractors had no trouble getting workers for $12 to $15 an hour -- and workers willing to do the job without respirators," said Pawel Kedzior, the business manager for Local 78 of the Asbestos, Lead and Hazardous Waste Laborers.
The local has made a comeback under new leadership, recruiting 1,200 Polish and 500 Hispanic members. But the current union wage of $19.90 an hour for asbestos removal -- sometimes with little effort to protect workers from asbestos detritus -- is the contemporary reality of the market for unskilled labor.
After making some assumptions about the value of job safety, Mr. Hamermesh found that the increased risk of injury between high-paying and low-paying work had significantly compounded wage inequality. By his calculation, the change in injury rates magnifies the growth in the wage gap by as much as 30 percent.
To many advocates for the poor, such evidence underscores the importance of enforcing health and safety regulations and of encouraging employers to provide benefits to low-wage earners. Economists do not disagree, but they say that the relatively low productivity of unskilled workers is the root of the problem and warn that it is not so easily solved.
An increase in amenities and benefits for these people would almost certainly lead to downward pressure on wages or increased unemployment. "There's no obvious way around it," said Mr. Krueger of Princeton. "At the end of the day, mandated improvements in working conditions would most likely be paid for by wage cuts."

HEADLINE: Manhattan's Real Estate Boom Spreads to the West Side, With or Without a Stadium

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The West Side of Manhattan south of 42d Street has been the subject of intense real-estate speculation in recent years. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said that a proposed baseball stadium over the rail yards at 33d Street and 11th Avenue would unleash a torrent of new development.
But some of that is already under way, according to real estate brokers and developers. In the latest example, David Werner and Credit Suisse First Boston emerged on Friday as the winning bidders for the Starrett-Lehigh Building, a mammoth green and red building near the West Side Highway in Chelsea that serves as a landmark to the city's disappearing industrial past. 
 Mr. Werner, his partner Mendy Wolfe and First Boston bid slightly more than $150 million, a surprisingly high sum for the aging, 19-story, 1.9 million-square-foot building. But it is another indication that industrial buildings on the West Side have become hot commodities as midtown rents soar and office tenants look west for less expensive space.
Mr. Werner outmaneuvered some rival developers, Larry Silverstein, Douglas Durst, Richard Kalikow, and Laurence Gluck of the Stellar Management Company. All the bidders were planning to renovate the building and increase rents from $10 a square foot to about $25, which is still well below the midtown average.
"It's the latest example of the unchecked appreciation of New York real estate values," said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties. "There's a strong move west now, and it looks like some office development may actually take hold."
The Starrett-Lehigh Building, which is owned by Leona Helmsley, was built in 1932 as a freight terminal and warehouse for steel, tire and even wine companies. Train tracks once ran under the building, which covers the block bound by 26th and 27th Streets, between 11th and 12th Avenues. Trucks can descend from driveways on 27th Street to gigantic elevators that carry the tractor-trailers to various floors for deliveries. The upper floors offer spectacular views of the Hudson River.
Over the last year, Mrs. Helmsley has sold more than $1.2 billion worth of the real estate holdings of her late husband, Harry B. Helmsley.
Benjamin V. Lambert, the chairman of Eastdil Realty who organized the sale for Mrs. Helmsley, confirmed that a top bidder had been selected, but he declined to provide details. Real estate executives, however, say that Mr. Werner had the high bid and would be the most likely buyer.
The new owner will have to invest as much as $80 million to make the landmark building attractive to office tenants, real estate executives say. There are only four passenger elevators in the 19-story building. The lobby needs to be refurbished, and the heating system and steel windows need to be replaced.
The current tenants range from a printing company to an advertising photographer's studio. Nearly one-third of the building is vacant.
Demand for office space in the area is expected to increase because there is little new construction. Indeed, prices for buildings in the garment district south of Times Square have more than doubled over the last year as office tenants have taken over showroom buildings and lofts.
Although many developers who pushed over to the West Side during the last real estate boom were hammered during the recession in the early 1990's, the new crop of speculators believe the risks are worth it, especially at the Starrett-Lehigh Building.
"It's one of the last great opportunities to buy space at a low price per pound," said William V. Adamski, director of the real estate finance group at First Boston.

Does Shakespeare Really Need B12 Shots?

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

 BODY:
THERE probably isn't a scholar or critic in the world who would rate "Henry VIII" as one of Shakespeare's great history plays. It possesses no grandly iconic heroes or villains of diabolic ambitions. It contains no patches of soaring verse and commemorates no single splendid event that forever changed the course of the British monarchy. It is essentially a patched-together propaganda piece.
The general belief today is that Shakespeare himself wrote less than half the text, and that John Fletcher and others were responsible for the rest. Part pageant, part history, the play seems to have been composed quickly and to order, possibly to celebrate the marriage of James I's daughter in 1613. 
 Yet as presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company during its recent 18-day residency at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, "Henry VIII" is suddenly revealed to be a vivid and compelling theatrical artifact. Here is an emotionally charged, early-17th-century docudrama, gorgeously designed and costumed, acted cleanly and without affectation, as engaging to the intellect for the history it omits as for the history it embraces.
This production is the kind of discovery that is expected of the giant, financially besieged R.S.C., which maintains three theaters in Stratford-on-Avon and two at the Barbican Center in London, tours regularly in Britain and abroad and has 29 productions in its current repertory. Certainly, "Henry VIII" is the most fully realized of the three Shakespeare productions in the company's five-play touring repertory, which, following its Brooklyn engagement, is now at the Kennedy Center in Washington through July 5.
Though this tour was designed to show off the R.S.C. to advantage (and could, if successful, become a recurring event), it also demonstrates why London press support for the company has eroded. Some English critics argue that the R.S.C. isn't adventurous in either its choice of plays or approach to the productions it chooses to stage. They also worry that many of its productions simply aren't good enough.
Because Americans aren't often bombarded by competing conceptions of "King Lear" or "Henry V" or "Hamlet," we're inclined to be grateful for any halfway decent Shakespeare that comes along. We can't easily yawn at the prospect of another more or less conventional "Julius Caesar" when we haven't seen any major productions of "Julius Caesar" in years.
Thus the Americans' surprise and disappointment when the R.S.C. comes over and, in addition to the seldom seen "Henry VIII," presents fancified though indifferently performed productions of "Hamlet" and "Cymbeline." Even its production of Samuel Beckett's "Krapp's Last Tape," starring Edward Petherbridge, is a letdown. It is a perfunctory staging of the classic that David Kelly of the Gate Theater of Dublin performed so exquisitely during the 1996 Lincoln Center Festival. (I missed "Everyman," the medieval morality play that is also in the R.S.C. touring repertory.)
Unlike "Henry VIII," which was presented at the comparatively intimate Majestic Theater, both "Hamlet" and "Cymbeline" were seen in the cavernous BAM Opera House, where, even if you are seated in the middle of the orchestra, you seem to be miles from the stage. Spoken words have a way of going astray when lobbed from the stage out to the distant audience. Acoustics, however, are not the only problem. Concepts also interfere.
The R.S.C.'s cinematically inspired "Hamlet" begins promisingly, though irrelevantly, with home movies (Hamlet as a small boy, playing with his father in the family compound). It then jumps to "the present": what looks to be a madcap Long Island evening party, complete with a large swing band, on the occasion of the marriage of Claudius and Gertrude. Pay no attention to the dialogue, which still contains references to kings and queens and such. Claudius could be the new head of his late brother's brokerage firm, Gertrude a bored, middle-aged socialite who winters in Barbados, and Hamlet a Yale student who drinks too much.
As with so many attempts to update and find contemporary associations to the classics, this concept has no place to go once it is established. It simply gets in the way. Reducing the members of this lusting, neurotic royal family to the status of the haute bourgeoisie, circa 1950, also reduces the stakes, makes the governing passions seem petty and renders the violence more wanton than inevitable. The concept doesn't seem to have been thought through. When Laertes comes on carrying a rifle and looking for Hamlet, you might think he had been hunting squirrels.
The language is all but lost amid these bizarre images. Alex Jennings's Hamlet is likely to be remembered more for his wardrobe, his decadent good looks (and the white-painted face he affects at one point) than for anything he says. This is a "Hamlet" in which the gravedigger sings "September Song," Ophelia wears red shoes in her mad scene (evoking Judy Garland in "The Wizard of Oz") and the Ghost turns up in a dinner jacket. Every now and then, when you hear a familiar speech, it seems to be a mistake, as if the soundtrack from another movie were butting in.
Performances are impossible to judge in these circumstances. Susannah York, a most appealing and sexy actress on the screen, appears to be distant, small and unnaturally quiet as Gertrude. This isn't necessarily her fault: the entire play is like a badly edited film composed entirely of longshots. Matthew Warchus, who staged the hit productions of "Art" in London and New York, is the director.
Adrian Noble, the R.S.C.'s artistic director, is responsible for "Cymbeline," though one wonders how he finds the time to direct individual productions when he is also expected to administer the company's $50 million yearly budget, attend to the needs of its 750 employees, oversee 2,100 annual performances and, in his spare time, raise private money to supplement the company's ever smaller state subsidies.
However he budgets his time, "Cymbeline" is something of an improvement over "Hamlet," if only because the production's concept affects only the costumes and the spare but handsome set design. The inspiration is said to be Kabuki, but it looks to be almost as Chinese as Japanese. The nobly born characters wear great, handsome kimonolike costumes, while the servants are dressed in the sort of trousers, jackets and pillbox hats worn by coolies in old movies of "Shanghai Express" vintage.
No matter, since reality isn't the point. "Cymbeline" is a shimmering fairy tale, far less difficult to follow than it is to synopsize, being about (among other things): a foolish king (Cymbeline); his virtuous but spunky daughter (Imogen); her doubting husband (Posthumus); her evil stepmother; Posthumus's treacherous, lecherous friend; banishments; mistaken identities; long-lost children; decapitation; resurrections from the dead, and, ultimately, forgiveness for almost everyone.
Mr. Noble's production looks good, but it slides too smoothly through the fanciful events of the play without ever finding the appeal or truth of its characters. With two exceptions, most of the principal performances are astonishingly superficial, composed of actorly readings and the sort of royal gestures you may not have seen in years. Note Cymbeline and his queen as they sweep around the stage, declaiming in their voluminous kimonos and kicking their trains behind them. Watching this production you might suspect that train-kicking is taught along with fencing at British drama schools.
In the pivotal role of Imogen, Joanne Pearce is pretty, spirited, husky-voiced and commanding, very much the modern woman that George Bernard Shaw admired in the character. The other noteworthy performance is that of Guy Henry, who plays Cloten, the queen's dimwitted twit of a son. Mr. Henry doesn't let his broadly comic lines go without savoring them a bit too long, but he is in touch with his role and with the sense of the play.
Though Shaw wrote that "Cymbeline" is "for the most part stagy trash of the lowest melodramatic order," he also admitted, "I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespeare." He was sufficiently hooked by the play to write his own substitute last act, published in 1938 as "Cymbeline Refinished." According to Shaw, the emancipated Imogen refuses to be reunited happily ever after with her Posthumus and goes her own way.
O rare G.B.S.!
(Though "Cymbeline" is infrequently performed, New York will be seeing a second one in August when Andrei Serban's version opens at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park as part of the New York Shakespeare Festival.)
Compared to "Hamlet" and "Cymbeline," Gregory Doran's production of "Henry VIII" is a vigorous, clear-eyed, unhackneyed delight. Its focus: the plight of Katharine of Aragon, Henry's first wife, whom he's in the process of dumping in favor of Anne Bullen (Boleyn), soon to be the mother of Elizabeth.
That such a play, written so soon after Queen Elizabeth's death in 1603, could present a strong, sympathetic portrayal of Katharine seems odd, especially since the play ends on the triumphant note of Elizabeth's birth and christening. Poor, soon to be headless, Anne figures hardly at all in the drama, which also deals with the fall from favor of Cardinal Wolsey.
"Henry VIII" or "All Is True," as it was known to contemporary audiences, is a treasure trove of what today look like contradictory political impulses.
The familiar Holbein portrait of Henry is recalled early in the production, but the role, and Paul Jesson's measured performance of it, are otherwise free of cliches and, for that matter, all idiosyncratic particulars. Instead of leaving a vacuum at the center of the play, this creates a kind of mystery that prompts not boredom but speculation. Like the god he was when he ruled, Henry appears to be accessible while remaining unknowable.
Jane Lapotaire is very fine as the abandoned wife who tenaciously fights Henry all the way to her eventual house arrest in a second-class castle. It's a tough, proud, unsentimental performance by the actress who, four years ago, starred in the R.S.C.'s memorable revival of "Ghosts." If you have the chance, note also Ian Hogg's excellent portrayal of Wolsey, the worldly prince of the church who was both perpetrator and victim.
"Henry VIII" is a most entertaining minor drama about which we know even less than we do about Shakespeare. One fact is documented: it can be incendiary. In the course of a performance of the play on June 29, 1613, the Globe Theater burned to the ground, the thatched roof apparently ignited by the debris from a fiery special effect.
 
'Once in a Lifetime'
 You have to run if you want to catch the Atlantic Theater Company's nifty revival of "Once in a Lifetime," which closes on Thursday. This is the seminal 1930 George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart sendup of Hollywood, about moviemakers at the time they were blundering into the sound era. Imagine a bunch of chimpanzees who have found a camcorder and you get the idea.
It's not likely you will see another such revival anytime soon. As "Once in a Lifetime" lethally satirizes the manners (and business practices) of Hollywood in the late 1920's, the play itself reflects the economics of Broadway in 1930. The revival, directed by David Pittu and designed by James Noone, is a marvel of ingenuity. It employs 21 actors to play the 45 characters who appear in five separate, more or less realistic settings.
Playwrights in those days didn't have to condense and foreshorten. When they needed more characters or additional changes of scene, they just typed them in. This often resulted in a looseness of structure, but it also made possible the sort of well-populated farces that were the Kaufman and Hart specialty.
Nuts abound in "Once in a Lifetime." Two of the most endearing: Herman Glogauer. the alternately bullying and smarmy chief of Glogauer Studios, played by Larry Bryggman in one of the funniest performances of the year to date, and Rudolph Kammerling, an intense German director who just happens to make the wrong movie. Peter Jacobson is exceptionally comic in this role.
Give credit also to John Ellison Conlee, Johanna Day and Tony Carlin. They play three ex-vaudevillians from New York who seek new careers as voice teachers in Hollywood, but accidentally save Glogauer Studios instead. Some of the comedy's more vivid characters don't even appear on the stage: the 12 powerful Schlepkin Brothers who, as described, sound very much like the Warner Brothers. There were only four Warners, but the way they threw their weight around they seemed like an entire squad.
"Once in a Lifetime," the first of the string of Kaufman and Hart collaborations, isn't nonstop hilarity. It has its calm spots, but it also has the intelligence and wit you don't often find in what passes for farce in today's entertainment manufacturing business.

COLD NEW WORLD
 Growing Up in a Harder Country.
 By William Finnegan.
 421 pp. New York:
 Random House. $26. 
 Mindy, the protagonist of one of the four nonfiction reports in William Finnegan's "Cold New World," is a teen-ager living in a Los Angeles suburb so down on its luck that the abandoned tract houses are routinely used by Hollywood directors when they need to blow up something big. Mindy is looking for an ideology, a set of beliefs, a religion -- something that might make sense of her condition in contemporary America. She settles on Mormonism, Finnegan tells us.
Then he deploys a narrative tactic that he uses to great effect throughout the book. He drops in a few deadpan sentences that plunge the story into one of the uncommon worlds he explores with the determination of Stanley on his search for Livingstone. "Actually," Finnegan writes, "before Mindy became a Mormon, she had wanted to become Jewish. But that had turned out to be too much work. Becoming a Mormon was relatively easy. All this was before Mindy got addicted to crystal methamphetamine and became a Nazi, in the ninth grade."
Mindy becomes Finnegan's native bearer, as he calls her, leading him to a scary remote crossroads in our bustling economy, Antelope Valley, Calif., where "widespread white insecurity and downward mobility intersected with significant black and Latino upward mobility."
In another story in the book, Finnegan uses the same tactic to introduce a onetime box folder in New Haven named Terry: "He started fingering a pile of not-yet-folded pizza boxes. 'I love these things,' he said dreamily. 'I got really good at folding boxes at Kevin's Seafood. The better you fold 'em, the more you can do.' At Kevin's, Terry was earning about $50 a week. Then a friend of a friend offered him work that paid $1,000 a week." So Terry becomes a drug dealer, and Finnegan's guide to America's crack economy.
Each part of "Cold New World" latches on to small figures caught up in forces larger than they are and far beyond their comprehension. Finnegan describes a high-tech drug assault in a tiny East Texas town, Operation White Tornado, that deployed 200 agents and found only five ounces of cocaine. The raid managed to sweep many financially independent blacks into the pen for long unforgiving stretches, and Finnegan points out that it was supported by some whites who "simply didn't like the idea of blacks' getting uppity -- a prejudice that 'drugs' covered nicely."
Yet another section of the book, and my favorite, concerns the troubles of a Mexican-American tough named Juan. It reads like a novella, and the contradictions at play in this story alone are worth the price of the book. No illiterate street punk, Juan is smart and clever, like his girlfriend, but he lacks her ambition and so breaks up with her. His ethnic pride is so convoluted that he mocks all things Mexican; he claims to loathe the food. Juan is not from a broken home. He has two parents, long married, hard-working, decent to the core. He's in trouble with the local gangs, but it's because he refuses to join one. Lost in his parents' adopted land, he exhausts his talents on fighting and drinking.
Finnegan's ability to plumb his characters' complexities is due to his documentary style. He settles upon a character and a place, and then he just keeps coming back for more and more visits, sometimes for years. Minor problems arise from such long-term reporting. Terry's story is so old that there is a creakiness to the slang -- as when Terry boasts that he's "livin' large" and looking "dope." But Finnegan's hanging-around technique yields riches among the kind of people that most reporters would strenuously avoid. His stories do not concern a trial of the century, a perfect storm or the ascent of a tall mountain. Instead, they are about powerless people left battered and grounded by an economy that may be richly rewarding the educated, but is cruelly punishing many others.
Finnegan ranges widely in the lives of his subjects. In the case of Mindy, we meet her mom, her friends, several boyfriends, pen pals, her mom's boyfriend and her mom's boyfriend's son. We also meet Mindy's enemies, particularly Heather, the "Aryan Mother" who threatens to kill her for befriending Darius, a skinhead of color.
Professors of journalistic ethics might object, but Finnegan becomes personally involved in the lives of these people without too much hand wringing. In a moment of unintended comedy, he finds himself chauffeuring nine assorted skinheads to a rave in his rental car. After they arrive, a fight breaks out and one of Finnegan's passengers bolts toward the rental, reaches under the seat and retrieves a knife. Finnegan later lectures the boy, expressing his anger that he and his car were used to transport weapons.
The cumulative effect is to create an unusual kind of sympathy for the characters he describes. It's not the stereotypical liberal sense of pity. Rather, Finnegan convincingly connects the wayward events in these people's lives to the messages and forces they detect around them -- whether from a fractured home, a school tracking system that subtly winnows out the losers from the gifted or just the plain despair inherent in what Finnegan calls our national religion of "liberal consumerism."
We see how and why these people make their wretched choices and the seeming inevitability of it all: it's not that their dreams reach beyond the grasp of their capabilities, it's that they don't dream at all. The pipelines of opportunity leading out of the lower end of our economy are being shut off, Finnegan says. He offers statistics revealing that per-pupil spending in California's once-celebrated educational system -- seventh in the nation in the mid-1960's -- has plummeted in three decades to 47th. Fairly half the state's 2,150 public libraries were closed in that time. Given recent tuition hikes and enrollment cuts, and the cancellation of affirmative action programs, the state's colleges and universities have evolved into economic aeries for the privileged children of the upper-middle-class taxpayer. Since 1970, Finnegan reports, the poverty rate in California among children doubled while "poverty among the state's elderly was nearly wiped out." And California is just leading the way for the nation. "It is clearly no coincidence," he continues, "that the 1996 budget of the Children's Defense Fund, the leading national lobby for children's interests, was $15 million while the equivalent lobby for the elderly, the American Association of Retired Persons, in the same year spent $449 million."
Although the four sections of Finnegan's book are seemingly unrelated, there is a larger structure at work here. The first account, about Terry's drug dealing, really concerns a cunning youth making an end run around the limits he senses blocking him. His story is not nearly as unsettling as Juan's, with his mysterious absence of faith in his own talent and future -- mysterious in that it appears to have no origin and no end.
But by the time you get to the last story -- to Mindy and the dark lives of skinheads, boneheads, heshers, punks, Goths and tweakers -- the future has turned truly bleak and frightening. Theirs is a world where the only input comes from Jerry Springer, crude comic books and word of mouth. They are practically medieval in the way that they let the forces of superstition and rumor guide the day-to-day events of their lives. They spend their afternoons spinning out increasingly more paranoid racial theories to explain their own economic imprisonment.
Glimpsing Mindy's world actually makes the reader yearn for the comfort of Terry's rational, if corrupt, decision to become a crack dealer. His motives belong to the familiar sphere of liberal consumerism. He can be reasoned with, possibly persuaded to take some other work. After all, he's just trying to make a living.

HOW IT ALL BEGAN
 By Nikolai Bukharin.
 Translated by George Shriver.
 Introduction by Stephen F. Cohen.
 Illustrated. 345 pp. New York:
 Columbia University Press. $28.95. 
 OF all the early Soviet leaders, Nikolai Bukharin had perhaps the greatest range of interests and talents. He was a lifelong student of the natural sciences, a gifted painter and caricaturist and an experienced journalist. He read widely in literature (Russian, European, American). His writings on economics from the early 1920's are among the most sophisticated theoretical works by a Bolshevik; they display a close familiarity with contemporary Western sociology, which Bukharin did not (like his peers) dismiss as mere bourgeois mystification. And all this intellectual vigor was joined to a warm and unpretentious personality. In the document usually called his "Testament," Lenin noted that his young protege was "rightly considered the favorite of the whole party."
But brilliance and charm are no match for raw cunning -- in politics least of all. During the intraparty struggles following Lenin's death, Bukharin joined Stalin in an alliance against Trotsky's "left opposition." Whereupon Stalin did a volte-face to isolate another danger: the "right opposition," namely Bukharin and his co-thinkers, who wanted a mixed economy incorporating both state-run industry and a vigorous market in agricultural products. Politically neutralized -- his policies consigned to the dustbin of history by the forced collectivization of the peasantry -- Bukharin nonetheless remained an important functionary for the Soviet Government through the mid-30's. Then, at the Moscow trials, he was named a major co-conspirator in numerous acts of sabotage, espionage and assassination. His performance in the docket was strange, almost playful. While confessing to most of the charges, Bukharin contested the details of the case -- calmly tearing it to shreds.
The trial's outcome was never in question. Sixty years ago this March, Bukharin was taken to an execution cell, shot, then effectively written out of Soviet history. Abroad he was remembered, if at all, mainly as the prototype for Rubashov in Arthur Koestler's "Darkness at Noon." He began to resume the dimensions of a figure significant beyond the circumstances of his death only with Stephen F. Cohen's "Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution" (1973). This detailed account of Bukharin's political career and policies also elucidated his distinctive Marxism, with its heterodox emphasis not on violent change but on the tendency of societies toward equilibrium, even in post-revolutionary periods. A tiny but persistent movement to rehabilitate him came to fruition in 1988 when, under Mikhail Gorbachev, he was finally exonerated.
A few years later, Cohen, a professor of politics and Russian studies at Princeton University, was granted access to a portion of the archival material on Bukharin, including four substantial works composed while he was in prison: two works of Marxist theory, a collection of poems and an unfinished novel. The novel, now published in George Shriver's solid English translation as "How It All Began," is a work of very lightly fictionalized autobiography. It seems that Bukharin intended to take the story of his alter ego, Kolya Petrov, up to the 1917 Revolution. But the manuscript breaks off just before the revolution of 1905, with Kolya in his teens -- barely conscious of politics, though that is about to change.
With its swarm of well-delineated minor characters (and their families), "How It All Began" is very much the work of a man with a feel for the 19th-century novel. Kolya Petrov, like his creator, is a product of the intelligentsia. His parents meet as schoolteachers; his father, in particular, is a "type" very familiar from Russian fiction: liberal-minded but ineffectual and vague. After losing his teaching position, Ivan Antonovich becomes a civil servant in a rural town, where his disinclination to torment the Jews arouses suspicion. Bukharin depicts the mediocrity of the provincial middle class, not in the tones of a commissar sentencing it to oblivion, but with humor -- as when describing one of Ivan Antonovich's all-night card games: "Tottering, the honorable gentlemen would make their way, like shellshocked soldiers, into the yard, where shivering from the morning cold, they would stare at the sky that was growing pale and in which the stars could be seen barely twinkling; they saw to their natural needs, then returned once again to poisoning themselves, others and the air with cognac, tobacco and the heat of the game."
The family's steadily declining fortunes barely impinge upon Kolya's awareness of the world. The novel is episodic, like childhood itself, and most of the episodes are very happy -- a series of friendships, hobbies and misadventures, somewhat reminiscent of Mark Twain (whom Kolya reads, along with Moliere and Tolstoy and books on science). Quite a few pages are given to lush and detailed descriptions of flora and fauna in the Russian countryside. Eventually Kolya realizes that not everyone leads such an idyllic life. Unlike some of the peasants he meets, he eats meat every day, and the thought fills him with anger and shame. The discovery of class differences is handled believably, as one element in the gradual development of Kolya's psyche, rather than as some apocalyptic episode in which the Bolshevik-to-be is formed.
If not quite a great novel, it is certainly a very good one: more evidence of the man's exceptional talents. In the introduction, Cohen recounts how the prison writings were unearthed and gives an expert account of their place in Bukharin's intellectual biography. And he notes that the manuscript of "How It All Began" contains very few corrections. Bukharin wrote it at high speed, in barbarous conditions -- with all the vividness of a life flashing in front of his eyes.

MAYBE ONE
 A Personal and Environmental
 Argument for Single-Child Families.
 By Bill McKibben.
 254 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $23. 
 It has become a bipartisan habit to turn vexing public problems into child-centered causes whenever possible. Poverty, health care policy, budget priorities, tobacco companies: the list of issues we must address out of concern for the fate of children keeps growing. Bill McKibben now urges us to address the fate of children out of concern for the issue he cares about most, the environment. In "Maybe One," he brings anxiety about global warming down to earth -- right to your hearth -- by casting it in terms of an intimate childbearing choice. We have until 2050 or so, he gauges, to "stabilize climate at the current level of disruption" and prevent a precariously balanced world from getting utterly out of whack. Since "cleverer technologies and more humble aspirations" may not do the job fast enough, stabilizing the population can serve as a safeguard. If more Americans stopped at a single child, he proposes, we might buy time to "salvage what we can of our relationship with the earth, keep things from getting any worse than they have to be."
McKibben once again proves himself an expert recycler. Ever since he left The New Yorker a decade ago, he has plowed events in his simple Adirondack life into his ecological writing, and plowed elements of each book into the next one. He recently had a daughter, and a vasectomy. Hence this repackaged variation on the "think small" theme of both "The End of Nature" (1989) -- in which he and his wife, worrying about global warming, tried "very hard not to think about how much we'd like a baby" -- and "The Age of Missing Information" (1992), a hymn to rustic, television-free life.
A hair-shirt alarmist in his youth, McKibben has acquired some Snugli-inspired optimism that an ecological consciousness need not be apocalyptic. "It is possible that we face unavoidable calamity," he still fears; "but it's also possible that we'll see remarkable change," he now hopes. McKibben tucks his ecological case for a lower birth rate, slower economic growth and reduced immigration into the middle of his slim book. It won't win over "cornucopians" convinced that there are no limits to the earth's carrying capacity. But readers unnerved by the weird weather, and by the recent invasion of sport utility vehicles, are well primed to nod at green sentiments served up so gently -- and to nod off at the big statistics he sprinkles here and there. Who on earth can say whether McKibben's dream scenario for the United States -- a birth rate of 1.5 children per woman, combined with annual immigration of 400,000, for a population of 230 million in 2050 -- is the answer? He himself only ventures that it "could be crucial, I think, in reducing our environmental damage."
In fact, he's counting on his readers not to trouble their heads too much with the math. One paradox of the think-small creed is that much of its authority rests on the kind of large, abstract calculations that it deems properly beyond human ken. But McKibben's smallest number, that 1.5 birth rate (down from the current 1.9), merits a closer look, since it's the linchpin of the rest of his book. Given the proportion of women the Census Bureau reports as already having zero or one offspring, there's an easier way to arrive at McKibben's goal than to concoct a campaign to persuade -- not, he emphasizes, coerce -- a large portion of the rest to have only one child. He could just urge women who have three or more children to stop at two. (In fact, his campaign for one threatens to undermine his own cause. It's a good way to guarantee that the environmentalist ethic wanes as green-minded nurturers, who are likely to rear little recyclers in their own image, produce a minority of America's children.)
But the just-say-two line is old hat, and would deprive McKibben of the "personal" part of his argument. In it, he employs intimate confession (he bares all in detailing his vasectomy) and parenting advice -- two popular genres -- to sell an environmental message of restraint that Americans, despite his best efforts in the past, have failed to take to heart. His marketing sense is that it's "easier to change fertility than life style. For better or for worse, we live in a culture that can say 'that's enough' in regard to children at least as easily as it can regarding cars."
He could well be onto something: a new baby's gas problems, unlike those of a new Ford Bronco, can keep an owner up at night. McKibben now appreciates that an effective call to conscience, in America at least, should not entail too much inconvenience. It's even better, of course, if the ecologically enlightened path is an upscale alternative of sorts. According to the ruminations on family matters with which McKibben begins and ends "Maybe One," that's just what the one-child choice turns out to be for both child and parents.
In the stroll through psychological literature about only children that opens the book, he has fun showing how they have been unfairly stigmatized as spoiled, lonely oddballs. The child study enthusiast G. Stanley Hall and his disciples planted the stereotype just before the turn of the century in "A Study of Peculiar and Exceptional Children," which McKibben judges "anecdotal, lamebrained and meaningless," and unduly influential. Actually, as he later admits, these conventional prejudices may not have been so misplaced back in an era when many families were very isolated. And by the 1920's, "reputable studies" began challenging anxieties about onlies. McKibben rounds up the data with a zeal Dr. Hall would have approved of, allowing himself only a passing giggle over such sophisticated modern measurements as an Anomie Index and an Index of Richness of Past Experience. But challenging the bias against singletons by showing that they seem basically indistinguishable from other children -- no more anomie than average -- isn't quite enough for this proudly solicitous father of one. The exceptionalist stereotype lives on as McKibben somewhat immodestly hints now and then that such intensively nurtured children may have a leg up in life.
He spends the last section of the book rescuing the parents of only children from the reputation of being selfish, soulless, immature hedonists. McKibben (a Sunday-school teacher in his spare time) tours centuries of religious, especially Christian, arguments about celibacy and fecundity more reverentially than he does the psychological findings about onlies, but emerges equally satisfied with both journeys. His conclusion is that the earth being full enough, thank you, those who selflessly, maturely and soulfully choose to be less fruitful and multiply only once can consider themselves holier than thou. They have more precious time to devote to their child, to their careers and to good causes. "The technologies of contraception," McKibben informs his readers, "can be used as technologies of indulgence and self-obsession, but they can be the technologies of humility as well."
McKibben's real accomplishment in "Maybe One," appropriately enough, is humbler than his sometimes sanctimonious tone suggests. He's highly unlikely to start a one-child trend (or, let's hope, a vogue in vasectomy memoirs). As he himself acknowledges, index-laden psychological studies of family health and success won't clinch the case for most people, unless, like McKibben, they've already made up their minds. Such generalizing misses the chastening yet also inspiring wisdom the second child brings: the daily reminder that no two children, or their relations with their parents, are alike. In any case, the great bulk of McKibben's natural audience of fellow baby boomers is already well embarked on childbearing. His best shot is to sway choices at the margins -- forestall that "afterthought" third child, those post-40 fertility treatments to give No. 1 a sibling. By reminding us that an only child is only and completely a child, not a freak or part of an unfinished family, he makes two children seem like a lucky luxury. A small revelation, it is all McKibben's own case for cutting back requires.

HEADLINE: What to Do About China

BYLINE: By James Webb; James Webb was an Assistant Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
For more than a decade many concerned observers have warned of the dangers in reaching a one-sided rapprochement with China. Invariably, such trepidations have been minimized by "pragmatic" political voices, or shouted down by business leaders who were seduced by China's vast potential market only to become hostages should our policies toward that country turn more confrontational.
The past several years have seen an acceleration of this willing self- deception. The Clinton Administration, buttressed by endorsements from former Republican officials, speaks wanly of a strategic partnership with China. Our crucial alliance with Japan has been strained. Our position in the rest of Asia is being undermined as we shift longstanding trade patterns away from countries with strong preferences for the free market and democracy in favor of China. 
 Meanwhile the Chinese Government's repression and blatant economic corruption have been explained away as internal matters, particularly by American business. Its courting of Muslim nations like Iran, Pakistan and Libya and attempts to penetrate the American political process through campaign donations have been dismissed as presenting no long-term threat.
In the past few weeks the folly of this benign approach became evident with the emergence of both India and Pakistan as nuclear powers. Our failure to censure China for its unremitting effort to help Pakistan become a nuclear power has dramatically altered the strategic world order, and the role the United States must play in it. The implications of world inaction in the face of China's audacity are of the utmost gravity, far beyond such matters as gang warfare in Somalia, petty dictators in Haiti and even the irredentist bloodletting in the Balkans that have thus far sufficed as foreign policy threats to this Administration.
The actions of the Chinese Government in this turn of events loom much larger than Pakistan's or India's. It would have been impossible for Pakistan to develop a nuclear capability without the illicit aid of the Chinese. And while one can justly condemn India for having fired the first shot, the reality of China and Pakistan combining forces in such a manner makes its actions understandable if not commendable.
American Government and business leaders are thus left with the unavoidable truth that China, despite its constant protests to the contrary, can no longer claim to be a non-expansionist power. And they must now prepare for the future consequences of that reality.
They can begin by putting American relationships with Japan, India, Israel and Russia on a much firmer footing. Along with the United States, these four countries possess the key ingredients of geography, military and economic power, and technological superiority to insure that China's future conduct conforms to international norms.
First, Japan. Despite continual bickering over trade policy and its recent economic problems, Japan remains our single most important bilateral relationship. At the same time, Japan to date accounts for nearly 10 percent of direct investment in the Chinese economy, and 30 percent of China's external borrowing. Through its power to reorient these activities, Japan has the standing to influence China's economic and military conduct, particularly with American backing. As relations with China enter a new phase, we should work to strengthen this most important of alliances.
Second, Israel. It stands to lose greatly through the strategic axis China is developing with the Muslim world. The first foreign official to visit Pakistan after its detonation of nuclear devices was Iran's Foreign Minister, Kamal Kharrazi, who proclaimed that "Muslims now feel more confident that Pakistan's nuclear capability would play a role of deterrence to Israel's." Though he later played down this statement, the world must consider it in the context of Iran's attempt to develop nuclear weapons of its own, also with Chinese -- and Russian -- assistance. The United States and Israel must keep the rest of the world focused on this, and should not rule out pre-emptive military strikes if there is evidence that Iran is building a weapon.
Third, Russia. Its assistance to Iran and even to China seems based on its own economic need in the absence of a national strategy, as opposed to China's conscious designs. With respect to these two nations American foreign policy has reached a true historic paradox. Having brought the Soviet Union to its knees, we watched Russia struggle with democracy at the same time we were flooding nondemocratic China with an excess balance of trade. As a result China now is rich enough to short-cut its rise as a superpower by buying Russian hardware and technical assistance off the shelf.
A principal goal of American foreign policy should be to offer Russia incentives to cease providing China and other nations with such capabilities. Russia itself should need little coaxing. The Soviet Union developed a strategic alliance with India in the early 1970's partly as a counterpoint to then-evolving Chinese power. Russia has a history of immigration and boundary disputes emanating from 2,600 miles of shared border with China, and remains at risk in its sparsely populated and mineral-rich eastern territories.
Fourth, India. Its importance to our strategic interests deserves fresh scrutiny. Although American businesses have become India's main trading partners, it has long been ignored by United States policy makers. India, a democracy with a legal system based on English common law, has the demographic makeup and geographical position to become an important ally, as well as a trading partner on a much larger scale. Its population of nearly one billion represents a potential consumer base almost as large as China's.
Our past tensions with India can be understood in part by choices made during the cold war, when both India and Indonesia sought warmer relations with the former Soviet Union based on their mutual fear of China's move toward regional dominance. Although India signed a security treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971, it did so when the Nixon Administration was vigorously pursuing fresh relations with China. Nor should stronger relationships with India be interpreted by Pakistan as a rejection of our interests in that country, any more than Pakistan's closeness to China has been viewed here as a rejection of the United States.
In addition to invigorating these relationships and holding on to its traditional base of European allies, the United States also must clean its own house in terms of technology transfers and acquiescence in the face of irresponsible Chinese conduct.
Beyond doubt, China will object to such a refocusing of policy with accusations of an attempt to "contain" legitimate Chinese interests. But every expansionist power in this century has made similar claims against those who have tried to quell their aggression. And it is China, through its internal repression, encouragement of nuclear proliferation, and even the possible manipulation of our political process that has made such efforts necessary.

HEADLINE: A Bilingual Way to Attract Viewers

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
With a rising number of the nation's Hispanic television viewers now bilingual, a handful of programs are being broadcast that use varying degrees of both English and Spanish.
The emergence of such programming on Spanish-language networks and in high-profile local programming reflects efforts by television executives to reach a younger, more culturally attuned niche of the nation's eight million Hispanic households. Though the networks have been slow to attract this population, other media like magazine publishing, radio and music are flourishing with crossover content that reflects the Latin experience. 
 "It's overdue," said Bruce Silverman, executive vice president of Western Media International in Los Angeles, a buyer of media time.
The newest program is from Telemundo Group Inc., which with a 17 percent share of the Spanish market is a distant second to Univision Communications Inc., with 83 percent. Telemundo affiliates in 60 markets recently began broadcasting a daily variety show whose host is the Cuban-born actress Maria Conchita Alonso, who often strays into Spanglish, a hybrid of English and Spanish. In the program's first month, Telemundo has seen national ratings for its time slot increase about 10 percent, according to A. C. Nielsen.
The show was in the works even before the announcement in November of Telemundo's planned sale to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Tele-Communications Inc. But it reflects Sony's intent to update the look and content of the network's programs, said Alan Sokol, a Sony senior vice president. "We think advertisers have a tremendous hunger for programming other than novellas," he said, referring to the lurid, low-budget, foreign-made soap operas on both Spanish networks.
Tomorrow, ad agency representatives in New York will get a look at Telemundo's first Sony-backed season lineup. Sony's acquisition of Telemundo is expected to receive regulatory approval next month.
Sony is already a steady program supplier to network television with shows like "Dawson's Creek" and "Vibe." The company has financed a dozen Telemundo pilots and intends to put into weekly production enough programming to revamp at least one full night in prime time. The shows will include one-hour dramas and be only in Spanish. "We hope and believe the bilingual audience will come back," Mr. Sokol said, "but we don't want to risk alienating the Spanish-dominant audience."
Last week, Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc. began Citi Vision, a local programming effort at the Miami station WAMI. Its lineup includes "Generation n," a bilingual magazine show based on a locally popular English-language magazine.
Last fall, Univision's cable network, Galavision, began broadcasting a group of programs on Sunday night that are nearly all in English seasoned with Spanish phrases. The programs include "Funny Is Funny," a comedy, and back-to-back reruns of "Que Pasa, USA?," a 20-year-old Miami-based sitcom from the Public Broadcasting System.
The results are telling. In the first six weeks, about 55,000 viewers tuned in who do not normally watch the Spanish-language cable network, which is available to 1.7 million Hispanic homes, said Anne H. Corley, a spokeswoman for Univision.
Economics and politics are forcing Hispanics to embrace English more quickly, said Alex Nogales, chairman of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, an advocacy group. The decision this month by California voters to ban bilingual education in schools underscores that, he said.
"The media is 10 steps behind what the world is made out of," said Mr. Nogales, a former television producer who was consulted by Sony on its Telemundo pilots. Because they rely on foreign shows, Spanish networks are losing young viewers to mainstream networks, he said, while insularity at national networks produces fare like Fox's "Culture Clash" and ABC's "Common Law," programs aimed at Hispanic viewers that did not survive a season.
Jeff Valdez, producer of "Funny Is Funny," added: "We have more Latinos than Canada has citizens. How can you ignore this market?"

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Trying To Assure Optimism

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
It has been a tough year for Republican tax cutters. President Clinton effectively put the budget surplus off-limits by claiming it for Social Security. Efforts to pay for a tax cut by slashing spending have run into a wall of political opposition. Other potential sources, like money that would be generated by the proposed anti-smoking bill, are not yet certain enough to be counted on.
So it was no surprise when Speaker Newt Gingrich and his top lieutenants lashed out in frustration last week at the Congressional Budget Office, whose estimates of the nation's fiscal condition over the past few years have proved consistently too pessimistic. Angry that the budget office's projections have regularly underestimated the room Congress has to cut taxes even after dealing with Social Security's looming insolvency, Mr. Gingrich and his team vented in the form of a letter to the House Appropriations Committee. 
 But rather than just listing their criticisms, Mr. Gingrich and the leadership team suggested that they would seek to cut the budget office's financing if its tax and spending estimates were not revised to show bigger surpluses in coming years.
"The C.B.O. must address this problem," Mr. Gingrich wrote. "If it does not, I believe we must review the structure and funding for the C.B.O. in this appropriations cycle."
The pressure campaign brought a storm of criticism from Democrats.
"Three years ago," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, "the Republican Congress shut down the Government, insisting that the President use C.B.O. estimates. Now the House Republican leaders want to shut down C.B.O. because they do not like C.B.O. estimates."
The Democratic leader in the House, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, called the letter "just another blatant attempt by the Republican leadership to artificially pump up the surplus to serve as a political piggy bank for their grab bag of special-interest tax cuts."
Mindful of the morass they risked being pushed into, the Republican leaders on the Appropriations Committee sidestepped Mr. Gingrich's demands. Representative James T. Walsh of New York, the chairman of the subcommittee that finances the budget office, agreed to put in this year's spending bill a demand that the office report on why its forecasts have proved wrong. But he took no steps to review or cut the office's $25.7 million budget for next year.
Mr. Gingrich's criticism was brushed aside by June E. O'Neill, the director of the budget office, who said that coming up with a totally accurate surplus or deficit forecast for a $1.7 trillion budget was no easy task in an ever-changing economy.
"C.B.O. is used to being a scapegoat and a punching bag," she said in an interview. "We're the accountants, and while your personal accountant might be directed to provide an answer that's beneficial to you, we can't do that."
Bashing the office is a time-honored tradition, indulged in by Democrats and Republicans alike. (Ms. O'Neill noted that a Democratic Congress had been miffed at one of her predecessors, Alice M. Rivlin, now vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, and denied the office use of a car to take officials around town -- a prohibition that remains.)
Mr. Gingrich has consistently pressed the budget office to adopt a new way of estimating tax receipts, one that assumes that tax cuts will unleash higher rates of economic growth and therefore generate more revenue for the Government.
But in this case his pique seems mostly a manifestation of frustration over how difficult it has been to accomplish something that Republicans had assumed would be so easy: returning to taxpayers at least some of the projected budget surpluses, which, after all, are nothing but excess tax payments.
And if there was a lesson for both sides, it was that budget politics in the age of surplus are proving just as rough-and-tumble as they were in the dark days when fiscal profligacy seemed destined to reduce the United States to an economic has-been. Then the budget office usually took a dimmer view of the economy than did Presidents of either party, and deficit hawks praised its restraint, accusing Administrations of falling to the siren song of someone called Rosy Scenario.

HEADLINE: Albanian Separatists Kill 2 Serbian Officers

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, June 14

 BODY:
Ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo killed two members of Serbian security forces and wounded seven in ambushes today. The attacks heightened tension on the eve of NATO air exercises that are intended to press Serbia to back off from its crackdown in the province.
Serbian officials said the dead were both police officers. Five of the wounded were soldiers in a Yugoslav Army food convoy attacked by the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, they said. 
 The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center accused Serbian forces of attacking ethnic Albanian villages in the western part of the Serbian province over the weekend. It reported at least four Albanian dead in attacks on Saturday.
The Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, is expected to visit Moscow on Monday. President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia has said he would try to mediate to reduce the violence. NATO, trying to force a cease-fire, has planned a show of air power for Monday over Macedonia and Albania, which both border Kosovo.
Serbia and the smaller Montenegro are the only republics that remain in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million population and once had a degree of autonomy. But since a crackdown by Serbia, the population increasingly supports the guerrillas' demands for independence.
The Serbian Deputy Prime Minister, Tomislav Nikolic, said any NATO plan to attack Serbia would be insane. He said Mr. Milosevic's talks with Mr. Yeltsin would "contribute to the final settlement of the Kosovo problem."
The air maneuvers were ordered by NATO and the Western Contact Group that is coordinating international mediation efforts as a warning to both sides, but especially to Mr. Milosevic, of NATO's ability to intervene militarily.
The conflict has entered a critical phase, with the United States and its European allies in the Contact Group piling pressure on Mr. Milosevic to stop fighting that the West fears could engulf the southern Balkans.
The West has threatened air strikes against Yugoslavia but there were growing doubts whether attempts to gain United Nations approval for such attacks would survive Russia's veto in the Security Council.
Russia, also a Contact Group member and often a Serb ally, has criticized Mr. Milosevic's handling of the crisis but has refused to endorse economic sanctions that the West has imposed against Yugoslavia or the use of force.
Mr. Milosevic has not reacted publicly to demands that he withdraw the police from Kosovo, allow thousand of refugees to return to their homes and start serious negotiations with Kosovo Albanian leaders on autonomy for the province.
But Serbian Government ministers have warned that Yugoslavia will defend itself against any NATO military intervention in the air or on the ground. Dozens of Yugoslav Army vehicles, including anti-aircraft missile carriers, were seen moving in the border regions over the weekend.
Mr. Nikolic said that there had been "insane calls to attack Serbia" but that he did not expect military intervention because "such a demand cannot hope to win majority backing in the U.N. Security Council -- no one who has any sanity can support it."
He belongs to the extreme-national Serbian Radical Party, a partner of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party in the Serbian government. The hard-line party expects to join the federal Yugoslav Government in a coming reshuffle.
"The Contact Group's demand that all action by our security forces should be suspended while Albanian terrorists are attacking us is effectively a demand that we turn that part of Serbia over to the separatists," Mr. Nikolic said. "This we will not and cannot do as the people of Serbia have granted us no such mandate."
Kosovo Albanian politicians have denied any formal links with the guerrilla army but some have hinted at being able to influence it.
Fehmi Agani, an adviser to a major Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, said on Saturday that a cease-fire could be won from the rebels if Serbian security forces returned to their barracks.
He said the Albanians would not object to the Yugoslav Army remaining to protect the borders with Macedonia and Albania although this would risk clashes with the guerrillas if they continued to run men and arms into Kosovo from safe havens in northern Albania.

HEADLINE: Japan Sinks Into Recession

 BODY:
Japan is now officially in recession, and its Government continues to dawdle about responding. The risk is that Japan's problems may cause further damage to its already weak Asian neighbors.
The first priority for Japanese officials must be to save the country's sick banking system, which is still burdened by bad loans left over from the bubble economy of the late 1980's. In February the Government announced a large and badly needed bank bailout plan, but almost nothing has been done to institute it. The Government needs to close weak institutions while enabling the stronger ones to put their bad loans behind them. The scandal at the Ministry of Finance, which some had hoped would make reform easier, instead seems to have produced paralysis. 
 The banks, having belatedly awakened to how bad their situation is, have created a huge credit crunch by cutting back on loans to avert further losses. Worried Japanese consumers are reluctant to spend, making things worse. Money is flowing out of the country as savers seek safe haven in foreign banks and foreign bonds. So despite a big trade surplus the yen is tumbling, having fallen 21 percent against the dollar in the past 12 months.
Japan's current economic woes reflect the limits of national monetary policy in moving an economy, particularly in this age of global financial flows. Japan's central bank has pushed interest rates about as low as they can possibly go. Short-term rates are under 1 percent, and the yield on 10-year Japanese Government bonds has fallen to 1.3 percent. It is hard to imagine how credit could be cheaper.
But the banks are afraid to make loans, and much of the borrowing has been by foreigners, who have used the cheap funds to speculate in foreign securities markets. Japan's low rates have stimulated rising stock and bond prices in the United States but have done nothing for its own economy.
The Japanese Government has put together a fiscal stimulus package, which should help. But more needs to be done to allow Japan to play the needed role of locomotive for the rest of Asia. Right now, Japan is acting as just one more brake on an already stalled regional economy.

Crisis Center: Good Sense Or Good Joke?

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
A HURRICANE sweeps up the Eastern Seaboard toward New York City, packing 100-mile-an-hour winds.
A bomb blast destroys a power plant, plunging Brooklyn and Queens into darkness. 
 A terrorist group vows to release nerve gas in a crowded subway station, pushing the city toward hysteria.
Such crises could happen, and a metropolitan center like New York is particularly vulnerable, which helps account for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plans for an emergency control center. As the Mayor explains it, the city needs the control center so that its leaders can respond to disasters with all the speed and effectiveness that cutting-edge technology can provide.
So why is everyone laughing?
No sooner were the Mayor's plans for the $15 million command bunker revealed over the weekend, than the visionary scheme became a target for practically every would-be humorist in the city.
Curtis Sliwa and Ron Kuby devoted four hours of their radio program to lampooning the project on Saturday morning. During the show, listeners participated in a name-that-shelter contest, which produced such winning entries as "Rudy's Nuclear Winter Palace" and "The Nut Shell."
The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, joined in the not-quite-harmless fun, noting that "the Mayor's actions are increasingly bizarre." He added, "If he wants to build a bunker for the only people he trusts, all he needs is a phone booth."
A clearly delighted former Mayor Edward I. Koch declared, "It's the joke of the week."
In a highly symbolic business like politics, it is sometimes the truly consequential blunders that matter, and sometimes just the ones that make good sense metaphorically. Had George Bush ever laid eyes on a supermarket scanner before that fateful day in 1992? Probably he had.
Did Dan Quayle know the correct spelling of "potatoe"? Quite possibly.
Does New York City need a state-of-the-art emergency control center, with enough water to last a week, a secure line to the President and a ventilation system that can be closed in case of a biological attack?
Who cares?
In the course of his eminently successful career, Mayor Giuliani has already done more than his fair share of unsettling things. Whether dressing up in sequins or harassing hot dog vendors, his actions have often been characterized by an element of excess, a "l'etat, c'est moi" quality that has left even his critics slightly agape.
But rarely has he seemed, symbolically speaking, on such dangerous ground.
It is not that the center is, on the face of it, an outrageous project, or even that its most grandiose elements are out-and-out absurd. Who knows, maybe it would be useful to be able to hold a video conference with the President during a bomb scare, a flood or a really ugly sewer-main break.
THE trouble is that the project seems to speak too clearly to the Mayor's fears and, worse still, his hopes.
Mr. Giuliani has always governed as if from a bunker, with chaos threatening from all sides and enemies all around. On some deep level -- well, maybe not so very deep -- one senses that nothing would please him more than having an antagonist truly worthy of his energies instead of just a ragtag bunch of disgruntled taxi drivers, street artists and unemployed strippers.
As soon as the news of the multimillion-dollar command center got out, aides to the Mayor did their best to quash the story. The Mayor was not building a Strangelovian bunker, they said, noting that it was going to be equipped with only a fold-out couch. They also disputed charges that the bunker was being built in secret, pointing to a one-line entry on page 995 of the city's capital budget.
"It's clearly laid out in the budget for anyone to inspect and review," said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the Mayor.
Aides even objected to the term "bunker," with its paranoid cold war connotations; it is "not a bunker," insisted Jerome M. Hauer, director of the city's Office of Emergency Management.
Mr. Giuliani, at a news conference on Saturday, defended the bunker with characteristic vigor, accusing critics of playing politics with the safety of millions of New Yorkers. And he made a special point of correcting the notion that in planning for disaster, he was thinking about himself.
"It's not for the benefit of the Mayor," he said. "It's for the benefit of New York."
So will everyone please stop laughing?

HEADLINE: Congress May Lift Ban on Wheat Sales to India and Pakistan

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Under pressure from farmers, the Government is poised to re-allow the sale of wheat to India and Pakistan despite economic sanctions by the United States against those countries for their recent nuclear tests.
Allowing wheat sales would seem to undermine Washington's moral outrage against India and Pakistan, but a movement to skirt the sanctions on wheat has caught on in Congress, and President Clinton encouraged the movement on Friday as he sought greater flexibility in exercising sanctions around the world. 
 "Farmers in the United States provide a significant percentage of Pakistan's wheat imports," Mr. Clinton said in a statement on Friday. "Cutting off that supply would only hurt the citizens of Pakistan and American farmers, without furthering our goals of nonproliferation of atomic weapons."
Although many in Congress have denounced the nuclear explosions, they are also sensitive to their important farm constituents as the November elections approach. Congressional action was introduced in each house last week by lawmakers from wheat-rich Washington State -- Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, and Representative George R. Nethercutt Jr., a Republican, both of whom are up for re-election. The state sends 37 percent of its wheat to Pakistan, which pays Washington farmers about $500 million a year.
Ms. Murray and Mr. Nethercutt introduced bills to pass a waiver that would allow wheat -- actually, wheat credits guaranteed by the Government and extended to farmers -- to bypass the sanctions, which are automatically imposed on a country if it tests a nuclear device.
The Arms Export Control Act of 1994 cuts off trade credits, private bank loans, loans from international institutions and loan guarantees to American companies doing business in the country in question.
But increasingly, politicians and foreign-policy analysts are questioning the value of unilateral sanctions because they can conflict with other national interests.
The sanctions imposed last month on India and Pakistan, for example, came at a time when 11 percent of the world wheat market was already off-limits to American farmers because of sanctions. Wheat prices have plunged to a seven-year low because of excess supply, in part because of improved per-acre yield techniques but also because of reduced exports. This tension has injected a new urgency into the questions of what purpose sanctions serve and whom they hurt.
"There are a lot of interests in any one country, not just the one issue on which sanctions are based," said Sidney Weintraub, a political economist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. "The Administration is trying to take in the full range of interests, and not giving up markets is one of the interests."
The halt in American wheat credits has prompted Pakistan to buy wheat from Australia, said Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington. Every day that the sanctions are in place, he said on Thursday at a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee, "we'll lose sales, and they are sales we can't recover."
Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, decreed without a vote that the committee would seek a waiver from the Senate, provided it did not cost anything.
The House Appropriations Committee had a more heated debate. That committee voted 7-5 on Wednesday to seek the waiver over the objections of its senior members, including Representatives Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, and David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat.
Many said that the United States should stand firm on its principle of exacting a price for what it considers a moral outrage, regardless of the cost. Others, including many in the Administration, support a more pragmatic approach. This view holds that the United States can influence a country more through engagement than by isolation.
But complicating this picture are two other factors. Although the law mandating sanctions was passed in 1994, the regulations to implement them were never written. The Justice Department made an internal ruling this week, in response to a request from the National Security Council, that the wheat credits are covered by the sanctions and would take an act of Congress to override. Thus, the President cannot simply declare the wheat credits allowable.
In addition, between the House committee vote on Wednesday and the Senate committee vote on Thursday, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that lifting the sanctions for agricultural products would cost $30 million to $50 million in Government subsidies for credits to the farmers. Many senators, though, questioned whether the move would cost anything.

HEADLINE: Federal Grants To Colleges Are Resurging

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
This year the University of West Alabama will receive a grant of $300,000 from the Department of Agriculture for research on the disposal of poultry carcasses. The University of Maine will receive $220,000, also from the Department of Agriculture, for research on low-bush blueberries.
These grants are among more than 200 Federal outlays set aside by Congress for specific colleges and universities without benefit of competitive or merit review. Although the grants may or may not meet genuine public needs, they are widely derided as pork-barrel boondoggles. 
 All told, Congress authorized $495 million for academic earmarking for fiscal 1998, according to the 10th annual study of the practice by The Chronicle of Higher Education, an independent national newspaper. President Clinton, making limited use of the line-item veto, reduced the appropriation to $483 million. The June 19 issue of The Chronicle, which reports on the study, will be on newsstands beginning today.
After appropriations dipped to $296 million in 1996 as Republican legislators slashed earmarks as prime examples of wasteful spending, the practice is on the rise again, according to The Chronicle.
The peak, according to The Chronicle, came in 1993, when the value of earmarks was placed at $763 million. Over the last decade, nearly $5 billion has been spent on such projects.
University leaders whose institutions benefit from earmarking were muted in their criticism. Cornelius J. Pings, president of the Association of American Universities, which has traditionally opposed earmarking, said the increase was "a bit troubling, but not alarming."
"All colleges and universities together receive somewhere between $15 billion and $16 billion from the Federal Government," Mr. Pings said. "Earmarking accounts for only 3 percent of that total." The other 97 percent, he explained, is for competitively reviewed projects.
James D. Savage, an associateprofessor of government at the University of Virginia and the author of a book called "Funding Science in America: Congress, Universities and the Politics of the Academic Pork Barrel," to be published next year by the Cambridge University Press, said that the reason for the increase in earmarking was that Congress has more money available because of the booming economy.
"The more they have, the more they get to earmark," he said.
Professor Savage said the solution to the problem lay in electing lawmakers who will fight the practice.
But academicians must also be held responsible, Professor Savage said. "Peer review is the norm in academic life," he said. "We have it in tenure, promotion, allocation of resources and publication. There is no such norm in politics, where the object is to get elected and then help your friends. The leaders of higher education must educate the politicians."

HEADLINE: This Time, Los Angeles May Lose Water War

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: KEELER, Calif., June 12

 BODY:
"It's not that you can't breathe," said Mark McCall, with gallows humor befitting a prematurely grizzled 49-year-old resident of this dusty village in the Owens Valley. "You just don't want to."
Mr. McCall's backyard abuts the dry bed of Owens Lake, a crusty lunar landscape of brackish pools and flaky salts and toxins that is the worst source of airborne pollution in the United States. The parched patch of 110 square miles is all that is left in the center of a once-fertile farming and mining community. Even the talc mill where Mr. McCall once worked is closed, and he is unemployed. 
 There is no mystery about where the water went: For 85 years, gravity has pulled it through a 223-mile man-made aqueduct to build and sustain the artificially verdant sprawl of Los Angeles, and today it still supplies just over half the water for the nation's second-largest city.
But for the first time in the longest-running water war in the West, Los Angeles, under intense pressure from state and Federal regulators, may be forced to put some of the water back to help control dust storms that can carry 20 times the particle pollution allowed by Federal law. That would be a precedent-shattering concession of complicity in one of the most celebrated water grabs of all time.
"We think that this is sort of David and Goliath meets 'Chinatown,' " said Ellen Hardebeck, air pollution control officer of the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District, the state-chartered agency here that last year ordered Los Angeles to cover about one-third of the lake bed, partly with water, partly with four inches of gravel, and partly with vegetation, in an effort to hold down the dust. In fact, the struggle is the stuff of legend, and Ms. Hardebeck was referring to the classic 1974 movie. "Chinatown" was inspired by the stealthy -- though legal -- efforts of Los Angeles city fathers to buy up land and water rights here early in the century so the city could expand into land that they were buying outside Los Angeles.
When William Mulholland, the visionary Los Angeles water czar who saw the potential of the Owens River's mountain runoff, officially opened the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, he watched the water gush down into the San Fernando Valley, then on the far northern outskirts of his fledgling city, and proclaimed in what remain fighting words here to this day: "There it is. Take it."
By the mid-1920's, Los Angeles was taking so much water that the lake dried up, and the city has resisted giving the water back. In December, it offered a counterproposal to do less than half of what the Owens Valley wants, and when officials here rejected that, the city appealed to the state Air Resources Board, which has the final say because the state owns the lake bed.
The board took no action at its meeting last month and gave negotiators for the valley and city until the next board meeting, on June 25, to try to reach a compromise. If a state-approved plan is not in place by fall 1999, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency has vowed to impose its own plan for bringing pollution within acceptable levels.
"Clearly, we have a responsibility to deal with the problem," said Gerald Gewe, executive assistant to the director of water services for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. "But it's not a problem that was created overnight or that's going to be solved overnight."
Officials from both sides spent the end of this week in secret negotiations, and the outcome is hard to predict. But their last public positions were far apart, and the staff of the State Air Resources Board has recommended a ruling in favor of Los Angeles.
"The staff did not feel that Great Basin's modeling work in tests for the plan was really sufficient," said Allan Hirsch, a board spokesman. The staff members questioned whether there was enough proof that the plan would reduce pollution.
The basic problem is not in dispute. On most days, the air here is splendidly clear, with breathtaking views across the valley to Mount Whitney, at 14,496 feet the highest point in the contiguous 48 states, and in summer, the lake bed is as hard and dry as concrete. But on some two dozen days a year, mostly in spring and fall, residual moisture makes the lake's crust churn into crystals that become a whirlwind -- of fine clay particles, salts, arsenic and other substances deposited over geologic time -- covering cars, seeping through windows and threatening the lungs of perhaps 40,000 area residents. The rough grass that fills Mr. McCall's yard is so sharp, he said, "it's like razor wire."
The trouble has come in agreeing on a solution. A 1983 law requires Los Angeles to take "reasonable" measures, but city and valley officials have distinctly different views of what that means. In its order, Great Basin proposed treating the worst 35 square miles of the lake with the mix of gravel, vegetation and water, which it estimated would take 50,000 acre-feet of water a year, or about 15 percent of what the city takes from the valley each year. An acre-foot is the amount needed to cover an acre of land a foot deep, or about 325,000 gallons.
After six months of negotiations, Los Angeles countered last December with an offer to work on 9 square miles, requiring about 20,000 acre-feet of water, with a promise to assess its progress and make adjustments after three years. The city says the valley's proposal would cost it $58 million a year to replace Owens Valley water from other sources, probably the Sacramento Delta in the north, and to finance operations at the lake, along with $25 million annual debt service on the capital improvements that would be needed to put the plan in place.
Mr. Gewe of the Los Angeles water agency said that would mean a total cost of $75 million to $80 million a year out of the agency's overall revenues of about $400 million, and he warned that such increases would have to be passed on to customers in Los Angeles. "That's a pretty significant hit," Mr. Gewe said. "But my concern is that it has not been demonstrated that these measures will work, and then we've got to spend even more money trying to find a solution."
Great Basin officials here contend that they are proposing simple measures, ones that mimic natural geologic processes. They say they have tested and rejected everything from spraying chemicals (environmentally unsound) to rigging sprinklers (the dust clogs them) to building low walls of sand as windbreaks (wind patterns are hard to predict).
"We've tested a lot of things out there, and some of them were pretty pie in the sky," said Theodore Schade, the engineer who is the Owens Lake project manager for Great Basin. "The lake has been dry since the mid-20's, and in that time, there are some limited areas that are starting to repair themselves, and generally by the mechanisms we're proposing, through some natural revegetation over time, for example."
Mr. Schade acknowledged that the sheer scale of the problem made it daunting. "It's the size and the money," he said. "If this was somebody's vacant lot, they would just go out and fix it."
Mr. Gewe, the Los Angeles official, suggests one possible area of compromise by noting that substantial nondrinkable groundwater may be percolating below the lake and could be pumped up to help carry out some of the valley's proposed solutions.
"We want to go forward in a phased approach that doesn't write a blank check," he said.
But Ms. Hardebeck of Great Basin is impatient with such talk.
"The district and the city have been jointly studying this problem since 1979, so when they say, 'We don't know enough,' or 'We need to study some more,' how long is long enough?"
Residents here remain skeptical that big changes will come. After all, even their ancestors' early efforts to dynamite the aqueduct could not keep the water from flowing away to serve a city of millions.
"That lake has been dry for almost 100 years," said Geizel Rice, the postmaster in Keeler, where the roadside sign says the population is 50 but she says it is actually a bit more. "Do you think they're going to really put it back? I don't think they ever will. I think it's too late."

HEADLINE: School Ruling Shakes Milwaukee

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, June 11

 BODY:
It was the last week of school, and students and teachers were absorbed in final exams and celebratory field trips. The biggest local story was the invasion of 100,000 motorcycle riders for the 95th anniversary of Milwaukee's own Harley-Davidson Inc.
Not exactly the perfect time for an education bombshell. 
 So when the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that taxpayer money could be used to send Milwaukee students to religious schools, the most significant school voucher ruling in the nation to date, the decision sent currents of excitement through some parts of the community, and alarm through others.
Proponents said it would completely transform education in Milwaukee, letting parents choose where to send their children and revitalizing parochial schools. One champion, Brother Bob Smith, the principal of Messmer High School, a Roman Catholic school, said, "This is, in my mind, the equivalent of winning the Super Bowl."
Opponents decried what they saw as the breakdown of democratic principles, the crippling of the public schools, the ascendancy of religious agendas in education, and what they feared might be an exodus of good students from the public schools or a streaming of whites and blacks to what would become essentially segregated schools.
"Will a Timothy McVeigh start the next church in Milwaukee and see this as a profit-making venture and solicit enrollment and succeed?" said John Benson, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Wisconsin's highest education official, who called for a moment of silence after the decision to memorialize the loss of religious liberty.
Much still needs to be determined about how the court's decision will be implemented, but it may be that in practice the changes will be more incremental than either the heraldic trumpets or the apocalyptic pronouncements suggest.
"At first blush we certainly were very concerned about it," said Alan S. Brown, the Superintendent of the Milwaukee Public Schools. "Then when you start getting into the numbers, it doesn't look as bad."
"It's going to take years," said Dan McKinley, the executive director of Partners Advancing Values in Education or PAVE, a group that has been behind the school choice movement and has been using private money to send children to private and religious schools. "A lot of the schools that we work with are struggling. Many of them don't have good science programs. . . . Many of them can't retain good teachers. They have a long way to go before they're really strong vital schools."
The Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, begun in 1990 as the nation's first voucher program, allows poor families to send their children to the school of their choice at state expense. About 1,500 students attend 23 nonsectarian private schools.
The crusade to expand Milwaukee's program to include religious schools, which make up the majority of the city's private schools, was waged by an unlikely coalition of habitual political enemies.
There was State Representative Annette Polly Williams, a black Democrat from Milwaukee's inner city, whose legislation created the program. Frustrated with a public system with a graduation rate of 45 percent and a controversial busing program, Ms. Williams said she wanted to give "low-income families some power" to choose schools.
And there was a group of conservatives, including the Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee, the Institute for Justice in Washington, and Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel investigating President Clinton, who led the legal team two years ago, when the State Supreme Court deadlocked on the case.
"They needed us to legitimize them," said Ms. Williams, adding that she is wary of conservatives' desires to promote religious schools and to include people who are not poor. "We needed them because they control the media, they control the money, they control everything."
Their opponents included teachers' organizations, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and black leaders who feared the draining or de facto segregation of the public schools. The plaintiffs have said they will appeal to the United States Supreme Court, but the expanded program is expected to start this fall.
Under the expansion, up to 15,000 students, or about 14 percent of the 104,000 students in the public school system, can attend private schools, nonsectarian or religious. At about $5,000 per pupil, that could mean that more than $70 million would be siphoned from the public schools.
This prospect makes people like Donelle Johnson, a teacher at Elm Creative Arts School, an inner-city magnet school, feel "like my legs had been cut out from underneath me. You're going to have to have layoffs and huge, huge classes."
Other teachers, like Gary Hanneman, chairman of the physical education department at South Division High School on the south side, worry that because many private schools do not have programs for special education students and do not have to take such students, the public schools will end up with more difficult pupils.
Dr. Brown and others suggested that these effects were likely to occur slowly, giving public schools time to compete for students.
About 4,400 of the 15,000 potential slots would be filled by students who are already in private schools, either through the state's secular program or through the privately financed program led by Mr. McKinley. While 110 schools will participate this fall, Mr. McKinley said Milwaukee's private schools now have space for only about 3,600 more students. He predicts that other religious schools will spring up to accommodate the 15,000.
But questions about what religious schools are required to do may temper some schools' enthusiasm for the plan. The law says students can decline to take part in religious observances.
"If the rules include abandoning religious observance, we may not be able to participate," said Tom Hage, the principal of Resurrection Catholic Academy, a school that has accepted so many public school students whose tuition was privately subsidized that they now make up about half the enrollment of 240. Mr. Hage said all students attend church once a week during school hours.
The program also does not require private and religious schools to hire certified teachers or use standardized state curriculum and tests, or to adhere to the same rules of accountability that public schools do. It is not clear whether the state will try to change those rules.
It is also unclear how dissatisfied parents are with the district.
"The reality is there aren't that many parents you interview who are really upset," said Emily Van Dunk, a research coordinator for the Public Policy Forum, a nonpartisan group, which found that most parents say they are happy with their child's school, whether public or private.
Empirical studies have been less than conclusive. One, conducted by a Princeton University economics professor, Cecilia Rouse, found that students in the school choice program performed better in math, but showed no gains in reading.
Professor Rouse also compared "choice" schools with public schools that had small classes and other enhancements and found that the public school students did as well in math and better in reading.
That suggests to some on both sides that public schools can find ways to compete.
"We will probably become more market oriented now in terms of how we display to the community our successes," Dr. Brown said.
Parents' views vary. Some, like Jennifer Evans, a religious education director at a Unitarian church, a public school parent and a plaintiff in the voucher lawsuit, said she feared some public schools would be cash-strapped and left with students "whose parents didn't have the resources, whether financially or emotionally or whatever, to get them into a different school."
Others like vouchers because they promote religious schools.
But several focused on their own pragmatic circumstances.
Vivian Watts, who works in a public school cafeteria, pulled her sons out of public school three years ago because Marquess, now 11, was suspended several times for discipline problems, and Remy, now 12, had low grades. With PAVE's help, she placed them in Resurrection Catholic Academy, where they "have more one-on-one with the teachers."
Claudia Coleman-Brown moved her sons, Kenneth, now 15, and Trent, now 14, from public school to a secular voucher school to a Roman Catholic school and back to public schools, depending on how she felt about the teachers, the principal and her children's needs.
"When something doesn't work," said Ms. Coleman-Brown, an administrative assistant for the county government, "you move on."

HEADLINE: A New Sign in the Suburbs: Sold Out;
Buyers Are Scrambling to Find Houses in a Booming Market

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
Buying a house was not how Ron Shriberg planned to spend his Sunday morning.
Rising at dawn, he was quickly where he wanted to be, at a marina in Bayville, N.Y., getting his speedboat ready for the cruises of summer. But a sudden rainstorm forced him to head back to the nearby home of his in-laws, where he and his wife were spending the weekend. On the way, he passed an open-house sign in front of a fetching four-bedroom Cape Cod-style house in Bayville. 
 "It had that warm, appealing home look, something you could move into and really feel comfortable," said Mr. Shriberg, a 29-year-old office-equipment salesman from Woodside, Queens.
In the superheated real estate market of 1998, where he had already lost a house to a cutthroat rival, Mr. Shriberg went into overdrive. He rustled his wife, Laureen, out of her pajamas and drove her over to look. Four hours after first seeing the Cape, they made an offer of $260,000 that was accepted just moments ahead of two rival bids.
"We realized that if we saw something we truly loved, we needed to act fairly quickly," Mr. Shriberg said, not quite appreciating his own understatement.
Just as in New York City, where co-ops and condominiums are being snapped up soon after they go on sale, houses in New York City's suburbs are moving faster than ice cream in July. Once an aberration, the house that goes on the market and is spoken for the same day is becoming routine. As a result, houses are selling for more -- sometimes substantially more -- than their asking price, and bidding wars that would warm the heart of a Sotheby's auctioneer are becoming an everyday occurrence.
"It's not a market in which you want to dillydally," said P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. "If you like the house and the price is right, you should act, because if you don't act, it may be some time before you find another property."
Many reasons are being given for the frenzied suburban market, in which house sales in areas like Westchester and Fairfield County, Conn., are up more than 20 percent from a year ago and prices are up as much as 15 percent. The economy is humming, the stock market is bullish, and interest rates for some types of mortgages are below 7 percent. As a result, far more people have the wherewithal to buy. Mr. Shriberg's fourfold jump in income over two years allowed him and his wife to consider moving out of their Queens apartment.
With the co-op and condo market in New York City also sizzling, it is easy to cash in an apartment and buy that longed-for Tudor on a cul-de-sac where the kids can learn to ride a bicycle and kick around a soccer ball. At the same time, more suburban homeowners have the money to trade up to that bigger house with the guest room, the third bathroom and the large kitchen they have always craved.
Not surprisingly, the madness is fueled by a tight supply of houses. The seven slow years of the late 1980's and early 1990's left many houses languishing on the market. But about two years ago, they began to move, and now the inventory, as they are referred to in the real estate trade, is depleted.
In the first quarter of 1998, only 3,945 single-family houses in all of Westchester were on the market, a 24 percent decline from the 5,171 listed in the first quarter of 1997. As a result, the average price of a house in Westchester -- $403,020 -- is 7 percent higher than it was a year ago. In Nassau County, the number of homes for sale has dropped to 5,979 this April, from 8,132 in April 1997, and the average price is up 13 percent. In Fairfield County, where inventory figures were not available, the average price of a single-family house is $320,475, a 14.9 percent increase from a year ago.
In such a market, it helps to pounce.
Darlene Bandazian, manager of the Weichert Realtors office in Ramsey, N.J., recalled how one of her agents received a listing on a recent Saturday for a $290,000 house in Mahwah. He scheduled an open house for the next day and, having no time to place a newspaper advertisement, posted a dozen fliers on lampposts and street signs. Fifty couples showed up, three of whom made offers. The house was sold at its asking price.
In such a market, it even helps to bribe -- legally, of course.
Karla Renz-Mcleod and Steven McLeod of Forest Hills, Queens, fell in love with a three-bedroom house in Stamford, Conn., with a flagstone patio and a lush garden. But they mistakenly decided to compare a few other houses before making an offer. By the time they returned that afternoon, another couple -- in a Mercedes -- was inspecting the house.
"I could see the wife was making these motions like, 'This is where the second floor can be expanded,' " Ms. Renz-McLeod said.
The McLeods put in a bid of $285,000 but couldn't match the one by their rivals.
"They're using cash for the deal, all inspections waived," Ms. Renz-McLeod said. "How can you compete with that?"
Similarly, Vera Blendermann, a broker for Houlihan Lawrence in Bronxville, told of a large Colonial on one acre that went on sale on a Thursday for $1.5 million. A half-dozen written bids came in, and when they were opened on Sunday, the highest was from someone who had not only offered more than $100,000 beyond the asking price but was also willing to put up enough assets to forgo a mortgage approval and an engineer's inspection, and to close on the house whenever it suited the seller.
"What better terms can you give than removing your mortgage contingency, removing your engineering inspection and closing at the convenience of the seller?" Ms. Blendermann said.
Of course, some buyers say they feel betrayed by sellers unable to resist better offers. In March, Mr. Shriberg shook hands with the broker on a $230,000 deal for a waterfront ranch house in Oceanside, in Nassau County. Mr. Shriberg signed a contract and sent in an $11,500 deposit, but the seller never put his signature on the contract or cashed the check. Instead, the owner sold the house privately -- no broker was involved -- to a remote acquaintance who came up with $250,000 in cash. Though they got their deposit back, the Shribergs were left in the lurch.
"These days, people have a lot more money," Mr. Shriberg said. "The seller's friend realized, 'I better step up to the plate or I'll lose the house.' "
 Though not every broker agrees, Mary Grimm, a veteran broker for C. S. McClellan in Pelham, in Westchester, said the current market is giddier than even the bustling market of the mid-1980's. And it seems to touch most locations and price ranges. Denise Smith, a spokeswoman for Weichert Realtors, said that sales are at their most feverish in the "classic suburban bedroom communities as opposed to the more urban and rural areas." In western Bergen County, N.J., for example, the hottest locations are Wyckoff, Ramsey, Mahwah, Allendale and Franklin Lakes. In Westchester, suburbs like Scarsdale, Larchmont and Pelham are hopping.
The mania has changed the way brokers, buyers and sellers behave. Rather than merely worry about how to best articulate the features of a house, brokers have to concentrate on convincing the suspicious buyer that the race is to the swift.
"They have to be on top of the market," said Jackson B. Browning, president of Julia Fee Realty, which has offices throughout Westchester. "It's not a part-time job. They have to be active, have to know what's coming on the market the minute it's in the computer."
Patricia Lampl, a broker at Wykagyl/Rittenberg Realty in New Rochelle, said she tried to avoid putting overt pressure on a client she took to houses in Scarsdale and New Rochelle. But experience provided a telling lesson.
In Scarsdale, the Tudor was swarming with brokers -- upstairs, downstairs, in the attic, in the yard. They peered, poked, sniffed, opened and closed closets and then were briskly off to examine other prospects. Ms. Lampl coolly escorted her pregnant client, Gail Herman, through the frenzy, pointing out the three-bedroom house's low taxes, good school district and proximity to the Scarsdale train station.
But the Scarsdale house vanished the same day, before Mrs. Herman had even considered making an offer. Mrs. Herman, a 30-year-old school psychologist who has been living with her stockbroker husband, Michael, in a one-bedroom apartment in White Plains, was not disappointed. Just that morning, she had seen a 1940's white Colonial cottage with red shutters in a congenial neighborhood in New Rochelle, a house with offbeat moldings, dormered ceilings and lots of nooks and crannies.
"Charming. Gail likes charming," Ms. Lampl had already noted.
So Mrs. Herman took her husband, weary from a day of work, to see the house that same evening. The next day, she showed it to her mother. On the third day, she made an offer. It was too late, of course. In the frantic market of 1998, three days might as well have been three years. Someone else had beaten her to the punch.
Mrs. Herman was stoic. "There will always be another house," she said. But Ms. Lampl said she would not be surprised if Mrs. Herman took a different tack the next time.
"It puts me in an awkward position," she said of the hot market. "I don't want to pressure people and don't want them to feel they have to hurry up, but when things like this happen, then the second time around they act a lot more quickly."

HEADLINE: Flint Journal;
City G.M. Built Looks Ahead Warily

BYLINE: By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., June 12

 BODY:
It is easy to overlook the two major highways crisscrossing this city as just a pair of well-worn roads.
But these roads are emblems of a rich slice of American history. One is named the Chevrolet-Buick, in honor of the General Motors Corporation, which began its automobile empire here, putting food on the tables and cars in the driveways of generation after generation. The other highway is called the U.A.W., a tribute to the labor giant, the United Auto Workers, that rose here in a legendary 1936 sit-down strike on the factory floor of a now shuttered General Motors assembly plant. Together, the roads are ordinary yet glaring symbols of just how tightly this city is gripped by its two most famous offspring. 
 "G.M. owns Flint," said Brad Kirfan, who co-owns a chain of convenience stores, "and the U.A.W. is the town sheriff."
The history that binds Flint, General Motors and the labor union is as long and layered as the miles of factory smokestacks that dot this city's desolate landscape. Depending on who is talking here, that tortured relationship is either wholly or at least partly at fault for the bitter tone of simultaneous strikes by 9,000 auto parts workers at two G.M. plants. Negotiations between the company and U.A.W. locals at the two plants recessed Sunday without an agreement, and were expected to continue on Monday.
The disputes have led to the layoffs of more than 50,000 auto workers throughout North America. And they have focused the eyes of the nation on Flint in a way that has not been done since the 1989 documentary "Roger and Me," the film by Michael Moore that chronicled his efforts to find out why Flint was losing tens of thousands of General Motors jobs.
These days, everyone here seems to have an answer to what is going on in Flint. On one side are residents and G.M. employees who say that the company is trying to abandon the town it built. On the other side are small-business owners who talk in whispers about how the U.A.W. seems to be determined to drive Flint's largest employer out of town. Both groups blame city officials for not doing more to wrest Flint from the shadow of the auto maker and the union.
"Everyone knows it's coming," said Kevin Jennings, referring to the widely held belief that G.M. is quietly preparing to close its 18 factories and offices here. Mr. Jennings, 30, whose father works for G.M., is the manager of Dale's Food for Health, one of only a handful of businesses scattered in a three-block area of boarded-up storefronts in the downtown section. "I wish they would just leave and get it over with," he said.
When Mr. Jennings was a boy, G.M.'s presence loomed so large that he and some friends, also children of G.M. employees, nicknamed the company Mother Motors, the breast that feeds Flint. In fact, it is difficult to find anything here that has not been created or influenced by the world's largest auto maker. G.M. and its 33,000 employees in Flint contribute about 60 percent to the local economy. Many of the classrooms in the five colleges and universities here are filled by the company's employees and their families, all of whom receive tuition assistance from the auto maker. One of the schools was started by G.M. to help train its workers for management and engineering positions. Now privately run, the school is the alma mater of at least 16 current G.M. executives.
And with more than 41,000 G.M. retirees and surviving spouses in the Flint area, the company and the union supply much of the customer base for the city's growing health care industry. Auto workers enjoy one of the most generous health care plans in the nation, paying for virtually nothing even after they retire.
Mayor Woodrow Stanley says G.M. has been both savior and oppressor to Flint. "It's one thing to be a one-company town. But it's far more difficult to be a town with one company in one industry," he said. "The very large presence of G.M. has retarded the growth of this community. It's not something you can change overnight."
No matter how long the strikes linger or how they are resolved, Mayor Stanley says the outcome for Flint is clear: "There is no greater microcosm of the auto industry than Flint. And if that industry is steadily leaving America, as we're seeing, it only stands to reason that they're going to leave Flint." Union officials predict Flint will lose 11,000 jobs over the next two years if workers do not win job security demands at the striking plants and other factories.
It seems to matter to almost no one that the auto maker plans to invest $1.5 billion here through 2001, including a $500 million engine plant. The flight from Flint is all that people seem to talk about, with many of them trading stories about how they plan to beat the company out of town.
"I'm going to New York. I'm going to be a singer," said Tanesha Fanter, a 22-year-old welder walking the picket line. Ms. Fanter said that although she supported the strike, she doubted G.M. would always be in town.
"I could be like everybody else," she said, "stay here and collect a paycheck, but it's not worth it. This work is hard. I've got burns all over my chest. I don't want to spend my whole life fighting just so I can keep working in a plant. There is more to the world than G.M. and Flint."

HEADLINE: PLAN TO GO PUBLIC AT GOLDMAN, SACHS

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company, Wall Street's last big private investment bank and by many measures its most successful, plans to announce today that it will end the firm's 130-year partnership by becoming a public company, according to people close to the firm.
Goldman's top executives were still meeting late last night to work out some details of the move, which would make Goldman a prime player in the financial industry's rush to consolidate. In recent years, that trend has turned nearly all of America's venerable finance partnerships -- which each formerly had a distinct culture and investment philosophy -- into homogenized financial giants. 
 The move would also be an indicator that some of Wall Street's savviest financiers believe there may never be a better time to capitalize on the bull stock market and on the public's love of finance houses with global ambitions.
Based on the stock-market prices of some other big investment houses, a decision to become a public company by issuing shares of stock could give the company a value as high as $30 billion and give each of the partners a stake that might eventually exceed $100 million.
Goldman's six-man executive committee was still meeting late last night to work out an agreement in principle to end the private partnership by selling at least part of the company. People at Goldman said that the firm's 190 partners, in weekend meetings that they described as passionate, had been almost evenly divided about the merits of ending the private partnership -- torn between the near-term riches and global heft that would almost certainly follow and the satisfaction of working within a tight-knit group whose decisions are not subject to the whims of outside shareholders.
Yet the partners left the final decision in the hands of the firm's six top executives, knowing full well that most of the executive committee favored the plan to go public.
As the firm's partners and 11,000 employees around the world anxiously awaited the results of the executive committee's deliberations last night, Jon S. Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr., Goldman's co-chairmen and chief executives, had scheduled a conference call with Goldman employees for early Monday morning. Barring last minute surprises, the two were expected to announce the decision in principle to take the company public, with details to be presented to the full partnership in a month or so.
Even though that decision would mark the end of a private firm founded in New York in 1869 by a German Jewish immigrant, Marcus Goldman, the game of musical chairs now played on Wall Street is a global one, and Goldman is determined to keep its seat. It is enjoying record profits, earning about $1 billion in each of the last two quarters. But it does not have stock, the chosen currency for mergers and acquisitions, and is now smaller than its leading rivals. It is also ill-prepared to seize opportunities at a time when walls between brokerage firms, bank and insurance companies are crumbling.
As a public company, Goldman bankers say they would seek to buy other American and foreign finance companies. And the firm itself, considered Wall Street's crown jewel in terms of profitability and the track records of the companies whose stock offerings it underwrites, will likely receive a flood of merger proposals -- some of which might allow Goldman to take over a larger commercial bank or insurance company.
Also underlying the decision is a fear that if the company does not go public during the current bull market, Goldman partners might lose an opportunity to capture the extraordinary value the market now places on well-run securities companies.
To some market watchers, Goldman's decision might be taken as a sign that the partners believe the stock market has reached a high. Indeed, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns, two rival, first issued shares to the public in 1986 and 1987, close to the peak of that era's bull market.
Goldman has long engaged in its own version of Hamlet -- to go public or not to go public -- deciding half a dozen times, most recently in 1996, to stay private. But people at the bank say a confluence of factors, including the bull market, the global competitive challenge, and the fact that the firm has had two of the best years in banking history, have now tipped the balance in favor of ending the partnership.
It was not a clear-cut choice. At their two-day retreat at the Palisades Executive Conference Center north of New York City on the Hudson River, a complex patrolled by security guards, the partners engaged in what was described as a Quaker-style meeting, where all 190 partners were invited to state their views about the firm's future.
In a long open session Saturday morning, more than 100 of them did so, with some later describing this gathering of mostly male white-shoe bankers as emotional and draining.
"For people who have devoted their lives to this place it was exhausting, but in some ways amazing," said one person who attended. "People did not hold anything back."
Mr. Paulson and Mr. Corzine remained officially neutral through the discussion, said people who attended. But several top partners who worked with Mr. Paulson to devise a strategic plan made strong cases in favor of taking Goldman public, emphasizing concerns that the partnership structure is too plodding and cumbersome for a bank with thousands of employees and the need to make snap decisions in scores of countries.
Others, including John L. Thornton, a member of the executive committee, spoke with equal determination against any public sale of shares, people there said. The prime fear was that a public company could never replicate the close-knit culture of a partnership, where financial rewards are measured in lifetimes instead of months.
In the end, no formal vote was taken. The partners were given a questionnaire in which they were asked to state their views on a public offering and several other issues, each requiring a written answer. Partners left the meeting Saturday afternoon without knowing the results of that poll. Reviewing the comments was left up to the executive committee, which met Sunday and continued discussion over dinner Sunday night.
At the weekend retreat, Goldman executives presented several ways of valuing the company, and their estimates covered a wide range of $15 billion to $35 billion, people who attended said. The firm has not yet developed a detailed plan for going public and would not put a price tag on the firm until they do.
Some analysts expect that the firm is likely to value itself between $25 billion and $30 billion, considered a rich but not implausible figure given the way the market values other securities companies. But some bankers argue with that figure and say that Goldman, given its reliance on some outside investment capital as well as partners' capital, would have to settle for less, perhaps $20 billion to $25 billion.
How the firm spreads that wealth is likely to be a matter of discussion in the weeks ahead. But several people within the firm expect that with a possible valuation of $30 billion, existing partners will take between $20 billion to $22 billion, or an average of $105 million to $115 million apiece. Goldman's 6,000 nonpartner executives would split between $6 billion and $8 billion, this person said. The rest would be reserved for the firm's outside investors and limited partners.
Several at Goldman have stressed that the plan to go public is not only about how to stuff the already bulging wallets of top executives. It is also about how to prepare the firm for a new era -- one in which only the most global banks with the resources to fight for business in any major economy will prosper. Increasingly, these people say, Goldman's private partnership is a handicap in that race.
In particular, a partnership cannot compete with public companies in the acquisitions game because it does not have stock, which is often a much cheaper way of acquiring other companies than cash. For that reason Goldman has tended to grow organically or to make only small purchases while some of its rivals have entered giant mergers or made multibillion dollar purchases to expand their business.
By some standards, Goldman is the most profitable investment bank in the world, and it competes for the top slot in all of its major businesses. But executives say they cannot ignore Merrill Lynch & Company's global acquisition binge, Morgan Stanley's merger with retail broker Dean Witter, Discover, or Salomon Smith Barney's proposed incorporation into a putative banking behemoth called Citigroup.
"On any one of these things, we can say, 'Oh, O.K., we don't need to do that,' " says one Goldman executive. "But you put them together, all these little punches, and you start to feel a little uneasy. It weighs on you."
But that straightforward reasoning underestimates the almost cultish attachment to partnership at the firm. It is an anachronistic vestige of 19th century, family-centered company organization, but a gilded one: A Goldman partnership is one of the few ways a Wall Street professional can become independently wealthy, with many earning as much as a top corporate boss or successful private entrepreneur.
Yet the firm also maintained a rare balance between fabulous monetary rewards and tight team discipline. One Goldman banker described this as "getting rich slowly." There are stars in the Goldman system. But they get smaller up-front rewards, and less public recognition, than they might get elsewhere.
Every company talks of teamwork, but Goldman elevated it to a commandment, bankers there say. Because partners' own money is at stake in every deal, the firm operates by consensus, with top executives often able to trust other partners implicitly. Scores of Goldman people participate in decisions that one or two bosses might make in other firms.
"The teamwork thing is not just propaganda -- it is emotional and real," says one person at the firm. "It was really the one thing that made this place special -- something other banks don't have."

HEADLINE: Most Approve Of Microsoft, A Poll Shows

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR with MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
The Government's antitrust battle against the Microsoft Corporation has not tarnished the company's reputation as an outstanding business that makes high-quality products. But according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, a majority of Americans do think that Microsoft is a monopoly and that the Justice Department should continue to investigate the company and its business practices.
Both in a nationwide telephone poll last week and in follow-up interviews, people again and again expressed deep admiration for the accomplishments of Microsoft and William H. Gates, the company's famous co-founder and chairman. Yet the same people repeatedly said there was an important role for the Government to play to make sure that fair play was maintained in the high-technology economy that Microsoft has come to symbolize. 
 "Bill Gates has made an enormous contribution to this nation's economy, creating jobs and wealth," said Richard Denoyer, a 65-year-old education consultant in Evendale, Ohio. "But you've got to give others a real chance to participate in these high-tech markets as well. And it's the Government's responsibility to check things out, to make sure that Microsoft is playing by the rules."
In the court of public opinion, the burden of proof clearly rests on the side of the Government to show that Microsoft has done anything illegal. Fifty-five percent of Americans surveyed said that they had a favorable opinion of Microsoft, while only 15 percent held an unfavorable opinion. (The remaining 30 percent had no opinion on the matter.) Most people said their opinion of Microsoft had not changed as a result of the Justice Department's investigation.
"People give Microsoft enormous credit for what it has accomplished, but they also recognize that bad things could happen and that market power can be abused," said Nicholas Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a market research firm that studies how consumers view technology companies. "It's pragmatic and entirely sensible."
The Times/CBS poll, conducted June 7 to 9, surveyed 1,126 adults nationwide.
When asked about Microsoft's business practices, 54 percent of those polled said they agreed with the statement that "Microsoft uses legally acceptable business tactics to sell and distribute its products."
By contrast, only 19 percent said they agreed that "Microsoft uses illegal sales and business tactics to force people to buy its products and keep other products from being used" -- a pivotal point in the Government's antitrust case. The remainder agreed with neither statement or had no opinion.
Even the 60 percent of people who say the Justice Department should continue to investigate Microsoft are not necessarily convinced that the Government was justified in bringing a major antitrust case against the company last month. The Justice Department has contended that Microsoft has used unfair practices to defend its monopoly in the market for personal computer operating-system software, the program that controls the basic operations of a computer, and to try to gain an edge in the new markets of Internet software and commerce.
Public opinion, to be sure, plays no direct role in antitrust policy. Yet it is inevitably a consideration when bringing a major case like the suit against Microsoft. Congress controls the Justice Department's budget, and a big case that is seen as too far out of step with public opinion could bring pressure from Congress.
So when the Microsoft suit was announced in Washington on May 18, Attorney General Janet Reno appeared before a battery of television cameras.
"Part of that exercise is to convince people that what the Government is doing is in the interest of the consumer," noted Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
Public opinion, he added, also sets the limits of Government action. The Justice Department, for example, has not moved to break up the big software company, as was done with the Bell System in 1984 and as some industry analysts have advocated in the Microsoft case.
"The public is not ready for something that drastic, certainly not yet," said Mr. Litan, who is the director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
People are split almost evenly on whether the Government did the right thing in filing suit against Microsoft, with 35 percent saying it was right and 27 percent saying it was a mistake. The remaining 38 percent were undecided or were not aware of the case.
People who said the investigation should continue but thought the Justice Department was mistaken in filing the antitrust suit tended to view the appropriate role for government more as a referee than as a prosecutor. They also regarded some of what they had heard of Microsoft's aggressive business practices as part of the rough-and-tumble of capitalism.
Dianne Tytell, a 48-year-old office manager of a dental practice in Virginia Beach, Va., said: "Bill Gates probably did overstep a few boundaries. If you're powerful and on top, that's what you do. He should get the equivalent of a parking ticket for that. But I don't think he's really done anything dishonest. And after all he's achieved, I think it's wrong for the Government to try to tear down someone like Bill Gates."
The Times/CBS poll does illustrate the high regard that most Americans have for Microsoft and for Mr. Gates. Nearly five times as many people have a favorable opinion of Mr. Gates as have an unfavorable opinion -- 39 percent to 8 percent, with the rest undecided or unfamiliar with Mr. Gates. The favorable-unfavorable split for President Clinton in the same poll is much more evenly divided: at 45 percent favorable, 37 percent unfavorable and the rest undecided.
In the case of Microsoft, familiarity breeds respect -- or at least familiarity with its products. On almost every Microsoft question asked in the poll, the more that people used computers, the more pro-Microsoft their answers were. For example, among people who not only use computers but have installed software on their own, 78 percent had a favorable opinion of Microsoft compared with 55 percent of all those questioned for the poll.
The high approval ratings for Microsoft, according to public opinion analysts, owes much to the perception that the company is a standard-bearer of a resurgent American economy in the 1990's, led by high- technology industries. "Microsoft is the symbolic company and Bill Gates is seen as the personification of America's recent success," observed Daniel Yankelovich, the public opinion analyst. "The captain of our side is Bill Gates."
Most Americans are technological optimists, according to the Times/ CBS poll, with 59 percent saying that computers solve more problems than they create, while 29 percent say they create more problems than they solve. Among computer users, 71 percent see the machines as solving more problems than they create. And two-thirds of Americans now use a computer either at home or at work, according to the survey.
Still, many Americans appear to be embracing the information age tentatively, if not fearfully. More than half of all computer users, 52 percent, say they have never installed a software program -- a basic step in computing. While technology enthusiasts never tire of extolling the virtues of computers as personalized tools of empowerment, the Times/CBS poll suggests that a large share of the computer-using public has no interest in tailoring their machines or changing them.
The portrait of many people as passive recipients of computer technology may also cast some doubt on one of Microsoft's arguments in its dispute with the Government. The Justice Department, Microsoft says, has overstated the advantage the company enjoys because the main desktop screen that users see when they turn on their machines is Microsoft's Windows. That first screen can be easily changed or modified, Microsoft insists.
It can, but the poll indicates that fine-tuning software is beyond many people.
Microsoft's market power is viewed with both ambivalence and pragmatism, according to the Times/CBS poll. Monopoly, it seems, is no longer regarded as an economic evil. A majority of those questioned say Microsoft is a monopoly -- a label Microsoft itself shuns -- but 77 percent also say Microsoft makes high-quality products. And 58 percent of computer users and 67 percent of people who have installed software themselves consider Microsoft's dominant role in the software business to be good for consumers.
A certain ambivalence about big, successful companies, and what the Government's role should be in policing them, has been a theme of American public opinion for decades, analysts say.
Consider Christopher Rogers, a 25-year-old medical student in Philadelphia, who seems little concerned by the dominance of Microsoft's Windows operating system.
"Microsoft's Windows is a great product," he said. "It is a monopoly but not in the traditional sense of controlling markets to raise prices."
Still, Mr. Rogers, like others polled, is skeptical about whether consumers would benefit if Microsoft were to control the market for software used for browsing the Internet -- a market that is a focus of the Justice Department's case. Only 8 percent of those polled said it would be a good thing if Microsoft dominated the browser market, 41 percent said it would be bad, 39 percent said it would make no difference and 12 percent had no opinion.
"Microsoft pushing its Internet browser onto the market with every copy of Windows does seem like a domineering thing to do," Mr. Rogers said. "And I do think that's something worth investigating."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 7 to June 9 with 1,126 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for the 315 most sophisticated computer users in the sample it is plus or minus six percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD;
A Muslim Artist and Hindu Images: It's a Volatile Mix

BYLINE: By Somini Sengupta 

 BODY:
For the second time in less than two years, India's most famous artist, Maqbool Fida Husain, has become a target of the country's most militant Hindu activists. Early last month, members of the far-right Bajrang Dal, upset at a stylized portrait of a Hindu goddess, slipped into Mr. Husain's Bombay apartment, destroyed one painting and mauled several canvases before being arrested by the police.
Since then, high-ranking officials of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, while distancing themselves from the attack, have asked him to refrain from what they call his perverted works of art, while many of the country's most prominent artists and writers have rallied around him, criticizing attempts to fetter free expression. 
 Mr. Husain himself, however, seems unruffled, taking what he euphemistically called a philosophical approach to the whole furor. "It's very minor," he said impatiently in a telephone interview from London, where his paintings were being offered at Christie's auction house. "The door was open. I went out. Some people came." When pressed for details, he demurred. "My house is an open house," he said. "Everybody is welcome. They are my people. I belong to them."
Perhaps. But Mr. Husain, a Muslim who has filled many a canvas with scenes and portraits taken from Hindu mythology, has recently become the most prominent whipping boy for his country's Hindu militants. In November 1996, a mob ransacked one of Mr. Husain's galleries in Ahmedabad over another painting, a partly nude representation of the Hindu goddess of arts and letters, called Saraswati, bringing loud cries against censorship.
The gallery has since closed, but even his shows abroad have not been immune. Last summer a display at A Gallery on West 23d Street in Manhattan drew a small clutch of peaceful protesters. For his part, Mr. Husain, whose long and prolific career has mirrored the boom in Indian contemporary art over the last 10 years, expressed little surprise. At 83, he remembers the Hindu-Muslim antagonisms that preceded India's independence in 1947, the year he displayed his first canvas in public. "Even in the British time, I saw riots in Bombay," he recalled, adding that India is steeped in religion. "It is the one thing that you should not touch. I touched it. But they misunderstood it.'
In fact, Mr. Husain's brush has always touched religion. The portraits that have set off the Hindu militants in recent years were done several years ago. He has painted a long series based on "The Mahabharata," the Hindu epic, and also completed a series on the world's 10 major religions, including humanism. Recently, his imagination has turned to the movies, which in India can be as vital as matters of faith. "As Woody Allen says, 'Cinema is the only reality,' and that is more true in India," Mr. Husain observed. "Imagine what violence if there was no cinema. And I mean popular cinema, not the arty-arty, which is dull.'
These days, he is busy at work on what he calls an experimental Hindi-language opera, starring the pouty Bombay bombshell Madhuri Dixit, who, much to the dismay of many critics, has become Mr. Husain's latest obsession. He has painted more than 200 portraits of Ms. Dixit and seen her films over and over again, sometimes with an easel on his lap. "It was," he offered, "almost like a meditation."
Though he has only recently aroused the anger of Hindu militants, he is no stranger to controversy. Mr. Husain, whose paintings are bought by Indians at home and abroad as quickly as they are created, has attracted almost as much attention from the very spectacle of his life as from his brush.
"Even the way you live," he said the other day, "is an art form." For years he insisted on traveling barefoot; he was forced to don sandals only recently, after fracturing his toes repeatedly. In a 1995 show in Calcutta, Mr. Husain painted six canvases in front of an audience over six days, and then obliterated them all with a coat of white paint. Last month he offered his Hindu fundamentalist detractors the ultimate of Hindu sacrifices, agni pariksha, or a test by fire. He suggested that a panel of judges composed of an art critic, a lawyer and a member of a Hindu nationalist organization review his works. Any painting they deemed offensive, Mr. Husain said, he would simply throw into the flame.
His most avid collector in the United States, Chester Hirwitz, compared him to Andy Warhol, a likeness only heightened by Mr. Husain's shock of silver hair and a handsome, lean frame. "It's the way he sees the world," Mr. Hirwitz said. "It's a kind of wit, out of which comes a revelation of a fantastic kind of art."
By his own estimate, Mr. Husain has produced 40,000 to 60,000 paintings, famous for the brilliant reds and indigos that are as reminiscent of Indian landscapes as the black and white films of Satyajit Ray. His works have been included in Sotheby's auction of Indian contemporary paintings for the last two years in New York. Though he is relatively unknown in the United States, where the art market tends to favor the subcontinent's classical works over contemporary art, for many moneyed subcontinentals, a Husain canvas has become an important status symbol.
"You buy a Rolls-Royce, you buy a Husain," the artist observed. "There's nothing wrong. It's good for the artist." It wasn't always that way. Only in the last decade has Indian contemporary art gained notice, and that largely in India alone.
Mr. Husain, born in a small town in Maharashtra in 1915, began painting at 11. But his uncle, wanting him to pursue a practical trade like becoming a tailor, destroyed his earliest works. Pressed, he became a tailor's apprentice but soon ran away to Bombay to paint movie billboards for a living. In the years before India's independence, he helped found the Progressive Artists Group, a collective devoted to the creation of a modern Indian esthetic, founded on the principles of Cubism and infused with the colors and textures of India. It was to be free, he recalled, from both a Victorian British tradition as well as from the classical Indian miniatures. "Those two forces," Mr. Husain explained, "we tried to demolish."
But there was no market for the work, although occasionally an embassy official from Europe or the United States would buy a painting. In the late 1970's, India's business tycoons also started buying. By the late 1980's, the auction houses in London and New York took notice. As the Indian economy opened to foreign investment and Indian expatriates grew in number and wealth, the art market blossomed.
These days, a Husain opening is noted in society columns. People wait in line for hours. "It's all so cinematic," Mr. Husain said the other day. "I lost my identity because of this. I have become McBool!"

HEADLINE: 3M to Trail Forecasts, and Its Shares Fall

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, June 15

 BODY:
The stock of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company skidded $5.8125, or 6.7 percent, to $81 in active trading today, after the company said its second-quarter earnings would be below estimates.
Earnings are likely to be between 90 cents and 94 cents a diluted share, the company said, short of both the figure of 99 cents a year earlier and an analysts' consensus of $1.05 from the First Call Corporation. 
 Attributing the earnings pressure to weak Asian economies, modest domestic growth and the strengthening dollar, L. D. DeSimone, chairman and chief executive of 3M, said in an interview that the company might look into layoffs to cut costs. 3M will explore a "whole series of cost cuts," he said.
Mr. DeSimone noted that employment had gone down to about 75,000 employees from about 90,000 in the early 1990's. "We're doing a lot more business now than then," he said. "We've got 15,000 to 17,000 fewer people. It's something you keep working on."
Mark R. Gulley, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said in a research note last week, in which he downgraded 3M to neutral from outperform, that growth in productivity was slipping.
"Head count was essentially flat in 1Q '98 but needs to decline to meet 8 percent per annum productivity goals," Mr. Gulley wrote.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Even as Stocks Plunge, Treasuries Soar to 30-Year High

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Long-term Treasury rates fell to their lowest level in 30 years yesterday while other Government bond yields, including those that affect home mortgages, dropped sharply.
The drop in rates, which has seen the 30-year yield fall half a percentage point since the end of April, could help support economic growth by helping the housing industry and making loans for capital investment cheaper. 
 Stronger growth would make it more likely that Federal Reserve policy makers would raise interest rates to prevent a resurgence of inflation.
But yesterday's sharp fall in the stock market, the latest in a string of declines that left the Nasdaq composite index down 10.5 percent from its recent high and the Dow Jones industrial average off 6.3 percent, has some analysts wondering about the near-term economic outlook.
A prolonged fall in the stock market, or even just a long period of inconclusive ups and downs, could have a chilling effect on consumer spending, as investors decide they may not be as wealthy as they had thought.
"The equity market is key," said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "If equities don't hold up it would neutralize the effects from interest rates."
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week that such a cooling in the stock market was one way that the Fed could get the slowing in growth policy makers say they need.
Analysts pointed to the economic turmoil in Asia, problems in Russia and, possibly, some new doubts about the American stock market, for reasons why investors seemed to be rushing to the safe harbor of the American bond market.
The 70-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average after 3:30 P.M. yesterday that pushed the day's decline over 200 points came as the yield on the 30-year bond dropped from 5.61 percent to 5.58 percent, down from 5.66 percent Friday. The price of the bond, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 16/32, to 107 26/32.
According to Salomon Brothers, the yield is the lowest for long-term Goverment rates since the fall of 1968, a time when interest rates were rising sharply because of the Vietnam War and inflation.
The yield on the 10-year note, used in the setting of mortgage interest rates, also fell, dropping to 5.35 percent, from 5.42 percent Friday. That is the lowest for 10-year yields since the fall of 1993. In January of this year, when the 10-year yield fell to 5.36 percent, mortgage rates were at four-year lows.
Shorter-term interest rates have also fallen sharply recently, partly in response to the foreign money coming into the American market. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell to 5.38 percent yesterday from 5.43 percent Friday and 5.57 percent in the last week.
Where interest rates go from here is unclear. Analysts said they could fall further if the turmoil in Asia continued and foreigners sent more money here. But some think that there are not enough data yet proving that the economy is slowing from its recent, rapid 4 percent-plus pace to warrant a further big decline in long-term rates.
"In order to go below 5.5 percent on a sustained basis, there will need to be more evidence that the economy is slowing on a sustainable basis, not just a flight to quality," said Donald J. Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	98.734	97.439	Discounted Rate	5.01%	5.06%	Coupon Yield	5.14%	5.27%	High Price	98.736	97.442	Discounted Rate	5.00%	5.06%	Coupon Yield	5.13%	5.26%	Low Price	98.732	97.439	Discounted Rate	5.01%	5.06%	Coupon Yield	5.15%	5.27%	Accepted at low price	23%	72%	Total applied for	$30,890,970	$32,390,949	Accepted	$8,698,810	$11,220,429	Noncompetitive	$1,275,527	$1,105,594

HEADLINE: Adrift in Japan's Sea of Unknown Intentions

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
For the last 10 months the Clinton Administration has warned that a full-blown recession in Japan could prove the time bomb of the Asian crisis, setting off a sharp fall of the yen and, in turn, a second wave of the economic contagion that is spreading to investors around the globe.
Now that appears to be what is happening. But Mr. Clinton's economic advisers, weary of jawboning their Japanese counterparts, say the United States has very little leverage remaining over Tokyo. In fact, in internal White House arguments in recent days, some of Mr. Clinton's advisers have argued that Japan's hidden strategy is to let the country's currency fall -- making Japanese goods less expensive in the United States -- even if the fall undermines other countries in Asia that are struggling to emerge from a yearlong nightmare, or worsens troubles in Russia and Latin America. 
 In fact, the yen's tumble is acting as something of a double brake on other economies around the world. Japan's recession is making it nearly impossible for other Asian nations (to say nothing of American car makers and other manufacturers) to export more goods into Japan. Meanwhile, as the yen falls, Japanese goods push out products that other ailing Asian nations are trying to export to the United States and Europe, particularly Korean cars, steel and semiconductors.
"What is happening in Japan is hitting all of its neighbors -- Korea, Thailand -- and it is triggering a huge amount of instability around the world," Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said in an interview today. But when asked what the United States could do, Ms. Barshefsky, a veteran of five years of trade wars with Japan that have yielded modest changes but not the sweeping economic deregulation that Mr. Clinton once championed so publicly, offered little new.
"We need to keep putting pressure on them, both bilaterally and through our allies," she said. At the same time she conceded that the threat the United States had occasionally wielded in trade disputes -- closing the American market to cars or computer chips, for example -- would probably only accentuate Japan's troubles if used to compel Tokyo to speed up economic reforms.
In private, Administration officials have long referred to Japan as "the last firewall" of the Asian crisis, and contended that if that wall were breached, it was only a matter of time before Asia's troubles leaped the Pacific. It is an unproven thesis -- many said Korea was the firewall during the depths of the first wave of Asian economic trouble in December -- but clearly investors harbor the same worry. The evidence came today on Wall Street, when last week's selloff accelerated into a 207.01-point drop in the Dow industrials, prompted largely by news that the dollar had touched an eight-year high against the yen.
All of this is bound to complicate President Clinton's first trip to China, which begins next week.
At the insistence of the Chinese, he is making no stopover in Japan, America's strongest military ally in Asia. That deprives him of a natural chance to drive home to a Japanese public -- one highly critical of its own leadership -- America's prescription: rapid deregulation and a bailout of Japan's banks modeled on the United States' handling of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980's.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton is facing accusations from the Chinese that the United States and Japan are engaged in an economic conspiracy to let the yen fall, creating further troubles in the rest of Asia. "Why are Japan and the United States letting the yen slide?" China's state-run daily, The Financial News, which is controlled by China's central bank, asked this morning. "Mainly because a falling yen suits the two countries' economic interests now, and is beneficial in passing on their domestic economic problems to other countries," the paper concluded.
That commentary underscores an oft-expressed view in Asia these days: that the United States is not unhappy with Asia in crisis, especially as the American economy keeps charging along.
China has long worried about American efforts to "contain" its power, both military and economic. The falling yen and rising dollar, in the view of some nationalists, are means to this end. The currencies' shifts benefit the Japanese by making their exports far more competitive against their rivals.
And a strong dollar benefits American companies by making it possible for them to snap up assets across Asia -- companies, factories, banks -- at fire sale prices. One of Asia's most voluble nationalists, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, warned recently that foreign investors who bought up Asian assets were risking a huge political backlash.
The opposite view -- that the Asian crisis poses a rising threat to the United States -- is voiced almost daily nowadays by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, even though he may have, intentionally or not, accelerated the recent run on the yen.
Time and again the Treasury Secretary, who once supervised currency trading at Goldman, Sachs & Company, has repeated that the only way to strengthen the yen is for Japan to enact the economic and market reforms the United States has long advocated. "Over time, currencies follow fundamentals," he told Congress last week. He has repeatedly infuriated Japanese officials by refusing to threaten imminent intervention in the currency markets, and he has not backed away from his mantra that "a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States."
Investors have interpreted those comments as a license to sell the yen, without fear that the United States would join Japan in an effort to bolster the yen. They are probably reading him correctly. "The Japanese wasted $20 billion last month trying to intervene to keep the yen in the 130's," one senior Administration official noted recently. "Bob knows that running against the markets only delays the fall of a currency; it can't stop it. So he wants to pick his moment."
That is a fine strategy as long as the Japanese really fear the effects of a devalued yen.
Mr. Rubin still believes they do. He argues that although Japanese businesses want a weak currency so that they can increase exports, Japanese authorities are fearful that a weak yen could topple Japanese banks that are struggling to remain solvent.
Inside the Administration, though, some officials have begun to question whether Mr. Rubin has read the Japanese correctly. In meetings last week and phone conversations over the weekend, they have begun to argue that Japanese authorities now realize they can no longer prop up the yen -- so they might as well just let it fall, and hope that exports will surge. The fate of many of Asia's economies may hinge on who is correctly divining Japan's intentions.

HEADLINE: Lewis H. Young, 73, Former Editor in Chief of Business Week

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Lewis H. Young, a former editor in chief of Business Week who expanded the horizons of business reporting, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 73 and lived in Ossining, N.Y.
Mr. Young died of a heart attack as he was leaving his office at the Cahners Publishing Company, where he was editorial director of Electronic News, his wife, Joanne, said. 
 Trained in engineering and physics, Mr. Young was among the first business magazine editors to emphasize coverage of technology, electronics and computers. At Business Week, he was in charge during a period when economic news was frequently prominent, including an Arab oil embargo, recession in the mid-1970's and the New York City financial crisis.
He was also editor in chief of Electronics Magazine, which, like Business Week, was a McGraw-Hill publication. He also started several other business and electronics magazines.
He was active with Catalyst, a national advocacy group for the advancement of women in business and the professions, for a number of years and became chairman of its board in 1982.
After 15 years as chief editor, he left Business Week in 1984. Mr. Young moved to Hong Kong and started the magazine Far East Business. In 1989, he joined the Cahners Publishing, a unit of Reed Elsevier P.L.C., the British-Dutch information company.
He directed Asian operations of Cahners and was editorial director of Cahners's Electronic Business Asia, based in Hong Kong. In 1992, he became editorial director of Electronic Business, a Cahners monthly based in Boston. He moved to Electronic News as editorial director last year.
Mr. Young was born in Philadelphia. He received undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering and physics at Purdue University. After college, he was a physicist with the Bettis Atomic Power division of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. He earned a master's degree in business administration from New York University. He was a first lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers from 1943 to 1946.
In addition to his wife, Joanne Root Young, he is survived by a daughter, Mrs. Anne Albanese of Norwalk, Conn., and a sister, Pauline Schamberg of Buffalo Grove, Ill.

HEADLINE: Delinquency Rate on Credit Cards Is Higher

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Consumers' credit card delinquency rate rose slightly in the first quarter of this year over the final quarter of 1997, the American Bankers Association reported today.
Some 3.11 percent of card accounts were at least 30 days overdue for repayment in the first three months of 1998, compared with 3.04 percent the previous quarter. However, the most recent figure was down from 3.51 percent a year earlier, it said. 
 Its chief economist, James Chessen, said, "The delinquency rates are still high enough to warrant concern, and banks will no doubt continue the pattern of tighter lending standards for higher-risk customers."
"I'm pleased that Congress is reforming the lax bankruptcy laws that allow individuals to ignore obligations, when many have the ability to repay a portion of their debt," he said of last week's House vote to overhaul the bankruptcy laws.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
For Sellers To Japanese, Worse Ahead

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
As the Japanese yen continued its slide toward the abyss yesterday, stock markets around the world trembled. So much for the idea that Asian problems could be contained.
Shares of many big multinational companies that do business in Asia fell yesterday on fears that declining sales there would hurt profits. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, for example, lost 6.7 percent of its value. I.B.M. was down 3.4 percent. 
 But share prices of some companies with large exposures to Japan's incredible shrinking economy do not yet reflect the dark reality of what is happening there. Yes, these companies' shares have fallen, but they are likely to fall further in coming weeks as the bleak news sinks in.
Businesses with big Japanese exposure range from Tiffany & Company, the elite New York-based jeweler that produces 27 percent of its sales in Japan, to the discount retailer Toys "R" Us, which has 111 stores -- one-tenth of its worldwide total -- in the Pacific Rim. The company has 64 stores in Japan alone.
Other players in Japan include Aflac Inc., a life insurance concern based in Columbus, Ga., which generates 60 percent of its earnings in Japan. Particularly hard hit is Nu Skin, a marketer of personal-care and nutrition products that gets 70 percent of its revenue from Japanese operations.
Cosmetics makers are also vulnerable: Estee Lauder generates 13 percent of its operating income from the region; 16 percent of Avon Products' sales and 10 percent of its pretax income come from the Pacific Rim.
In addition, Japan is the largest market for Gucci, the luxury-goods retailer. And LVMH, the Parisian purveyor of high-class perfume, luggage, Champagne and Cognac, reported that sales fell 30 percent through May at its duty-free goods unit as Japanese customers cut back on travel.
The setback in Japan is a paradox for the American companies that battled for years to penetrate the country's relatively closed consumer society. Because Japan was willing to open its borders only to some, not all foreign companies, it may not be immediately obvious to investors which companies will be hurt most by problems there now. The businesses that never broke through Japan's barriers can now count their blessings.
The damage is not limited to companies that do business in Japan. The entire Pacific Rim looks like poison. The yen is dragging down currencies elsewhere in Asia, in places like South Korea, Indonesia and Hong Kong, as it falls in value.
Companies with significant operations in Japan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim are reeling from a double punch. First, sales of goods made overseas generally decline when a nation's local currency is in a free fall; that's because the currency's lower value makes foreign goods more expensive there than they once were.
The second punch comes when these companies repatriate earnings made in a country whose currency is weak to one with a strong currency -- in this case, the dollar. Although these companies try to hedge their currency risks, almost no one had predicted that the yen -- down 8.5 percent against the dollar since May 15 -- would drop so steeply.
Many managers of concerns with exposure overseas say they will make up any shortfall there by stepping up operations elsewhere. For example, Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, told the French business weekly Le Journal des Finances, that the company would expand in the United States to offset slowing sales in Asia.
Maybe so. But it takes a long time to build business. Any increases that LVMH and other companies hope to generate from new or expanded markets will not be evident for several quarters. Sales declines, on the other hand, can happen overnight, especially in a country whose currency -- the yen in this case -- has fallen almost 4 percent in the last week alone.
Wall Street analysts remain mostly sanguine about these companies' prospects. That's no surprise, given how hard it is for executives to dispense bad news. And many analysts, perhaps waiting for the yen to stabilize, have not updated their estimates to take into account the its recent tailspin. Mr. Arnault of LVMH, for example, said at last week's shareholder meeting, it remained his objective for the company to report a profit rise in 1998. But his hopes are pinned on a yen value of 130 to the dollar, not the current 146.
Another reason these shares have not crumbled further: Investors may think Japan's problems are temporary -- a dangerous view. Craig Chudler, Japanese market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, expects the gross domestic product in Japan to contract 1.5 percent this year, more than double last year's decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent. Continued weakness in Japan's stock market, down 1.3 percent yesterday, will make consumers there even more likely to cut back on discretionary spending.
With some of these stocks down, they may look cheap. But with few willing to predict how low the yen can sink, and with the Japanese Government doing little to address its problems, this is no time for bottom-fishing.

HEADLINE: In Booming Economy, Poor Still Struggle to Pay the Rent

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Despite the economy's robust growth, low-income families continue to face record-level problems in the most basic of economic transactions: paying the rent.
Two studies released in the past two months have found that, unlike past economic recoveries, the boom times of the mid-1990's have done nothing to ease the housing problems of the poor. Indeed, the affordability problem may have grown worse. 
 Though housing costs vary widely by region, the severe and growing shortage of affordable apartments persists from east to west; in central cities, suburbs and rural areas, and among all racial and ethnic groups. The new data suggest that, through boom or bust, the gap between the incomes of needy renters and their shelter costs has become an abiding feature of the modern economy.
The study released today by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research and advocacy group, added fresh details to the discouraging picture. The study primarily covered 1993 to 1995.
In 1993, 4.1 million poor families spent more than half their income on rent and utilities, the study found. By 1995 that figure had grown to 4.4 million families.
Similarly, in 1993, the count of needy families outnumbered affordable apartments by 3.8 million. But by 1995, the gap grew to 4.4 million.
In 1995, the typical family of poor renters spent about 60 percent of its income on shelter, twice the percentage the Government considers affordable, the study found. That figure was the same in 1993.
The center's findings echo those of the Government. An April report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development similarly concluded that a growing economy had done nothing to ease the housing problems of the poor.
The department report said that for low-income families, housing affordability had become a "a fundamental structural problem," despite "robust economic growth."
"The center's study mirrors many of our own findings," said Andrew Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "Unfortunately, there are a lot more $6-an-hour jobs than $6-an-hour apartments."
The center's portrait of low-income housing did contain one bit of encouraging news. The number of dilapidated apartments continues to decline. In 1985, 22 percent of poor renters lived in substandard homes, like those lacking reliable plumbing. A decade later, that figure had declined to 14 percent.
The problems of needy renters rest at the intersection of three distinct trends. One, their incomes have stagnated. Two, shelter costs are growing faster than inflation as a whole. And three, the Government has not been expanding the supply of subsidized housing.
"There is general agreement about the magnitude of the affordability problem," said John Weicher, who served as an assistant housing secretary under President George Bush and now is a housing analyst for the Hudson Institute, a conservative research organization. "The disagreement is over what to do about it."
The Clinton Administration is asking Congress to offer rental subsidies to an additional 100,000 families this year. During the heyday of Government housing programs, 1977 to 1981, the Government added about 260,000 families a year to its roster of subsidized renters. During the Administrations of President Ronald Reagan and President Bush, that number still grew, though more slowly, averaging 70,000 a year.
But since 1995, when the Republicans took over Congress, the Government stopped expanding the pool of subsidized housing for the first time in modern history. Much of the cutback has been budget-driven. It costs about $6,000 a year to keep an average family in subsidized housing. And with repair costs rising for aging apartments, Congress has been reluctant to finance new ones.
Though about 15 million households now qualify for Federal housing assistance, only about 4.5 million families get it. Of those families, about a third live in conventional public housing projects. The others have subsidies that allow them to live in private housing. In each case, tenants contribute 30 percent of their income toward the rent, and the Government provides the rest.
While the Government's efforts have slowed, the crux of the problem remains in the economics of the private market. Demolition and gentrification have destroyed many low-cost housing units. And the cost of replacing them simply outstrips the ability of the neediest renters to pay.
Market forces can supply the poor with cheap clothing or food. But many housing costs are fixed, like land, taxes, utilities and interest. The ability of builders to economize, therefore, is limited.
From 1991 to 1995, the average rent paid by a low-income renter rose 21 percent, the center's study found, compared with a general inflation rate of 9 percent.
While the housing problems of the poor may seem a perennial concern, they have undergone a sea change in the past generation.
In 1970, there were about 300,000 more cheap apartments than there were needy renters -- 6.2 million renters and 6.5 million apartments. By 1995, however, there were 10.5 million needy renters, and just 6.1 million cheap apartments.
(The study defined a cheap apartment as one where rent and utilities cost less than $300 in 1995, and a needy renter as one earning less than $12,000 a year. It adjusted the 1970 figures to account for inflation.)
The study found that about 80 percent of poor renters spend more than 30 percent of their income on shelter. And about 60 percent spend more than half their income on rent and utilities. Leaving aside those with subsidies, the numbers grow even more discouraging. The average poor renter not receiving a subsidy spends 77 percent of income on shelter.
While Mr. Weicher agrees that the economic recovery has been slow to ease the housing problems of the poor, he predicts a less discouraging report when more recent data is made available from the Census Bureau.
"I'd expect some improvement from 1995 to 1997," he said. "This recovery was slower than previous recoveries to reach people at the bottom."

As Japan Goes, So Goes the Neighborhood

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, June 16

 BODY:
As countries throughout Asia try to pick up the pieces of their economies, they are increasingly confronted with the disconcerting reality that recoveries are vulnerable to the frail Japanese economy and the downward path of the yen. What worries them is that both are completely beyond their control, and more worrying, perhaps beyond the control of the Japanese authorities.
China, Hong Kong, Thailand and other countries have called on Japan to stem the yen's fall, and there is growing apprehension that the yen's decline will lead China to devalue its currency as well, perhaps spurring a rash of competitive devaluations. 
 The yen has been declining relentlessly in recent weeks. In late New York trading Monday, the dollar cost 146.15 yen, the first time in nearly eight years it has surpassed 146 yen. In Asia trading today, the yen weakened further before rebounding a bit to 145.35 yen. It took just under 80 yen to buy a dollar at the yen's peak in April 1995.
The fear is that the recession in Japan's economy, which is twice as large as all the rest of Asia, will cause a currency crisis that wrecks Asia's fragile recovery from the initial plunge in currency values nearly a year ago. The effects of Asia's weakness have already shaved profits at companies across America, and another currency crisis could have a deeper and wider impact.
"We have reached another stage," said Rajeev Malik, regional economist with Jardine Fleming International Securities Ltd. in Singapore. "Asia will not turn its course until Japan does."
It is not clear how the Japanese Government can exert influence over the market forces pushing the yen down. "We cannot move the market by ourselves," Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told Parliament on Monday.
Japan's Vice Finance Minister, Koji Tanami, reiterated at a regular weekly news conference on Monday that the Japanese Government may take coordinated action with other countries to halt the yen's decline. His words had little effect.
One reason for the yen's decline is that Japanese investors are selling yen and buying dollars. Figures released Monday showed that Japan's market liberalization had encouraged investments overseas.
The figures showed that in April, Japanese investors sent a record amount of capital abroad. About 3.74 trillion yen, or $25 billion, went into equity and bond investments overseas, the Ministry of Finance said, the largest amount since the Government started compiling such data in 1980.
The tide of money changed into dollars could continue. Japanese investors are sitting on 1,200 trillion yen in individual savings, even though bank deposit rates here are less than three-tenths of a percent.
The Government has begun loosening foreign exchange regulations and so now it is easier for Japanese savers to turn their savings into dollars or marks and invest in the United States and Europe to get higher returns. In Japan, the benchmark 10-year bond earns 1.18 percent, compared with 5.37 percent on 10-year United States Treasuries.
Japan's recession makes it hard for other Asian economies to recover, partly because Japan has a potentially huge appetite for Asian exports. About one-fifth of China's exports, for instance, go to Japan. With the weak economy and the weak yen, however, Japan is less able to absorb such goods.
The yen's weakness also raises pressure on other Asian countries, particularly South Korea and Taiwan, to devalue to keep their exports competitive. This could set off a round of competitive devaluations, particularly if China then devalued its currency, the renminbi.
"Beggar thy neighbor policies, or competitive devaluations, are more serious and more immediate, compared to a downward spiral of the economy," said C. H. Kwan, a Tokyo-based economist specializing in Asia at the Nomura Research Institute. The weakening yen is "already hurting currency and stock markets in the whole region."
"If we have a devaluation of the renminbi," he added, "we have more trouble ahead. The crisis is going to linger."
China has repeatedly said it will not devalue the renminbi but has given indications of a reappraisal. Last week, Dai Xianglong, China's central bank governor, said the yen's weakness was "having a very negative impact on Chinese imports and exports and the utilization of foreign capital." One major risk is that a debilitating tailspin in the currencies of other Asian countries could prompt Asian governments to defend their currencies by raising local interest rates, a move that could choke off any recovery or cause more severe economic declines.
Not everyone in Asia is so discouraged, though. Kim Min Hong, a manager at Kyung Duck Electronics in Seoul, South Korea, makes magnetic heads for credit cards, as well as machines that read the cards. His product costs one-fourth the price of similar machines from Japan.
"In terms of competitiveness with Japanese products, our products are still much cheaper," he said. "Japanese products account for more market share around the world, but we do not feel the effects of the yen depreciation yet."
Lee Jin Ho, an analyst at the Korea Foreign Traders Association, which represents steel, auto and semiconductor exporters, said South Korean companies were still coping, but not necessarily for long.
"Korean exports still have some breathing room," he said. "But when the yen depreciates to 150 yen to the dollar, that will definitely have an impact on Korean exports over all."

German Bank Deal
TOKYO, June 15 (Agence France-Presse) -- The struggling Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. said today that it had sold a major operation to a German bank for $1.57 billion.
Long-Term sold its aviation and shipping financing division, with operations in London and New York, to Deutsche Verkehrs Bank, hoping the move would help strengthen its capital base.
The Japanese bank, troubled by big debts and losses, has faced heavy pressure, particularly in the last week, after its share price was badly hit as investors sold off their stocks fearing it would cancel a major tie-up with the Swiss Bank Corporation.
At the end of last March, Long Term's assets totaled 26.6 trillion yen, or about $18.2 billion, down from 29.5 trillion yen the previous year.
In 1996 Deutsche Verkehrs, owned by German savings and agricultural banks, had assets of 9.1 billion marks, or about $5 billion.

HEADLINE: DOW TUMBLES 207 IN GLOBAL DECLINE

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Renewed fears that Asia's economic crisis will stall growth in the profits of American companies sent United States' stocks plunging yesterday, the worst in a string of recent selloffs that has now erased the gains of the last three months for the Dow Jones industrial average.
Since crossing the 9,000 mark in April -- a level almost 1,100 points above where the blue-chip average began the year -- the Dow has faced trouble sustaining that height. 
 The barometer of the nation's top industrial companies fell 207.01 points yesterday, to 8,627.93, a 2.3 percent drop that left it down 6.3 percent from its record high. Some other market gauges have fallen even more, suggesting that a stock market correction -- a drop of 10 percent or more -- is under way.
Investors are increasingly concerned that Asia has not reached the bottom of its economic cycle. Distress signs there have worsened.
Japan, which many hoped would be the region's rescuer, announced last week that its economy shrank sharply in the quarter that ended in March, amounting to its steepest annualized decline since World War II. The yen, a barometer of Japan's economic weakness, fell to another eight-year low against the dollar yesterday, further elevating fears throughout Asia. Page D8.
Prices on the Japanese stock market and at other exchanges across Asia fell sharply in response, setting the stage for a decline when trading began on Wall Street.
"What you're really seeing is a truly global market," said Anthony Conroy, a managing director at Bankers Trust Global Investment Management. "If you catch a cold in Asia, it really becomes a flu almost everywhere else."
For American companies that do business in Japan and throughout Asia, the prospects are growing dimmer for a recovery anytime soon. Yesterday, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, the maker of Post-It Notes and Scotchgard fabric protector, became the latest American company to warn investors that earnings would be disappointing this quarter because of Asian problems.
Earlier this year, analysts predicted that Asia's troubles would hurt global companies in the first half of 1998 but that earnings would pick up in the second half. Now, more analysts are pushing back their estimates of a recovery.
Although companies have been reluctant to say much about how Asia will lower earnings, Boeing, National Semiconductor, Ford Motor, Callaway Golf, and Analog Devices have all hinted that profits will continue to be pinched in the second half.
Through Friday, 64 percent of the companies that have warned analysts to revise their profit projections for the second quarter have suggested that the estimates be lowered, according to the First Call Corporation, a Boston-based firm that tracks analysts' earnings estimates. In an average quarter, only 57 percent of companies give such negative advice, First Call said.
For the year, analysts now expect profits at the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 to rise 9.2 percent, down from a 13.9 percent estimate at the beginning of the year, according to a survey by First Call.
Those projections may still prove optimistic. Profits in the S.& P. 500 actually rose 3.8 percent in the first quarter and are now expected to climb 4.7 percent in the second quarter, First Call said. That estimate is down considerably since the first of the year.
A flight to quality has helped the American financial markets all year, but only the Treasury market benefited yesterday.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 average of Japanese stocks fell 1.3 percent yesterday. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index was off 5.72 percent, to its lowest level since Jan. 30, 1995. European stocks fell as well. In early trading today, Japanese stocks fell slightly and Hong Kong stocks were up a bit. Other Asian markets were little changed.
"Asia is a double-edged sword," said Charles Johnson, a managing director and head equity trader at Blaylock & Partners in Baltimore. The problems have dimmed the possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon -- stable or falling rates are generally viewed as positive for stocks -- but "the other edge is corporate profits," which are under pressure, Mr. Johnson said.
In uncertain times, United States Treasury securities are seen as a haven, and yesterday a surge in demand for bonds sent the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury to a record low of 5.58 percent.
The 207-point fall was the fifth biggest ever for the Dow, but in percentage terms, the 2.3 percent decline was not even among the 20 steepest declines. The Dow is still up 9.1 percent for 1998.
Some analysts said that the blue-chip stock gauge was merely beginning to reflect the declines already evident in the broader market.
The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology stocks, fell 29.30 points yesterday, to 1,715.75, a 1.68 percent decline. The index is now off 10.5 percent from its April 22 high. The Russell 2000 index, another broad gauge, fell 7.73 points yesterday and is now off 11.7 percent from its high on April 21.
"The overall stock market is acting much more poorly than the blue- chip indexes," said Steve Shobin, chief technical analyst at Lehman Brothers. "Yes, there's really a correction going on."
According to a Salomon Smith Barney study, through June 2, more than 43 percent of the stocks in the Nasdaq composite index have dropped 30 percent or more from their 52-week highs. That compares with 10.2 percent of S.& P. 500 stocks and almost 18 percent of stocks on the Big Board. During that period, the average drop in a Nasdaq stock has been 30.1 percent from its 52-week high.
When looking at stocks with price declines of at least 10 percent -- the usual measure of a correction -- the percentages are even higher. In Nasdaq stocks, 84 percent are down by that amount, as are more than 58 percent of S.& P. stocks and almost 69 percent of Big Board issues.
Mr. Shobin of Lehman Brothers said his indicators pointed to more trouble ahead. Fewer stocks are posting new highs now than in mid-April, he said, and trading volume is off. "Most corrections do not end until volume rises sharply," he said.

Stocks Fall to 3-Month Low On Growing Asian Concerns
The turmoil in Asia has sent United States stock markets tumbling, wiping out the gains of the last three months for the Dow Jones industrial average. Yesterday, the Dow fell 207 points, or 2.3 percent. Some other market gauges have fallen even more, suggesting what Wall Street calls a market correction -- a drop of 10 percent or more -- is under way.
Investors are increasingly concerned that the economic crisis in Asia has yet to reach bottom. Japan, which many hoped would be the region's savior, announced last week that its economy shrank sharply in the first quarter, amounting to its steepest decline since World War II. Page A1. 

Long-term Treasury rates fell to their lowest level in 30 years. The yield dropped to 5.58 percent, from 5.66 percent Friday. D12.
 
Sunbeam Dismisses Chief Executive
Albert J. Dunlap, who has gained a reputation as a turnaround artist by downsizing many companies, was dismissed as chief executive of Sunbeam. The board of Sunbeam, the consumer appliance maker, said that 1998 earnings would be much worse than anticipated and that outside directors had lost confidence in Mr. Dunlap's leadership. A1.

HEADLINE: $100 Million in Legal Services Funding Is Placed in Doubt by a Supreme Court Ruling

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
A sharply divided Supreme Court today cast constitutional doubt on state programs that generate $100 million a year for legal services for poor people by pooling the interest on some of the money that clients deposit for brief periods with their lawyers.
That interest is actually the property of the clients, the Court ruled in a 5-to-4 decision that raised, but did not answer, the question of whether channeling the money for legal services amounts to an unconstitutional "taking" of private property for a public purpose. 
 That question will now be answered by the lower Federal courts or by the Supreme Court as the case works it way back up through the legal system. Reaction today was sharply split over whether the Court's handling of the initial property question foreshadowed an eventual ruling that the program is unconstitutional.
The case, a challenge brought to the program in Texas by property rights advocates, represented the leading edge of a debate that has taken place largely out of the public eye but that has galvanized the organized bar in support of programs.
It is also the latest chapter in the long-running, ideologically charged battle over the fate of publicly funded legal services programs, which conservatives in Congress have been trying to kill or curb sharply for the last 20 years. According to a brief filed by the American Bar Association, money generated by the programs is second only to the Federal Government as a source of funding for legal services, accounting for as much as a quarter of the legal services budgets.
The Court split along ideological lines. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by his four most conservative colleagues: Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.
In declaring the interest to be clients' property, the Court rejected arguments put forward by the chief justices of all 50 states, the American Bar Association, 35 state attorneys general, and numerous government groups. These groups argued that properly understood, the interest should not be seen as the clients' property because it would be nonexistent, eaten up by transaction costs, except for the pooling arrangement that courts and legislatures in all states have adopted under a program known as Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts.
The idea for the program, usually referred to by its initials as Iolta, began in Australia in the 1960's. Its adoption in the United States was delayed until 1980, when Congress first authorized banks to pay interest on checking accounts for certain types of depositors. Before then, lawyers typically deposited short-term client funds, like escrow or settlement deposits, in non-interest bearing accounts.
Once interest-bearing checking accounts became available, the American Bar Association and other lawyers' groups were quick to promote adoption of the Australian idea of directing the pooled interest to legal services. They reasoned that for clients, the interest was largely theoretical in any event, because the costs of opening an account and dealing with tax forms would quickly cancel out the earnings from all but sizeable deposits. When actual net interest to a client was a possibility, that client's deposit would not be pooled, but would go into an individual account for the client's benefit.
The Texas Supreme Court adopted an Iolta program for the state in 1984. All states now have the programs, which flourished at the same time that Congress was cutting the budget of the Legal Services Corporation and placing restrictions on the types of cases that lawyers who work for the federally funded programs can bring.
The case against the Texas program was brought by a conservative public interest law firm, the Washington Legal Foundation. It challenged the program both as an unconstitutional taking of private property and as a form of compelled support for causes not of a client's choosing, in violation of the First Amendment. That aspect of the case was not before the Supreme Court but can be renewed in the lower court proceedings that will follow today's ruling.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, in his majority opinion today in Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, No. 96-1578, applied a rule of English common law that "interest follows principal." Because there was no dispute that the principal on deposit was the property of the client, the Chief Justice said, it followed that "any interest that does accrue attaches as a property right incident to the ownership of the underlying principal."
This was the case, the Chief Justice continued, even if at the end of the day there was no net interest for the client to receive. "We have never held that a physical item is not 'property' simply because it lacks a positive economic or market value," he said, adding that: "The government may not seize rents received by the owner of a building simply because it can prove that the costs incurred in collecting the rents exceed the amount collected."
Whether the use of the property was a "taking" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment or, if so, whether any "just compensation" would be due to the clients, were questions for another day, the Chief Justice said.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Souter objected that the Court had announced "an essentially abstract proposition" that "may ultimately turn out to have no significance" in resolving the ultimate constitutional question. If the amount of "just compensation" turned out to be zero, he said, "there would be no practical consequence" to having recognized a property right in the first place.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, which found the interest to be property in its 1996 ruling but stopped short of deciding the other questions, will now consider the case again. "We're 90 percent of the way home," Richard Samp, the Washington Legal Foundation's chief counsel, said today in predicting that his group would win the next phase.
The program's supporters were more tempered in their predictions. Jerome J. Shestack, president of the American Bar Association, said in an interview that Iolta programs were "more vulnerable, but still alive" under the ruling today. Mr. Shestack speculated that if there had been a solid five votes on the Court to decide the ultimate issue against the programs, the majority would probably have done so now rather than preserve the issue for another day.
