HEADLINE: Anger Grows in Middletown Over Teachers' Strike 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS and ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, N.J., Dec. 6 

 BODY:
At first, it felt like a snow day in June.
 But one week into a strike that has thrown 10,500 students out of class and 228 teachers behind bars, frustration is turning to anger in this New Jersey town, which not long ago gained international attention as having one of the largest Sept. 11 death tolls. 
 With no resolution in sight, the Middletown teachers' strike is emerging as one of the most bitter and disruptive local labor battles in recent years. Union officials say the mass jailing of teachers is the first in this country since 1978 and represents the first time in two decades that New Jersey teachers have been incarcerated for walking off the job. 
Picketing teachers have been booed and cursed by passing drivers; death threats have flooded the local school board office; and at least four educators, disgusted by the court proceedings, have resigned on the spot rather than go to jail.
Parents have become increasingly infuriated by the demands of caring for idle children. Several have vowed to pull their children out of Middletown's school system. "Let them stay in jail," said Stephanie Billings, 27, a mother of two who grew up here. "We're just sick of this. They broke the law. Now they have to pay the price."
With an additional 99 teachers ordered jailed today and the distrust and bitterness mounting, those on both sides of the issue say they are stunned by how quickly a contract dispute turned into a nationally televised civil war.
Defiant teachers, cuffed wrists thrust in the air, liken their cause to the 1960's struggle for civil rights. Before she was led away by police officers on Wednesday, Barbara Guenther, a history teacher, told a Superior Court judge why she was defying his back-to-work order. "I try to teach my students this country is fair and just," she said as many of those in the courtroom cried. "In this process, the law is not fair and just. Sometimes good people have to stand up to fight an unjust law."
The pace of contempt-of-court hearings increased today, with a third judge added to the proceedings. All three judges increased the amount of jail time given to striking teachers, in some cases doubling sentences to two weeks. Judge Clarkson S. Fisher Jr., who has been presiding over the case since Nov. 29, said he was prepared to impose even harsher penalties if the teachers did not return to work.
Saying that "more onerous sanctions" might be necessary, he seemed to be threatening the mass firings requested by the Middletown school board.
The strike has been troubling for students, especially those who have watched news broadcasts showing teachers being led to jail. "It made me very sad," said Samantha Tartaro, 17, who wept when she saw her favorite elementary school teacher in handcuffs. "I like my teachers. I don't want them to be in prison."
But in more than two dozen interviews this week, parent antipathy toward the striking teachers was nearly unanimous. Citing a troubled economy and soaring layoffs, many said they thought the teachers were asking for too much. "A good teacher can never be paid enough, but the truth is they're the highest paid in Monmouth County and I don't know any employer these days that gives full benefits," said Bonnie Acosta, 43, whose daughter, Maggie, is a ninth grader. "Maybe they should travel to the Bronx or Bed-Stuy and see those schools. Then they'll realize they have a gem of a job." 
Some parents said they had supported the teachers' demands until they went on strike. Working parents like Jo-Ann Werner said they were too overwhelmed by child care concerns to worry about the teachers' monetary needs. A mother of two who works full time as a secretary, Ms. Werner said she and her husband were tired of juggling time off or asking relatives to baby-sit for their daughters, 6 and 15, during the day. At the same time, their home has become a neighborhood hangout for other displaced children.
"The first day it was great, but I've got seven kids eating me out of house and home," she said. "They're bored and I'm losing my mind. I've had enough of this strike." 
The main sticking point between the union and the board is health benefits. Teachers and secretaries currently pay a $250 annual flat fee for family health benefits and up to a $1,400 deductible. The board wants union members to pay a percentage of their health care premiums. 
But many teachers say their walkout has more to do with dignity than dollars. Over the years, and especially during a week-long strike in 1998, union members have said they have been treated poorly by the district, which, with 17 schools, is the largest in Monmouth County. The struggle, many believe, is also about fighting a board intent on breaking the union. 
Jennifer Loughlin, a literature teacher who resigned today rather than go to jail, said she would seek a job in another district. "I'm totally disheartened by the treatment of the Board of Education and the lack of support for teachers in our community," she said as she left the courthouse in tears. "I can't continue to work in a district that has no respect for us."
Incarceration is clearly having the desired effect on some of the strikers. Today, for the first time, eight women came before the court asking to be let out of jail. One woman was desperate to go to her son's wedding, another said the stress of detention had worsened her high blood pressure and another fretted about the 2-month-old daughter she had left with her 72-year-old father. 
Judge Fisher set them free, although he ordered one of the women to return to jail on Monday, after the marriage of her son.

 BODY:
 The European Central Bank left its main interest rate unchanged, a decision that was widely expected one month after it slashed rates by half a percentage point in the face of strong pressure to stimulate the Continent's sagging economy. The central bank has made only 4 rate cuts this year, in contrast with 10 by the United States Federal Reserve Bank. The European bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, said, "The conditions are there for economic growth to improve in the course of 2002."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN; 
U.S. Official Praises China for Its Cooperation in Rooting Out bin Laden's Terror Network

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
A top American antiterrorism official wound up two days of talks here today by praising the Chinese for their cooperation in fighting Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network, and said he was hopeful that the F.B.I. would soon be allowed to open a liaison office in Beijing.
 "The Chinese share our resolve to shut down the global terror network linked to Osama bin Laden," said the official, Gen. Frank Taylor, who became the State Department's ambassador at large for counterterrorism after his retirement from the Air Force. "We're pleased with the cooperation we have received from China since Sept. 11." 
 Still, it appeared that the scope of collaboration against global terror might be limited. General Taylor said that his meetings with senior foreign policy, military and banking officials here focused on the immediate struggle against Mr. bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda.
He said he did not raise broader issues -- on which agreement was less likely -- like extending the antiterror battle to Iraq, which the United States suspects is trying to develop weapons of mass destruction, or trying to shut down the Hamas organization in the Middle East.
Also, General Taylor said he made clear that the United States would not support Beijing's effort to paint Uighur Muslim nationalists in China's Xinjiang region as terrorists. China has been criticized for trampling on people's rights as it tries to stamp out ethnic separatism in the region, but Chinese officials insist that Uighur militants have received outside training and aid. 
Some Uighurs had been discovered with the Taliban forces in Afghanistan, General Taylor said, and some have committed acts of violence inside China. But he said that "the legitimate economic and social issues" facing people in northwest China "need political solutions, not counterterrorism." 
"The United States hasn't changed its values," he said. "We continue to hold very dearly our concern in areas such as human rights." 
In any case, General Taylor said, "our focus now is in rooting out Al Qaeda, and we've got a lot of work to do." He said the United States believed that the group had cells in more than 50 countries, but declined to say whether these included China. 
General Taylor said the main contribution by China so far had been in the diplomatic arena -- especially its cooperation in passage of a strong resolution in the United Nations and its support for the creation of a new government in Afghanistan.
He said that a bilateral working group had been set up to improve vigilance in the financial sector, but that there was no evidence that terrorist groups had deposited money in Chinese banks. The two countries have also established channels for sharing information and intelligence on terrorist activities and have agreed to hold formal antiterrorism consultations twice a year.
General Taylor said the Chinese had promised to give "positive consideration" to the American request to open a legal attache office in the American Embassy here, which would be run by the F.B.I. Similar offices in Moscow and elsewhere have aided the efforts of law enforcement agencies against organized crime, money laundering and other criminal activities.

2 Big Chip Makers Raise Forecasts

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Intel and Advanced Micro Devices raised their financial forecasts for the current quarter today, saying that their microprocessors that power personal computers were selling better than expected. 
 The two companies, leading competitors in the PC chip market, said that computer makers had bought more of their newest chips than projected in October. 
 Though corporations continued to show frugality in their spending, analysts said, retail shoppers had begun to open their wallets again during the holiday season and buy computers. 
Intel, the world's largest chip maker, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it expected sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion in the quarter -- an increase over its October estimate of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion. Intel shares, which fell 45 cents, to $34.16, before the announcement, rose as high as $35.22 after hours. 
Surprising demand for the Pentium 4, its newest line of chip, contributed to the new forecast, Intel said. Andy D. Bryant, the chief financial officer, said the company was making all the Pentium 4 chips it could, but acknowledged that its factories could not keep up with orders. "Right now supply is tight," Mr. Bryant said in a conference call with analysts. "We're doing all we can to meet our customers' needs." 
Despite the shortages, Mr. Bryant said he saw a return to normal business patterns this quarter, if at lower levels. As in most years, he said, the number of microprocessors shipped in Asia and Europe will increase over those in the third quarter while the North and South American market will remain roughly flat. 
Many chip industry executives and analysts think the bottom in a precipitous sales decline occurred in September, when revenue fell 44 percent compared with September 2000. While Intel's announcement offered evidence to support that notion, Mr. Bryant cautioned analysts that a return to boom times depended on an economic turnaround. "The economic indicators remain weak," he said, "and we will continue to be cautious until we see a recovery in the worldwide economy." 
Intel and Advanced Micro have conducted a punishing price war that cuts heavily into both their profits. Intel said increased shipments, more than higher prices, would enable it to meet or slightly exceed its gross profit margin projections. 
But Advanced Micro, which holds about 22 percent of the desktop market, said today that the average selling price of its chips increased during the quarter, boding well for improved profit. 
The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it expected revenue to increase 10 percent or more from last quarter, when it reported revenue of $765 million. Trying to recover from a steep loss last quarter, the company indicated that sales of its PC chips had risen sharply after the introduction of its Athlon XP microprocessor, which some say outperforms more expensive Pentium 4 chips. 
Advanced Micro said it expected PC chip revenue in the fourth quarter to exceed its previously strongest period, the first three months of 2001, when the figure was $661 million. For that to happen, PC chip sales must sharply improve from last quarter's $467 million.
An Advanced Micro spokesman, John Greenagel, said, "The entire story of the quarter right now is proving to be the Athlon XP processor." The company said it expected to turn a profit again in the second quarter of next year, when the full effect of factory closings and job cuts is felt.
A.M.D. stock rose one cent, to $16.25, in the regular session. After hours, it traded as high as $18.
Analysts cautioned against using today's forecasts as a benchmark for the health of the PC industry. 
Eric Rothdeutsch, a managing director with Robertson Stephens, said Advanced Micro benefited from the price and performance of its Athlon XP chips compared with Intel's offerings. As for Intel, he said a better-than-expected transition to the higher-priced Pentium 4 chips had increased sales figures, adding that Intel had been too cautious in its original projections. 
"I would not extend this to say there is robust PC demand," Mr. Rothdeutsch said. --------------------

Sun Says It's on Track
PALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 6 (Bloomberg News) -- Sun Microsystems said here today that its orders this quarter were coming in as expected, yet it declined to predict if revenue would meet forecasts because so much business comes at the end of the period.
Sun, whose servers power Internet sites and corporate networks, said that work force reduction costs would result in a charge of at least $500 million this quarter. Sun's chief financial officer, Michael Lehman, said the company still expected to return to profitability in the fourth fiscal quarter ending next June.
Sun shares fell 42 cents, to $14.15, in regular session trading today and settled at $14.18 after hours. 
The company is expected to have a loss, excluding certain costs, of 4 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Sales are forecast at $3.08 billion.

HEADLINE: Auction Houses Are Set Back By Conviction In Price-Fixing 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
When Sotheby's and Christie's first conspired in the mid-1990's to fix the commission rates charged to sellers at their auctions, they were reacting, at least in part, to a desperate financial situation.
 In the throes of fierce competition, both auction houses were hemorrhaging money by promising the sellers commission-free deals, multimillion dollar financing, black-tie parties, elaborate vanity catalogs and donations to their favorite charities. 
 Now, after the conviction of Sotheby's former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, on Wednesday for his pivotal role in the conspiracy -- designed to illegally stifle the competition and reap millions for the venerable companies -- the economic situation for the houses looks many times worse.
Seldom has a scheme seemed to yield as little, in the end, for its participants as this one has. The $4 billion a year high-end auction business, controlled for centuries by the two companies, finds itself more cash-strapped than ever. 
Both companies have had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in legal settlements, lawyers' fees, and, in Sotheby's case, fines stemming from the collusion.
They are also facing a shaky economy with a dwindling supply of multimillion-dollar art coming on the market, an upstart competitor with deep pockets poking at their duopoly, and reputations that might have been deeply damaged by the scandal and seamy revelations that emerged during Mr. Taubman's 16-day trial in Manhattan federal court.
While Christie's is privately held by Francois Pinault, the French luxury-goods millionaire, Sotheby's, publicly traded, was again the talk of sales rumors yesterday. Although a spokesman for Mr. Taubman said he had not begun to actively consider selling his still-controlling interest in the company, it has passively been on the market for several months.
Ronald Baron, chairman of the Baron Fund and Sotheby's largest outside shareholder, said in his annual report on Sept. 30 that he would probably sell his Sotheby's holdings next year. 
Financial analysts do not consider auction houses a desirable investment now. "The problem is profitability," said James M. Meyer, chief investment officer of Tower Bridge Advisers, a Pennsylvania investment firm. "Auction houses are a trophy franchise."
A possible buyer, he said, could be Phillips de Pury & Luxembourg, the newly aggressive No. 3 in the auction world. "A potential buyer has to be either Phillips, who has been throwing millions of dollars into buying its way into the art world, or someone like Taubman, who wants to buy their way into a powerful position in art and social circles." 
But there are some art-world observers who believe memories are short and that the bruises Sotheby's and Christie's are experiencing will quickly fade, particularly given that they remain the biggest game around for the sale of high-priced art and furnishings.
Other observers, though, are not as optimistic. They believe that after one of the biggest art world scandals in decades, the halcyon days of the glamorous auction world will never be the same. 
"There's going to be skepticism in the auction industry for some time," said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University. 
But he and others pointed to the sophistication of the auction houses' customers and their commitment to the auction mechanism as the best way to do business. These factors, they say, could help the companies right themselves and carry on.
"Auctions are still the best way of determining fair market value," said Alexander Forger, a lawyer with Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, who was an executor of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate, which was sold at Sotheby's in 1996 for $13.1 million. "There's no question of the validity and integrity of public auction."
Mr. Taubman and his protegee and chief accuser, Diana D. Brooks, may face prison terms of up to three years, but for the auction market, Mr. Forger said, the trial, "was just a bump in the road."
The companies, which have been dismissing staff members, now have under 2,000 employees each worldwide. They each generate about $2 billion worth of sales annually.
A large part of their sales are built on personal relationships that their experts have nurtured over the years with the world's richest collectors.
Their stock in trade is the establishment of a trust that allows a client to feel comfortable selling a multimillion-dollar art collection through a particular expert and house.
Throughout Mr. Taubman's trial, though, details of secret negotiations and other matters cast the houses' reputations for probity in a dubious light. There were secret meetings in the back seat of Ms. Brooks's car at Kennedy International Airport and at Mr. Taubman's apartments in London and New York to discuss competitive matters, including raising and fixing commission fees to sellers so that they were non-negotiable.
And even after top officials from the companies shook hands on a corrupt deal, they often cheated on it to take business from each other. 
Four people were admitted or indicted conspirators -- Ms. Brooks and Mr. Taubman from Sotheby's and Sir Anthony Tennant, the former chairman of Christie's, and Christopher M. Davidge, Christie's former chief executive. Sir Anthony, indicted with Mr. Taubman, refused to travel from London to stand trial.
But according to trial testimony, others in the two houses had also discussed fixing fees. Mentioned in testimony were the jewelry experts John Block, a former head of jewelry at Sotheby's who is now chief executive for Phillips in North America, and Francois Curiel, who is chairman of Christie's in Europe. They were identified in testimony as having discussed increasing buyers' fees in 1992.
Another former Sotheby's employee now on the board of Phillips, Lord Camoys, also wanted to enter into the collusion, according to Ms. Brooks' testimony. He talked to Sir Anthony about meeting to discuss commission rates, and when Ms. Brooks found out she stopped him. 
(Simon de Pury, chairman of Phillips, said yesterday that he declined to comment about the fate of Mr. Block and Lord Camoys. Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, declined to discuss Mr. Curiel's future at Christie's, saying only, "We do not comment on any internal personnel matters.") 
The trial's damage to Sotheby's and Christie's did not stop with fixing fees. Discretion is an important part of how the houses do business. Yet throughout the trial details of agreements with prominent collectors were projected on a large screen for jurors to evaluate and others were mentioned in testimony. 
Most details were used to underscore the fact that even after officials at Sotheby's and Christie's had agreed among themselves to stop negotiating sellers' commissions along with certain kinds of financing, they went ahead with that sort of dealmaking as if they had never made the commitment.
During the trial, highly confidential consignment agreements for major estates, including those of Mrs. Onassis and Pamela Harriman, a political personality and a United States ambassador to France, are now a matter of public record. 
Who knew that in 1995, when Christie's agreed to sell property belonging to Mrs. Harriman, it had agreed to give her a $14 million guarantee, regardless of the outcome of the sale, and to cover the tab for shipping and insuring the art. The deal, according to the once-private consignment agreement, also included a promise to feature her $10 million to $15 million Picasso on the cover of its Impressionist and modern art sales catalog. 
Even though the sale is six years old, this information is most useful to other potential sellers as they approach both houses.
To win the Onassis estate, Sotheby's waived its seller's commission unless the sale totaled $10 million, after which point it would share a portion of the profits above that figure. The auction house also agreed to give the executors a say in the photographs to be used in the catalog and the way the property would be exhibited at Sotheby's.
Some observers said the damage from the release of the details from these sales could be contained, mostly because auction house customers still had few other places to turn.
"Some people may be horrified that these arrangements are now out in the open, but everybody knows special deals were struck," said William B. Warren, a lawyer at Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood. There were also the mystery loans made by Ms. Brooks that were revealed. One for $240 million, made in 1998 and identified by a Sotheby's code name -- the flower loan -- went to Wolfgang Flottl, a Austrian-born financier who had been a major buyer and seller at auction for years.
Ms. Brooks made another loan, for $105 million, a year later, according to the testimony of William S. Sheridan, Sotheby's chief financial officer. And his story painted an unflattering picture of ineptitude.
At the time, a mystery telephone bidder known simply by his paddle number, L036, went on a shopping spree at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art in May 1999, buying works by Monet, Rodin and Signac. At its sale of art from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the philanthropist and socialite, the buyer bought a $60.5 million Cezanne. 
But, according to testimony, the loan, which was extended so that the bidder could make the acquisitions, was not repaid in a timely manner. 
After the sale, Sotheby's sold the Cezanne at a loss to Stephen A. Wynn, the casino owner. 
Until the details of the loan surfaced in court last week, information about the buyer was scant. Mr. Sheridan declined to identify him other than to say that he had never bought million-dollar art before and had a rich mother.
Days later, according to officials at Sotheby's, one buyer who met Mr. Sheridan's description was William Gerry, from Locust Valley, N.Y. A call to his house was answered by a housekeeper who said he was out of the country for four or five months and she did not know where he was. 
There are many in the art world who believe that the auction houses, scarred and policed as never before, have learned their lesson. 
But they also face a new era of unbridled and intense competition. Perennial No. 3, Phillips boasts deep pockets from its parent company, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. As long as Phillips is willing to buy $100 million worth of art to sell at auction each spring and fall, said Mr. Meyer, the financial adviser, that takes away business from Sotheby's and Christie's.
Hurting Sotheby's bottom line will not make it more attractive to a potential buyer of Mr. Taubman's holdings, he said, or to those of Mr. Baron, the large shareholder.

HEADLINE: Competing for Better Government 

BYLINE:  By Stephen Goldsmith; Stephen Goldsmith, mayor of Indianapolis from 1992 to 1999, is chairman of the Manhattan Institute Center on Civic Innovation and professor of public management at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.

 BODY:
My first week as mayor of Indianapolis, I visited angry sanitation workers threatening job actions because of my pledge to privatize municipal services. Soon those threats turned to picketing, demonstrations and occasional sabotage by union workers.
 Yet just five years later, both the union and I were joint recipients of an award for cooperation. Knowing how we turned this situation around might prove helpful to Michael Bloomberg and New York City's unions as they struggle with declining revenues and an increased need for city services. 
 Both city officials and union leaders need to recognize that a city cannot grow economically, and public employees cannot succeed, if a city's tax base flees, if poverty becomes more concentrated and if the quality of public services declines.
In Indianapolis, I distributed to city employees unflattering advertisements about our city that had been paid for by economic development officials in neighboring communities. To my surprise, the president of the Indiana state chapter of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees understood the need for change. He was open to the idea of competition, if not necessarily privatization.
Simply put, bureaucratic monopolies are bad for taxpayers and bad for public employees. When government insists that competition is off limits, it communicates to public workers that they are inferior. Competition creates the conditions for increased productivity and new partnerships in which the private sector provides some functions while public employees concentrate on what they do best -- and where they are most needed.
For example, in many cities and states today, private companies are contracted to do "back-office" work like collecting parking-ticket revenue, processing toll-road payments or operating print shops. This allows more money to go to more visible public workers like police and firefighters. The aim is not to privatize the work for the sake of privatization, but to serve the public better with existing resources.
Of course, this sort of transition may mean some shifts in the work force. Private contractors for public services often hire city workers, but not always all of them. To win support for change, city leaders must pledge to do what they can to minimize immediate forced layoffs.
Demographic trends may make this goal more realistic. As the first baby boomers reach retirement age, the size of the public sector work force will decline. Thus there will be a natural opportunity to put more functions out for bid while also thinning the ranks of the public sector, making it more productive.
This process is not easy. Incentives for early retirement help, as does outplacement assistance. But most important is a commitment from city hall to put as many displaced workers as possible in other public jobs. This requires both union and management leadership to rethink seniority rules, job classifications, pay scales and other issues, for they all affect employee mobility.
This kind of transformation will depend on a motivated work force that is allowed to make its workplace decisions. Rigid job descriptions, layers of unnecessary middle management and lack of authority often prevent workers from being efficient and effective. Pay systems and work rules must be structured to allow for -- and to reward -- productivity.
Smart unions understand this. In Indianapolis, we asked our garage mechanics to bid against private contractors for city business. They agreed, and their bid included a proposal to thin the ranks of management by 75 percent and to share in any profits of the new arrangement. They won the contract, and as a result they had an incentive to increase productivity -- and profits -- by absorbing the work of colleagues who were retiring.
None of this can work well unless there is a spirit of trust and cooperation between labor and management. Too often in the public sector, these relationships become little more than a framework for grievances and lawsuits. In Indianapolis, we chose another way. Our labor-management team addressed many issues unrelated to compensation, from race relations in the workplace to equipment safety. Regular meetings between top union and city officials, including the mayor, helped ensure that middle managers understood that we were on the same team.
The private contractor that won the bid to operate our wastewater treatment plant, for example, agreed to work in partnership with the public employees union. Together they produced a remarkable record over five years, increasing pay and minority subcontracts and virtually eliminating grievances and accidents.
New York City, of course, is not Indianapolis. The New York Police Department alone, with almost 50,000 employees, is about seven times the size of the entire Indianapolis municipal work force. But Mr. Bloomberg need not reinvent the entire city government at once. And the principles we applied in Indianapolis are equally valid in New York.

HEADLINE: Giuliani to Appeal Decision On a Work-for-Shelter Policy 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Nearly two years ago, a state judge ruled that the Giuliani administration could not bar adults from shelters if they failed to meet work requirements and other welfare eligibility rules. 
 Now, with less than a month left in the term of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, his administration has filed notice in court that it will appeal the judge's order. 
 The move, which gives the city nine months to complete an appeal, comes at a time of record population in the city's homeless shelters, rising unemployment, and the end of federal welfare benefits for thousands of families. And it could force the incoming administration of Michael R. Bloomberg to take a stand on a Giuliani-era policy that was roundly criticized. 
Steven Banks, the Legal Aid lawyer for the Coalition for the Homeless, said the filing on Tuesday had created "a human hot potato for the incoming administration."
"In a city still trying to recover from the reverberations of Sept. 11," he said, "it certainly seems like certain lame duck officials are attempting to leave a legacy of a policy that would deny and terminate shelter for very vulnerable New Yorkers."
Mr. Bloomberg declined through a spokesman, Jerry Russo, to comment yesterday. 
The ruling the city is appealing applied only to single adults, but lawyers for the homeless have argued successfully that it also should prevent the city from ejecting homeless parents from shelters and putting their children in foster care if they fail to meet the stringent welfare requirements. 
An appeal revives the underlying debate: Should shelter, as a 1981 consent decree maintains, be the ultimate safety net for those so poor, troubled or "socially dysfunctional" that they slip through the cracks of other systems? Or, in an age of welfare reform aimed at ending dependency, should shelter be governed by the same work rules and eligibility conditions as public assistance?
In his February 2000 ruling, Judge Stanley L. Sklar of State Supreme Court in Manhattan wrote: "The simple bureaucratic error which might send an individual out into the street, because he or she was unable to understand or to cooperate with these requirements might be the error which results in that individual's death by exposure, death by violence, or death by sheer neglect. The risk is simply too great to take." 
At the time, the mayor vowed to appeal and predicted a quick reversal of the decision, which he explained as "Justice Sklar clinging to his desire for a city of dependency." Instead, the city seemed to shelve efforts to modify the consent decree, which is the bedrock of the city's right to shelter the truly homeless.
Martin Oesterreich, commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services, recently resigned to become executive director of the Liberal Party after his widely praised efforts to keep services going in the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks. Thomas Rozinski, acting interim commissioner, referred questions to City Hall, which did not return calls for comment.
City figures show an average nightly total of 29,480 people in the shelters as of mid-November, including 7,566 single adults, up from about 7,000 at this time last year, and 12,404 children in families, an increase of nearly 60 percent from 1998. 
The immediate concern of advocates for the homeless is a shortfall of beds for homeless men this winter. Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless, said that while cold weather typically drives an additional 500 homeless men to the shelters, the city has planned to add only 233 beds.
"When you deny shelter to a homeless person," he said, "that's a person that ends up on your sidewalk."

HEADLINE: Hitting The Trifecta 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Shortly after Sept. 11, George W. Bush interrupted his inveighing against evildoers to crack a joke. Mr. Bush had repeatedly promised to run an overall budget surplus at least as large as the Social Security surplus, except in the event of recession, war or national emergency. "Lucky me," he remarked to Mitch Daniels, his budget director. "I hit the trifecta."
 Lucky him, indeed. The Enron analogy will soon become a tired cliche, but in this case the parallel is irresistible. Enron management and the administration Enron did so much to put in power applied the same strategy: First, use cooked numbers to justify big giveaways at the top. Then, if things don't work out, let ordinary workers who trusted you pay the price. But Enron executives got caught; Mr. Bush believes that the events of Sept. 11 will let him off the hook. 
 Earlier this year Mr. Bush used projections of vast budget surpluses to push through a huge, 10-year tax cut. Most of that tax cut went to people with incomes of more than $200,000 per year. Now Mr. Daniels tells us that the budget -- not just the budget outside Social Security, but the whole enchilada -- will be in deficit through 2004. Since the administration's phony budget math ("fuzzy" just doesn't cut it at this point) gets phonier the further you go into the future, this means that we have effectively returned to a state of permanent deficit. 
However, with television busy reporting from the caves of Tora Bora, this revelation -- which shows that the tax cut was sold on utterly false premises -- wasn't even considered headline news.
Administration officials insist that the economic slowdown and the war on terror, not the tax cut, are responsible for the red ink. But this is flatly untrue: antiterror spending is a minor factor, and the persistence of projected deficits into the indefinite future tells us that it's not caused by the recession either.
Anyway, they're missing the point. Opponents of the administration's plan always warned that it was foolish to lock in a giant tax cut on the basis of hypothetical surplus projections. They urged, to no avail, that we wait to see the actual budget results. Now their warnings have proved prophetic -- and ordinary Americans will suffer because they were ignored.
The administration now says that the tax cut was necessary to fight the current recession. But nobody is questioning the $40 billion in rebates actually paid out so far, and few would complain about another round of temporary tax cuts for the year ahead. It's the huge further tax cuts that will take place after 2002 -- tax cuts that are now the law of the land -- that are the problem. But we're supposed to accept those future cuts as a fait accompli. Hey, Mr. Bush hit the trifecta.
Meanwhile, the return of budget deficits has real, nasty consequences. Prescription drug insurance is, of course, dead. Bolstering Social Security? Don't be silly: payroll tax receipts are being used neither to acquire assets nor to pay down federal debt; instead, they are subsidizing deficits in the rest of the government. 
And austerity rules, even in areas you might have thought were of the highest priority. Money to rebuild New York? Sorry, no. The government's own experts say we need $3 billion to guard against bioterrorism? Cut the number in half. Tax cuts are more important.
Meanwhile, state and local governments, savaged both by recession and by new security expenses, are firing teachers and slashing services. How about some revenue-sharing from the feds? Never mind.
Whenever they were asked, voters said that the "compassionate" parts of Mr. Bush's campaign promises -- securing Social Security, providing more money for prescription drugs and education -- were more important to them than tax cuts. But they were assured that there was enough money for everything. Those assurances were false -- but the tax cut is sacrosanct, while the rest is expendable. 
Mr. Bush could try to undo some of the damage, by canceling future tax cuts for the top income bracket. Instead, he wants to accelerate those cuts. That's the moral equivalent of the big bonuses Enron gave to executives just days before it went bankrupt.
Horse racing is a zero-sum game; so, it seems, is budget politics. Mr. Bush hit the trifecta; the great majority of Americans lost, big time.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Has His Doubts On Stadiums 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg expressed doubts yesterday about whether the city should agree to help pay for new stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets in the current fiscal climate.
 "We'd all like to have stadiums," he said. "The question is, how can we afford it?" 
 Building stadiums has been a dream of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, an avid baseball fan. Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he would do as much as possible to put deals together before leaving office at the end of the month, but acknowledged that the final decision would be Mr. Bloomberg's.
"I won't take away his option, long-term, of making the decision," Mr. Giuliani said. "I don't think it would be right."
In 1993, during his days as a mayor-elect, Mr. Giuliani was outraged when his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, signed off on a plan to build a stadium for his favorite sport, tennis, during the last month of his term. As mayor, Mr. Giuliani has avoided the product of that plan, the Arthur Ashe Stadium at the National Tennis Center in Queens. 
Earlier this fall, Mr. Giuliani pushed to forge baseball stadium deals. Then the World Trade Center was attacked and suddenly he had no time for stadium negotiations. Also, the city's weakening fiscal outlook made a large subsidy for such a structure more difficult to justify.
Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that he would look at the mayor's proposals for baseball stadiums, but added that he had to study whether taxpayer money should be used to help pay for them. 
"I think everybody understands we have to modernize our facilities," he said at a news conference, separate from one held by Mr. Giuliani. "We have to have the best facilities for sports, for entertainment. We have to have housing, we have to have schools, and there are conflicting needs." 
Mr. Bloomberg added: "I don't yet know the numbers, whether you could justify stadiums at this time. Clearly we're going into very difficult economic times, and we're going to have to make some choices, and it's just too premature for me to give you a definitive answer."

HEADLINE: House Supports Trade Authority Sought by Bush 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
The House today passed legislation that gives the Bush administration a stronger hand to negotiate trade agreements, awarding a hairbreadth wartime victory to President Bush that the same chamber twice denied the Clinton administration.
 Bush administration officials and Republican leaders squeezed their party ranks, relying on several longtime trade-wary lawmakers, one late vote switch, and the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, who often does not vote, to eke out the 215-214 victory. 
 Just before the vote, Mr. Hastert made an impassioned appeal on the House floor "not to undercut our president at the worst possible time," a plea that several lawmakers later said persuaded them to defy influential interests in their home districts to back Mr. Bush.
The bill was seen as an important test of Mr. Bush's political strength. He lobbied for it right up until the final vote, arguing that he needed it both on substantive grounds and to demonstrate American solidarity to foreign leaders. He passed the test, but just barely. 
If the bill is passed by the Senate, where support for trade is considered firmer, Mr. Bush will have so-called trade promotion authority, allowing him to reach foreign trade agreements that Congress can accept or reject, but not amend.
Administration officials argue that the new authority will help them negotiate global and regional accords to free trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and services. Without that power, they say, other countries might prefer to leave the United States out of trade agreements rather than see them subjected to Congressional tinkering.
"Trade Promotion Authority will give me the flexibility I need to secure the greatest possible trade opportunities for America's farmers, workers, families and consumers," Mr. Bush said after the vote. The president had spent much of the last three days lobbying House members in the White House and on Air Force One.
The United States has not reached any major multinational trade agreements since the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization were created more than seven years ago, when the president had what was then called fast-track authority. 
Congress denied President Bill Clinton enhanced negotiating authority twice in the late 1990's, though Mr. Clinton was able to negotiate commercial agreements with China, Vietnam, Jordan and other nations that Congress ultimately approved.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States Trade Representative, has worked all year to pressure Republican leaders and some reluctant administration officials to hold the vote, which many predicted would fail. Mr. Zoellick said the added authority would make it far easier to achieve the administration's two top trade priorities: broadening Nafta to include Central and South America and completing global trade talks that were started in Doha, Qatar, last month.
"The president has tried to restore momentum for trade," Mr. Zoellick said, "and this House has now given us the authority to do that."
Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the measure, as many generally pro-trade Democrats voted no. Many complained that the bill failed to mandate that trade agreements set labor and environmental standards as well as tariff and quota levels, a demand that reflects staunch opposition to traditional trade liberalization by unions and some environmental groups.
But Republicans managed to peel off enough Democratic support -- a total of 21 votes -- to make up for defections among their own party members. One factor was an eleventh-hour promise by House leaders to spend at least $20 billion to help the unemployed, many times what they had agreed to devote to post-Sept. 11 welfare assistance as recently as last week.
"It is an abomination that they would be bringing up all of these ideas for worker relief, as inadequate and poor as they are, in order to buy votes," said the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who led opposition to the bill and helped draft a Democratic alternative, said the Republican victory was Pyrrhic. Republicans, he said, failed to address deep-seated concerns about the direction of trade policy, potentially reducing chances of passing any trade agreements reached under the new authority.
"It's clear that Republican leadership was willing to offer other things that had nothing to do with the bill since they would not offer solid trade policy," Mr. Rangel said.
Multinational companies, including many high-tech firms, strongly supported trade authority, as did most major farm groups. Export-oriented industries expect that new trade agreements will make it easier to sell or produce goods in foreign markets. Some also hope that reciprocal tariff cuts by the United States will reduce import prices and help their bottom line.
A few major business lobbies called this the most important vote of the year. The Information Technology Industry Council, a lobbying group, told lawmakers that it would count their vote on trade authority twice when tallying how supportive they were to the high-tech cause -- potentially costing those who voted against the measure a lucrative source of campaign contributions.
But some Republican and Democratic lawmakers face pockets of intense opposition to trade accords in their home districts. Unionized workers and businesses that have been harmed by imports, including citrus, textile and steel producers, have mobilized against them. Many especially oppose giving the president open-ended authority to negotiate trade deals as he sees fit.
To overcome such resistance among Republicans, Mr. Bush and Republican leaders twisted arms through the final gavel. 
The administration put especially heavy pressure on several North Carolina and South Carolina Republicans. Representatives from those states often vote no on trade agreements because of strong textile interests at home. But their districts are also full of conservatives eager to support the president during a war.
Mr. Bush invited Cass Ballenger of North Carolina to dinner at the White House Wednesday night. Mr. Zoellick spent much of the afternoon talking to Robin Hayes of North Carolina. The two still professed that they would vote against the measure even as the floor debate began this afternoon.
But Mr. Ballenger hovered with party leaders in the well of the House chamber until the final moments, prepared to vote yes if Republicans needed his support to avoid defeat. They did, and he did.
"I felt it was my duty to support the president," Mr. Ballenger said afterward. "But I'll tell you it was not the smartest vote I've made in my life." Mr. Hayes also voted yes to help close the gap.
Even with those late recruits, Republicans were still at least a vote shy. With the time allotted for voting expired and Democrats shouting across the aisle to bring down the gavel, Mr. Hastert and other Republican leaders repeatedly circled Adam Putnam of Florida, urging the 27-year-old freshman to tow the party line. He ultimately voted no.
Asked how he felt afterward about choosing between the demands of citrus farmers and pressure from the president, Mr. Putnam said, "It made me want to throw up."
Ultimately the man who saved the day for Republicans was Jim DeMint of South Carolina. He first voted no, as he often has on trade issues. But with the tally at 214-214, he handed over a green card signaling that he would switch to yes. House leaders promptly declared the vote complete.

HEADLINE: Recent Events Recast Debate on Fuel Economy 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Domestic automakers argued against changes to federal fuel economy standards at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing today, but the events of Sept. 11 appear to have recast the usual debate about automotive fuel economy into one about national security as well as environmental concerns.
 Fuel economy standards "may now play a more significant role in our discussions regarding efforts to decrease U.S. dependence on the importation of foreign oil," said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. "I hope next year we can take some action," he added. 
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat, said, "We would be ill-advised, given the time and place, to do nothing." 
But what that action will be remains unclear in this initial hearing, which will seek to find a proposal on fuel economy to add to the Senate's energy bill.
Today, most auto industry officials argued against toughening corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards in the short term, and also argued against a bill proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat, and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, to close the regulatory disparity between passenger cars and light trucks. 
CAFE standards, first put into effect in the 1970's, currently require each automaker to average 27.5 miles per gallon on the passenger cars they produce and 20.7 m.p.g. on minivans, S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks. These standards have not been significantly altered in more than a decade and automakers are permitted to inflate their mileage figures by as much as 18 percent through various loopholes. 
During the hearing, the top official of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Jeffrey W. Runge, said his agency would begin looking at improving fuel economy again, after several years during which such research was not financed.
Mr. Runge said the agency's determinations would be aided by a recent study by the National Academy of Sciences that said a 40 percent fuel economy improvement could be made within 10 to 15 years, but Mr. Runge added that the earliest changes would probably not come until model year 2005. 
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who was chairman of the hearing, said the Senate would probably choose its own course. 
Officials at General Motors argued that short-term fuel economy requirements would impede the company's work on technologies like the fuel cell, a clean, hydrogen- powered system that many believe will eventually supplant the internal combustion engine. 
"CAFE is actually an obstacle to the realization of this vision," said Thomas J. Davis, group vice president of North American development for General Motors. 
"A near-term shift in CAFE pulls engineering resources back to incremental advantages in internal combustion engine systems and to reduction in vehicle power, weight and size," he added. 
But G.M. and other automakers, many of whom have produced prototypes of vehicles powered by fuel cells, have conceded that numerous hurdles remain to retrofitting an industry built around the internal combustion engine. 
"I think it's important for all of us to understand that some of the arguments we're hearing are very similar to arguments we were hearing when this program was first proposed" in the 1970's, said Senator Kerry. 
David Friedman, an engineer and analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group, told the senators, "Forty miles per gallon is possible with existing and emerging technologies."
"Increasing fuel economy standards to 40 m.p.g. in the next 10 years would be the most effective, fastest and least expensive path to reducing our future dependence on oil," Mr. Friedman added.
But even the Honda Motor Company, the most independent of the big automakers on environmental issues and one that did not openly oppose CAFE increases, said the 40 m.p.g., 10-year target was not feasible. 
A common argument against further fuel economy improvements, besides their potential expense, is that they make vehicles unsafe by making them lighter, and studies have indeed shown that -- while S.U.V.'s are not necessarily safer than passenger cars because of rollovers -- larger vehicles tend to be safer than smaller vehicles of the same type.
But many current technologies are not weight related, like hybrid electric-gasoline engines already used by Honda's Insight and by the Prius from Toyota Motor, improved engine valve or transmission technology, or even altered tire design. 
"The 1,800-pound Civic of the mid-1970's now weighs 2,600 pounds and gets 40 m.p.g. versus 32 m.p.g.," said Clarence M. Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety. 
It is too early to tell from today's initial hearing whether Sept. 11 or the new National Academy of Sciences report will be swing factors in the debate.
Several of the senators spoke of fuel economy in light of the conflict in the Middle East. Senator Snowe said the country currently imports 10 million barrels a day from abroad, much of it "from one of the most unstable regions in the world." 
"Two weeks ago OPEC was threatening to curb production in order to drive up prices. Fortunately for us, Russia thwarted that," she said.
Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said, "Mark my words, with everything that is going on in this world with regards to terrorism, sooner or later the terrorist is going to try to sink a tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, and when that occurs, and that free flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf ends, you're going to have another great energy crisis."
Senator McCain said Sept. 11 argued for both new CAFE standards and for drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.
"We need to address the issue, but exactly how is not clear," he added.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Selig Defends His Plan of Contraction to Congress

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Bud Selig, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, told the House Judiciary Committee today why baseball needed to eliminate two teams and why its economic system led to a $519 million loss last season.
 He tried to persuade Congress not to strip Major League Baseball of part of its antitrust exemption as it applies to team movement or contraction, as is being considered in a bill sponsored by Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan. 
 "Sounds like baseball is in a terrible fix," Representative Melvin Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, said.
"We have significant problems," Selig said. 
"It's in that fix despite having that antitrust exemption?" Watt said.
"Our economic problems are obvious," Selig said.
Watt, growing impatient, wondered why the commissioner simply could not personally impose a cure for his 30-team industry.
"What are you all waiting for?" he said, almost plaintively.
That brought Selig to his earnestly repeated mantra: he cannot expand revenue sharing or put a salary cap into effect without the approval of the players' union. So far, he has not been able to achieve approval for either.
The explanation did not satisfy Watt.
"So, you'll eliminate two teams this year, two the next year, two the next year and two the next year?" Watt said. "At what point will it stop?"
A little exasperated, Selig said: "It will take myriad solutions to fix our problems. Contraction is one of them."
While Selig received occasional tongue lashings from committee members -- one threatened the revocation of a cherished tax break if baseball did not fix its problems -- he was also chided several times by Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.
Ventura, another witness, governs the state that is home to the Twins, who lead the list of presumed contraction candidates. He has vowed not to consider public financing for a new Twins stadium unless baseball fixes its economics.
Selig testified that losing the antitrust exemption would rattle baseball's geographic stability, possibly leading to teams moving without any way for baseball to stop them.
But, Ventura said: "What's the difference between a team leaving in the middle of the night or being contracted and disappear? I don't see how eliminating these teams will change the system." He added, "I bet we'll be taken off the list" -- of contraction candidates -- "if we agree to build a new stadium, and some other teams will make the list."
Underlying some of the committee members' questions to Selig was the doubt that baseball had disclosed all of its financial figures, that there were profitable numbers lurking beneath baseball's public bottom line.
This suspicion was stoked by Conyers, the committee's ranking minority member, who complained that baseball did not deliver all the information he had demanded. The notion of not-so-full disclosure received more urgency when Steve Fehr, a player agent and outside counsel to the Major League Baseball Players Association, testified that baseball lawyers had threatened to seek penalties against the union if it discussed the specifics of baseball's financials.
"The problem is not the numbers on the page, but the numbers off the page," Fehr said. "If we could just give our analysis of baseball's financial information, you'd see a different situation. We're not being allowed to."
He said a confidentiality provision in the collective bargaining agreement prevented the union from discussing specifics. But a baseball official subsequently said that was not true, that the union could discuss anything that has been released publicly. Selig said that baseball did not, however, provide Conyers with information about current collective bargaining.
The severest challenge to Selig's insistence that the numbers fully and accurately reflected baseball's damaged economic model came from Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, who argued that the commissioner was not being cooperative.
"Despite having the antitrust exemption, you won't give us the information that you would sue the union if they would give it to us?" she said.
"You have all the numbers," Selig said.
"Let me remind you," Waters said, "you are under oath."
Selig escaped Waters's next level of anger when her time for questions expired.
All along, Selig insisted that the numbers were accurate.
"The idea that somehow what I have presented today is not an accurate picture of the industry's economics is utter nonsense," he said, adding that the union has had every team's audited statements since 1985, and all the revenue sharing audits done annually since 1997.
Selig was so adamant that the numbers had not been finagled with that he brought Mike DiLecce, the Ernst & Young partner in charge of Major League Baseball's audit, to a post-testimony news conference.
Selig scoffed at the notion that even the elite auditing firms could be wrong, as they were in Enron's financial collapse.
"I'm responsible for a lot," he told reporters, "but don't make me responsible for Enron. I have no idea what happened here. But I know our bankers don't doubt our numbers."

HEADLINE: Using Battle of Terrorism for Victory on Trade 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
President Bush won a major victory on trade in the House of Representatives today by updating a time-honored argument: Wartime is no time to undercut the president. This is especially true now, Mr. Bush and his allies argued, when the world is watching for any sign that an embattled America is pulling up its drawbridges.
 Like the outcome of the presidential race that ended a year ago next week, his margin of victory could not have been narrower. He won streamlined trade negotiating authority by only one vote, 215 to 214. Even getting that required his Republican allies on the floor of the House to twist arms after the official clock had run out. 
 But that single vote was enough to win a political battle that President Bill Clinton, fighting members of his own party, had twice lost. 
Perhaps more important, Mr. Bush has finally broken a political deadlock that has afflicted Washington for seven years, a deadlock over which branch of government -- the executive or legislative -- should have the greatest control over how the United States negotiates the rules of globalization. 
"This is one of those votes that is partly about substance, but also about power and perceptions of power," said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, and a veteran of the trade wars that have polarized Democrats and Republicans for the past two decades. "There was a perception that if the vote went against the president, he would be undercut, and we would be seen as withdrawing from the world. I don't think that was true but the perception was there."
Mr. Bush won for several reasons.
The first is that his argument about trade as a weapon against terrorism, while a stretch, actually worked. His trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, made the case that the war against terrorism hinges on building coalitions, and that coalitions in the modern world are built on trade first and ideology second. While it pains Mr. Bush's team to admit it, this is an echo of the argument Mr. Clinton made time and again. 
"The difference is that the war made it clear that we really do need coalitions," a senior White House official said. "Every argument has its context, and the context of this one was a war in which we clearly need the help of developing nations around the world."
Mr. Bush's use of the patriotism card bred more than a little resentment among Democrats. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, they have been in disarray about how to oppose the president on substantive issues without seeming out of tune with the bipartisan chorus of the times.
It was a testament to the emotional resonance of the trade issue that 189 Democrats voted against the president, even under the circumstances. The opponents and their allies in the labor and environmental movements have long argued that free trade accords simply encourage American companies to open factories in developing nations with little regard for the environment or minimum labor standards. 
(The 21 Democrats who voted for the bill were almost all members of a small coalition of Democrats who have tried, largely unsuccessfully, to cure the party's traditional allergy to free trade agreements.)
Still, Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat, tried at the last moment to reach a compromise with the White House about how to deal with those labor and environmental issues. He took to the floor to protest the White House's effort to paint opponents of the bill as unpatriotic. 
"We don't believe that under our government, and the democratic way that we expect to legislate," Mr. Rangel said, "that what we are doing is undercutting the president of the United States." 
Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, agreed, saying, "This debate is about trade, not about terrorism."
But the second reason that the Democrats lost is that they have yet to figure out a way to turn their fears of trade into an effective legislative strategy at home, or an effective foreign policy abroad.
The reality of the post-cold war era is that trade agreements have become the basic treaties negotiated among nations. That is why Mr. Bush is so eager to use his new authority to negotiate a Free Trade Area of the Americas: Like Mr. Clinton, he sees it as a way to cement the links among democracies, weak and strong. 
And so when individual agreements come up for a vote, they almost always pass because the strategic cost of defeating them is simply too high.
The evidence is overwhelming. Two years ago, Congress voted by a large margin to let China into the World Trade Organization, even though that meant ending the annual review of its human rights record. 
Just in the past 18 months, Congress has also approved trade accords with Vietnam, an old enemy that is gradually reintegrating with the West, and with Jordan, a rare economic success story in the Middle East. And it used a trade agreement with African nations -- even an accord riddled with protections for American industry -- to remake American relations with an entire continent.
"It was always the strategic arguments that made the difference in the end," Charlene Barshefsky, Mr. Zoellick's predecessor as trade representative, argued recently. "They are the only way to trump the other concerns."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE APPROPRIATIONS; 
Republicans in Senate Win Round on Curbing Spending

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Republicans won two early skirmishes tonight in their effort to block $7.5 billion in additional spending for domestic security and $7.5 billion in aid to New York, measures that provoked a veto threat from President Bush.
 By identical 50-to-48 votes, Democrats mustered majorities to designate those needs as "emergencies." But under Senate rules, they needed 60 votes. Had they won, they would have protected not merely the items themselves, but the entire military spending bill from a point of order that would kill it. 
 It was unclear how the issues would be resolved. Republicans planned to offer on Friday an amendment that would strip the extra $15 billion from the $352.6 billion measure. But the Democratic majority that held firm tonight, losing only Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, may also stick together on Friday. 
That result would leave the Republicans with the unpalatable alternative of making the point of order that would kill the whole Senate bill, a step that would conflict with their argument today that a military spending bill, including a 5 percent pay raise, was needed right away. It is not obvious whether they would be willing to go that far.
Under an early version of the amendment, which was withdrawn, New York would lose not only the $7.5 billion but also $2 billion elsewhere in the bill. Under the bill now, New York would get $17 billion, enough after $3 billion spent so far to meet the promise of $20 billion Congress and Mr. Bush made earlier. 
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said of both provisions, "There is no need for the money now." And he argued that it would look bad for the Senate to challenge the president when Mr. Bush had made his views clear. 
But Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said, "There is no time to wait when it comes to the homeland defense investments that are so important to us as we look at restoring confidence, restoring safety, restoring the kind of opportunities that we need in this country." He also contended that the spending would boost the economy. 
On the New York money, Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, said it was "an inexplicably absurd moment" for the Senate to debate whether what happened in his state was an emergency. 
New York's other senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton, said the state was rebuilding but added: "We can't do it without America's help. When New York City was attacked, America was attacked." 
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant minority leader, replied that the money would come eventually. "I think everyone in the Senate wants to help New York," he said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Clouds Loom for New York, But Bloomberg Stays Sunny

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The ballroom at the Waldorf-Astoria, where the Citizens Union was holding its holiday dinner the other night, was rustling with the concerns heard all around New York these days. The city's fiscal situation seemed as perilous as anyone could remember. Washington was resisting pleas for help. New York's government was in transition, and the region was on high terrorist alert again.
 Everyone in the room, shoulder to shoulder with veterans of government service, seemed apprehensive. 
 Everyone, that is, except Michael R. Bloomberg. 
"The best is yet to come!" he declared in a peppy and sunny speech that made it sound as if happy days were already here again. Mr. Bloomberg warned his audience against pessimism -- "There is always a danger of looking at the downside, of looking at the part of the glass that is not full" -- and made just one fleeting mention of the problems that will be piled on his new desk on Jan. 1.
As a rule, chief executives taking office during bad times begin their tenure by announcing just how bad they have found things. It is a tactic intended to lay the blame on the predecessor, insulate themselves from future damage and prepare constituents for unpopular decisions that, they hope, will be forgotten or forgiven before the next election.
"The days of wine and roses are over," Gov. Hugh L. Carey said in his first State of the State speech, in the midst of the state's 1975 fiscal crisis. George W. Bush took office suggesting that the seeds of a recession had been planted by Bill Clinton. 
Mr. Bloomberg has yet to do anything like that -- in fact, he has struck pretty much the opposite tone -- and it has become perhaps the most striking aspect of the style of this largely unknown man who will be New York's next mayor.
Indeed, despite considerable evidence that there is good reason to be worried and that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is leaving behind more than a few budgetary and management headaches, Mr. Bloomberg has been New York's cheerleader, pitting himself against a cast of Cassandras and sounding more optimistic than Mr. Giuliani himself. (And certainly more than his very gloomy fellow Republican in Albany, Gov. George E. Pataki.)
Democrats and Republicans alike, accustomed to the behavior of people who, unlike Mr. Bloomberg, have made a career in politics, have been intrigued by the mayor-elect's approach and have been waiting for him to begin preparing New Yorkers for what most fiscal experts believe will be a very difficult patch of years.
"What he's going through he's never gone through before," said William Eimicke, a political science professor at Columbia University. "He hasn't been in the game."
Professor Eimicke, who worked for Mr. Carey when he was governor, described himself as both surprised and charmed by Mr. Bloomberg's reaction to the fiscal problems he faces. E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative group, praised Mr. Bloomberg's approach, saying it was important for someone new to the job to display confidence in his ability to manage New York through these problems. 
Still, Mr. Bloomberg's unorthodox response is not without risks, both to his own political reputation and to his ability to manage the city in the years ahead. If he proves to be wrong in his measure of the severity of New York's difficulties, he may very well find himself absorbing the bulk of the blame for the kind of calamitous problems that many fiscal experts think his city is about to endure.
Mr. Bloomberg, after warning against alarmism now, may find it difficult to persuade New Yorkers to endure the kind of sacrifices that seem likely in the years ahead. In particular, his approach could make it much tougher for him to push the city's unions to accept the low- or no-raise contracts that fiscal experts say New York will need to negotiate.
"You run the risk of people not taking seriously the nature of the economic shortfall that's ahead," said Richard Schraeder, a longtime Democratic consultant who managed the mayoral campaign of Mr. Bloomberg's opponent, Mark Green. "That's the last thing that you want to do."
To a certain extent, Mr. Bloomberg's deportment suggests the constraints he must feel given the central role Mr. Giuliani played in getting Mr. Bloomberg where he is today. While Mr. Bush had no trouble assailing Mr. Clinton last year, it would arguably not be good form for Mr. Bloomberg to begin assailing the popular departing mayor who endorsed his candidacy, at least not quite this soon. "How would it look if he turned around and started to blame him for this situation?" said Hank Morris, a Democratic consultant. "It would seem impolite."
Mr. Bloomberg's demeanor is also very much in keeping with his fundamentally confident nature, evident to anyone familiar with his years at Bloomberg L.P. or who has read his autobiography. Mr. Bloomberg is not the kind of person who would want to begin his administration as the dark cloud to Mr. Giuliani's sun, or to do anything further to alarm New Yorkers who already are, understandably, on edge.
Mr. Bloomberg's political consultant, David Garth, who was at Mr. Carey's side in 1975, said he had not encountered a politician quite like Mr. Bloomberg. "To go through a campaign like this, when you're starting way behind, to come through that, it takes a hell of a lot of optimism," said Mr. Garth, who himself has a fairly dark view of the city's immediate future.
Some advisers say Mr. Bloomberg is simply expressing his genuine view of the city's fiscal situation, speaking more like the businessman he was than the politician he is. He is not alone in doing that. Mr. McMahon, for one, said he did not believe that the situation facing New York City was as bad as it was 25 years ago, noting, as Mr. Bloomberg has, the fundamentally strong nature of the city's economy before the Sept. 11 attack.
Some of Mr. Bloomberg's advisers, in discussing the candidate's measured reaction, argued that the attack on the World Trade Center and the extensive attention paid to the financial problems it has caused the city might spare Mr. Bloomberg from the obligation of delivering too much bad news to New Yorkers. 
In truth, these days Mr. Bloomberg is sounding quite a bit different than he did on the campaign trail. Before the attack, he presented a distressed view of New York's economy and argued that his business background made him particularly qualified to lead New York through an economic downturn. "It is going to be hard times and somebody has to manage it and somebody has to make decisions," he said in an interview on July 31.
After the attack, he switched his appeal in a significant way, saying that his experience in private enterprise qualified him to help lead New York in rebuilding its downtown.
Given that switch, there are a number of politicians who think that Mr. Bloomberg will eventually shift his tone, perhaps with his inaugural speech, in a way that would recollect Mr. Carey, who endorsed Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy. "What Carey did was he prepared the public for tough days ahead, and he did it in a forthright matter," said Raymond B. Harding, the head of New York's Liberal Party who at the time served as a senior adviser to the Democratic governor.
But Mr. Bloomberg's advisers said that as of now, there are no plans for such a speech. 
Professor Eimicke, one of a number of people who are watching with fascination the education and evolution of this new arrival to New York government, said he was increasingly confident that Mr. Bloomberg would stay this course, even if it hurt him politically in the long run. "Part of the reason he has succeeded his whole life," Professor Eimicke said, "is that he has a lot of confidence."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DOMESTIC FRONT; 
Ridge Promises Security Funds For States in Next U.S. Budget

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
A day after the nation's governors asked Congress for an immediate $3 billion to fight terrorism, Tom Ridge, director of homeland security, promised that President Bush's budget proposal next year would include "substantial down payments" to the states for security.
 Mr. Ridge spoke as questions of how much domestic security should cost after Sept. 11 have proliferated on Capitol Hill and as states, facing recession and budget shortfalls, are grappling with how to pay for new responsibilities to help guard borders, bridges, dams and nuclear power plants. 
 Mr. Ridge, in appearances before news executives and state legislators, assured local officials that they would be given federal help. But he did not indicate how much money the president would propose and he put the states on notice that they would have to share the costs.
"We can't do it all," he said. "The responsibilities and costs from area to area within homeland security have to be shared in this national system. But the federal government is prepared to step up and make some substantial down payments in the budgets ahead."
Mr. Ridge also set down a series of challenges to the states to adjust to the new concerns raised by terrorism. He called on them to examine whether they were running enough response drills and whether police officers and firefighters could communicate across localities. He suggested that the states upgrade computer security and asked whether they had cataloged the vulnerability of critical sites.
He spoke as officials at every level are beginning to grapple with what a long-term commitment to increasing security will mean and what it will cost. In a sign of the mood, the program for the meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures here was crammed with panels on topics like cyberterrorism, bioterrorism in the Capitol, disaster coordination and tourism recovery.
"Everybody's feeling their way," said Andrew Fleischmann, a Democratic state representative from Connecticut. "Everybody wants to do things that are helpful and figure out the constructive response. But nobody wants to do things that are unnecessary or redundant."
On Wednesday, the National Governors Association released a preliminary survey of domestic security costs, estimating that they would run the states $4 billion in the first year.
With states across the nation facing budget shortfalls, state lawmakers were also looking for suggestions that federal assistance would be forthcoming, asking for additional money for the Coast Guard and public health.
"Every state will have to be relying on federal funding," Dave Kleis, a Republican in the Minnesota Senate, said in an interview after Mr. Ridge had spoken. "It's essential."
Mr. Kleis said Minnesota had been particularly hard hit because it is a hub for Northwest Airlines, which is suffering a sharp drop in traffic.
Mr. Ridge did not include specific sums but said he was seeking more money in the budget proposal to help police forces and fire departments, to defend against bioterrorism and to share information on threats. He said he planned to produce a multiyear plan for domestic security.
"We know," Mr. Ridge told the lawmakers, "you will need financial support from the federal government and we plan to address that."

HEADLINE: A New Boom: Somewhere Over the Rainbow?; 
The Economic Evidence Is So Dismal, Yet the Forecasts Are So Hopeful

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The economy sinks, but the nation's forecasters grow more optimistic. A vibrant upturn is just around the corner, they insist, certain to arrive by spring. In the world of forecasting, the upturn has been just around the corner for months.
 Forecasts are often wrong. The economy has too many complicated moving parts, and despite all the sophisticated forecasting techniques, too little is known about how the parts interact. Any forecaster acknowledges as much. Yet the great majority persist in their optimism, magnifying the positive data and minimizing the layoffs, the rising unemployment rate, the outright refusal of business to invest, the numbing indebtedness of millions of Americans. 
 Listen, for a moment, to the optimism of John Lipsky, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, and one of America's most prominent forecasters. "Household incomes are growing more slowly, and that is a powerful negative," he said. "But October retail sales were strong, and that made it almost certain that consumption will accelerate in the fourth quarter." 
A leap of faith is required for such optimism, and such leaps of faith have been commonplace since the early 1970's, far outweighing pessimism -- even after the Labor Department's announcement yesterday that 800,000 jobs had disappeared in October and November, the most for a two-month period in 27 years. "These job losses are a consequence of prior weakness, not a reason for gloom looking forward," said Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics, a Wall Street forecasting operation.
For most of the past decade, a booming economy justified the optimism. So did good salesmanship. Many of the forecasters work for Wall Street investment houses, and their sunny readings of the daily economic data encouraged investors, helping to make stock prices surge. But in fact the optimism has much deeper roots, stretching back generations to theories and beliefs that originated in the earliest days of modern economics, in the 18th century. 
These theories and beliefs have outlasted the various doomsday pronouncements about capitalism's prospects. The fall of Communism and the decades of prosperity since World War II have only reinforced the faith in a free market system's in-born tendency to repair itself. The Depression, in this view, was a fluke, an accident, a result of mistakes.
And now, optimistic forecasting is swamping a minority view that the current recession, more than any of the nine others since 1945, could endure, dooming the economy to contraction or very sluggish growth for months or years. The recession is already eight months old, half the age of the longest downturns since the war. Japan's bleak experience -- a decade of virtually no economic growth -- suggests to some people that America, too, is not immune.
But so far the optimism entrenched in mainstream economics guides the forecasts, and they are persistently upbeat. "The consensus view sounds plausible to me; I have even been trying to get some funds back into the stock market," said Deirdre McCloskey, an economic historian at the University of Illinois in Chicago. "Still, I do not believe that economists understand the business cycle. I say to my mom, 'Don't worry, there will not be another Depression,' and she says, 'Why not?' And I say I don't really know why not."
Ms. McCloskey's faith -- and the concensus forecast -- have their origins in the writings of Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist in the early 1800's, who gained fame as a popularizer of Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations," capitalism's seminal treatise, published in 1776. A "law of markets" that bears Say's name is still the theme song for those who count on the economy to repair itself. Say himself never wrote or uttered or fully subscribed to what came to be known as Say's law, which is expressed in just five words: "Supply creates its own demand."
That is being tested in the current recession. Too much supply, particularly in the high-tech sector, brought the economy down. (The stock market sell-off also helped.) Companies found themselves producing more goods and services than consumers demanded. So they cut way back on spending for the tools of production -- computers, machinery, factories, trucks, office space. And the downturn commenced.
Something similar happened in the Depression, and Say's law failed to kick in. But overcapacity was much greater in the 1930's, economists today contend. This time the excess is less and is already disappearing. Computers are becoming obsolete, vehicles are wearing out, older factories are being closed. Soon corporate America will be motivated to step up investment.
The cost savings from purchasing modern equipment will play a role in motivating investment, goes the optimist's scenario. So will the potential return from replacing old equipment with newer, more efficient models. And so will expectations. Over the decades, economic growth has averaged 2 percent a year or so. Corporate executives know that if they hold back too long on investment and expansion, they run the risk of falling behind competitors. So they take a chance and expand, and as they do, the companies that make the tools of production hire more workers, who spend their wages. Supply, in sum, creates its own demand. As employment and spending rise, companies purchase more tools to expand production, and the recovery is under way. In this way of thinking, government's role is to stay clear of the private sector.
"The problem comes if you get into a situation where expectations reverse," said David Collander, an economist at Middlebury College. "If companies do not believe the demand will be there, then you have to convince them it will be. That is what I believe the forecasters are doing now, trying to make everyone comfortable that demand will be there. This is a case where the forecasters are actually influencing the economy. If they are wrong too often and people start forming their views outside the normal corridor, that is when you get a serious recession."
Counting on Say's Law, the forecasters make their leap of faith. Citing the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate cuts, plunging fuel prices, a still healthy housing market, the recent spike in the stock market, adequate retail sales, and the promise of fiscal stimulus, the forecasters speak with increasing optimism of an upturn soon.
"As businesses begin to rebuild their inventories and increase investment," Mr. Lipsky said, "it is natural that they will increase employment, and that will increase spending and away we go."
Say's Law failed in the Depression. As opposed to the Saysians who saw the Depression as an anomaly, some maverick thinkers began to argue that economists had failed to consider that supply was not a sufficient source of demand. Neither business nor the consumer would spend, and the economy, instead of moving up toward full employment, settled in at a high level of unemployment and pessimism. 
John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, explained the new dynamic, and the importance of demand rather than supply in restarting the economy. Perhaps more than anyone else, Keynes popularized Say's Law, mostly as a foil for his own theories about the role of government in supplementing demand to get business investment going again.
After the war, consumer demand came back with a roar and forecasters became accustomed to Americans who never sat on their money, as so many Japanese are doing today. Supply and demand fed on each other, and a purer Say's Law gave way to an amended "compromise version, a mongrel Say's Law," as Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, put it.
Keynesian economics, meanwhile, faded into the background, except for a hard core who argue today that in this recession -- after years of debt accumulation and inadequate incomes -- demand is in danger of failing again, pulling supply down with it. "In 1945, American households were rich beyond any previous historical memory; they had this enormous stock of government savings bonds," said James K. Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin. "Now their wealth is eroding, and their debt position is incomparably worse."

Crisis Deepens In Argentina; Aid Is Sought

 BODY:
The Argentine government scrambled yesterday to keep its economic crisis from spinning out of control as pressure mounted on its public finances, its securities markets, its banking system and its currency, now pegged to the American dollar. 
 Domingo Cavallo, the government minister brought in by President Fernando de la Rua to manage the economic crisis, flew to Washington to try to persuade the International Monetary Fund to release $1.3 billion in cash that the country desperately needs to stave off default on its $132 billion in debts. 
 The fund withheld the cash earlier this week, saying that Argentina -- plagued by a severe recession, weak tax revenues and spending that has proved to be stubbornly hard to cut -- had failed to meet its own goals for balancing its national budget. 
At a news conference last night, Mr. Cavallo said his talks with the I.M.F. would continue over the weekend, according to the Reuters news agency.
Other multilateral aid to Argentina, including about $1.1 billion in loans from the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, has also been frozen. Release of those funds depends on the outcome of Mr. Cavallo's talks with the I.M.F., officials said.
Ordinary Argentines have grown increasingly nervous about the mounting crisis in recent days, not least because of rules imposed earlier this week that prevent bank depositors from withdrawing more than $250 a week in cash, though they remain free to spend money using checks and credit cards.
Long lines appeared again at banks, and tellers working in a large bank in downtown Buenos Aires told Reuters that every second customer was asking to convert pesos to dollars.
The exchange rate is officially pegged at one to one, but many people fear that the peg will be abandoned and the peso devalued; local money changers were asking for 1.12 pesos for each dollar on Friday, Reuters reported.
Mr. Cavallo has repeatedly insisted that the peg will stay, and has trumpeted aspects of his economic plans that would make the consequences of a devaluation painful for the country as signs of his resolve. More likely, analysts said, would be a move to scrap the peso entirely and use dollars exclusively as Argentina's currency. 
The Argentine stock market has rallied sharply in recent days. The Merval index rose more than 25 percent this week, though it gained less than 1 percent yesterday.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rate Jumped Last Month On Surge of Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
A vast wave of job cuts in November sent the unemployment rate up sharply, to 5.7 percent from 5.4 percent the previous month, the government reported yesterday, suggesting that the current recession will be more painful than many forecasters had expected.
 Companies eliminated more than 300,000 jobs in November and have cut nearly a million jobs in the last three months, the fastest pace of reductions in more than 20 years. The layoffs have come in an unusually wide array of businesses -- from the normally stable service sector to typically volatile manufacturing industries -- as profits have plunged across corporate America. 
 The report, depicting a nation in which millions of families are struggling more than they have in nearly a decade, added more heat to the debate in Washington between Republicans and Democrats over competing economic stimulus packages. And despite the bleaker outlook, negotiations broke off yesterday in Congress in partisan rancor. Page B6. 
"This is another miserable employment report," Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney, said. "There's really nothing good you can say about it."
Since October of last year, the unemployment rate, which is adjusted to take account of normal seasonal variations, has risen from 3.9 percent, a 30-year low, to its highest point now in more than six years.
"Today's unemployment numbers are troubling, and they underscore that we must act to ensure America's economic security," President Bush said in a statement released by the White House. Mr. Bush said the Senate should quickly pass a bill consisting mostly of tax cuts for businesses and well-off Americans, which Republicans say will increase investment and lift the economy. 
Democrats want to increase benefits for jobless workers more than Republicans do, saying those people need help and they would quickly spend any money they received.
"People who have lost their jobs are starting to lose hope," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader.
The dismal jobs numbers also made another Federal Reserve cut in interest rates a near-certainty when the Fed's policy-making group meets on Tuesday, analysts predicted. Since January, the Fed has reduced its crucial short-term interest rate, which affects a wide variety of credit card, small-business and home equity loans, a total of 10 times, lowering it from 6.5 percent to 2 percent.
Although the cuts have helped prop up consumer spending, they have yet to revive the economy, as businesses continue to reduce their investment after having optimistically binged on new computers, machinery and factory equipment in the late 1990's.
Compared with the official 5.7 percent rate, a broader measure of joblessness, which includes people who are not actively looking for work, rose to 6.2 percent last month, up from 4.5 percent a year ago, the Labor Department said.
The deteriorating labor market caused a surge last month in the number of people who had lost their jobs months ago and were still unable to find new work. More than 1.1 million people reported being unemployed for at least 27 weeks in November, up from 890,000 in October. The average length of unemployment rose to 14.5 weeks, from 13 weeks.
Forecasters have long emphasized that job cuts are more a reflection of where an economy has been than of where it is going. And yesterday -- when a separate survey by the University of Michigan showed a small rise in consumer confidence last month, adding to a spate of surprisingly good economic news in the last week -- bond yields moved up sharply, suggesting that many investors believe that a recovery will arrive early next year.
Reflecting the current level of uncertainty, stock prices fell yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 10,049.46, down 49.68 points.
Even if a recovery is near, however, job losses are likely to continue rising in the coming months, economists said. Companies typically wait to begin adding to their payrolls until they are confident that their revenues will begin growing again.
Indeed, analysts expect the unemployment rate to continue to move higher and remain around 6 percent for much of next year.
"Many forecasters are talking about a rebound in March," said Elaine L. Chao, the labor secretary, who acknowledged that yesterday's numbers were disappointing. "But I don't think we should necessarily expect to see an immediate increase in employment. It takes time for the economy to gear up."
For now, the economy is a long way from gearing up. In October, an index of nationwide help-wanted advertising fell sharply, to its lowest point since 1982, the Conference Board, a research group in New York, said last week.
Over all, the economy lost 331,000 jobs in November, according to the seasonally adjusted data released by the Labor Department, which also pushed up its estimate of job losses in October to 468,000, making that the worst month since 1974.
Manufacturers have suffered the most in the current recession, largely because companies have drastically cut their capital spending. The jobs report offered no evidence that the sector had reached a turning point. Since the summer of 2000, manufacturers have eliminated 1.4 million jobs, or more than one of 20 in the sector. Manufacturing lost 163,000 jobs in November, the most of any month during its 16-month decline.
"The recession isn't over," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist for Prudential Securities. "The hopes of the last few weeks have had a splash of cold water thrown on them."
Still, Mr. Rippe, like most Wall Street forecasters, said he expected that low interest rates and falling energy prices, together with a stimulus bill that he continues to expect from Washington, will get the economy growing again early next year.
In recent months, and especially since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the economic pain has spread well beyond heavy industry. Airlines and department stores both cut jobs last month. Temporary-employment agencies continued their huge cutbacks, reducing employment by 87,000, to 2.9 million -- 17 percent below its level early last year.
The broad nature of the recession has also caused joblessness to rise among even highly educated, well-paid workers. Last month, the jobless rate rose across the educational spectrum, although the 8.1 percent rate for people without high school diplomas remains well above the 3.1 percent rate for college graduates.
Among the few expanding industries, hospital, doctors' offices and health care companies added 32,000 jobs. Car dealers, helped by zero-percent financing deals offered on many models, increased employment by 6,000. Mortgage companies added 7,000 new workers to help them handle the demand for refinancings caused by lower mortgage rates.
Despite the recession, the unemployment rate remains lower than it was for much of the 1980's and early 90's. This relative tightness of the labor market allowed hourly wages for nonsupervisory workers to continue rising last month at an annual rate of more than 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Housing Gains In Poor Areas, Study Shows 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
A new study shows that people in the 10 poorest neighborhoods in New York City gained economic ground even faster, by some measures, than those in the city's wealthiest neighborhoods in the second half of the 1990's.
 Of course, the economic gap remains large. But the study found, for example, that average prices for single-family private homes in the 10 poorest neighborhoods increased by a startling 36.5 percent from 1995 through 1999, while average prices for single-family private homes in the 10 wealthiest areas of the five boroughs increased by 9.2 percent in the same period. 
 And in one of the poor neighborhoods, East New York, Brooklyn, the percentage price increase was even higher, 46.9 percent, according to the report, "State of New York City's Housing and Neighborhoods 2001," compiled by two professors at the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law. 
Coming at a critical time of economic tremors caused by the recession, the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 and the ensuing war, "this is good news," said Rae Rosen, the senior regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
"It sounds like documentation of the general sense we've had that the rising tide of the late 90's lifted most boats," Ms. Rosen said. "We knew the proportion of people in the city's labor force had risen. Driving down those streets, we could see the improvement. We had anecdotal impressions. But now there's documentation."
The survey backs up some anecdotal and other evidence, including a study early this year by the Columbia University School of Social Work that found that people in poor parts of the city felt more satisfied with their neighborhoods than previously and that things were generally going well.
To be sure, these neighborhoods are still poor, and the dollar values of the homes in these poor neighborhoods are still not high by New York standards. And advocates for the poor say that there is still not enough housing for the poor in the city.
Further, Ron Shiffman, director of the Pratt Center for Community and Environmental Development and a former member of the City Planning Commission, expressed concern that the improvements came at a cost, "poor people being pushed out."
The report, which has 345 pages, compiles and analyzes data from 14 city and federal sources, including the 2000 Census and the 1999 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, which was released in February 2000. The new report was prepared by Michael Schill and Glynis Daniels, the director and associate director, respectively, of the N.Y.U. real estate and urban policy center.
Among other things, the study found that property values were higher, there was more money for mortgages, housing conditions were better, more people were able to pay their property taxes on time and there were fewer families paying more than half their incomes for rent. 
In the report, the authors caution that the overall findings for a particular indicator cannot necessarily be applied to every neighborhood, because the sample for a particular neighborhood may be small. Co-op and condominium sales are also not factored into the calculations of single-family sales prices.
In addition, a double-digit percentage increase in housing value may indeed be large, but the actual dollar increase may be small. Nevertheless, the trends in all the categories are up and that is good news for those seeking signs of general economic improvement in poor areas of New York City. The report is available on the Internet at www.law.nyu.edu/realestatecenter.
The primary indication of improved conditions in the poorest neighborhoods during the 1990's was, of course, increased income. Professor Daniels pointed out, for example, that Mott Haven in the South Bronx, "was the poorest sub-borough area in the city in 1996, with a median household income of $8,644." That figure, like all income figures in the report, was based on the 1996 Housing and Vacancy Survey, and it is those income figures that were used to determine the poorest and wealthiest neighborhoods.
But by 1999, according to the next triennial Housing and Vacancy Survey, Professor Daniels continued, the median income in Mott Haven had increased to $12,000, "a jump of 39 percent, compared to an 11.5 percent increase for the whole city," in which the median income rose to $33,000 from $29,600. United States Census figures on 2000 income have not been released, except in an experimental form that raised a multitude of questions. 
In East New York, the median income had been $14,400 in 1996, but increased by 67.7 percent, to $24,154, in 1999.
Frank Anelante Jr. has watched these neighborhoods. Mr. Anelante is president of Lemle & Wolff, a development and management company for 275 buildings with about 6,000 apartments in communities like Harlem, Inwood and Washington Heights, in Manhattan, and Morrisania, East Tremont, Highbridge and Fordham in the Bronx. 
"Vacant shells have been completely renovated," he said. "You walk down the street and see occupied buildings, some with gardens, and the neighborhood becomes alive. Some buildings that had stores which were shuttered for years have been rented to local entrepreneurs."
There were other ripple effects. For example, Professor Daniels said the percentage of tenant households in Mott Haven that paid more than half their income for rent declined from 38.4 percent in 1996 to 26.4 percent in 1999. And in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where 38.8 percent of households had been paying more than half their income for rent in 1996, the figure dropped to 27 percent in 1999. For the entire city during the same period, there was only a slight drop, to 24.3 percent from 25.3 percent.
Professor Schill cited the "improved economic viability of private housing in the poorest neighborhoods," saying that "part of the reason is that they had so much farther to go. Their upside potential was tremendous because they entered the decade with depressed values, and because the city was actively investing in the communities."
For example, from 1995 through 1999, sales prices for buildings in Mott Haven with five or more units -- the predominant housing type in a community that remains the city's poorest -- rose by an average of 141 percent, while in central Harlem they rose 123 percent. In Chelsea and Greenwich Village, Professor Daniels said, overall prices increased -- though certainly from a much higher base -- by 67.7 percent and 64 percent, respectively.
From 1996 through 1999, the city's poorest communities generally had bigger percentage increases in the flow of mortgage money than did the wealthiest areas. In fact, 9 of the 10 poorest areas attracted more mortgage money in 1999 than they had in 1996. 
The biggest increase occurred in central Harlem, where the total dollar amount of home-purchase loans grew 637 percent, to $47.9 million in 1999 from $6.5 million in 1996.
Rosario Salazar, 34, is worried. The whir of a sewing machine punctuates Ms. Salazar's sentences as she sits in the compact kitchen of her two-bedroom apartment (one bedroom partitioned for the children) in Bedford-Stuyvesant. "We used to pay $450 for rent," she said. "Now it's $1,000."
Ms. Salazar, a seamstress, was laid off from her job at a purse and wallet factory on Sept. 29. She has lived with her husband, Rigoberto, 31, a textile factory foreman, and their three children -- Maria, 13, Margarita, 11, and Bonifacio, 5 -- in the three-story, three-unit, wood-frame row house with beige siding on Kent Avenue for 12 years.
"The neighborhood is definitely changing," Ms. Salazar said, "a lot of houses being fixed, families moving in. I don't think there's going to be anything anywhere near here that we'll be able to afford. Twelve years here, and then to have to move to another neighborhood that is in worse shape and is dangerous, that scares me."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home; 
Hope Against Hope

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The Hamas suicide bombings in Jerusalem last weekend were terrorism at its bloody worst, killing 25 innocent civilians. A military response by Israel was inevitable, and it came: air attacks on Palestinian police stations and on the headquarters of Yasir Arafat, pressuring him to arrest terrorists.
 From Israel's point of view, there is just one problem with that response: Force alone will not stop terrorist attacks. And from America's viewpoint, it will not keep the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from becoming ever more desperate -- and dangerous to our interests. 
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon used military force as the answer to terrorism just two months ago, when he sent tanks and troops into Palestinian territory to invest the major West Bank cities. The operation supposedly broke the back of terrorism. But it did not.
Then, on Nov. 23, Mr. Sharon sent Israeli aircraft to kill Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a senior leader of Hamas. He was a principal planner of terrorist attacks, it was said, and removing him would safeguard Israel. To the contrary, as every knowledgeable person understood, Hamas retaliation was certain. It came last weekend.
Reliance on force to solve this conflict is futile and tragic on both sides. The Palestinians' second intifada has been one of the most self-defeating strategies in memory, bringing death and misery to Palestinians and no political gain.
The only way to security for Israel and a humane life for Palestinians in their own land is political. No matter where the fault for past negotiating failures lies, there is no other path.
Think about Mr. Sharon's implied threat to force Mr. Arafat out of the Palestinian leadership -- perhaps to destroy him physically. Would that make Israel more secure? Hardly. Hamas would play a larger role in any successor leadership.
One of the most important facts on the ground is that Hamas has been gaining strength among the residents of the West Bank and Gaza. The latest poll shows 31 percent support for Hamas and smaller Islamist groups, up from 23 percent a year ago. Support for Fatah, the Arafat organization, has fallen from 33 to 20 percent.
Why Hamas has gained popularity is no secret. Palestinians have suffered, and are suffering, indignities that would drive Americans or any other people to rebel. Israel has steadily colonized their land, doubling the number of settlers since the 1993 Oslo agreement. Under Prime Minister Sharon, it has destroyed the Palestinian economy, confined people to their towns and villages and carried out assassinations. 
"It's a system that suffocates you slowly, slowly," Saleh Abdel Jawad, professor of political science at Bir Zeit University, told James Bennet of The New York Times. "It paralyzes your life, daily. And the people arrive to the point of explosion, and they cannot explode. And then one of the suicide bombers explodes instead of them."
The Palestinians see no hope now for a meaningful political process. The promise of Oslo turned to dust with the unending Israeli colonization. And Mr. Sharon has made plain that he opposes the removal of Jewish settlements and the creation of a Palestinian state with the contiguous territory that would make it viable.
The Sharon approach, in short, is all stick and no carrot. Even many Palestinians who firmly believed in a two-state solution -- Palestine living in peace alongside Israel -- have lost their faith in negotiations.
Israelis fear that Palestinians now really want not a two-state compromise but the elimination of Israel. That may well be more true now than a few years ago. But the irony is that Israeli policy has played a part in bringing it about. In trying to solidify its presence in the occupied territories, Israel has weakened the security of its pre-1967 borders. 
That any political move now can break the cycle of violence is a frail hope. But there is only one way to nurture that hope. It is to begin real peace negotiations without conditions, giving Palestinians a stake in the future. That depends on American leadership. 
The reality was succinctly stated by the distinguished Israeli writer Amos Elon in The New York Review of Books two months ago. Since 1967, he said, "Israel has been unable to resolve the painful paradox of increasing military power and steadily decreasing national security. The reasons for this continuing paradox are political: the attempt by one people to rule another against its wish."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: TOURISM; 
Attacks Called Costly to City Tourism Industry

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
The president of the city's convention and visitors bureau told state legislators yesterday that tourism-related businesses would probably lose much more than $4 billion over the next two years because of the shrinking economy and the lingering impact of the terrorist attack on Sept. 11. 
 The tourism official, Cristyne L. Nicholas, said that the business losses would probably mean thousands more people being laid off at restaurants, on Broadway and at cultural institutions as well as a decrease in city, state and federal tax revenue that she estimated at $797 million. 
 In her first tourism industry projections, Ms. Nicholas said that research had shown two disturbing and somewhat unexpected trends. The first is that while New Yorkers and suburban residents helped prop up many tourism businesses in the weeks after the attacks, visits are again beginning to drop off sharply. For example, Broadway attendance is down 14 percent after climbing up in October. The advance sales, where tickets are sold at full price, are down even more sharply. 
The second factor is that out-of-state visitors appear to be not only afraid of flying, but also afraid of coming to New York in particular. 
"The city's tourism outlook has taken a dramatic turn for the worse," Ms. Nicholas said. "In short, the tremendous gains that the city's tourism industry has enjoyed over the last five years have been erased."
Ms. Nicholas's predictions came as officials at the New York City Partnership were releasing findings from an equally dire economic impact study that suggested that the travel and tourism industries were likely to lose $7 billion to $13 billion in revenues and will lose 25,000 more jobs by 2003. In addition, a survey in the report suggested that travel to the city from Britain and Canada would decline about 40 percent in the fourth quarter, as compared with the fourth quarter of last year. 
Ms. Nicholas, who said that the city would need to market itself, proposed a $25 million increase in the state's contribution to the NYC & Company budget, an expansion of the Jacob Javits Convention Center and a week free of sales tax in January. Ms. Nicholas did not specify where the $25 million would come from, but city and state officials have bandied about using some portion of the hotel surcharge tax to increase NYC & Company's budget. NYC & Company's $12.6 million budget dwarfs that of other major cities that are more accustomed to marketing themselves. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Agency, for example, had a budget of $153 million in 2001. Las Vegas was able to shift $13 million alone toward a post-Sept. 11 advertising effort.
In 2001, the city contributed about $5.6 million and the state contributed $630,000 to NYC & Company's budget. The rest of the $12.6 million budget comes from corporate sponsors, program income and membership dues. Among tourism destinations, the spending by NYC & Company ranks 16th, behind Kissimmee, Fla., San Antonio, Los Angeles, Orlando, Fla. and other cities. 
In response to a question, Ms. Nicholas indicated that neither had she received help with estimates from the state, nor did she have any idea whether Gov. George E. Pataki would include the $25 million in his proposed budget. Ms. Nicholas said that in 2001 she expected visits to be down 14 percent, or by about 5.3 million people and spending to be down by 12 percent, or by a little more than $2 billion. While Broadway, museums and zoos were beginning to show signs of recovery, Ms. Nicholas said that they have again slipped back to the poor attendance levels seen after the attack.
In 2000, a record-setting 37.4 million tourists visited New York and contributed $17 billion to the industry. This year, Ms. Nicholas said she expects visits to be down 14 percent, or about 5.4 million people, to 32 million, with similar results in 2002.
Hotel occupancy rates are expected to decline 12.1 percentage points in 2001 to 72.5 percent after hitting a record-high 84.6 percent in 2000. At the same time, the average room rate is expected to decline 13 percent to $206 a night in 2001, from $237 in 2000. Occupancy is supposed to decline further in 2003 to 68.5 percent, while room rates drop to $181 a night.
Kathryn S. Wylde, the president and chief executive of the New York City Partnership, the city's chamber of commerce, said that she is concerned about the ways in which New York City is getting hit harder than other parts of the country. 
Ms. Wylde said many international tourists -- who, studies say, spend three times more than domestic visitors -- have the misconception that much of the city is in rubble. She pointed out that while retail sales in Manhattan were down 40 percent in September, the same sales numbers were down only 14 percent citywide and 2 percent nationwide. 
"The closer you get to ground zero, the bigger the impact," Ms. Wylde said, adding, "Our projections are also based on timely interventions to turn things around, such as marketing the city and dealing with security issues. If that does not happen, we will have an even larger hole in our economy."

HEADLINE: New York City Boom Helped Poorest, Too 

 BODY:
The surging economy of the late 1990's helped New York City's poorest gain economic ground even faster, by some measures, than it helped the wealthy, a new study by two New York University professors shows.
 The average prices for single-family homes in the 90 poorest neighborhoods increased by a startling 36.5 percent from 1995 through 1999, while average prices for single-family homes in the 90 wealthiest areas of the five boroughs increased by 9.2 percent. 
 The economic gap still exists, of course, and the dollar value of the homes in poor neighborhoods is low by New York standards. Still, economists welcomed the news, which comes at a critical time of tremors caused by the recession, the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 and the ensuing war in Afghanistan.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a computer entry error, a brief front-page summary article on Saturday about the economic gains of the poorest New Yorkers during the 1990's misstated the number of poor and wealthy neighborhoods compared in a study by two professors. The 10 poorest were compared with the 10 wealthiest, not 90 and 90.

Manhattan Prosecutor Criticizes Caymans Tax Pact

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, is critical of the agreement that Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill signed last week with the Cayman Islands to share information that would help the United States track down suspected income tax evaders, calling it "a sham."
 A variety of tax experts were also critical of the agreement, which calls for the Cayman Islands to cooperate with American tax investigators, starting in 2004. They say it gives those now cheating on their taxes 25 months to move their assets to another tax haven and seal the records of their cheating from investigators. 
 Mr. Morgenthau called Tuesday for the Bush administration to cut off the Cayman Islands' access to the United States banking system immediately, saying that was the only effective way to end decades of tax evasion and other felonies by Americans using Cayman Islands accounts. 
"What's bad is people are going to think the government is doing something when this is just a fig leaf," said Mr. Morgenthau, who disclosed last summer that Federal Reserve data show that $800 billion is being held in Cayman Islands accounts for Americans, an amount equal to roughly one-third of all domestic bank deposits.
Tax experts also criticized the agreement because it did not apply to cheating on estate, gift and state-level taxes. Still, some of these experts said the agreement, though flawed, should be seen as an important step, even if it is small, in the right direction by a government notorious for its decades-long embrace of American tax criminals.
These criticisms were dismissed as laughable by Mark A. Weinberger, the Treasury Department's senior tax policy official, who hailed the agreement.
"Obtaining this agreement in the most important financial center in the Caribbean," Mr. Weinberger said, "is an import step in advancing our cause of enforcing our tax laws globally, and we hope and expect that this will be a catalyst for other countries to step up" and sign similar agreements.
Last week, Mr. O'Neill praised the Cayman Islands for "emphatically demonstrating that those who engage in tax evasion or other financial crimes are not welcome" by signing the agreement.
David Ballantyne, the Cayman Islands attorney general, said that while the criticisms were harsh, they were not unexpected.
"Despite our efforts, there may be people who are unsure about the moves that the Cayman Islands is making," he said. Whatever may have gone on in the past, he said, "we are now moving in the direction of cooperation on criminal matters."
Aides to Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was critical of Mr. O'Neill last summer for not acting aggressively against tax cheats using offshore accounts, said the agreement should be seen as a step in the right direction.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, said that "two years is too long to wait for the noose to be cinched on tax havens," but that the Treasury Department's hands were tied because the 2004 deadline was originally set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in its efforts to crack down on tax havens.
Mr. Grassley said that he wanted "tax havens to fall like dominoes as we approach January 2004."
Mr. Morgenthau and other critics, however, said they were troubled that the agreement covers only income tax cheating and only beginning in 2004. Tax evasions now under way in the Cayman Islands can never be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service or the Justice Department under the agreement.
Gideon Rothschild of Moses & Singer, who helps clients establish lawful offshore accounts, said the agreement was an early warning to tax cheats that the era of secret offshore bank accounts was going to end eventually.
The 25-month delay gives tax cheats ample time to move their money to another tax haven, said Jack Blum, a Washington lawyer who specializes in financial frauds.
"They have written this in a way so that the people who have been violating the law can get themselves out from under the mess by moving to another jurisdiction where there is no agreement," Mr. Blum said. "This is simply astonishing."

HEADLINE: Conference Panel Reaches Accord on Education Bill 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
After months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, a House and Senate conference committee has tentatively agreed on a bill that gives federal authorities an unprecedent role in requiring schools to ensure a minimum level of education for all students.
 The bill, the legislative answer to President Bush's initiative on education, allows states to define minimum levels of proficiency on reading and math tests and gives them 12 years to do so at a more or less steady pace. 
 States must report progress toward the proficiency goals by race, ethnicity, sex and learning disability and for those with limited English, in a clear federal effort to pressure states to close gaps in achievement that have persisted despite 36 years and more than $130 billion in federal aid for poor schools.
Amy Wilkins, an education policy analyst at the Education Trust, a nonprofit organization in Washington that advises urban school districts, called the final bill "a piece of solid legislative work," and she said she expected that while 100 percent of some groups might not reach the proficiency goals in 12 years, there was ample room for improvement. 
"We're so far from a hundred now," Ms. Wilkins said, "that the next six years of pushing toward a hundred would not be a bad thing, even if we have to revisit the issue again." 
The bill, which formally authorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for the next six years, represents a remarkable coalescing of Democratic and Republican interests in overhauling public education and a turnaround for the Republican Party. In 1995, the Republican platform called for abolishing the federal Department of Education. With this bill, shaped by a Republican president and written with bipartisan support, the federal government is taking an untested direct role in forcing school improvement.
The conference committee, which is made up largely of members of the House and Senate education committees, will probably ratify the consensus bill on Tuesday, sources on both sides of the aisle say. In recent days the bill had been delayed by an effort, led by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, to transform special education into an entitlement program, which would guarantee a level of federal financing for those eligible. Supporters of the effort said they would continue the fight next year.
Among the major differences in the bills the two chambers passed last spring were the criteria for judging school performance under the testing program and options for children in failing schools. The Senate wanted to make the National Assessment of Educational Progress, administered to samples of students in 42 states, the benchmark for gauging the rigor of state exams, while the House wanted to give states the flexibility to use other tests to verify state results. The final bill mandates the National Assessment.
The bill also offers some immediate relief to parents of children in schools already failing under existing federal law. Beginning in September, school districts must allow children in failing schools to transfer to successful public schools or provide tutoring after school, at the school or with private companies, nonprofit organizations or religious schools.
David Schnittger, an aide to the House education committee, said that "3,000 public schools nationwide at this very moment would fall into that category." He estimated the subsidies could amount to $500 to $1,000 each child.
While the Senate bill allowed demonstration projects that would have given as many as seven states unprecedented flexibility in spending substantial federal education money, the final bill says 5 percent of the federal allotment not designated for poor schools could be used for experiments in flexibility. While the language of the final bill was not available today, members of the conference committee said it created restrictions that would direct more Title I money to the very poorest schools. Currently, states use not only poverty but also geographical and political considerations in distributing Title I money, which serves about a third of all eligible children.
"We have made sure that the scarce funds that we do have are going to be targeted on the neediest children," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Senate education committee. He estimated that Title I money for New York City schools would increase 30 percent. "We're holding children accountable, schools accountable and parents accountable, but we're also going to provide help and assistance."
Senator Kennedy said that an extra $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion that the bill authorizes for public schools might help schools prepare for the new testing and accountability regimes, but he noted that the recent economic recession had shrunk state education coffers by $12 billion.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ISLAM ABROAD; 
Europe's Muslims Seek a Path Amid Competing Cultures

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Shazia Mirza is by most any standard a good Muslim. She is fasting this Ramadan, as always. She prays. She never drinks alcohol or eats pork. Yet three Muslim men jumped her, one actually wringing her neck, after she told this sly joke in a comedy club here about a pilgrimage she took to Mecca: 
 She was milling in a mixed crowd of men and women when, her joke went, "I felt a hand on my bottom. I ignored it. I thought: 'I'm in Mecca. It must be the hand of God.' " 
 Ms. Mirza, 26, may be Europe's sole female-devout-Muslim-stand-up-comic -- a job title that might seem contradictory on several levels. She says it is not. "If you aren't able to laugh at your own religion, at yourself, then there is a weakness there," said Ms. Mirza, the British-born daughter of Pakistani immigrants. 
Her comedy is about a single, complicated issue: living the dual life of a religious Muslim as well as an engaged citizen of secular Western culture, in her case Europe. This is an idea without much history behind it: There are some 15 million Muslims in Europe, a steadily increasing population, most of them migrants who settled here, then gave life to new generations, only since World War II. 
Now the terror attacks in the United States seem to be widening a split that has long existed among Europe's Muslims: those, like Ms. Mirza, who believe in an accommodation between Islam and life in the West and those, like her three attackers in the club, who are quick to see heresy. 
For all the worry among non-Muslims about a clash of cultures since Sept. 11, the reality is that moderate Muslims in Europe are the majority by far. In Britain the terror attacks "shook up people," said Dilwar Hussain, a researcher on Muslims in Europe for the Islamic Foundation in Leicester. 
"They felt they had to take a stand, to reaffirm what they are saying, that we are British, that there is no competition between being British and Muslim at the same time," he said. "You can have a national value and a religious value. They don't need to clash." But often they do, and, in many ways, this tension defines the life of Muslims in Europe.
They are a diverse group, sharing not a single language or culture: Pakistanis in Britain; Turks in Germany; Northern Africans in France; Arabs scattered in several places. They are entrepreneurs, tired retirees who came to Europe four decades ago as factory workers, oil-state tourists buying a few weeks of freedom from their tight regimes at home, bright students whose brains fully encompass two cultures.
Yet, for all the moderation, there is an undercurrent of extremism, too, even among those Muslims born in Europe. Since Sept. 11, investigators have found evidence of what they say are Al Qaeda terror cells and other radical groups in places like France, Spain, Belgium, Bosnia and Germany, where some men went on, the authorities say, to plan the attacks in New York and Washington.
Those attacks -- along with the war in Afghanistan, a Muslim nation -- have unearthed old resentments even among moderate Muslims. Simply, many Muslims feel like second-class citizens in Europe (a common worry is that Turkey will never be allowed into the European Union because it is a Muslim country). 
The question, with so much suspicion now cast the way of Muslims, is whether that anger may now expand.
"When something like this comes along," Mr. Hussain said, "it adds greater credence to those people who say the twain shall never meet."

Clashing Currents in Bosnia
For Senad Lepirica, the point was driven home one recent night when he, a Muslim, was punched in the nose by another Muslim. It was October in the small, central Bosnian town of Bugojno. There was a party at the sports center, and Mr. Lepirica, 23, went outside at one point to show affection to his girlfriend, whom he had not seen in several months.
"They came to us from the mosque, two guys," he recalled. "They said, 'You can't be here.' I asked, 'Why? It's a public place.' They said, 'It's in front of the mosque.' "
One of the men hit Mr. Lipirica. Soon they were on the ground wrestling -- not just two men, but two visions of Islam.
Like Mr. Lipirica, most Muslims in the Balkans -- Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Albania -- consider themselves the most moderate in the world: They are of European Christian stock, converted half a millennium ago when the Ottoman Empire rolled west from Turkey. Despite fears of an Islamic invasion of all of Europe, the brand of Islam that survived, then weathered 50 years of Communism, is manifestly hands-off -- a model, they say, for how Muslims can coexist elsewhere in Europe. 
But since the war in Bosnia, which upended society in four years starting in 1991, charities from the Middle East have been working to remake Bosnia's Muslims in their image: to persuade them to abandon drinking, a widespread lack of observance, a European style of life. In the war, they sent arms and fighters to help Muslims when the West would not.
They have been building mosques, not in the ornate Ottoman style common in the Balkans but with the austere lines of the Saudi desert. It was one of these mosques that had just opened, across the street from the sports center in Bugojno. 
The question is whether this is a danger in any way. The mosque's young imam, Salih Indzic, says not. He politely apologized for the behavior of the man who punched Mr. Lepirica as not only wrong but also contrary to Islam. 
"The Koran says that one cannot be forced to believe," he said. 
All the same, Middle Eastern charities have poured in hundreds of millions of dollars into Bosnia. The Saudi High Commission for Relief for Bosnia, a charitable foundation of the Saudi Arabian government, which paid for the Bugojno mosque, has spent roughly $500 million in Bosnia on humanitarian and religious projects. The aim, Bosnian and foreign officials maintain, is not merely aid, but to spread a more rigid Islam, Wahhabism. 
"They are trying to fully change the real nature of Bosnian Islam," says Senad Pecanin, publisher of Dani, a newspaper in Sarajevo that has written against the Saudi influence. "They are collecting mostly young people, uneducated, without jobs." 
There are also fears that religious centers like this attract extremists. In a wave of arrests around what Bosnian police said was a terrorist threat against Western peacekeepers, NATO squads raided commission offices on Oct. 26 and detained two local employees. Local police arrested another Arab employee the next day. All were released without charges. 
Common sense suggests that Bosnia might be ripe ground for extremists: The borders are porous. Lawlessness is widespread. The economy is bad. Yet the war in the 1990's, in which ethnic and religious groups fought for supremacy, also seems to have made Bosnia's Muslims wary of absolutes. 
"Anyone who thinks with his own brain," Mr. Lepirica said, "can see that the war here happened because of fundamentalism, in politics, in religion and in nationalism." 

An Amalgam of Beliefs
Tayyiba Ahmad, 26, a second-generation Pakistani Muslim in London, rejects the common wisdom these days about her religion: that Islam equals extremism. She is arguably more devout than her parents. In college, she began reading the Koran closely. She started wearing a hijab, the head scarf that denotes modesty among Muslim women. She wears it still, if lightly. 
"To be honest, it makes things a little easier," she said. "You don't have to worry about your hair."
Yet Ms. Ahmad, now a barrister, acknowledges that she is living a life that would not please some Muslims. For one, she is a woman who works and expects equal rights. She also practices not Islamic law, but British family law. 
"There is no conflict," she said. "Within Islam there is a set of guidelines for the way a good society should function, and the starting point is the individual. Then comes the family. Then comes society as a whole."
"The conflicts arise when individuals do not respect humanity, do not respect each other and do not help one another," she said. 
Some experts say that people like her are at the forefront of a kind of new European Islam. In part, this has been shaped by places like Britain, where some two million Muslims live. Most are Pakistani but, as in Europe as a whole, they are from scores of different countries, and all practice Islam in their own way. 
And so, some experts argue, Islam transplanted to Europe is by necessity shearing itself from its cultural roots, basing itself more on the Koran than on local practice from their home countries. 
"That will eventually have a broad impact in Islam," said Peter B. Clarke, an expert on religion at King's College, University of London. "When you get into customs, you run into all sorts of problems with modernity. I'm not afraid of strict Islam. I'm afraid of cultural Islam."
The forces against such a change are strong. 
"Any modernization in the verses means backwardness in the principles," Abu Hamza al-Mazri, an influential Egyptian sheik who preaches from a mosque in northeastern London, said in an interview. "There is no such thing as a European or American Islam."
But Ms. Ahmad does not see her life as a retreat: Her religion is, as she describes it, a rudder toward a deeper a cultural, religious, even political existence. She is active in demonstrations against the war in Afghanistan. She has been lobbying to change British law to allow Islamic women who divorce still to collect a customary gift from groom to bride not now recognized in Britain. 
But, she emphasizes, this melding of Islam and Britain must take place very much on Britain's terms.
"I'm not in an Islamic country," she said. "Therefore I must work within the system."

Protection for Opponents
Not all Muslims hold so textured a view. On a chilly morning in the comfortable German city of Cologne, two young Turkish Muslims described why they chose to worship at the mosque of the Caliphate State, Germany's most radical Islamic group. 
"It is very simple," said one of the men, who is 26 years old. "Islam and democracy are incompatible. You can't have the two in the same place." His friend agreed. Both were born in Germany. Both have decent jobs, as chemists.
There are more than two million Turks living in Germany, and most reject radicalism. The Caliphate State -- a self-declared Islamic state within the German state opposed to Turkey's secular government -- is small, with only 2,000 or so members. Yet, even there, extremism has found a place. 
Little angers non-Muslim Europeans more than the fact that groups like the Caliphate State are not merely permitted to exist, but are even protected by laws their members claim not to believe in. That point was underscored at a rare news conference the Caliphate held recently. The group's spokesman, Ismael bin Yassar, acknowledged that his group had met with Osama bin Laden, if only once, by chance, in 1996. And he repeated the group's opposition to democracy. But, he said, he did not believe Germany would ban the group, as is being debated there. 
"I think that the religious freedoms in this country would not allow that to happen," Mr. bin Yassar said. 
The fear among non-Muslims is not only that a terror attack might be planned in their midst, as may have been the case in Hamburg, an affluent and cosmopolitan city that investigators say was used a base to plan the Sept. 11 attacks. 
But many Muslims say their distinct experience in Europe -- a continent shaped in many ways by the fight against the Ottoman Empire -- is one of the forces that pushed them closer to Islam. 
Turks, for example, first arrived in numbers in 1961 as "guest workers" in German factories. The theory was that they would make money and go back to Turkey. But many stayed, had children, then realized they were no longer accepted back home fully as Turks. And Germany, some say with bitterness, has always accepted them only as "guests" -- and Muslims around Europe complain about a similar alienation. 
Islam became an kind of identity "to deal with this paradox of 'Am I a Turk in Germany or a German in Turkey?' " said Mehmet Soyhun, a theologian in Cologne. 
Werner Schiffauer, a professor who wrote a book about the Caliphate State, said that embracing a more devout Islam was a way that some young Turkish Germans rebelled both against their parents and what they saw as the secular consumerism of a Germany that didn't accept them anyway. They "beat their parents with their own weapons," he said. "They were better Muslims than their parents."
Most, for now, seem to think they can be good Muslims in the West without compromising their faith any more than Christians or Jews do. 
But, with so much hostility against Muslims after the terror attacks, experts say Europe itself is also facing a test: accepting that whatever terrible acts may be done in the name of Islam, Muslims are now an inseparable part of the continent.
"If someone sees this as a problem," said Mr. Pecanin, the publisher in Bosnia, "then I'm afraid there is no future for any of us."

HEADLINE: National Briefing Northwest: Alaska: Budget Reserve In Danger 

BYLINE:  By Matthew Preusch (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Unless oil prices rise sharply, the state's $2.4 billion in savings will run dry in July 2004, economists said. After two years of high prices, oil leveled off this year at $18 a barrel, widening a fiscal gap that will require the state to draw 40 percent, or about $1 billion, of the annual budget from its budget reserve fund. The state has no sales or income tax, so about 80 percent of its general fund comes from oil and gas revenue, and production has been declining at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska's largest source of oil. Since 1991, the state has had to dip into its reserves all but two years. Matthew Preusch (NYT)

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 Collapse of the Taliban

STRONGHOLD FALLS -- Two months after the American bombardment of Afghanistan began, Taliban forces abandoned their last stronghold in Kandahar. The surrender, reported by anti-Taliban leaders entering the city, appeared to complete the collapse of the radical Islamic group that ruled Afghanistan. But confusion was widespread in the streets of Kandahar, with rival warlords competing for control, some Taliban fighters still defiant and the fate of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, unclear. A1

CAVE WARFARE -- Anti-Taliban Afghan fighters appeared stalled in their drive to capture a complex of mountain caves held by Osama bin Laden loyalists and to begin a full-scale search for him there. B2

Questions of Diplomacy

PAKISTANI AID TO TALIBAN -- One month after the Pakistani government agreed to end its support for the Taliban, its intelligence agency was still providing safe passage for weapons and ammunition to arm them. A Pakistani intelligence official acknowledged that an Oct. 8 shipment contained arms for the Taliban, but he said that it was the last officially sanctioned delivery and that the Pakistanis had since lived up to their commitment to the Americans. A1

OPTIMISM ON ACCORD -- The senior American diplomats for Afghanistan said that despite grumbling from some members of the Northern Alliance, they were confident that the interim Afghan government patched together in Bonn would succeed. B4

The Path of Al Qaeda

REBEL LEADER'S DEATH -- Investigators piecing together the assassination of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Afghan rebel leader, say they believe the plot was carried out by members of an Al Qaeda cell based in Europe and acting on command from Osama bin Laden. B1

A FOCUS ON SOMALIA -- A senior State Department official said the United States had begun surveying the waters and airspace around Somalia in hope of preventing members of Osama bin Laden's network from establishing a foothold there. B3

AFGHAN WOMEN SEEK RIGHTS -- Almost 40 prominent Afghan women, backed by American and European groups, gathered this week in Belgium to stake their claim to a role in rebuilding their country after years of living either in silence at home or in frustration abroad. B3

TAPE OF TWO AMERICANS -- The C.I.A. official Johnny Michael Spann was videotaped, just before his death, as he tried to interrogate the young American Taliban fighter John Walker in a prison in Mazar-i-Sharif. In an unusual agreement, ABC and CBS joined to buy the tape for $80,000 then broadcast it on their morning programs. B3

The View From Europe

TENSIONS AMONG MUSLIMS -- The terror attacks in the United States seem to be widening a split that has long existed among Europe's Muslims: those who believe in an accommodation between Islam and life in the West and those drawn to a more radical view. B1

CRITICS STILLED -- European criticism of the United States and the war in Afghanistan has quieted rather suddenly, in part because the Taliban have been overthrown so much more quickly than anyone expected. B5

Security and the Economy

AID PLAN FAILS IN SENATE -- Backed by a veto threat from President Bush, Senate Republicans killed a Democratic plan to provide $17 billion of aid to New York and a similar amount of money for programs to combat terrorism. The vote was a victory for Mr. Bush and a setback for Senate Democrats, who had tried to provide more money than the president sought for New York and for anti-terrorism activities. A1

DELAY IN AIR SECURITY -- Congress was unrealistic when it set a deadline of next December for screening all checked baggage for bombs, private and government experts testified. B6

ECONOMIC PLAN STALLS -- House Republicans broke off bipartisan negotiations on an economic recovery package, reducing the chances that Congress and the Bush administration will reach a deal this year. B6

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: LAST STRONGHOLD; 
TALIBAN ABANDON LAST STRONGHOLD; OMAR IS NOT FOUND

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE with NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Two months after the American bombardment of Afghanistan began, Taliban forces today abandoned their last stronghold in Kandahar.
 The surrender, reported by anti-Taliban leaders entering the city, appeared to complete the collapse of the radical Islamic group that had ruled Afghanistan. But confusion was widespread in the streets of Kandahar, with rival warlords competing for control, some Taliban fighters still defiant, and the fate of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, unclear. 
 Two rival Pashtun factions that moved into the city today engaged in firefights with each other and looted stores, opposition officials said. The gun battle appeared to mark the collapse of an agreement for the peaceful handover of Kandahar, brokered by Hamid Karzai, the Pashtun leader destined to head the country's new interim administration. 
Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the head of American military operations in Afghanistan, denied reports that Mullah Omar had fled Kandahar, but acknowledged that he did not know the exact whereabouts of the reclusive one-eyed cleric. "I do not have reason to believe that Omar has in fact escaped Kandahar," General Franks said from his headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. "We simply don't know, right now, where Omar is."
He added that the fact that his whereabouts was unknown "does not lead me to believe that he's vanished."
The Times of London reported late tonight that a Pashtun commander said that Mullah Omar had been captured and was being held by one of the rival factions. A spokesman for the United States Central Command, Maj. Ralph Mills, said the military command had seen the reports regarding Mullah Omar but was unable to confirm them. The Foreign Ministry of the interim Afghan government said it had no knowledge of such a capture. 
As Kandahar changed hands, completing the Taliban's fall from power, two essential American war aims remained unfulfilled: the elimination of the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden and the capture of the Taliban leader who harbored him as he defied the United States.
How long it might still take to achieve those objectives was unclear. Though the Taliban have collapsed, they may retain the ability to wage a guerrilla war while the hunt for Mr. bin Laden and Mullah Omar continues -- and even beyond that. Efforts to storm a network of caves in eastern Afghanistan where Mr. bin Laden may be hiding stalled today, and the mystery regarding his whereabouts deepened.
In the Kandahar area, United States marines attacked Taliban troops fleeing the southern city as the hunt for Mullah Omar intensified. The attack took place early today when marines in heavily armed, light-armored vehicles, who were deployed to block Taliban and Al Qaeda supply and escape routes, killed seven people and destroyed three vehicles. One carrier-based F/A-18 fighter-bomber also joined the strike.
The military did not release the location of the attack or other details to reporters in Afghanistan, saying only that the incident began when the marines were confronted with a vehicle rushing toward their roadblock, and that some of those killed were moving on foot.
It was the first reported offensive engagement involving the marines since Nov. 27, when two Cobra helicopters and Navy F-14's attacked a convoy of 15 Soviet-era military vehicles headed toward the marines' forward base about 80 miles southwest of Kandahar.
As Taliban forces by the hundreds tried to break out of encirclement today, the marines and Special Operations forces in the area became fully engaged in combat, and the Pentagon, which had already added heavy equipment to the nearby operating base, seemed poised to throw even more marines into the fight.
Several hundred Marine infantrymen remained afloat on Navy ships in the North Arabian Sea, prepared to reinforce the 1,300 marines already in action around Kandahar.
As some Taliban surrendered to opposition Afghan forces, General Franks said at a news conference that marines had engaged small numbers of armed Taliban on the ground and from the air.
Inside Kandahar, fighting between the forces of two commanders, Mullah Naqib Ullah and Gul Agha Shirzai, was reported. But it had stopped by nightfall. 
Under the agreement negotiated by Mr. Karzai, who is to become Afghanistan's new leader on Dec. 22 if the conclusions of negotiations in Bonn are respected, Taliban soldiers had been expected to lay down their arms and surrender the city to Mullah Naqib's soldiers.
But Mr. Shirzai views Mullah Naqib, who has often changed sides, as a lackey for the Taliban. After his forces entered the city, Mr. Shirzai, a former governor of the province who has said he is eager to have the job again, was said to be occupying the governor's mansion tonight.
Mr. Karzai's aides played down the problem, though it now appeared that two commanders were vying for control of the city.
"There was compromise between the two commanders," said Abdul Malik, Hamid Karzai's brother-in-law. "They wanted to share the power. And in order that there should not be any conflict, it was decided that they should both go to Kandahar."
"The complete surrender of the city hasn't taken place yet," Mr. Malik said. "But the situation is peaceful now."
Ahmad Rateb Popal, a cousin of Mr. Karzai's who was an intermediary in negotiations with the Taliban, said the surrender had also failed to accomplish another critical goal: disarming the Taliban.
"A lot of these soldiers left without being disarmed," he said. "They all slipped out in the night and this morning. It's a big danger. It's not good for the city, and it's not good for Hamid. It should have been more well organized."
The situation in Kandahar today was so chaotic that General Franks said it could be two or three days before conditions were stable enough to get an accurate assessment.
"We do not yet have a sense of comfort that there is stability in the city, and I don't expect that we will have a sense of comfort for perhaps two or three days," he said.
More than 1,300 marines are deployed at a forward base about 80 southwest of Kandahar. But with hundreds of Taliban either surrendering or trying to escape the city, General Franks said he was considering moving part of the American force to another location in Afghanistan to cut off their retreat.
He said he had not ruled out sending marines into the city itself, although that was not the plan. 
Mr. Popal, the cousin of Mr. Karzai, said Mr. Karzai had made a mistake in quickly changing his position on whether Mullah Omar should be granted amnesty.
The future Afghan leader is under enormous, conflicting pressures. Many Pashtuns would see the arrest and trial of Mullah Omar as a humiliating bow to American power. But members of the Northern Alliance, with whom Mr. Karzai will soon have to govern in Kabul, want the Taliban leader to be severely punished.
Mr. Karzai initially hinted that an amnesty might be possible if Mullah Omar renounced terrorism. But after Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said that was unacceptable, Mr. Karzai took a harder stand against Mullah Omar.
"He should be very careful," Mr. Popal said. "The Pashtuns are looking very seriously at what he's saying about Mullah Omar and the way he's handling the situation in Kandahar. The way he has made his statements and changed them, that will create mistrust."
Mr. Karzai's handling of the amnesty issue provoked anger among members of the Northern Alliance, which has battled the Taliban for six years. 
While Northern Alliance leaders were silent on the subject, midlevel commanders said they supported an amnesty for soldiers but not senior leaders, particularly Mullah Omar. 
"Karzai is taking the side of the enemy of people of Afghanistan," said Abdullah Tawhidi, the Alliance's deputy security minister. "If this is the case, if he is going to support Mullah Omar, we do not follow him." 
Most Kabul residents questioned joined the criticism. "If he makes a deal, if he compromises with the enemy," said Muhammad Yunis, an unemployed pharmacist, "there is no way for us to support him."
In an interview with the Qatar-based television network Al Jazeera today, Mr. Karzai repeated his new position that Mullah Omar should be arrested and tried. "I have urged him to stop the bloodshed and ban terrorism," he said. "But unfortunately his response was not positive, showing no pity whatsoever for the Afghan people." 
In eastern Afghanistan, attacks by opposition forces around a cave complex believed to hold up to 2,000 of Mr. bin Laden's die-hard loyalists stalled today.
The soldiers attacking the complex, known as Tora Bora, had made progress on Thursday, moving about two miles forward in fierce skirmishes including hand-to-hand fighting. They captured several caves above the valley floor, along with ammunition, equipment and at least half a dozen pickup trucks. 
But there was little progress today, commanders conceded. "Yesterday we captured two caves, but we lost them today," said a frontline commander, Hajji Moussa. The Afghan fighters are from the Eastern Shura, which has replaced Taliban rule in the Jalalabad area. 
American warplanes, including giant B-52's, have been heavily bombing the area for eight days and nights and continued today, sending huge plumes of smoke higher up the mountains. Afghan commanders said four American Special Operations military advisers had arrived at the front on Thursday and directed the bombing overnight.
Al Qaeda fighters -- believed to be mostly Arabs, Chechens and Pakistanis -- appeared unlikely to surrender easily. Their radio communications, in Arabic, sounded confident, almost cocky, today, taunting the Afghan fighters to "send us the international forces."

HEADLINE: Wheeling, Dealing and Making Side Deals; 
Vow to Scrap Latin Textile Deals Wins Vote on Bush Trade Powers

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The Bush administration hailed Thursday's photo-finish vote on presidential trade powers as a sterling -- though slender -- victory for free trade. But in return for crucial support, House Republican leaders quietly agreed to weaken one of the Clinton administration's most-prized trade accords.
 In a letter to Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican who switched his vote in the final seconds to give the White House a 215-to-214 win, three top Republican leaders promised to use "whatever means necessary" to cancel some textile export preferences Congress had granted Caribbean, Central American and Andean nations. In doing so, the lawmakers agreed to bolster textile manufacturers in Mr. DeMint's district. 
 Such protectionist side commitments are not uncommon when Congress considers trade agreements, and they are often defended as half-steps back to clear the way for a great leap toward open borders and expanded commerce. The concessions to Mr. DeMint helped reassure several other Republicans in textile districts who cast their votes to give President Bush trade promotion authority, a power the Bush administration says will allow the United States to join major global and regional free trade initiatives.
But perhaps because the margin in the House was so slim, the price of a victory this time was steep: critics say the proposals contained in the side letter -- if agreed to by the Senate -- effectively gut a central provision of the Caribbean Basin Trade Preference Act, a showpiece effort by the Clinton administration to help some of the world's poorest nations sell more textile and apparel products to the United States.
The promise may also complicate trade negotiations with the developing world.
Textiles are the most sensitive trade issue for poor nations because they depend on basic manufactured goods to provide jobs. Washington pledged to consider speeding the elimination of barriers to textile trade as part of negotiations begun in Doha, Qatar, last month. And the United States has come under pressure to grapple with its textile lobby as part of negotiations to free trade across the Americas.
The Bush administration is also being pressed by Pakistan to loosen quotas and reduce tariffs on imports of textile and apparel from that country, a concession to a partner in the war against terrorism that may become more difficult to finesse after the Republican horse-trading.
"This will definitely send a signal to the developing world as the U.S. tries to go forward with negotiations," said Lael Brainard, a former Clinton administration adviser on international economic issues who helped arrange a compromise on textiles that made possible the Caribbean trade accord last year. "These were very striking concessions to make, especially to members of the president's own party."
Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee and an opponent of the bill that gave new trade power to Mr. Bush, said his opposition turned to outrage when he learned of the arrangements to bring Republicans on board.
"This letter is a betrayal of all the reasons we have trade," said Mr. Rangel, a sponsor of the Caribbean deal. "It comes at the expense of hundreds of thousands of Caribbean workers as well as their governments who trusted that when the United States gives its word in trade matters, that word means something."
Robert B. Zoellick, the United State trade representative, called the DeMint concession "necessary to achieve a large good." He said the value of having the broader trade powers greatly outweighed the cost of backtracking on textiles.
He also blamed Democrats for opposing the new trade powers in overwhelming numbers and then condemning Republicans for making the deals necessary to get the package through the House, where Republicans hold a slight majority.
"If we had a few more Democrats voting with us, we could have avoided this compromise," he said.
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert; Dick Armey, the majority leader; and Tom DeLay, the majority whip, made the promise to Mr. DeMint after the time for voting on trade promotion authority had expired. Opponents outnumbered supporters in the electronic tally by several votes. With Democrats shouting to end the voting and declare defeat, Mr. DeMint and the House leaders engaged in animated discussions on the floor before Mr. DeMint got his letter. Mr. DeMint, who had voted no, then switched his vote to yes.
In the letter, Mr. Hastert assured Mr. DeMint that no new trade bills would pass the House until Congress had taken action to make sure that any apparel assembled in the Caribbean or Andean areas for export to the United States is made from fabric that is dyed, printed or finished here.
Though the preferences have been in dispute for months, the Customs Service had ruled that Congress authorized Caribbean nations to dye, print and finish their own fabric and export final products to the United States free of duties and quotas as long as they purchased raw fabric from American producers.
Mr. DeMint fought to make the Caribbean nations buy higher-value-added fabrics before turning them into clothing for export. North and South Carolina are leaders in dyeing, finishing and printing.
He was not alone. Senator Jesse A. Helms of North Carolina also fought the preferences. He held up the nomination of Kenneth Dam, the deputy Treasury secretary, and several other top Treasury officials this spring to press the administration to overturn the preferences. He eventually allowed those nominations to proceed without forcing Bush administration officials to cooperate.
Administration officials refused to budge on the matter before Thursday's vote. Mr. DeMint met President Bush at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the terms of his support for the broader trade bill, an aide said. He consulted numerous times with Mr. Zoellick. But the letter agreeing to his terms was presented only after it became clear that trade promotion authority would fail without him on board.

HEADLINE: Three Bad Calls In the Election? Not a Problem For Union Chief 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Randi Weingarten, the hard-charging president of New York City's teachers' union, gambled mightily when she endorsed Alan G. Hevesi in the Democratic mayoral primary this summer, and sure enough, Mr. Hevesi placed dead last.
 That did not stop Ms. Weingarten from backing another candidate, Fernando Ferrer, in the runoff, and when he lost, endorsing Mark Green in the general election. Mr. Green was defeated by Michael R. Bloomberg, whom Ms. Weingarten had painted as a dilettante. 
 Ms. Weingarten, it seems, should still be scraping egg off her face, but in fact, she appears neither daunted nor damaged by her missteps. She was one of the first people whom Mr. Bloomberg visited after his victory, and he publicly promised that day not to punish Ms. Weingarten's union or others for supporting his rivals. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bloomberg named Ms. Weingarten to his transition committee, further suggesting that she was not on his enemies list.
As if to emphasize that she was not about to slink off the political stage into obscurity, Ms. Weingarten made waves last week by renewing her union's demand for a 22 percent wage increase despite the economic problems that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's withering response only seemed to add fuel to her fire. Two days later, she joined striking teachers at Roman Catholic schools on their picket line, drawing yet more attention to her own goal of getting the city's 80,000 public school teachers higher salaries.
Why has Ms. Weingarten emerged seemingly unscathed from three bad calls in the mayoral race? The easy answer, associates say, is a combination of Mr. Bloomberg's hold-no-grudges attitude and Ms. Weingarten's ability to avoid burning bridges and to redraw alliances quickly when the tides turn, using a mixture of personal charm and political savvy.
"She has always had a good sense of the big picture," said Robert Berne, the vice president for academic and health affairs at New York University and an expert on the school system. "The combination of her pragmatism and Bloomberg's reaching out has led to an interesting moment." 
Others say that Ms. Weingarten has worked more diligently than her predecessor, Sandra Feldman, at maintaining close relationships with other union leaders and finding a significant role in the overall city labor movement. As chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, which coordinates bargaining for all municipal unions, she has additional visibility and influence.
Nor are Ms. Weingarten's unsuccessful endorsements likely to hurt her within the ranks of her union, the United Federation of Teachers. The members overwhelmingly re-elected her in April, and in an earlier vote, they extended the length of a president's term to three years, from two. Opposition within the union has been weak, and the coalition that tried to defeat her last spring has been working closely with her lately, delegates say, after she lobbied them to do so.
"There was disappointment and a lot of disgust right after Election Day, when Green lost," said Marian Swerdlow, a longtime delegate and social studies teacher at Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School. "But a lot of members would like to believe that Bloomberg's reaching out to her is a really good sign and that she's landed on her feet."
George Arzt, a political consultant who advised Peter F. Vallone and then Mr. Ferrer in the mayoral race, pointed out that Ms. Weingarten was hardly the only person who endorsed more than one losing candidate in what proved to be a completely unpredictable race. So many people switched their endorsements that none are likely to suffer grave consequences, Mr. Arzt said.
"No one really knew which horse to get on," he said. "Look at Ed Koch: he was with Vallone, Ferrer, finally Bloomberg. This was a very, very unusual year."
Notably, none of Ms. Weingarten's endorsements in the mayoral race were particularly passionate. She waited until mid-August, less than a month before the Democratic primary, to back Mr. Hevesi, and did little campaigning on his behalf. Her endorsement of Mr. Ferrer came only after an even larger union, District Council 37, backed him. By the time she got around to endorsing Mr. Green, it was clear from remarks she had made about him throughout the campaign that Ms. Weingarten -- a member of the Democratic National Committee -- was merely fulfilling political obligations.
"I read those endorsements as very careful, lukewarm statements about the candidates," Mr. Berne said. "None of them would have prevented her from doing what she did in the next round."
In an interview on Monday, Ms. Weingarten said her endorsements of Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Ferrer were heartfelt, and she pointed to past endorsements of candidates who won -- Charles E. Schumer in 1998 and Hillary Rodham Clinton last year. "I tend to be a risk-taker, and sometimes risks work out, sometimes they don't," she said. "The mayor-elect understands that the U.F.T. follows its convictions. He also knows that when we say we want to work with him, we mean it."
Also in Ms. Weingarten's favor is the fact that Mr. Bloomberg is a novice politician, a Republican in a city of Democrats who needs all the support he can get, said Joseph P. Viteritti, a research professor at New York University. "He can't play the game of not dealing with people who didn't support him," he said.
He added that the relationship could be mutually beneficial, because Ms. Weingarten has signaled recently that she is willing to reverse longstanding union positions and support two ideas that Mr. Bloomberg advocates: increased mayoral control of the school system and bonuses for teachers in schools whose test scores improve.
"It's not what Rudy Giuliani wanted," Mr. Viteritti said of Ms. Weingarten's new positions, which are more cautious than similar proposals by Mr. Giuliani. 
"But it's a very significant sea change in the thinking of the union. Bloomberg may realize it's in his interest to have her across the bargaining table."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE STIMULUS PACKAGE; 
Republicans Break Off Talks On Measures to Spur Economy

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
House Republicans broke off bipartisan negotiations on an economic recovery package today, reducing the chances that Congress and the Bush administration will reach a deal this year, even as the latest statistics showed a surge in unemployment.
 Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and his party's point man on the economic stimulus bill, issued a terse statement this morning saying he was canceling negotiating sessions planned for today and through the weekend. He then flew home to California. 
 His decision prompted criticism from Democrats, who said it was outrageous at a time when workers are suffering. That brought a counterattack from Republicans and the administration, who said the talks' cancellation was the justifiable consequence of a decision by Democrats to play politics with the economy. 
Democrats want the stimulus package to focus on helping low-income workers and the unemployed. Republicans are pushing for tax cuts, largely to benefit businesses. The two parties have been at a standoff for nearly two months, but had seemed to make progress this week when Mr. Thomas offered concessions and Democrats signaled that they would respond in kind.
Members of both parties said negotiations might still resume next week, perhaps with more direct involvement by President Bush. But among Democrats and Republicans alike there was increasing talk that the concessions being demanded by their counterparts made walking away from a deal more attractive than a compromise, especially if the economy shows signs of rebounding.
The negotiations have been suffused by what members of both parties called hostility between Mr. Thomas, known for a sharp tongue and quick temper, and the Democratic leadership, especially Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, who Republicans say is more interested in his party's electoral prospects than in helping the economy.
Republicans said Mr. Thomas was especially infuriated by a decision by Senate Democrats that any economic plan would have to win the support of a substantial majority of their caucus, or perhaps as many as two-thirds of the 50 Democratic senators. They said Mr. Thomas viewed the Democratic position as demanding an outright victory, making a compromise impossible.
The Republican Congressional leadership and the administration jumped in on Mr. Thomas's side today, seeking to blame Mr. Daschle.
"Senator Daschle has offered nothing except more unrealistic demands," said J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the House speaker. "It seems to me that the Senate majority leader is trying to kill this negotiation before it even starts."
Paul H. O'Neill, the treasury secretary, said Mr. Daschle had created "an impossible hurdle" for the negotiators in insisting that any deal be supported by most Democrats.
"By refusing to respond to the president's repeated call for action, Senator Daschle is delaying America's economic recovery and threatening Americans' job security," Mr. O'Neill said in a statement.
Mr. Daschle said that by abandoning the negotiations, the responsibility for economic suffering now rested with the Republicans.
"They've walked out on the talks, they've walked out on unemployed workers and they've walked out on America's economy," he said. "And that is an outrage."
Some members of both parties said they would resist any deal that gave too much to the other side, with Republicans adamantly opposed to Democratic calls for more spending and Democrats determined to block a second big tax cut this year.
"I think, increasingly, Republicans are not willing to take a bad package, and it may very well be that the result will be no package," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.
Alice M. Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was the White House budget director under President Bill Clinton, said that many liberals would prefer no bill to a deal based on the Republican tax cut legislation passed by the House in October. That bill cut taxes in the coming year by nearly $100 billion, with more than 70 percent of the benefits going to companies. 
Among its provisions was one that would eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax and allow companies to claim, immediately, 15 years of accumulated tax credits from the minimum tax.
But with the ranks of the jobless growing, there is political peril to both parties should Congress go home this year without enacting some measure to help the economy.
Late in the day, Mr. Thomas issued a second statement saying that there is "already a large area of common ground between Republicans and Democrats" and that Republicans would restart negotiations -- if Mr. Daschle would drop his insistence that a large majority of Senate Democrats approve any compromise.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Panel Backs Putting Hefty Duties on Imported Steel 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
A federal trade panel recommended hefty duties on steel imports today, clearing the way for President Bush to protect troubled domestic steel companies but almost certainly raising the price of cars, appliances and other steel products.
 The Bush administration sought today's ruling by the International Trade Commission, making it likely that the White House will carry out the most sweeping protections for American steel makers since the 1980's. 
 Coming just a day after the House agreed to grant Mr. Bush expanded powers to negotiate free trade agreements abroad, the ruling gives Mr. Bush leeway to appease a politically influential constituency that staunchly opposes open trade -- and to reward workers and businesses in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and other swing states that some Bush advisers view as crucial to winning presidential elections. 
Each of the six members of the trade panel recommended that Mr. Bush protect 16 steel product lines -- accounting for about four-fifths of imported steel -- with tariffs from 5 percent to 40 percent. Some members also suggested using quotas or a combination of quotas and tariffs to help the industry.
Those recommendations are generally less than what the industry considers adequate. But the trade law gives Mr. Bush wide latitude to impose penalties as he sees fit, a decision he must make by February.
"The industry welcomes the I.T.C.'s recognition that tariff-based remedies are necessary at this time," said Thomas J. Usher, chairman and chief executive of the USX Corporation. But he urged Mr. Bush to adopt higher tariffs than the ones recommended by the trade panel, calling them "the only remedy that will give America's steel industry the chance to restructure."
Steel makers pressed the Bush administration to initiate the action against imports using a potent trade law, called Section 201, under which it is considered relatively easy to show damages from imports. The Clinton administration repeatedly declined to invoke that law to help steel makers.
Some 25 American steel companies have declared bankruptcy in the last several years, with many blaming their demise on a flood of low-priced imports and appealing for emergency government assistance to fend them off. The industry has asked for tariffs on many steel products of up to 50 percent, saying that the resulting higher sales at higher prices would help American steel makers generate more than $10 billion in industry profits that could be used to put them on firmer financial footing.
Earlier this week, leading steel makers also asked the Bush administration for $13 billion in federal aid to help pay pension and health care benefits for retirees. They said the aid would help as many as six major steel makers, including USX-U.S. Steel Group and Bethlehem Steel, to merge into a single and more resilient entity.
In essence, the industry is asking for a belt-and-suspenders bailout from the government -- reducing import competition while also providing financial aid to help compete with imports.
The administration is unlikely to give the industry everything it wants. Administration officials are noncommittal about any direct financial aid for steel makers, and Mr. Bush may well choose to impose lower tariffs or quotas than the industry would like.
The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, has said that the administration will impose protective trade barriers only if the steel industry consolidates to reduce its own overcapacity.
Some economists argue that any protections for steel are a waste of money. The trade panel recommended duties on trade products like flat-rolled and slab steel, which are basic materials for a wide range of consumer goods like refrigerators, microwave ovens, car fenders and fire extinguishers. All those items are likely to increase in price -- unless companies that make them take a blow to their profits.
Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said he had studied the impact of imposing 20 percent tariffs on most steel imports -- about the average of what the commission recommended but well below what the industry wants. He found that they would cost consumers $2.4 billion a year when they were first imposed, falling to about $1.2 billion in the fourth year, when they are scheduled to be phased out. His total comes to more than $7 billion.
He also estimated that import barriers would save 7,300 jobs next year, meaning that Americans would end up paying $326,000 for each steel worker retained.
"This is why trade protection is an incredibly expensive way to save jobs," Mr. Hufbauer said. He said it might make more economic sense to give direct aid to steel makers to help them lay off workers or pay benefits than to impose the tariffs.
Any substantial tariffs are also bound to offend some of America's leading trading partners. Canada, Mexico, Russia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea and several European countries export steel to this country, and their companies would be hit hard.
The Japanese minister of economy, trade and industry, Takeo Hiranuma, said today that the trade panel's decision was "a call for a de facto ban on imports." He called it "truly regrettable."
The European Union trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, said a 40 percent tariff on steel imports would virtually close the United States steel market to the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE APPROPRIATIONS; 
Senate Rejects Increase in Aid For New York

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Saturday, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Backed by a veto threat from President Bush, Senate Republicans on Friday killed a Democratic plan to provide $17 billion of aid to New York, along with a similar amount of money for various domestic programs to combat terrorism.
 The vote was a political victory for Mr. Bush and a major setback for Senate Democrats, who had tried to provide more money than the president sought for New York and for antiterrorism activities. 
 The Senate vote was 50 to 50. Sixty votes were needed to approve the Democratic plan, because it called for spending in excess of limits previously set by Congress. 
Democrats had said the $17 billion in their plan, combined with $3 billion already spent in aid to New York, would fulfill a federal promise made to the state in the week after the attack on the World Trade Center.
The New York senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, both Democrats, said they now expected that the state would receive $9.5 billion under a compromise devised as an alternative to the $17 billion proposal.
The money for New York and for antiterrorism programs was part of an amendment to the annual spending bill for the Defense Department. The Senate passed the bill late Friday, just a few seconds before midnight, by a voice vote. In the House, as in the Senate, Republicans rallied to Mr. Bush and blocked Democratic efforts to provide more money than he wanted.
Mr. Schumer and Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate Republican leader, predicted that Mr. Bush would seek additional money for New York in the current fiscal year when he submits his annual budget request to Congress in January.
"There is almost a universal belief," Mr. Schumer said in an interview, "that the administration will come back early next year with a request for a supplemental spending package that includes many of these same items. So why not do it now? The only answer is macho. The administration wants to be able to say, 'We're doing it, we're in charge.' "
The vote was the second significant victory for Mr. Bush in two days. On Thursday, over strenuous objections by many Democrats, the House passed a bill that would give the president broader power to negotiate international trade deals. The Senate is expected to take up the measure next year.
The $9.5 billion of aid to New York envisioned under the Senate compromise includes $5.8 billion to remove debris and repair public works at the site of the World Trade Center; $2 billion for community development grants; $140 million to reimburse New York hospitals; and $10 million for mental health services to children in New York.
The central issue in the debate on Friday was not just money but also the ability to control the domestic political agenda.
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and other Democrats had wanted to provide a total of $35 billion for aid to New York and for various programs to prevent terrorism in the United States. But Mr. Bush threatened to veto the whole bill if it included more than $20 billion for those purposes.
Democrats said Republicans were delaying urgently needed improvements in domestic security, gambling with public health and safety, and exposing Americans to the risk of more hijackings, more anthrax and still other forms of terrorism.
Republicans said they wanted to give Mr. Bush an opportunity to assess the nation's needs and to submit a coherent set of proposals to beef up border security, prevent bioterrorism and protect airports, seaports and nuclear power plants.
Tom Ridge, director of the White House Office of Homeland Security, said on Thursday that Mr. Bush would propose substantially increased spending for security in his budget request next month.
In political terms, there is a vast difference between the two approaches. Mr. Bush would look weak if Congress forced additional spending on him now, over his objections. By contrast, if he makes similar proposals in January, he can plausibly take credit for seizing the initiative.
A bill passed by the House last week would provide nearly $7 billion in new aid to New York. The administration supported that measure, opposing the extra money in the Senate bill because "the total cost of recovery efforts in New York is not yet known."
Whether senators will pay a political price for voting against additional spending to help New York and enhance domestic preparedness may depend on events. Republican lawmakers could pay a penalty at the polls if another terrorist incident occurs before Congress provides further money. But voters may see the debate as a petty squabble if no more acts of terrorism occur. 
The rejection of the Democratic plan on Friday, combined with two Senate votes on the same legislation on Thursday, was a major defeat for Mr. Byrd, the Appropriations Committee chairman, who has served in Congress for nearly a half-century.
Mr. Byrd made clear in debate today that he saw the issue as a struggle over who would set domestic priorities.
"If we back away every time a president threatens a veto," Mr. Byrd said, "then the chief executive of this nation will reign supreme. He will be the emperor, no matter what his political party. He will be king. It seems to me to be a rather arrogant attitude on the part of the administration to say, 'We will tell you how much money we need.' "
Democrats said they were not surprised by their failure to round up 60 votes for their spending plan. Still, Mr. Byrd said, "The vote sends a message that it's more important to win a political battle than it is to win the war against terrorism."
One of Mr. Byrd's closest friends in the Senate, a Republican, said in reference to a series of votes against the spending: "Senator Byrd has never lost three votes in a row. He's in a state of shock."
Backing away from a veto fight with Mr. Bush, Senate Democrats agreed to scale down their proposal so it totaled $20 billion, the maximum acceptable to him. Within that sum, Democrats rearranged the money to provide $9.5 billion for New York -- $3 billion more than Republicans had initially proposed.
Senator Lott hailed the Senate's action as a vote of confidence in Mr. Bush's judgment. "We are now at war," Mr. Lott said. "We've got men and women on the ground and in the air and at sea in this war against terror. We should not revert to political positioning."
In the Senate, as in the House, some Republicans said they would have supported extra money for New York and for antiterrorism programs if the White House had not put pressure on them.
The Senate vote on extra money for New York and for domestic security generally followed party lines. Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin was the only Democrat who voted with the Republicans. 
"I strongly support funding to help the country recover from the tragic events of Sept. 11," he said. "But only a fraction of the money Congress approved earlier for recovery has been expended. It is premature to circumvent budget limits to provide additional spending."

HEADLINE: A Vote for Free Trade 

 BODY:
By a single vote margin, the House of Representatives on Thursday gave President Bush the negotiating power he will need to broker trade agreements vital to the health of the global economy. It is a shame that only 21 Democrats voted for the measure. Senate Democrats, less beholden to protectionist interests, should now hasten to support President Bush's request and reassemble a bipartisan consensus for freer trade. 
 There are few more meaningful ways for America to aid the world's neediest than by remaining a steadfast advocate of economic liberalization. Poor countries desperately need developed nations to lower their tariffs for textile and agricultural imports. Though some domestic competitors in those sectors may suffer, America's overall economy also benefits from an expansion in trade. 
 Every president since Gerald Ford has exercised the kind of trade promotion authority just approved by the House, though President Clinton was unable to renew his after it lapsed in 1994. The law binds Congress to a straight up-or-down vote on any trade deals made by the president. Without this streamlined process, Mr. Bush's ability to engage other countries in complex trade negotiations is much diminished.
The bill passed in the House rightly directs Mr. Bush to place environmental and labor standards at the center of trade negotiations. Robert Zoellick, the United States trade representative, has proved his willingness to do so. Countries must not be allowed to violate basic international labor standards or to dilute their own laws to attract investment or benefit from trade. 
For more than a half-century, Democratic and Republican administrations alike have rightly endeavored to liberalize the world's economy and lower barriers to trade. This commitment is as important today as ever before, particularly as the nation seeks to rally the world in a war on terrorism. President Bush needs the negotiating power to lead the new round of multilateral talks agreed to by 140 countries last month, as well as to forge a free trade zone for the Americas.

HEADLINE: Charles Schwab Will Close Its Online Venture in Japan 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The Charles Schwab Corporation, the American discount brokerage concern, said today that it would shut its online-trading joint venture in Tokyo in February.
 The venture, Charles Schwab Tokio Marine Securities, faltered from its start in April 2000, just in time for technology stocks to melt down and the new-share market to dry up. Since then, Japan's economy has skidded into a recession and Japanese retail investors are even more reluctant than usual to buy equities. 
 The online venture managed to gather just 9,000 accounts; some of those who still remain will be sent to a rival, DLJ Direct SFG Securities, a joint venture of Credit Suisse First Boston and Sumitomo Bank. The Schwab venture lost 3.7 billion yen ($29.8 million) in the year ended March 31, 2001.
"It is unfortunate that the economic conditions prevailing in Japan and around the world have depressed our competitive prospects at such a key time," the venture's president, Richard Kenny, said in a statement. Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance owns 35 percent of the venture.
Schwab joins a growing list of foreigners to pull out of Japan's moribund market. Last month, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter closed its only consumer branch here, which had been open less than a year. Societe Generale of France also said recently that it would shut its online operations here, and Merrill Lynch is pruning its retail network.
All three had been among the foreign players who bet that Japan's stock market would recover sharply after collapsing in 1998. At first they were right, as stock prices revived in 1999, but the gains were swiftly erased when American stocks swooned last year and pessimism spread abroad.
The Schwab venture came late to an online brokerage market cluttered with dozens of companies. Early entrants like Matsui Securities and Monex Securities established brand names and cornered parts of the market, including day traders. Schwab, however, never distinguished itself from the pack for Japanese retail customers, who now execute half their trades online, analysts said.
"They came in too late and missed the window of opportunity," said Kristine Li, who follows Japan's brokerage industry for Lehman Brothers in Tokyo.
Ms. Li estimates that Matsui, Monex, DLJ Direct SFG Securities and E*Trade Japan control 60 percent of the online trading market here, with another 15 percent going to online arms of the country's three largest conventional brokers, Nomura, Nikko and Daiwa.
A price war has driven commissions down 90 percent since they were deregulated in 1999.

HEADLINE: With Tourism Down, Hotel Rates Fall, Too 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES; EVELYN NIEVES is chief of the San Francisco bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
THE tourists, so many of them based in other, earlier time zones, begin stepping out in Union Square before dawn. They mosey into the cafes when the morning fog is still on the ground, wait for Macy's to open when the corner newspaper kiosks are still padlocked, line up for the Mason-Powell cable car before most San Franciscans have had their first cup of nonfat latte.
 But lately, the throngs of tourists that are so much a part of life in San Francisco have thinned. The hotels are half full. At high noon, the wait for the cable car is only five minutes. 
 On a typical weekday last month, well after the morning's brittle sweater-weather had warmed into another lovely shirt-sleeve afternoon, the streets of Union Square were as quiet as a library. So were the once too-crowded souvenir shops of Fisherman's Wharf, the restaurants of North Beach and the trendy hotel bars in Nob Hill.
San Francisco's tourist industry, the lifeblood of its economy, is in dire straits. Even before Sept. 11, the dot-com bust had put a damper on business travel, causing hotel occupancy to drop 11 percent in the first eight months of the year from the same period last year. But since Sept. 11, tourism in San Francisco, as in every destination that depends on air travelers, has been seriously affected. Only three out of five hotel rooms in the city had paying customers in September, or an occupancy rate of just under 60 percent, down from 88.5 percent for the same time last year, according to the latest available figures from the Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
It has become so bad that Gov. Gray Davis has begun a $5 million ad campaign to get Californians to take trips in-state, with much of the campaign focused on the tourist-dependent Bay Area. (When the governor announced on Nov. 1 a "credible threat" by terrorists to destroy one or more of California's four main bridges, hotels and restaurants in San Francisco saw a further drop in clientele. The governor was obliged to cross the Bay Bridge and visit the Golden Gate just to show that they were indeed safe.)
San Francisco, which is accustomed to having more than 80 percent of its hotel visitors arrive by plane, is trying to lure nearby residents to spend a night or a weekend in the city.
Mayor Willie Brown is even considering a plan that would have city officials call Bay Area residents and invite them over for a bite and a bed.
For tourists, the drop means a good deal. The Convention and Visitors Bureau has put together two collections of winter hotel packages, one in effect through December, the other running from January to March. The first offers hotel rates beginning at $63 a night, with amenities such as shopping discounts, restaurant credits, free parking and attraction passes. The second, focused on romance, has overnight package rates starting at $79, with perks that might include champagne, bathrobes and breakfast in bed.
"November and December is our slow season traditionally," said Laurie Armstrong, vice president for public relations for the Convention and Visitors Bureau. "So we're optimistic that this slowdown will pick up again."
If it does, San Franciscans could go back to the good old days of grudgingly accepting tourists as part of the landscape. Their absence is oddly unsettling, like seeing an empty space in the corner where grandmother's old recliner used to be.
"I never thought I'd say this," said a vendor at Fisherman's Wharf as he looked around the near-empty streets, "but I miss the tourists in their shorts and T-shirts, gaga over everything. I miss their happy faces."

 THE STRANGE DEATH OF AMERICAN LIBERALISM
By H. W. Brands.
200 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $22.50.
 Could the war on terrorism revive trust in government? Maybe even big government? Political commentators are asking whether relying on muscular federal action to prevent terrorism and save the economy might cause Americans to trust government in other ways as well. H. W. Brands could scarcely have predicted the events of Sept. 11 when he wrote "The Strange Death of American Liberalism." But the issue now raised so often -- the connection between national emergencies and government activism -- is the centerpiece of his argument about the demise of liberalism.
For Brands, the author of books on Theodore Roosevelt and Benjamin Franklin, the question is less why liberalism died than how it ever managed to come about at all. He argues that 20th-century liberalism was a grand historical anomaly made possible by the cold war. No more cold war, no more liberalism. 
Distrust of government has always been the default setting of American politics, Brands says, with one very big exception: wartime. When national security is at stake, Americans are willing to tolerate a temporary but vast expansion of federal power. Thus, during the cold war, when America was trying to lead the world by example, domestic reformism became a part of foreign policy. Ending discrimination and ending poverty were no longer the concerns just of do-gooders. They were another front in a global struggle.+
Brands is right to place the cold war at the center of our understanding of the late 20th century. The cold war had a way of stacking contrary political impulses against each other to create a mutually reinforcing and remarkably stable political whole. Liberal internationalists could suddenly agree with virulent anti-Communists on many points of foreign policy. Eisenhower and Nixon Republicans could find conservative reasons for endorsing a moderate liberalism. Most important, the cold war persisted long enough to convince two generations that the politics it spawned was a natural state of affairs. There are legions of aging, liberal baby boomers who believe that some amalgam of memories from the 1950's and 60's amounts to the normal order of things. If Brands can puncture that shortsighted nostalgia, so much the better. 
Unfortunately, he nips and tucks the historical record too often to be convincing to those who aren't already convinced. Take what is arguably the single largest expansion of federal power in American history -- the adoption of the Constitution in 1789. It occurred while the country was at peace, not war, but this goes almost unmentioned. And progressivism, another great wave of reformism with centralizing tendencies, is all but argued out of existence. Everyone agrees that Americans are more skittish about government than Europeans. But their attitudes are more complex and ambivalent than Brands allows.
The book's real weakness, however, is its one-dimensional rendering of liberalism itself. For Brands, liberalism is all about bigness and power and centralized control. Equality, solidarity and rights-consciousness tag along like bit players in the drama. By seeing liberalism so totally through the prism of statism, Brands comes close to declaring what is simply a truism: that cold war liberalism was a product of the cold war and couldn't go on without it. But if liberalism is to have any meaning for understanding our past or our future, we should see it as one manifestation of a broader tradition of American reform, one that has often, but by no means always, been identified with the power of the state.
In his book's final pages, Brands writes that if history is any guide, "another serious threat to American security" will be necessary to change the public's skepticism about big government. After Sept. 11, just such a threat is at hand. But since the American tradition of reform has never simply been about an overweening state, a revival of liberalism, at least as it existed during the cold war, is by no means certain.

THE END
OF GLOBALIZATION
Lessons From the Great Depression.
By Harold James.
260 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $39.95.
 The attacks of Sept. 11 have only deepened the parallels between present-day America and the America of the 1920's. In the early 20's, Americans also felt assaulted by alien forces -- radicalism and Bolshevism imported mainly by immigrants. There was terrorism then, too. These are eerie extensions of similarities between the two periods that until now have been largely confined to economics and popular psychology. In both periods, Americans enjoyed astonishing prosperity. In both, novel technologies mesmerized the public. In both, the stock market rose to unanticipated heights. In both, the faith that the economic system had permanently changed for the better led to self-congratulatory labels: the "new era" in the 20's and the "new economy" in the 90's. We know what happened to the 20's; the 90's endgame is still unfolding. 
No one guessed in 1921 -- just as no one guessed in 1991 -- that the country would soon experience astonishing prosperity. Economic downturns in both years darkened the public mood. The severe 1920-21 slump is usually classified as a depression, with unemployment averaging almost 12 percent in 1921. The depression resulted mainly from the huge inflation unleashed by World War I that set in motion a spending frenzy (buy now to beat price increases) and caused the Federal Reserve -- created only in 1913 -- to raise interest rates. New technologies helped propel the subsequent boom. In the 20's, the spread of electricity -- by 1927, 63 percent of households had it, up from 16 percent in 1912 -- stimulated markets for new appliances: irons, toasters, stoves, washers, vacuum cleaners and, most conspicuously, radios. Along with the spread of movies, radio's arrival fostered a new national pop culture and politics. Even more transforming were cars. Production exploded. From 1920 to 1929, car registrations tripled to 27 million. The hunger for mobility spurred satellite industries, from filling stations to road construction to motels. 
The story of how this prosperity fed a stock market mania has been told many times, most notably in "Only Yesterday," the 1931 classic by Frederick Lewis Allen; "The Great Crash, 1929" (1955), by John Kenneth Galbraith; and "Once in Golconda" (1969), by John Brooks. But for those who want a refresher, Maury Klein's "Rainbow's End" is a worthy successor, well written, entertaining and detailed. Klein, a historian at the University of Rhode Island, shows how optimism gradually spawned financial euphoria. Market setbacks were temporary; people bought on the dips; and warnings about speculative excesses were dismissed as old-fashioned. Sound familiar? 
There are other parallels. By 1998, about 49 percent of households had stock, up from 32 percent in 1989. A similar growth occurred in the 20's, though (because surveys were rare and not always reliable) the exact dimensions remain unknown. Klein cities one estimate that toward the end of the decade, about 15 million Americans (out of 122 million) owned corporate stocks or bonds, up from 500,000 two decades earlier. Mutual funds, then known as investment trusts, barely existed before the 20's. Their number had quadrupled by 1926. Rising stock ownership, Klein writes, dampened hostility toward corporate enterprise. This, too, happened in the 1990's.
Then as now, a thin line separated genuine economic enthusiasm from market manipulation. In the 90's, stock analysts touted profitless Internet stocks whose shares already traded at astronomical prices. This helped the analysts' investment firms win underwriting deals (the sale of new shares) from which they earned lucrative fees. Yet many analysts believed their outlandish predictions. In the 20's, wealthy investors often organized secretive "pools" that, through concerted buying, stimulated enthusiasm for a stock and drove up its price. The pool would then quietly sell at a profit, enthusiasm would wane and the stock's price would drop. Still, many leading Wall Street figures -- including pool operators -- were true bulls, believing in the market's inexorable rise. 
Klein's major failing is that he does not connect the stock market crash of 1929 to the Great Depression. Instead, he declares that the crash "ranks high on the list of unsolved puzzles for scholars" who have been unable to determine "what role, if any, it played in bringing on the grinding depression that followed." This is misleading. In recent decades, a huge amount of academic research essentially absolves the crash. Klein ignores this research. By itself, the 1929 crash did not so weaken confidence and consumer buying that it caused the Depression.
The Great Depression differed from ordinary economic slumps in many ways: its severity (economic output in the United States dropped about 30 percent between 1929 and 1933); its length (unemployment in 1939 was still 17 percent); and its international character (almost all industrialized countries suffered). Among scholars, the prevailing view is that the global financial system after World War I was inherently unstable. The attempt to restore the prewar gold standard -- paper money backed by government gold reserves -- led to a series of banking crises, because domestic and international investors doubted that the gold commitment could be honored. The stock market crash signaled the onset of an American recession. It became the Great Depression because once a setback occurred, a financial system based on gold was so shaky that normal recovery was difficult and, perhaps, impossible. Depositors withdrew money from banks, which caused banks to fail. Credit and international trade shriveled, causing economic weakness to spread and snowball. This happened in Austria, Germany, Britain and France as well as the United States. 
"The End of Globalization," by Harold James, a historian at Princeton University, represents the latest contribution to this new consensus. James shows in great -- if sometimes dry -- detail how the Depression led to the breakdown of the liberal international economic order of the late 19th century, characterized by open trade, a free flow of money among nations and heavy migration. Here, too, there may be disturbing parallels. The Sept. 11 attacks suggest that today's globalization could founder because large groups around the world reject it and will try (literally) to destroy it. 
What undermined globalization in the 1920's was the nationalistic residue of World War I, which fostered trade protectionism and immigration restrictions. The Depression compounded these pressures. Deflation -- falling prices -- meant that debtor countries, often dependent on a few raw material exports, couldn't earn enough to repay their debts. By the mid-30's, many countries had resorted to trade restrictions and foreign exchange controls to protect domestic industries and pay for essential imports. The Great Depression's simple and overriding lesson is that economic forces, if sufficiently powerful, can transform the social and political landscape in ways once unimaginable. In turn, the Depression represents a root cause of World War II because it discredited democracy in Germany and by humbling democracies in Britain, France and the United States weakened their will to deter Germany.
Neither Klein nor James asks whether the crash and the Depression could have been averted by shrewd leadership. But both books tell similar stories of confusion and disarray. Political, business and financial leaders around the world grappled with problems they barely understood. Even had they understood, their power -- to affect financial markets, banking systems and trade flows -- was so fragmented that the practical prospects for controlling events were limited. This is a parallel that need not apply to our own time. But it might, and that is a sobering possibility.

HEADLINE: CHOICE TABLES; 
The Mission District: Affordable and Fun

BYLINE:  By MARK BITTMAN; MARK BITTMAN writes for the Dining section of The Times.

 BODY:
I KNOW of no other North American neighborhood where you can have as much fun and eat in as many different, affordable restaurants as you can in the Mission District of San Francisco. The dot-com boom bought tons of new money here, and two years ago, when pioneering yuppies had gentrified the Mission -- or ruined it, depending on your perspective -- I began visiting regularly. There were a few restaurants I already knew: the venerable Taqueria, the 10-year-old creperie called Ti Couz, and the newer Universal Cafe (actually in nearby Potrero Hill), Delfina, and the Slanted Door. 
 Now the Mission is as alive as it has ever been, a multi-ethnic attraction for young people, affluent and not, who come for the clubs and the shops, the busy, crowded, milling, Manhattanlike scene, and especially the restaurants. Though I dined late when I was in San Francisco, each of the restaurants mentioned here was packed or close to it, as if in defiance of the national mood and the locally struggling economy. 
 None of these places are expensive, and most have spent little on decor. Velvet curtains, old mirrors and high ceilings with exposed mechanicals are the norm. The crowd is generally young -- very young -- as are the servers and chefs (often the owners). 
The energy and noise levels are high but not off the charts. The food, for the most part, is terrific and, in a happy development in the last few years, the wine-by-the-glass offerings are tremendous.

Andalu
The only consistently Iberian aspect of the two-month-old Andalu is that the plates are small; the food is supremely eclectic. The bar is topped with seltzer bottles, the high ceiling is painted sky, hung with huge paper lanterns. Like many Mission storefronts, it's three or four times as long as it is wide, with a mezzanine section overhanging the back. 
Andalu is a tad less noisy than some ofthe competition, but it's no less crowded or hip: the jade-green glass tabletops sparkle, there are high communal tables with stools in the bar area, and the smart, efficient servers are uniformly dressed in jeans and black shirts. 
The menu, which changes daily, lists "small plates" and "smaller plates," thelatter meaning side dishes and little bites -- spicy cashews, fries with gremolata (the lemon-garlic condiment traditionally served with osso buco), olives, a vegetable side dish or two. A couple of "small" plates plus dessert should be enough; this food is hearty. 
To wit: green salad with duck confit, fresh, creamy goat cheese, and pomegranate seeds; crunchy, hot polenta fries with a light tomato dipping sauce; brandade -- salt cod creamed with loads of garlic and potatoes -- topped with lemon-garlic mayonnaise; steak tartare; crisp-sauteed skate with garlic mashed potatoes; portobello mushroom with bone marrow and bread crumbs; and a few pieces of suckling pig on a gratin of potatoes. With these my three companions and I drank a fine viognier from Bonterra Vineyards ($43) in Mendocino, chosen from a lovely wine list that includes some 40 wines by the glass. 
There were less successful dishes, like a wild mushroom pot pie that was simply dull and an underseasoned lamb "osso buco" (a cross-cut of shank) with chickpea puree. And desserts were uneven: fresh doughnut holes -- served with hot chocolate that could have been thicker and richer -- were soggy and underdone. But a "salad" of cooked pear, fresh shortbread cookies and mint was original and successful. 

Alma
A nuevo-Latino restaurant whose food does not rely heavily on either sugar or chiles -- as so many do -- Alma seeks a balance between the nuevo and the Latino. Four ceviches -- fish marinated with acidic ingredients to "cook" it, served cold -- top the menu, and we ordered "un poco de todo," a sampling of scallops in a delicious sauce of cucumber and lemon spiked with palm oil; fine tuna with scallions and spicy coconut milk; squid and octopus in lime and squid ink; and striped bass with onions and orange. 
Of the first courses, a crab-and-corn flan with annatto cream and salsa verde was the most attention-grabbing: it was tender, subtle and devoured in three minutes. Spinach and queso blanco empanadas needed salt despite a complex chile sofrito; spinach salad was topped with crisp plantains and a sweet persimmon vinaigrette. 
Alma's wine list totals 40 bottles, drawn entirely from Iberia and former Iberian colonies. I enjoyed a full-bodied, rough-and-soft red from the Douro region of Portugal, the 1998 Quinta do Vale ($39).
Each of the four main courses we sampled had something to recommend it: a simple grilled pork chop was served with wonderful garlic-scallion mashed potatoes and a fiery jicama cabbage slaw; expertly seared local halibut was topped with irresistible slow-cooked onions; grilled hanger steak, served with a creamy gratin of potatoes and hearts of palm, sported a smoky bacon-chile sauce; and duck breast with sweet plantains had a rich, deep sauce of red wine and pomegranates, along with braised lacinato kale, a superior gardener's variety. Not that you will need them, but yucca fries, scented with cumin, are worth ordering. 
Desserts did not measure up: ice creams were rich and creamy, but chocolate jalapeno is an unsuccessful combination that I thought went out with 80's fusion. The cinnamon ice cream that accompanied a good apple crisp was delicious, but the crisp itself was unexciting, as was banana bread pudding. 
Alma's design is typical Mission, a mishmash of Western cliches: a cavernous space with white stucco walls in back washed blue in front, Moroccan blown-glass light fixtures, rustic wood trim and a Victorian mirror. Two huge windows provide a vista of the street scene. 

The Slanted Door
Despite being called a Vietnamese fusion restaurant, implying that it serves Westernized Vietnamese food, the Slanted Door in fact is similar to the best restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City. Its cuisine is modernized Vietnamese influenced by the more sophisticated cuisines of Thailand and China. 
The place looks good: like Andalu, it's narrow and deep, with a mezzanine section. The floors are cherry-stained; the bar is green wood, the tables faux marble. Although the Slanted Door looks informal, both service and the presentation of the food compare favorably with those of more expensive Asian restaurants. 
Along with Delfina, the Slanted Door is one of the first places in the Mission recommended to out-of-towners, and with good reason: the food is consistently fine. A shredded salad with green papaya, tofu, carrots and celeriac is flavored with a sweet-sour-hot dressing and rau ram, a Vietnamese herb not unlike cilantro; its flavors are clear and clean. Soup with won tons of shrimp and pork and fresh egg noodles is close to ideal, the stock flavorful and soothing, the won tons and noodles fresh, tender and tasty. And glass noodles (mung bean thread) with crab meat is subtle despite its flavoring of black pepper, garlic, nam pla (Southeast Asian fish sauce) and cilantro. Less exciting, but only by comparison, are daikon rice cakes with a good soy dressing; squid stir-fried with Thai basil and tofu; and shrimp with caramelized onions, a traditional Vietnamese dish. 
Here, too, desserts are not up to the rest of the food. With the exception of a creative and delicious jackfruit ice cream, I found them unexciting. 

Foreign Cinema
The best looking of this group of restaurants, Foreign Cinema is not just a good idea -- in its inner courtyard, old movies are projected onto a neighboring building -- but a good restaurant. New chefs -- John Clark and Gayle Pirie, a husband-and-wife team -- have boosted the level of the food considerably since I first ate there over a year ago. 
You enter through a long hallway, pass a couple of bars, then either walk directly into the courtyard, which has drive-in movie speakers set near the tables, or to the dining room and kitchen. The room is huge (the building once housed a department store), two stories high with windows overlooking the courtyard -- I caught glimpses of "Ivan the Terrible" while I ate -- a central fireplace and the projector-equipped mezzanine. Some tables are covered, others are polished black marble, with black chairs. It's a swank, swell place. 
Much of the food is very good but there are inconsistencies: cured sardines were magnificent, as was duck liver crouton with pear salad; eagerly anticipated beef tongue salad was left unfinished and pronounced unexciting. Super-garlicky brandade fared better; the top was nicely browned, and it was served with a few caper berries, a nice touch. Main courses varied. Sliced pork loin with lavender was sensational, and the accompaniments lavish: treviso (a kind of chicory), earthy mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms and bacon. Similarly winning was sea bass with fried potatoes, cranberry and green beans, a couple of pieces of artichoke, and two sauces, one green the other aioli -- talk about a plateful. But fettuccine with chanterelles, sage, squash, butter, pecorino and bread crumbs was muddy, even boring, and grilled steak with peppercorns not much better. 
Desserts displayed similar ups and downs. Lemon eclair with strawberries did not live up to its promise, but double chocolate ice cream was delicious; sorbets of Muscat grape and tangerine were creamy and intensely fruity; chocolate pot de creme was disappointing. 

Luna Park
A neon sign outside ("Luna Park -- Kitchen and Cocktails") signals this big open room with high ceilings, polished cement floor with area rugs, booths made of pews and the nearly requisite velvet curtains. The service is informal but professional, and youthful. You could think of it as a new-age diner, given the high-quality food that is anachronistically inexpensive. A small wine list -- about 40 bottles -- includes a smattering of French wines (I had a Bandol white for $20) along with those from California. 
My favorite dish was a "sandwich" of breaded pork cutlets stuffed with mushrooms and Gruyere, served with a pile of slender green beans, mashed potatoes with a hint of garlic, and fresh apple-cranberry sauce; obviously this isn't haute cuisine, but the combination was appealing. Whole sand dabs -- local flatfish -- were fried and served with a bearnaiselike sauce on a bed of spinach and roasted potatoes. Split, flattened and pan-grilled chicken -- crisp, tender and juicy -- came with grilled Brussels sprouts, a heaven-sent preparation. 
Desserts shine here. S'mores feature homemade graham crackers with a cup each of fudge and marshmallows sitting over individual candles; you combine them yourself. Bananas Foster -- caramelized bananas with banana ice cream and rum -- were a bit sloppy but delicious. And coconut cream pie was perfect.

Bill of fare: lively, eclectic
The Mission is a fairly large neighborhood, but the area under consideration here is small, bordered roughly by Guerrero to the west and Mission to the east, and running from about 16th to 23rd Streets; you can easily walk from place to place in 10 to 15 minutes.
The problem is getting there. If you are anywhere near a BART (subway) stop, there are stations on Mission at both 16th and 24th Streets. Driving isn't bad, but parking is; ask if a restaurant has valet parking. Cabs are not plentiful. 
All credit cards are accepted, except where noted below. Reservations are recommended, but at lunch you can just stroll in. Smoking is not permitted in California restaurants. 
Andalu, 3198 16th, at Guerrero; (415) 621-2211. Dinner only, closed Sunday. Dinner for two with wine, about $60. 
Alma, 1101 Valencia, near 22nd; (415) 401-8959. Dinner only, closed Sunday. MasterCard and Visa only. Ceviches about $4 each, four for $11; other starters are around $6, and most main courses $15 to $17. Dinner for two with wine, about $70. 
The Slanted Door, 584 Valencia, near 17th; (415) 861-8032. Lunch and dinner daily. Visa and MasterCard only. Dinner for two with wine, $75. 
Foreign Cinema, 2534 Mission, near 21st; (415) 648-7600. Dinner only, closed Monday. The film schedule is at www.foreigncinema.com. Valet parking, $8. Smoking is permitted in the courtyard except when it is covered by a tent (which it is from now until spring). Dinner for two with wine, $90. 
Luna Park, 694 Valencia, near 18th; (415) 553-8584. Lunch Monday through Friday, dinner nightly. With a $17 Trimbach pinot blanc, two could eat here for about $70.

HEADLINE: Sitting Down With Frank Lloyd Wright 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE CURTIS; WAYNE CURTIS is a contributing editor at Preservation magazine.

 BODY:
IN the early 1940's the Iowa businessman Lowell Walter wrote to Frank Lloyd Wright asking that he design a home for him. Wright's reply -- in its entirety -- read: "My dear Mr. Walter: We will design a dwelling for you. Send further details. There will be no basement nor any attic."
 Wright's correspondence is now neatly encased behind glass at Cedar Rock, the home Wright eventually designed for Walter. And Wright's economical letter points up the aggravation of trying to get a grip on his genius. His structures, more than not, tend to be defined by what they lack. 
 No basement nor any attic, of course. But Wright's list of other taboos is legendary: no unsightly structural beams obstructing corner views, no bric-a-brac on shelves, no interior trim, no light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. ("Consider everything in the nature of a hanging fixture a weakness, and naked radiators an abomination.") No plastering, no paint, no gutters, no downspouts. No unneeded rooms, no unnecessary detail or ornament. Nothing in "pessimistic" blues or purples, and no colors from "the ribbon counter." No double hung windows. No interior doors and no garages. 
What's left? A Wright-fueled cultural-industrial complex manufactures increasingly lavish accounts of his legacy -- I recently saw a coffee table book large enough for a dining room table -- yet, for me at least, the Wright industry has long failed to answer that one simple question. 
So on a two-week road trip several years ago from the southern plains to New England, I plotted to visit as many Wright buildings as possible. With a copy of "Wright Sites," a handy guidebook published by the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, I sketched out a Wright marathon from Oklahoma to New Hampshire. It would require stamina and good fortune (some places are open only a few days each month). Luck was with me. I managed to get inside 11 Wright homes and buildings, and saw another dozen or so from outside. 
Yet showing up on the doorstep of a Wright masterwork with tour ticket in hand turned out to be the easy part. Tours of many Wright buildings proved to be nearly as impenetrable as the coffee table books. I would be shown inside. I would briskly follow a guide who was impressively capable of walking, talking and pointing at the same time. Just as I was getting a dim sense of the place, the exit door would close behind me and I would find myself standing on a gravel walkway still spinning from the speed of the tour. I often left a Wright home with the same mental image I had earlier acquired from book and magazine photos.
Architectural historians note that Wright was famous for subtle sleights of hand, and I looked forward to being conned by these. For instance, he often obscured his entryways to force visitors to closely examine his houses before entering. He also cleverly manipulated interior spaces, making a room seem larger, for example, by obliging people to enter through a claustrophobic hallway. 
But on the tours we were usually led inside as a lowing herd, sometimes following an entrance sign hammered into the lawn. And any claustrophobia tended to come from the nearness of my fellow travelers, who pressed in from every direction no matter how large the space. 
Other distractions: There was the lady in the wide-brim straw hat at Fallingwater, Wright's renowned work in southwestern Pennsylvania, who inhaled theatrically each time she entered a room, giving rise to concerns that she was succumbing to advanced respiratory failure. There was the guide in Chicago who kept losing his patter and, after wandering silently for some seconds across the empty plains of his memory, would repeat a few sentences of his spiel to jump-start his recollection.
And then there were the blue paper booties. Twice we were asked to slip paper booties over our shoes, as if preparing to enter a silicon chip laboratory. This is all well in principle -- no one wants to muddy the floor -- but it added more than a paper's thickness of distance between me and the home. At Taliesin, Wright's home and studio in the verdant Wisconsin hills, I found myself warily edging across a highly polished stone floor as if on a moon walk, arms outstretched for balance yet mindful that I not touch the walls. In the weirdness of it all, the house got lost. 
My search for Wright evolved into something like the children's game of "getting warmer, getting colder." Most of the time, distracted by docents and other pilgrims, I felt as if I were getting colder. But during a few exceptional moments I thought I could feel Wright's breath on the back of my neck. 
At Taliesin, our group entered the extraordinary living room, a sort of laboratory where he tinkered with ideas that would become staples of modern home design. Here we were invited to sit in the original chairs as our guide described Wright's innovations -- his use of uneven stone on the walls, his selection of patterns in the carpet to echo the landscape outside. 
But the most lasting impression came when we were told how he had slyly enhanced the sense of overhead space: by lopping several inches off the legs of the Marshall Field's chairs in which we sat. In unison, we all looked up. Experiencing this was far more memorable than noting it from the far side of a red rope.
The Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Ill., serves as a sort of de facto Frank Lloyd Wright National Park -- it's home to Wright's first studio and more than two dozen early Wright buildings. The Wright Plus Housewalk, which allows visitors to see some of the interiors, is held here each year on the third Saturday in May. At any time of year, though, knots of visitors walk the streets with guidebooks, regarding the place with the sort of quiet reverence one might expect to witness in a redwood grove. 
At Unity Temple there, one of Wright's earliest and most audacious buildings, my self-guided tour featured a small tape player with headphones and a disembodied voice that ushered me from room to room. When in the heart of the temple, the voice instructed me to sit in a pew. And there I sat, while several minutes of Bach were piped through the headset, blessedly free of commentary, as the building performed its quiet magic. This was one of the highlights of my Wright expedition. (Alas, the tape has been discontinued in favor of printed handouts).
One of Wright's early Prairie-style homes in Oak Park, the Edwin H. Cheney House, is now a bed-and-breakfast, with three guest rooms. With my reservation in hand, I arrived early on a spring evening and was greeted by the innkeeper. I was the sole guest, and after showing me my room, he handed over the keys and left for a meeting. 
I wasted no time in undertaking a full reconnaissance of the home, striding through the rooms and consuming the place in huge, avaricious bites as I sought to inventory its distinctive features. Not 15 minutes had passed before I was beset by a sort of architectural indigestion, compounded by that unique numbness familiar to those who visit too many museums in too short a time.
Defeated, I made my way to the living room where there was a pool table and a radio. I found a blues station and turned it up. I shot several racks. And as the house faded into the background over the next couple of hours, something curious happened. It came into focus -- its perfect scale and proportions, its respectful use of natural materials, its impeccable design as a sort of Parthenon of modern living. The place felt tailored to my size and mood.
It was at that moment that I found what I was looking for: goose bumps, an homage to Wright's genius. 
Perhaps his greatest sleight of hand was making his houses resistant to tours and picture-taking and the nattering of guides. Wright designed them for living.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Pasadena

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN; RICK LYMAN is a cultural correspondent in the Los Angeles bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
That Pasadena is more than a sleepy haven for Midwestern transplants and middle-class commuters is pretty old news by now. The little old lady from Pasadena has grandchildren who are old ladies by now.
 Indeed, the renaissance that transformed the retail and dining strip along Colorado Boulevard into one of the most crowded and energetic night-life destinations in Southern California is well over a decade old, which puts this small, palm-lined city in the position of continually trying to reinvent itself, or at least find fresh ways to keep it buzzing. 
 The latest effort is a three-square-block development that opened in September called Paseo Colorado, a mix of retail, commercial and residential spaces along Colorado Boulevard between Marengo and Los Robles Avenues. Its Mediterranean theme is intended to complement the red-tile roofs and craftsman bungalows of the surrounding area. TrizecHahn, the designer, is also behind the recently opened Hollywood and Highland development several miles to the west in Hollywood. 
Paseo Colorado was billed as a nearly 13-acre urban village, a network of open-air walkways, fountained plazas and elegant staircases, with shops and restaurants lining secluded courtyards and storefronts. If the resulting complex feels a bit more suburban shopping mall than urban commercial strip, at least the project works as a magnet to extend the bustle of Colorado Boulevard a few blocks farther east. Its central design element, an open swath that carves the development in two, opens a wonderful esplanade connecting Pasadena's beautiful Beaux-Arts city hall with its stately Civic Auditorium a few blocks to the south.
If you ignore the clatter of skateboarders and the presence of standard-issue mall shops, Paseo Colorado can even act as a pleasant starting point for a meander through Old Pasadena, an eight-square-block area where tattoo parlors still sit alongside aromatic ethnic cafes and pricey boutiques. 

Events
The grand event on Pasadena's calendar remains the annual Tournament of Roses -- beginning at 8 New Year's morning with the Rose Parade through the center of the city and culminating with the Rose Bowl football game. The game is on Jan. 3 instead of Jan. 1 this time, because it is being played for the national college championship. A limited number of game tickets will go on sale Tuesday at 8 a.m. Pacific time through Ticketmaster, (213) 365-3550. They will cost $150 each and are limited to two a call. 
Tickets to the parade route's 125,000 grandstand seats are on sale through Sharp Seating, (626) 795-4171 ($35 to $80), and Marsden Brothers, (310) 454-3511 ($58 and $62). But it's also possible to claim a curbside spot on the parade route, which runs east along Colorado Boulevard from Orange Grove Boulevard through Old Pasadena to Sierra Madre Boulevard, where it veers north for a few blocks to its terminus at Villa Street. The trick is that city law prohibits staking a claim to a piece of the curb until noon on New Year's Eve (folding chairs and sleeping bags only), and some stretches fill up almost immediately. The Pasadena police operate a hot line, (626) 744-4598, about the rules and best tactics. From Dec. 28 to Jan. 3, information will also be available at (626) 793-9911. The theme of the 2002 parade will be "Good Times," with Regis Philbin as grand marshal. 
Of course, there is more to Pasadena than football and rose petals. The Pasadena Playhouse, a top regional theater, will present Neil Simon's "Biloxi Blues" from Jan. 11 to Feb. 24, followed by the Los Angeles premiere of David Hare's "Blue Room" March 8 to April 21. Tickets run $29.50 to $44.50 and can be ordered at (626) 356-7529. The playhouse, at 39 South El Molino Avenue, is just off the eastern edge of the Colorado strip; www.pasadenaplayhouse.org. 
The Pasadena Civic Auditorium's musical series will present the Moscow Classical Ballet's version of "The Nutcracker" from Dec. 19 to 23, followed from Jan. 30 to Feb. 3 by a dual production of "Swan Lake" and "Spartacus" by the Moscow Grigorovich Ballet. Tickets for "The Nutcracker" are $21 to $57, and for 'Swan Lake/Spartacus" $26.25 to $67, at www.pasadenamusicals.com and the auditorium, 300 East Green Street; (626) 449-7360. 

Sightseeing
The Colorado strip is bracketed by two of the region's most interesting museums. At the Pacific Asia Museum, 46 North Los Robles Avenue a half-block north of Paseo Colorado, (626) 449-2742 and at www .pacificasiamuseum.org, a show of hauntingly beautiful Japanese baskets, "Bamboo Masterworks From the Lloyd Cotsen Collection," runs through Jan. 13. But the small, slightly ramshackle museum has a fascinating permanent collection of Chinese ceramics, Southeast Asian and Indian sculpture, Buddhist art from the Himalayas and South Asia and Japanese decorative arts. General admission is $5, and it is open Wednesday through Sunday. 
The Norton Simon Museum, a much grander institution, sits on a gentle bluff about a mile to the west at 411 West Colorado Boulevard; (626) 449-6840, www.nortonsimon .org. An extensive and impressive remodeling of the galleries and gardens was completed in October 1999. The permanent collection features Old Masters, Impressionists and Southeast Asian art. Through Feb. 11, it also has "Pop Culture!" an exhibition of works by Warhol, Lichtenstein, Oldenburg and others. The museum is open every day but Tuesday. General admission, $6. 
One of the real jewels of Southern California, the breathtaking Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, is a short drive to the southeast, at 1151 Oxford Road in the suburb of San Marino; (626) 405-2100, www.huntington.org. The nearly 150 acres of gardens contain more than 14,000 species of plants. The Huntington's art collection is home to Gainsborough's "Blue Boy," while its library displays a Gutenberg Bible from 1455 and the Ellesmere manuscript of "The Canterbury Tales" from 1410. General admission is $10. Closed Monday and holidays.
A few blocks north of downtown, the Gamble House, 4 Westmoreland Place, (626) 793-3334 and www .gamblehouse.org, is one of the finest examples of the American Arts and Crafts style. It was built in 1908 as the retirement home for David Berry Gamble, a scion of the Procter & Gamble fortune. Tours of the house, with its rich wood interiors, stained-glass windows and interlocked balconies, are given noon to 3 p.m. Thursday through Sunday. Tickets, sold from 10 a.m. (11:30 on Sunday), are $8, $5 for students and those over 65. 

Where to Stay
Those wishing to be close to the action in Old Pasadena can try the Sheraton Pasadena, 303 East Cordova Street, (626) 449-4000, fax (626) 584-1390, www.sheratonpasadena .com, about two blocks off Colorado Boulevard and not far from the new Paseo Colorado. The modern five-story hotel has 317 rooms in traditional decor, a heated outdoor pool, a tennis court, fitness room and business center. Double rooms start at $99 and run as high as $225 on the Club Level, which requires a key to access. 
Budget: The Econo Lodge Pasadena, 2860 East Colorado Boulevard, (626) 792-3700, fax (626) 792-0244, has 33 rooms on three floors. All rooms have a refrigerator. Rates start at $44, with a large room with a hot tub going for $79 or $89.
A few blocks closer to Old Pasadena is the Comfort Inn, 2462 East Colorado Boulevard, (626) 405-0811, fax (626) 796-0966, with 54 rooms on three floors wrapped around a lawn. The hotel also has an outdoor pool, hot tub and sauna. Doubles: $73 to $160 around New Year's.
Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton, Huntington Hotel and Spa, 1401 South Oak Knoll Avenue, (626) 568-3900, fax (626) 568-1842, www.ritzcarlton.com, is on a refurbished 1908 estate amid lush gardens. The 392-room hotel is vaguely like the biggest Mediterranean villa you've ever seen, except bigger. Doubles, decorated in traditional English style, start around $250, although the hotel also offers many discount packages with spa treatments, champagne and restaurant vouchers. Suites begin at $475. 
In South Pasadena, the Artists' Inn and Cottage is a bed-and-breakfast in a Victorian house and nearby cottage at 1038 Magnolia Street; (626) 799-5668, www.artistsinn.com. There is a full breakfast, of course, and tea and sweets at 4 p.m. Each of the nine rooms -- costing $115 to $205 -- has its own theme, either a specific artist (the Van Gogh Room is based on "Van Gogh's Bedroom") or a style (the Expressionist Suite "reflects the pure colors of Matisse, Picasso and Dufy"). 

Where to Eat
Pasadena has a lively, eclectic dining scene, with small, ethnic places tucked away here and there. An excellent example of the upscale storefront restaurant typical of the downtown district is Bistro 45, 45 South Mentor Avenue, (626) 795-2478, in a pretty Art Deco building a half-block south of Colorado Boulevard. It has a spare interior and simple white tablecloths in three inviting dining areas. The food is French bistro fare with California-style preparations. A popular appetizer is the crispy New Zealand calamari with a spicy red mustard dip ($8.45), and a popular main course is Canadian Duck Two Ways -- a leg confit and rare seared breast ($25.45). Dinner for two with wine is about $120. Closed Monday.
In a growing restaurant district along South Arroyo Parkway, the bustling Arroyo Chop House, 536 South Arroyo Parkway, (626) 577-7463, is the antithesis of light, fussy California fare. This steakhouse has big, modernist booths and hanging plants; it features large portions of prime aged beef, double-cut chops and huge lobsters. Dinner for two with wine is around $120. 
Yujean Kang's is one of the best Chinese places in the Los Angeles area. In a nondescript storefront just off Colorado Boulevard, at 67 North Raymond Avenue, (626) 585-0855, the small, unpretentious restaurant is frequently crowded with large families. Among the many popular appetizers is minced chicken in a lettuce cup ($6), and main courses include fresh fish sauteed in a spicy sesame sauce with asparagus ($15). Dinner for two with wine shouldn't cost more than $75.
In the heart of the Colorado Strip is the American-bistro-themed Cheesecake Factory, 2 West Colorado Boulevard, (626) 584-6000, part of an intensely popular Southern California chain (there can be long waits). Favorites on the eclectic menu include an avocado egg roll appetizer ($7.95) and the Cajun jambalaya pasta entree ($15.95). The 35 flavors of cheesecake start at $5.75 for a plain original slice and go up to $6.95 for one topped with fresh strawberries. Dinner for two with wine, about $65.
The Pie 'n Burger, 913 East California Boulevard, (626) 795-1123, an unadorned storefront a few blocks west of the California Institute of Technology, is essentially one long, undulating Formica counter facing a tiny kitchen and a line of milkshake and soda machines. Always crowded, it prides itself on its burgers (beef, chicken, turkey or vegetarian), chili, shakes and fresh pies. A hamburger costs $4.95; fruit pies are $2.75 a slice.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN IDEAS: A TO Z. 

 BODY:
When looking back at the end of a year, we usually regard the 12 months that have just passed as a series of momentous events, a parade of notable individuals or a gallery of compelling images. But these are not the only ways to capture the arc and rhythm of a year. For this special issue, The Times Magazine has chosen a different lens: ideas. Presenting 2001 as the latest volume in the encyclopedia of human innovation, "The Year in Ideas" offers not a summary of the year's major news stories but a catalog of 80 notions, inventions, conceptual swerves and philosophical leaps that mattered this year and may well continue to matter in years to come. 
 Of course, not every idea that makes its mark on a culture is necessarily a big one or a good one. (Remember supply-side economics? New Coke?) Certainly, 2001 is no different. It was a year that was marked both by advancements and by backward thinking, by major breakthroughs and by ephemeral obsessions. Our catalog trys to capture this variety. Frivolous ideas are given the same prominence as weighty ones; the diabolical sits side by side with the noble. 
In its attempt to chronicle our pell-mell culture in all its guises, this encyclopedia is far less august than its leather-bound forebears. (Thanks to some outlandish headline contortions, however, it is as alphabetically comprehensive as any Britannica.) The intention here was not to be authoritative; it was to recapture the childhood delight of paging through a World Book for the first time. Indeed, if you feel that some of the year's important ideas are missing from this catalog, you are probably right. At the same time, we would be surprised if you didn't encounter for the first time at least a dozen intriguing new ones.
Such a playful approach may seem like a strange way to document a year that has witnessed so much tragedy. Yet the grim events of this fall should not overshadow the many ways the human mind keeps pushing our world in bold new directions. A few years ago, at the height of the Internet boom, it became commonplace in Silicon Valley to believe that a single great idea could change the world. Even though our world has hardly turned out to be as utopian as those thinkers imagined, the Net prophets were definitely on to something. For ideas -- big and small, good and evil -- are the engines of history. They inspire progress and they justify cruel regimes. A new idea that permeates the culture can quicken the pulse of our daily lives; it can also bring that culture to a standstill. Indeed, a quick flip through this encyclopedia, we think, will make the case that 2001 was, for better or worse, a year bursting with ideas -- from noble to vulgar, from crucial to trivial, from A to Z.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN IDEAS: A TO Z.; 
Air Taxis

BYLINE:  By Richard Siklos

 BODY:
Even before the threat of terrorism made commercial flight in the United States a particularly anxious affair, frustration among business travelers over curbside congestion and flight delays was simmering. A growing number of affluent travelers -- mostly high-level executives -- were enjoying travel by private jet, and fractional ownership schemes were making the trend more affordable. In May, United Airlines surprised the aviation world by ordering 200 small jets and announcing plans to enter the fractional business itself. As one United executive put it at the time, "We had to do something -- our first-class cabins are emptying out." 
 United is not alone in pursuing the new small-plane, short-haul services dubbed "air taxis." Because of recent breakthroughs in the development of small, low-cost aircraft, a vast new network of air taxis could soon emerge for economy-class passengers as well. The author James Fallows made the case for the air-taxi idea in his book "Free Flight: From Airline Hell to a New Age of Travel," published in June. As Fallows explained, 98 percent of Americans live within a 30-minute drive of a small airport. The 5,400 best-equipped of these airstrips could handle 500 million takeoffs each year, yet currently they handle just 37 million. A new generation of small aircraft -- led by the Eclipse 500 jet -- should soon make air-taxi businesses operated out of these airfields economically feasible. Scheduled to make its debut in early 2004, the Eclipse 500 -- designed to take five passengers at 400 miles per hour -- is less than a quarter the price of a typical corporate jet. 
 After the Sept. 11 attacks, existing charter aircraft companies reported a burst in business. One proponent of next-generation air taxis, Richard Noble, recently told a trade publication: "The concept of the air taxi is more valid than ever. People want to travel with people they know. And these aircraft are too small to be dangerous." Richard Siklos

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN IDEAS: A TO Z.; 
American Imperialism, Embraced

BYLINE:  By Kevin Baker

 BODY:
This year a new conservative movement, led by William Kristol's Project for the New American Century, formed around a single idea: support for a new, proud American imperialism. The debate on whether America is an imperial power is over, P.N.A.C.'s scholars insist; the American empire is real. The challenge now is to figure out what to do with it.
 "We had better get used to seeing ourselves as others see us," says Tom Donnelly, P.N.A.C.'s deputy executive director. "It doesn't matter if we don't consider ourselves an empire. Others see us as impinging on their lives, their space, their way of life. If we are going to protect our enduring interests, in the Middle East and elsewhere, then we have to do something about it." 
 So far, that something mostly boils down to spending more -- a lot more -- on the military. P.N.A.C. has deluged the Bush administration and Congress with articles and press releases calling for vast increases in the defense budget, and expressing suspicion about Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's ideas on "reforming the military." They claim that military spending fell to less than 3.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product during the Clinton years, "back to pre-World War II levels." The new imperialists would like it to return to its cold war average of 10 percent of G.D.P., increasing the defense budget by at least $75 billion to $100 billion per year.
"We'd better understand the full range of tasks we want our military to do, from Balkans-like constabulary missions to no-fly zones to maintaining enough big-war capacity," Donnelly contends. The P.N.A.C. wants it all -- a military that can confront China over Taiwan, throw up a missile defense, remove Saddam Hussein from power, fight two conventional wars at the same time and effectively hunt down terrorists, drug lords and guerrillas.
Donnelly refers longingly to the strategies and tactics of the old British Empire, back when it was policing the Raj and maintaining the Pax Britannica. But the American empire is different, he says, in that it holds no territorial ambitions. 
"The fundamental difference between America and other, past empires is that we don't issue writs in Washington that we expect others to follow," Donnelly says. Rather, our new manifest destiny is to disseminate our values. "We have seen the spread of liberty in our own country as our power spreads, as well as around the world," he says. "As we have grown more powerful, we have extended rights to women, to racial minorities, to everyone." These are the values -- along with free-market capitalism -- that the American empire should stand for, the new imperialists maintain.
In Afghanistan, Donnelly speaks of "economic development" and long-term diplomatic engagement aimed at "not just winning the war, but creating a stable peace." He rejects talk of an "easy-exit strategy" and demands that we commit American troops to a peace-keeping force and take the lead in building "some sort of state structure in Afghanistan." 
Historically, America's most ambitious imperialist projects have been undertaken during some of the more progressive periods in American history. Conservatives have generally been more skeptical of attempts to impress American values upon foreign nations. So it's no surprise that the debate over imperialism has exposed deep fissures in the national conservative movement. Donnelly's most intractable opposition comes from other conservatives -- including much of the administration's foreign policy establishment. Bush's foreign policy, after all -- at least prior to Sept. 11 -- has been based upon a partial global disengagement; a self-interested, "realistic" unilateralism. P.N.A.C.'s analysts criticize the "almost contemptuous rejection" with which the administration has backed out of international agreements.
Kristol sees domestic political advantage in the imperial strategy; in an essay, he and Robert Kagan promise that the new imperialism will make the Republican Party "once again the party of Reagan -- a party that stands for that 'distinctly American internationalism' that we believe a majority of Americans embrace."

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
Using Forms Ingrained in Ballet To Help the Body Move Beyond It

BYLINE:  By ROSLYN SULCAS; Roslyn Sulcas's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about ballet dancers who go on working even in their spare time.

 BODY:
THE word "ballet" doesn't instantly come to mind when looking at the work of William Forsythe. The dancers of the Frankfurt Ballet, the company he has directed since 1984, move in undefinable ways, their bodies arcing and convulsing around invisible forms, their limbs swerving in contrary directions and their movements apparently refracted from one part of the body to another with no implicit reference to any predetermined dance vocabulary. Nonetheless, for many dance lovers, the American-born Mr. Forsythe is the choreographer who is most important to the present and future of ballet, because he has immeasurably enlarged our notions of what the art form can do both physically and theatrically. 
 This view holds more currency in Europe than in the United States, where the breadth of Mr. Forsythe's oeuvre is little known. The handful of his ballets -- "In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated," "The Second Detail," "Herman Schmerman," "The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude" -- that are scattered through the repertories of almost every major ballet company in the world offer one particular aspect of his work; they are what Mr. Forsythe refers to as the "ballet ballets." 
 Mr. Forsythe studied at the Joffrey Ballet School in New York after attending Jacksonville University in Florida and danced briefly in the Joffrey corps before joining the Stuttgart Ballet in 1973, at age 23. He has lived in Germany ever since, making his first ballets for Stuttgart under Marcia Haydee's direction and becoming the company's resident choreographer, then leaving in 1980 to pursue a freelance career. While some early ballets for Stuttgart and the Joffrey Ballet were seen in New York in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Forsythe's ground-breaking works for the Frankfurt Ballet have been presented in this country only on tours in 1987 and 1988, and in 1998 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Beginning on Friday and continuing through Dec. 20, the Frankfurt Ballet returns to the Academy to perform three works -- "Enemy in the Figure," "Quintett" and "Woolf Phrase" -- that encompass the last 13 years of Mr. Forsythe's career and demonstrate something more of the breadth of his canon.
Made in 1989, "Enemy in the Figure" uses balletic lines and is set to a ticking, brooding score by Thom Willems, the Dutch composer who has collaborated with Mr. Forsythe since 1985, playing an important role in his artistic development. Like "In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated," which Mr. Forsythe created for the Paris Opera Ballet two years earlier, "Enemy in the Figure" evokes the contemporary dynamism and aesthetic of George Balanchine's plotless, pared-down "leotard" ballets, pushed to new extremes. But the work, largely performed off point, takes ballet further by incorporating some of the compositional techniques that Mr. Forsythe and his dancers were starting to develop in the course of creating new work.
One of these is called "isometries," which Mr. Forsythe described as "learning to develop a feeling for transferring the shape or form of one part of the body to another part, so, for example, the curve of an arm might be translated onto the whole body or the line between waist and neck." In "Enemy in the Figure," the dancers move in angled, disjointed configurations, their ballet-trained limbs mutating into entirely unexpected shapes, their bodies appearing as polyphonous instruments that can generate movement from any point, rather than taking impetus (as ballet teaches) from the legs and arms around a vertical body.
But the steps are only part of the picture. The work is also thrillingly, wildly theatrical. Making use of an undulating wooden screen positioned diagonally across the stage, a rope that pulses irregularly across the floor and a floodlight on wheels that is guided by the dancers, Mr. Forsythe creates a dark and mesmerizing poem about vision and perception, form and chaos, with remarkable economy of means. "The rolling light happened to be onstage from an opera production when we were rehearsing," he said recently. "It turned out to be an interesting way of manipulating the space, and of revealing and concealing the dancers. It's not always obvious: sometimes light can conceal by illuminating something so brightly that other things are obscured by contrast." 
In "Enemy in the Figure," the lighting (which Mr. Forsythe designs for all his work) is an explicit visual element, analogous to decor or props and as integral to the ballet as the steps. His interest in lighting and how he deploys it to carve out theatrical space is new in ballet and has exerted an enormous influence on a generation of choreographers, particularly in Europe.
YET in "Quintett," from 1993, the dancing is paramount and shows further developments in Mr. Forsythe's choreographic style. To a haunting score by Gavin Bryars, the dancers move on unsteady, buckling limbs, their movements dissolving into and collapsing upon one another in a poignant series of encounters and solos. Their swooping, liquid movements are the result of techniques that trace a muscular process as it passes through the body: here, balletic form is visible but the steps themselves are not, as if their dynamics have been erased, leaving mere vestiges of their shapes. The removal of the physical dominance that ballet technique offers engenders a curious sense of vulnerability that has much to do with the context of the ballet's creation: Mr. Forsythe made it for his terminally ill wife, the dancer Tracey-Kai Maier, "as a kind of love letter that she never saw; she was too ill." (Ms. Maier died of ovarian cancer in 1994; she was 32.)
Mr. Forsythe reaches into what might be called the balletic unconscious in "Quintett," moving his dancers' bodies around the idea of codified ballet steps ("tracing a space around an arabesque rather than doing the arabesque," he offered as an example), creating startlingly complex interactions between dancers that often appear to defy physical logic.
In the recently created duo "Woolf Phrase," Mr. Forsythe constructed the dance passages (which are interspersed with spoken text from Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway") "around the rhythm of Woolf's language." Here, his engagement with the language of ballet appears even more distant. "There isn't a real ballet step in it," he said. "But it does require a ballet technique." Epaulement, the alignment of head, shoulders and hips that is crucial to ballet, Mr. Forsythe said, "has to be in the hands and head."
As Mr. Forsythe suggests by these comments, his current engagement with the language of classical dance is much looser and less recognizable than it has been in the past. But all of his work retains a deep structural relationship to that form: his development of a distinctive movement vocabulary has emerged directly from his original balletic orientation. Thinking beyond ballet's means of carving out shapes in space, Mr. Forsythe used what he knew to make his dances.
The art of ballet is recombinatory: Mr. Forsythe's simple and profound insight is that the elements can be put together in unforeseen ways. "I use ballet dancers and the knowledge in their bodies," he said. "When you speak about the vocabulary of classical dance, you're talking about ideas." Those ideas are always present in his work, even when their physical enactment is not.

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
A World Tour With Pina Bausch as Guide

BYLINE:  By JACK ANDERSON 

 BODY:
PINA BAUSCH has been choreographing travelogues.
 That may seem a strange thing to say about this intensely serious exponent of the neo-expressionist form of German dance known as Tanztheater, a choreographer known for works showing men and women engaged in endless power struggles. 
 Ms. Bausch is still interested in power struggles. But for slightly more than a decade, she has also created what can be called choreographic travelogues, some with power struggles in them. Last month, during the 2001 Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, her Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch offered "Masurca Fogo" ("Fiery Mazurka"), which was inspired by Portugal, as well as by Brazil and Cape Verde, countries once controlled by Portugal. 
The first travelogue New Yorkers saw was "Palermo Palermo," an evocation of Palermo, Sicily, which came to the Academy in 1991. Five years later the American West, and California in particular, served as source material for "Nur Du" ("Only You"), which she showed in America only in Western cities. "Der Fensterputzer" ("The Window Washer"), inspired by Hong Kong, was danced at the Academy in 1997. Like most of Ms. Bausch's pieces, the travelogues are collages of movement and speech to taped collages of popular and classical music.
Artists, including choreographers, are often stimulated by specific places. And local cultural organizations frequently commission works from visiting artists. But contracts seldom require such creations to be about those places. Ms. Bausch's travelogues both concern a specific region and are sponsored by organizations in that region. "Masurca Fogo," for instance, was a co-production involving EXPO Lisbon 98 and the Goethe-Institut Lisbon, while "Nur Du" was made possible by universities in California, Arizona and Texas.
Some dancegoers might wonder if these commissions simply provide ways for Ms. Bausch to take her company globetrotting. But whatever the motivations for devising them may be, these productions have genuine artistic substance.
Ms. Bausch has become the choreographic equivalent of a travel essayist. Visiting places, she does not merely describe their attractions, as a guidebook might. Nor does she glamorize them in the manner of those old Hollywood movie shorts in which, as the sun sank in Technicolor splendor, smiling natives danced blissfully away, oblivious to all social and economic problems. Instead, Ms. Bausch choreographically comments on places in her own idiosyncratic manner.
The often bleak "Palermo Palermo" began with the startling image of a collapsing wall, as if to point out that the Sicilian city of Palermo, although rich in art and history, is also a gritty place with highly visible rubble. Contrasts in costuming between stark black clothes and fancy attire suggested extremes of poverty and wealth. And quarrels between men and women indicated that Ms. Bausch can find struggles everywhere.
Men and women got along (or failed to get along) in peculiar ways in "Nur Du," which I saw in Berkeley, Calif. Lovers taunted one another. A woman kept pouring water into the plastic bag her male partner wore over his head. A man and woman embraced in a chair with a lighted stick of dynamite beneath it. But both the dynamite and the love affair fizzled.
Such emotional complications had their genuinely humorous aspects. So, too, "Der Fensterputzer" and "Masurca Fogo" emphasized a comic strain that has never been totally absent from Ms. Bausch's choreography, although it can be obscured by a prevailing somberness.
"Nur Du" depicted California. Yet Ms. Bausch avoided the strident California-bashing to which some intellectuals are prone. Of course, she recognized how odd California can be. Scenes in which dancers kept taking off their clothes to gaze at their bodies with pleasure or horror mocked the obsession with physical fitness shared by many Californians. A man in a dress flounced and preened as if he were pining to be a glamorous movie star. Another man portrayed a transvestite hairdresser obviously bored by the women who came to his beauty salon.
Ms. Bausch was often poking fun. Yet her jokes seemed more affectionate than scathing. And the work's final solo suggested genuine compassion for unfortunate people. The eloquent choreography showed a man lurching about, frantically waving his arms like the wings of a fatally wounded bird. This male dying swan could symbolize all emotionally wounded mortals.
MUCH of "Die Fensterputzer" appeared festive. The stage was covered with red flowers and dancers tossed them into the air to suggest fireworks displays. Slide projections of a city skyline and bustling ensemble choreography celebrated the energy of a great metropolis. 
That metropolis was Hong Kong, a city that has experienced political transition. No one can predict what may happen next there. Appropriately enough, therefore, Ms. Bausch devised some ominous scenes. A man ran like a desperate fugitive. Later, a man trying to pass through a metal detector kept setting off alarms while stern inspectors had him remove his clothes, item by item, until the offending metal object was found: a filling in a tooth. Yet Hong Kong is not the world's only city in which there may be fugitives or security problems. And the overall tone of "Die Fensterputzer" was just genial enough to make one suspect that Ms. Bausch is cautiously optimistic about Hong Kong and, possibly, other troubled cities.
As for the new "Masurca Fogo," it was, at least for Ms. Bausch, almost unabashedly sensual. It did have its unnerving moments: for instance, a scene in which a man forced a woman's head into a basin and had her pick up fruit with her teeth. More often, however, "Masurca Fogo" affirmed eroticism. One performer told a corny dirty joke in English, the dance sequences were usually vigorous and a samba blazed with choreographic heat.
Yet moralist that she is, Ms. Bausch warned that passion can be threatening as well as liberating and that the senses have their dangers as well as their delights. Remarkably realistic films of a violent storm at sea were reminders that great natural forces of all kinds can get out of control. During the conclusion, dancers were curled up onstage, as if asleep, while films were projected showing enormous flowers opening and closing. The flowers, though lushly beautiful, were so huge that they appeared to engulf the dancers, just as people can be overwhelmed by erotic desires.
The fact that the travelogues since "Palermo Palermo" have grown generally lighter in tone prompts a few speculations. Has Ms. Bausch somehow come to feel that she must be softhearted out of politeness to the organizations and localities that sponsor her pieces? Or is she really mellowing?
The quirkiness of her travelogues surely indicates that she has not become a booster allied with any community's Chamber of Commerce. Rather, these works imply that Ms. Bausch is an inquisitive traveler who looks around her, fascinated by what she sees, and filters these sights through her artistic sensibility. 
Because, like all travelers, she brings her own intellectual baggage with her, she may inevitably remain preoccupied with power struggles. Yet her concern for the follies and foibles of places as dissimilar as Portugal and China may have broadened her sympathies. She can still castigate cruelty, but she appears willing both to smile a little and to weep a bit at certain manifestations of human foolishness. Traveling around the world, she finds streets everywhere littered with broken hearts. She sighs over some of them. But she choreographically turns others into funny Valentines.

Philadelphia Gets A New Concert Hall A Century Aborning

BYLINE:  By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
FIVE days, more or less, until the opening of a new hall for the Philadelphia Orchestra, but who's counting?
 Well, in a city that time often seems to have forgotten, the countdown began some 34,000 days ago -- before Wolfgang Sawallisch, Riccardo Muti, Eugene Ormandy and Leopold Stokowski -- in 1908, when Karl Pohlig was the orchestra's music director. It was proposed then, as it has been many times since, that the orchestra, founded in 1900, should vacate the Academy of Music, built in 1857, in favor of a hall with adequate symphonic acoustics. 
 The modern push began in 1986, when the orchestra announced a project for a new hall and set about raising money, with an eventual goal of $140, million to finance it. It selected a site on South Broad Street, a block from the academy. The campaign limped along for almost a decade with waning support and with little enthusiasm for a design presented by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown in 1987. 
"There's a long list of reasons the hall never happened," said Joseph H. Kluger, who became the orchestra's executive director in 1989 and its president in 1991. "We originally tried to go without support from the public sector. We arrogantly made the statement that we could do it all on our own. The original project was led by a small group of corporate leaders who were not successful at building consensus."
In 1995, after fund-raising leveled off at about $100 million, Edward G. Rendell, then the mayor of Philadelphia, stepped in. He galvanized public and private support as part of his effort to revitalize the city's center and create an Avenue of the Arts on South Broad Street, near City Hall. The next year, the Regional Performing Arts Center was formed to take over the hall project, which, in a new, grander design by Rafael Vinoly, grew to include a second theater and sizable public spaces all under a big glass barrel vault.
The regional center has almost finished raising the money, now $265 million, and constructing the building, the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, named for Sidney Kimmel, who made the largest single donation, some $30 million. Along with the 2,500-seat Verizon Hall, intended for the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Philly Pops and visiting attractions, it includes the 650-seat Perelman Theater, to accommodate chamber music, dance, drama and other presentations. The public spaces include a roof garden, atop the smaller hall but protected from the weather by the glass vault.
Verizon Hall opens on Friday with a gala variety show featuring the Philadelphia Orchestra only peripherally. The orchestra plays a program conducted by its music director, Mr. Sawallisch, on Saturday. And on Sunday the center presents a daylong open house, billed as the official opening.
A considerable obstacle in all of this was that grand old hall, the 2,900-seat academy, which for many is the most beloved building in all of Philadelphia. With its gas lamps on a noble exterior and its warm, plush interior, it is lovely to the eye (as those who saw it in the film "The Age of Innocence" may recall). It is even adequate to some musical purposes: opera, for example, for which it was designed. But for an orchestra -- for the orchestra, that is, one of the city's leading cultural institutions and long one of the finest ensembles anywhere -- playing onstage, it has never afforded an adequate acoustical environment.
Despite some $30 million in recent improvements, the sound that finds its way across the proscenium is muffled -- blanketed, it can seem -- and wildly uneven. Sections, even individual instruments, jut out angularly where blend is needed. Musicians and critics have said as much for decades, yet even now, many in Philadelphia disagree.
"When Ormandy was the music director, no one complained about the acoustics," said Leonore Annenberg, who, with her husband, former Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg, has contributed many millions of dollars to the orchestra, much of it earmarked for the academy. "My ear is not attuned so finely, but I can never understand what they're talking about. The academy's acoustics are fine."
Other longtime supporters of the orchestra were also slow to support the project, though not necessarily for the same reasons. "Our concern from Day 1 was never about whether we needed a new hall," said Rebecca W. Rimel, the president of the Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia. "Everybody agrees we do. The issue, and I'm sure I became boring on the subject, was what we could afford: if we build it, will they come, and can they pay for it?"
Indeed, despite turning responsibility for the project over to the center, the orchestra has had its financial ups and downs in recent years. It is running a $4 million deficit for the current fiscal year -- caused partly by expenses involved in the move -- on a budget of $35 million. But it has an endowment of $75 million and expects a net increase in revenue of $2 million a year with the new hall. This is to be accomplished, despite a drop of 400 in seating capacity, largely by raising ticket prices for the best seats.
"We are confident, while not cocky, about the future," said Richard L. Smoot, the chairman of the board. "The net worth of the orchestra continued to rise through the 1990's. Musically, we're in great shape, and there is a lot of energy going into dealing with the current challenges."
In any case, there was never a plan to jettison the academy, which has long been overcrowded with events. Opera, ballet and touring attractions have competed for whatever scraps of performance and rehearsal time the orchestra has left unfilled. The last of the current round of renovations is still to come: raising the roof above the stage to accommodate trappings for Broadway-style shows, for another $10 million.
Although the orchestra is to retain ownership of the academy, it, too, will be managed by the regional center. The orchestra plans to use it only for the annual ball celebrating the anniversary of the building, a highlight of the Philadelphia social season.
Might problems of access arise for an orchestra accustomed to first claim on its own building now that another agency sets the terms for it and other constituents? Almost inevitably.
"It's a big source of negotiation," said Leslie Anne Miller, the regional center's president. "The framework is built in, but as in any marriage, we will have work to do. Getting the agreements signed has been a tough process, but it will pale in relation to working out living arrangements."
Yet almost by definition, the issue that more than any other engages the imagination of the audience as well as the orchestra is acoustics. The acoustics of the new hall are the province of Russell Johnson of Artec Consultants, which has met with acclaim for concert halls in Dallas, Birmingham, England, and elsewhere. Mr. Johnson does not subscribe to the theory of venerable auditoriums like Carnegie Hall or Symphony Hall in Boston that one acoustic fits all.
"We know and everybody knows that if you build a concert hall today, you're going to have amplified rock, dance, string quartets and chorus," he said. "Even the symphony orchestra today plays a fascinating variety of music and is broadening the kind of music it is programming."
He therefore builds variability into his schemes: in this case, there are reverberation chambers from floor to ceiling that can be opened or closed, systems of fabric in the hall and in the chambers that can be deployed or retracted, and a stage canopy that can be raised or lowered. This is a complex and mildly controversial matter. Just how practical some of the adjustments are is open to question. Musicians are often loath to spend the time and effort needed to experiment with a wide variety of settings to achieve a desired result -- and a highly specific one: Mr. Johnson suggests that acoustics might be tailored even to individual pieces within a single program and adjusted accordingly.
"The average music director is not deeply fascinated," he admitted, "but once he hears what can be achieved. . . ." Until convinced, many musicians would be likelier to do what they have always done -- adjust their own sound to suit the circumstances -- than to toy with the acoustics.
Indeed, this is an issue with particular resonance here, for there is every reason to believe that the vaunted Philadelphia sound -- the warmth and richness that have prevailed through so much of the orchestra's history, especially in the strings -- is largely a product of the academy's acoustic deficiencies. The players have had to dig into their instruments and project to the audience simply to make themselves heard. Transfer that sound to a hall like Carnegie, and the results can be overwhelmingly rich and reverberant.
None of which is reason enough to continue to live with wretched acoustics. But there is a question of how the orchestra's sound may change in its new home.
Mr. Sawallisch does not seem unduly worried. He attributes the Philadelphia sound mostly to the ability of the players to hear one another, which allows for a "personal touch" in their interactions. It is certainly true that the best sound in the academy is not in the house but onstage.
"At the academy, the orchestra onstage can hear each other very well," Mr. Sawallisch said. If that remains true in the new hall -- and there are cautionary examples of halls in which the audience hears well but the orchestra does not -- he expects no diminution in the Philadelphia sound.
The classic model for a hall with excellent acoustics has been a shoe-box shape. (But it is far from infallible, as concertgoers at Avery Fisher Hall know too well.)
"We wanted to obliterate the shoe box," said Willard G. Rouse III, the chairman of the Regional Performing Arts Center, "but we couldn't, for acoustical reasons."
They at least modified it. From the time the new design was first presented, the publicity has pointed out that the shape of the auditorium, softened with curves, was like that of the body of a cello.
Why a cello? "It's not a cello," Mr. Vinoly, the architect, said unromantically. "It's a room, but a room rethought as an instrument, another version of a box but much more intimate than a formal shoe box. There are essentially no straight lines."
In this matter, as in many others, architect and acoustician do not necessarily agree, and Mr. Johnson holds to the fanciful notion of a cello, as unpredictable as the results may be. "Will the cello be a problem?" he asked. "I don't know yet."
The new hall will have a pipe organ, the dream, it seems, of every European conductor and many others. For the moment it is merely a facade, but by 2005, it will be a large Dobson instrument. An organ, conventional wisdom holds, can only enhance the acoustics of any hall. As so often, Mr. Johnson rejects convention.
"We started from the notion that a concert hall really should have a pipe organ, and we accepted what comes with it," he said. "In complex structures, sound is absorbed and energy is lost. An organ will take the basic numbers down a notch" -- a crucial number being reverberation time. The problem is obviously not insurmountable, however, for many of the finest halls have organs.
WHEN all such matters are attended to, even the best acoustical design can suffer from faulty execution, as Carnegie Hall learned forcibly in 1995, when it was discovered that a layer of deadening concrete had inadvertently been left right under the stage floor in the renovation of 1986. As it happened, when a reporter visited the very much unfinished Verizon Hall a month before the opening, the stage floor was being nailed down, plank by plank.
No concrete, surely? "Concrete is absolutely there," Mr. Johnson said, and sure enough, a layer of white was partly visible. But a grid of boards placed edgewise between it and the actual stage floor allowed for almost six inches of crucial air space above it.
Now, assuming that a great deal of finishing has been done since then, all that remains is to give the hall a road test.
"The most amazing thing," said Mr. Vinoly, whose experience with concert halls and the primacy of acoustics has been limited, "is that these things are made or broken in one night." In this case, a night a week or so from now, putting a sudden end to an excruciatingly long wait.

Dropper Popper

BYLINE:  By Jaime Wolf

 BODY:
This is the toy for the ex-dot-com millionaire reduced to living in his mother's basement. This is the toy you can keep on your desk to remind you of the quality of resilience in hard times. This is the Austerity Toy. 
 Simply speaking, the Dropper Popper is half a rubber ball. Imagine an old-fashioned Spalding handball hacked down the center with a machete. You may ask what you can do with such a thing. The ingenious, counterintuitive and deeply pleasurable answer is this: you bounce it. 
 Turning the half-ball inside out produces a slightly deformed, near hemispherical shape. (See illustration above.) The rubber's desire to return to its original form creates a high surface tension and structural instability. When you then drop the half-ball onto a flat surface, hollow-side down, the inverted part pops back out, slams into the floor and causes the toy to bounce high into the air.
An introductory physics textbook can provide a technical explanation, involving potential mechanical energy, of how exactly the Dropper Popper works -- and why it actually bounces higher in the air than the distance from which it is dropped. No science, however, can adequately account for the surprise and delight produced each time by the phenomenon of bouncing half a ball.
The Dropper Popper is sold in the United States by Petra, a company best known for importing wooden toys from Europe. Made from a rubber compound in marbleized color schemes (orange and yellow; black and blue), it is sold here for $3.50 at Kar'ikter, a shop with branches in New York City and San Francisco that specializes in toys and gadgets exemplifying modern design.
In these depressed economic times, the Dropper Popper is both a toy and a symbol. Of course we will bounce back. Sometimes, it seems, half a ball is better than one. Jaime Wolf

Global-Warming Lawsuits

BYLINE:  By Stephen Mihm

 BODY:
Imagine for a moment that you're a citizen of Tuvalu, an island nation in the South Pacific. Your home will soon disappear beneath the waves, an early casualty of rising sea levels linked to global warming. The people largely responsible for your plight -- the oil-burning, carbon-dioxide-spewing citizens of the United States -- are thousands of miles away and show no signs of lending a hand. What do you do? A growing number of environmental advocates, alarmed by the Bush administration's repudiation of the Kyoto Protocol, have this advice: take 'em to court. 
 The idea of filing lawsuits to recover damages from emissions of carbon dioxide is the brainchild of Andrew Strauss, a professor of law at Widener University in Wilmington, Del. In a controversial paper delivered this summer at a conference in London, Strauss explored the "litigation possibilities" for filing suit against the United States. Though Strauss is the first to admit that there are serious obstacles to bringing such a case, the mounting evidence that global warming is a real and present danger has lent momentum to his idea. 
 There are plenty of candidates for the role of plaintiff: countries as diverse as Bangladesh, the Netherlands and China will suffer if sea levels rise. But as Strauss notes, finding aggrieved parties won't be a problem; what will be difficult is finding a court willing to take the case. After all, it's not clear what court would have jurisdiction over such a novel proceeding. International law is famously complex and has never handled anything on this economic scale.
Nevertheless, Strauss has a few proposals. One promising avenue, he thinks, would be for the plaintiff nations to file a case before the International Court of Justice, the legal arm of the United Nations. There's only one hitch: typically, the court can hear the case only with the assent of the accused nation. More promising, perhaps, is for the General Assembly to ask the U.N. court for an "advisory opinion," a decision that is not legally binding but would give environmentalists a public-relations victory. The battle over global warming, Strauss explains, "is a battle in the court of public opinion, so such a decision would strengthen your negotiating position." 
Another option is to force the United States before the World Trade Organization. Countries that abide by the Kyoto Protocol could argue, with some legitimacy, that the cheap-energy policies of the United States constitute an unfair competitive advantage. Affected countries could then impose so-called countervailing duties on goods made here. The U.S. would then have to go before the W.T.O. to try and have the duties removed, forcing a potentially embarrassing hearing that might not work out in its favor.
Strauss doesn't expect immediate success. "There will be different generations of this litigation as it unfolds," he says. But as the world becomes increasingly entwined with international legal tribunals, courts and binding treaties, it may one day become difficult for one country to wreak environmental havoc on the rest without paying a price. Should that come to pass, no country -- not even America -- will be able to live as an island unto itself. Stephen Mihm

Nonromantic Dating

BYLINE:  By Susan Dominus 

 BODY:
Since the code of courtly love swept through 12th-century France, romance has been understood to entail a certain amount of languishing, anguishing and wallowing. Perhaps it is that culturally ingrained expectation of pain that has allowed the current system of dating (and dumping) to persist without rival for this long. But this year, signs have begun to emerge that our idea of romance, with all its attendant anxiety, is finally facing competition from more practical models of courtship. 
 Rabbi Yaacov Deyo of Los Angeles has trademarked the concept of Speed Dating, evenings in which singles spend seven minutes talking to a potential date before a bell rings, at which point they move on to the next prospect. Singles are instructed to use those precious minutes to discuss meaningful topics (career choice doesn't count; CD and movie preferences do). After each speed date, the daters note their interest -- yes or no -- on a piece of paper they'll turn in at the evening's close. If there's nervous waiting by the phone, it lasts only a day, at which point the suitors receive official phone calls letting them know who is interested. 
 It's all about as romantic as a job fair, but then, seeking serendipity can be tiresome, too. Let the die-hard romantics peruse the crowds at museums and bookstores and dinner parties, waiting like very patient tornado chasers for lightning to strike -- Speed Dating self-selects for the pragmatists, the sober realists, the people who want to see the numbers working for them. Once a social curiosity, Speed Dating has expanded this year into a full-fledged industry, with more than 30 new spinoffs working to maximize their clients' romantic chances -- in some cases by reducing all that endless chitchat down to an economical three minutes.
Just as Speed Dating was taking off among Jewish singles, young Christians in conservative circles were developing their own alternative to romance. Known as courtship, it might also be described as the hunch-based marriage track: once two singles of passing acquaintance sense they're well suited, they agree to pursue a relationship, meaning they'll see each other more frequently in groups and in the company of their parents. The declared intention, all along, is to wed, but until they exchange vows, they're forbidden temptations like hand holding, much less soulful walks on the beach or candlelit dinners. 
Speed Dating tries to maximize the number of intimate investigations over the course of an evening, while courtship, ideally, narrows that number down to one over the course of a lifetime. What the two systems share is an effort to manipulate the odds, instead of hoping for giddy happenstance, in the pursuit of a soul mate. SUSAN DOMINUS

Positive Asymmetry

BYLINE:  By Todd Lappin 

 BODY:
The United States defense establishment has awakened to an unsettling paradox. America's military power vastly outstrips that of most potential adversaries, but unrivaled military superiority does not make the U.S. invulnerable to attack. Instead, Pentagon planners now realize, conventional military dominance only encourages potential adversaries to look for "asymmetrical" ways to neutralize our strengths by exploiting our vulnerabilities. 
 The events of Sept. 11 -- in which a handful of hijackers armed with box cutters transformed several civilian airliners into precision guided missiles -- provided a horrific testament to the destructive power of asymmetric threats. In response, some national-security experts now argue that the U.S. should take advantage of all the resources -- military and civilian -- that can be brought to bear as part of a broader national-security policy designed to halt the spread of terrorism. The challenge, in other words, is to fight an asymmetrical foe asymmetrically by using those U.S. assets that can best undermine the social, cultural and economic factors that foment extremism. 
 In a paper published earlier this year, Steven Metz, chairman of the regional strategy and planning department of the U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, defined this policy as "positive asymmetry," or "using differences to gain an advantage." In the current conflict in Central Asia, we have several nonmilitary assets that could play a significant role in shaping the outcome of the campaign.
The most obvious of these is food. Given the agricultural bounty of the American heartland -- and the chronic food shortages that plague Afghan and Pakistani refugee camps -- the United States could use food in Central Asia as a powerful weapon to demonstrate our commitment to humanitarian values. A massive operation designed to inundate the region with American-grown rice and wheat could save lives, win hearts and minds and alter fragile allegiances in America's favor.
Wealth is another asymmetrical asset. As the richest country in the world, the U.S. can always throw money around; in Central Asia that might mean buying the allegiance of opportunistic regional foes. "This is a war where simply buying off a few warlords may be cheaper and much more effective than launching Tomahawk missiles at them," says Peter Singer, a military-affairs analyst at the Brookings Institution. "We certainly have the budget to pay more than the Taliban can."
Hollywood can be enlisted to join the campaign. Though American cultural hegemony is often a source of resentment in the Middle East, Hollywood filmmakers are extremely adept at manipulating images to capture the attention of a global audience. Those skills can be used to buff up America's image in hostile parts of the world.
Positive asymmetry means enlisting not just armed soldiers but also a broad cross section of America's best and brightest -- including Iowa farmers, Wall Street financiers and Tinseltown producers -- to contribute to the war on terrorism. TODD LAPPIN

Precautionary Principle

BYLINE:  By Michael Pollan 

 BODY:
New technologies can bring mankind great benefits, but they can also cause accidental harm. How careful should society be about introducing innovations that have the potential to affect human health and the environment? For the last several decades, American society has been guided by the "risk analysis" model, which assesses new technologies by trying to calculate the mathematical likelihood that they will harm the public. There are other ways, however, to think about this problem. Indeed, a rival idea from Europe, the "precautionary principle 2/3" has just begun making inroads in America. 
 The problem with risk analysis, which came out of the world of engineering and caught on during the late 70's, is that it hasn't done a very good job predicting the ecological and health effects of many new technologies. It is very good at measuring what we can know -- say, the weight a suspension bridge can bear -- but it has trouble calculating subtler, less quantifiable risks. (The effect of certain neurotoxins on a child's neurological development, for example, appears to have more to do with the timing of exposure than with the amount.) Whatever can't be quantified falls out of the risk analyst's equations, and so in the absence of proven, measurable harms, technologies are simply allowed to go forward. 
 In Europe, a different approach has taken hold. When Germany, for example, discovered in the 70's that its beloved forests were suddenly dying, there was not yet scientific proof that acid rain was the culprit. But the government acted to slash power-plant emissions anyway, citing the principle of Vorsorge, or "forecaring." Soon, Vorsorgeprinzip -- the forecaring, or precautionary, principle -- became an axiom in German environmental law. Even in the face of scientific uncertainty, the principle states, actions should be taken to prevent harms to the environment and public health. 
Germany's idea has since gone international. It has popped up in the preamble of the U.N. Treaty on Biodiversity and was written into a slew of protocols and rules issued by the European Union in the 90's. It informs treaties like the 2000 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which allows countries to bar genetically modified organisms on the basis of precaution. The idea has not prevailed over risk analysis, however, at least not yet. The E.U.'s ban on American beef treated with hormones, for example, is based on the precautionary principle. But since world-trade rules are based on risk analysis rather than precaution, and the health risk of eating hormone-treated beef has not been proved, the World Trade Organization has ruled that the ban is illegal. 
What explains the W.T.O.'s resistance to the precautionary principle? It doesn't sound like a revolutionary idea. Indeed, it sounds like common sense: better safe than sorry; look before you leap. But, in fact, the precautionary principle poses a radical challenge to business as usual in a modern, capitalist, technological civilization. As things stand, whenever questions are raised about the safety of, say, antibiotics in livestock feed, not until someone finds the smoking gun can anything be done about it. When President Bush earlier this year challenged the Clinton administration's tougher standards for arsenic levels in drinking water, he did it on the grounds that "the science isn't in yet." (He subsequently relented.) The problem very often is that long before the science does come in, the harm has already been done. And once a technology has entered the marketplace, the burden of bringing in that science typically falls on the public rather than on the companies selling it. 
If introduced into American law, the precautionary principle would fundamentally shift the burden of proof. The presumptions that flow from the scientific uncertainty surrounding so many new technologies would no longer automatically operate in industry's favor. Scientific uncertainty would no longer argue for freedom of action but for precaution and alternatives. 
Just how revolutionary an idea this really is is just now dawning on thinkers tied to American industry. In April, a fellow at the Hoover Institution published an attack on the precautionary principle, calling it, quite rightly, "a wolf in sheep's clothing." The Bush administration has adopted a hard line in international negotations. In the spring, its delegates to the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the world body that sets food safety standards for world trade, scuttled an agreement rather than allow precautionary language into a single footnote.
Critics argue that the precautionary principle is "antiscientific." No and yes. No, in the sense that it calls for more science in order to dispel the uncertainties surrounding new technologies and to develop less harmful alternatives. And yet there is a sense in which the idea is "antiscientific," if by scientific we mean leaving it to scientists to tell us what to do. For the precautionary principle recognizes the limitations of science -- and the fact that scientific uncertainty is an unavoidable breach into which ordinary citizens sometimes must step and act.

Slow Food

BYLINE:  By Lawrence Osborne 

 BODY:
What do the Vesuvian apricot, the Delaware Bay oyster and the Loire salmon have in common? According to the Italian journalist Carlo Petrini, founder of the Slow Food movement, they're all "endangered" foods. And like rare zebras, butterflies and rhinos, these exotic, traditional foodstuffs require an organized effort to defend them. Slow Food is that movement. Slow Food activism is curious but simple: the idea is to protest the spreading evils of fast food and the bland, unhealthy cuisine of the globalized economy by going back to the locally grown, "authentic" food that our grandparents cherished. Why eat mass-produced and plastic-tasting Monterey Jack, Slow Food activists cry, when you can eat a hand-made and zesty chevre from a tiny village in Corsica -- and support a Corsican farmer too? 
 The Slow Food movement, which is just now making inroads in America, is a gastronomic version of Greenpeace: a defiant determination to preserve unprocessed, time-intensive food from being wiped off the culinary map. And like anti-W.T.O. activism, the movement is a protest against globalism. But Slow Food activism doesn't take the form of street demonstrations. Instead, activists are encouraged to savor organic cabbages and dissect the joys of truffles in their kitchens. Protest was never this much fun. 
 Perhaps that's why Petrini's movement, with its cute snail logo and its charming manifestoes against the evils of fast-food hamburgers, has 65,000 adherents in 45 countries worldwide -- with 6,000 "party members" in the U.S. alone. Each of the nearly 580 branches worldwide is known as a "convivium." A look at one of the movement's writings provides a clue to its passions. "We are enslaved by speed," it reads, "and have all succumbed to the same insidious virus -- fast life, which disrupts our habits . . . and forces us to eat fast foods." And it goes on: "Our defense should begin at the table with Slow Food. Let us rediscover the flavors and savors of regional cooking." The movement now sponsors something called the Ark of Taste -- a project that gives a sort of preservation status to traditional livestock breeds, cheeses, cereals, charcuterie, herbs and fruits.
For the prosperous European middle class, and for an increasing number of its North American counterparts, the Slow Food movement's heady mixture of righteous politics and splendid self-pampering has proved as deliciously irresistible as Chinantla vanilla from Mexico or indigenous-bee honey made in Turkey. It's revolution with a spatula, not a Kalashnikov. LAWRENCE OSBORNE

HEADLINE: DINING OUT; 
A Lot of Italian Fare, but Little Elbow Room

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA BROOKS 

 BODY:
WE did not expect our dinner at Mike's Ristorante in Norwalk to turn into a discussion on economics, but that is what evolved. Not Greenspan variety, mind you, but the day-to-day accounting involved in running a restaurant and keeping it solvent and, one would expect, profitable.
 When the four of us sat down, we were charmed by the look of Mike's, with its clean, neat Italian cafe touches. 
 As we studied the menu, a waiter brought us two baskets of bread and, before we could peek inside the paper covering, whisked the baskets away. That was a foretaste of the disorganized service to come. 
The bread basket's disappearance was followed instantly by the arrival of four heaping dinner-size plates of salad, a lovely medley of fresh, diverse greens enveloped by dressing. By the time the warm toasted bread slices reappeared, most of the salad had been consumed.
After such big salads, we did not feel like ordering a bunch of starters, but settled on antipasto all' Italiano. We reasoned that at $11.50 there would be enough for nibbling by all of us. "No, no," the matron said. The antipasto was mostly a repeat of the salad. She recommended the prosciutto and mozzarella ($13.50) instead.
We complied and the prettily-arranged platter was one of the high points, with slices of fluffy soft and tender cheese and tomato resting on a bed of paper-thin Parma prosciutto. It was the only dish that evening that seemed arranged with the forethought of eye appeal.
As a backup, we added an order of funghi alla contadina, which arrived saucepan-hot, pungent with garlic, olive oil and sliced mushrooms. Robustly delicious.
The specials were recited, but they were also listed on a board that we could walk over to and study.
When the entrees appeared, we were still enjoying the appetizers, which posed a problem for the waiter and us as we juggled to make room for the additional large plates.
Meanwhile, the restaurant had filled up. Only one table was occupied when we arrived at seven o'clock, and by 8, another table for four and a long table seating 12 people were all full. That was the entire seating capacity of the restaurant.
When we left at 8:45 p.m., not a table had changed occupants. That is what prompted our discussion of restaurant economics. How can a place this tiny make it?
First, there is the matter of prices. While Mike's resembles the comfy neighborhood Italian restaurant that brings out nostalgic bleats in many diners, the prices are those of a much tonier establishment: appetizers run from $7.50 for bruschetta to $13.50 for our mozzarella/prosciutto platter, with most starters $10.50.
Entrees were mostly priced at $22.50. Gamberi alla scampi, at that price, consisted of five jumbo shrimp and a lot of angel hair pasta with garlic, parsley, white wine and lemon -- tasty, but pricey.
Scaloppine marsala con funghi at the same price was generous -- as all Mike's dishes are -- but the escalopes of veal were extremely tough. Toscan pansotti Napoletana consisted of a few pasta pockets submerged in a voluminous, freshly made garlic-cherry tomato sauce loaded with roasted garlic buds. It was hefty and hearty, with nothing subtle about it.
Our best choice was petto di pollo contadina. The chicken breast with roasted peppers, big hunks of artichoke hearts and mushrooms was wholesome, if basic.
Our bill, which included four entrees, two starters, three desserts and two glasses of wine, was $173, which included tax and tip.
Mike's has a wine and beer license and a limited wine selection that begins at $18. The only dessert made on the premises was an almond-saturated tiramisu, which was overpowering. 
It is a tough restaurant world out there, we concluded, stating the obvious. To compete, prices, kitchen capability and service all need to be in sync. But can anyone make it seating a mere 20 to 24 patrons, we wondered? Only Mike's can answer that -- but we hope the pretty little place will survive, improve and prosper.

HEADLINE: The Only Game in Town, for Now 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
FOR 11 years, Florence Mignone and Fernand Audette have enjoyed a friendship based on gambling, a hobby that has taken them to Atlantic City, Las Vegas and Connecticut.
 But on a recent weekday morning, as they sat side by side in front of 50-cent slot machines at Mohegan Sun Casino, the two Melville, N.Y., residents admitted they soon may be parting ways. With the prospect of casinos opening in New York, Ms. Mignone said she would probably prefer to gamble in her state because the casinos would be closer to home. Mr. Audette thought otherwise. 
 "I'd come here," he said as he puffed on a cigar. "I like it over here." 
Just how New Yorkers like Mr. Audette and Ms. Mignone will react to the possibility of casinos opening in the Catskill region is of great interest to Connecticut casino executives and budget officials in Connecticut, which receives more than $300 million in slot revenues each year. In October, New York Gov. George Pataki signed a bill that would allow three Native American casinos to be built in Ulster and Sullivan counties, creating more competition for New York gamblers who constitute as much as 20 percent of the customers at Mohegan Sun and the nearby Foxwoods casino.
While casino and state officials said it is too soon to predict what type of impact New York casinos could have on Connecticut, at least one analyst said he believed they would have to affect Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods.
"Casino gaming in New York State would definitely impact those two casinos in Connecticut," said Marvin Roffman, a gaming analyst and president of Roffman Miller Associates, a Philadelphia money management company. "The only reason why the Indian reservations are doing great is because they are the only game in town."
Harry Curtis, a managing director at Robertson Stephens in New York, is even more specific. 
"It will certainly be no more than 10 percent and probably less than 5 percent of their revenues, and that's within the first six months," Mr. Curtis said. "And then after 12 months, I think that the impact will be minimal."
But, he said, it depends on what is built in New York.
"At the outset, what may get built is relatively modest and so the initial impact may be at the low end of that range," he said. "Over time, if it's one casino with anywhere from two to three thousand slot machines in the Catskills, I don't think it would have a long-term impact on the Connecticut casinos."
Casino gaming has flourished in Connecticut since the Mashantucket Pequots opened Foxwoods in 1992. Benefiting from a monopoly on casino gambling in New England and Foxwoods's location between New York and Boston, the tribe made national headlines as it attracted tens of thousands of gamblers to its casino each day. When the Mohegans opened Mohegan Sun four years later, Connecticut earned the distinction of playing host to two of the country's largest casinos that together take in more than $1 billion in gross revenues annually.
Thanks to an agreement that gives the state 25 percent of each casino's slot revenues, Connecticut has benefited as well. For the fiscal year ending June 2001, the state's share of the slot revenue totaled $332 million.
But the tribes have been aware of their tentative monopoly on gambling in New England and have long kept an eye on the possibility of other casinos opening in places like Massachusetts and New York. A few years ago when the Mohegans began to raise money for their $1 billion expansion, the first phase of which opened this fall, the prospect of other casinos opening was routinely mentioned.
"We always knew that New York was a place where gaming might take place," said Mitchell Etess, Mohegan Sun's executive vice president of marketing and whose family used to run the Grossinger's resort in the Catskills.
Yet Foxwoods or Mohegan Sun officials said they were somewhat surprised when New York's legislature did a quick turnaround on the subject this fall. Earlier this year, the New York Senate passed a bill that would have authorized the governor to negotiate a compact for casinos in western New York, but the legislation was not approved by the state House of Representatives, according to Mark Hansen, spokesman for New York Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the State Legislature resurrected the issue. This time, they passed the bill, which also authorized the three casinos in Sullivan and Ulster counties and lifted the state prohibition on slot machines.
"All of a sudden we found ourselves in a position where we had to find a tremendous amount of additional revenue going forward to support the state's programs and meet our responsibilities," Mr. Hansen said. "It was seen as a way to increase revenues for the state."
Just how soon a casino would open in Ulster or Sullivan counties is hard to say, since there are several regulatory hurdles that must be overcome before construction can begin. But at least one tribe, the St. Regis Mohawks, has begun to take the first steps toward developing a casino. On Nov. 15, the Mohawks signed development and management agreements with the Park Place Entertainment Corporation, which owns, manages or has an interest in 28 gaming properties including Bally's and Caesars.
The tribe intends to build a $500 million casino and resort in Thompson, a Catskill town in Sullivan County. When finished, the project would include a 750-room hotel and a 130,000-square-foot casino, according to a statement released by Park Place.
Before construction can begin, the federal government must agree to take land into trust for the tribe. In addition, the tribe must negotiate a compact with Mr. Pataki, and the National Indian Gaming Commission must approve the tribe's management agreement with Park Place.
By comparison, after the Mohegans were federally recognized in 1994, it took about two-and-a-half years for them to realize their dreams of opening a casino. One of their biggest hurdles was securing the National Indian Gaming Commission's approval.
If built, the casinos would provide another option to gamblers from the New York metropolitan area, who comprise between 15 and 20 percent of Foxwoods's and Mohegan Sun's customer base, according to casino officials.
Since the New York casinos could be years from reality, Marc Ryan, secretary of the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, said it is too soon to determine what effect they could have on the state, which is already experiencing a decline in revenues thanks to the slumping economy.
"Once something is more solid, then we would probably start looking at the impact," he said. "But it really depends on where the casinos are located. To the degree that they are located in the Catskill Mountains or somewhere in that area I think that would obviously have an impact on the visitorship to the two casinos in Connecticut and would probably impact our slot revenues."
But, he added, one factor that must be taken into consideration is whether Connecticut's casinos have reached their saturation point. The Mohegans' Sun Burst expansion nearly doubled the size of their casino, adding another 115,000 square feet of gaming space. Mr. Ryan said state officials are watching whether the slot revenues continue to grow or level off.
"The more important question is, is there enough business to go around, so to speak," he said.
Robert DeSalvio, executive vice president of marketing for Foxwoods, said there is.
"If in fact the casinos are built in the Catskill area, the net effect here will be that it will slow the rate of growth of our penetration into the New York metropolitan area, but certainly won't stop it or see it go backward," Mr. DeSalvio said. "And the reason is that we feel we have not even come close to reaching our full potential from the New York metro market."
In addition, he said once people have been exposed to casino gambling, they tend to look for other places to wager their money. That, in turn, could create new customers for the Connecticut casinos.
"We think we could qualify as a very reachable drive, and that the area of southeastern Connecticut is very attractive because of not only the casino option, but the wonderful collection of tourist type assets that we have in the region," he said. 
In addition, just because someone is from New York does not mean it will be more convenient to go to Sullivan or Ulster Counties to gamble. It all depends on where a person lives, Mr. Etess said. 
"Let's say you live on Long Island, that doesn't mean that you are going to go gambling in the Catskills just because it's in New York," he said. "So that doesn't necessarily mean we are going to lose 20 percent of our business right away because a New York zip code has gaming."
Plus, Mr. Etess said, Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun are such large resorts, it will cost a developer about $1 billion to build something on a similar scale.
"One of the reasons that we got our financing and went to Project Sunburst when we did was to raise a barrier of entry to prospective competition," he added.
Still, some people, like Charles Pitti of West Babylon, N.Y., said they would welcome casinos in New York. Watching his wife feed coins into a slot machine at Mohegan Sun, the Long Island resident said the Connecticut casinos are too popular.
"You have so many people playing the machines there's not enough area to play," he said. "It's overcrowded."

Charity Begins With Sept. 11, and Ends There

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
EXECUTIVES at some of Long Island's largest nonprofit and philanthropic institutions say that dozens of social-service or cultural programs are endangered because of the impact of Sept. 11 on local fund-raising activities.
 Agencies that rely on individual and corporate philanthropy are finding that their usual end-of-the year fund-raising is coming up short. Regular contributors are saying that they have already given what they can spare this year to help the victims of the terrorist attacks. Other factors, including the weakening economy and disruptions in the fall fund-raising schedule, are causing a number of administrators to consider paring their costs, or canceling programs outright. 
 Sharon Markman, the director of development of the Family Service League in Huntington and the president of the Long Island chapter of the Association of Fundraising Professionals, said, "Some individuals and corporations either don't have the same amount of dollars to spend this year, because of the economy, or have reallocated some of their dollars to efforts aimed at helping Sept. 11 victims." 
More frequently, the effects of Sept. 11 on the Island's nonprofit sector have been indirect but no less serious. For example: 
*Nearly $5.6 million in state money earmarked for some 60 Long Island agencies is now in political limbo, with a growing likelihood that perhaps only a fifth of it will ever materialize. 
*Scores of fund-raising events scheduled for the fall and the current holiday season have been postponed, scaled back or canceled. Efforts to reschedule them have been hampered by the anthrax threat and fears of opening unsolicited mail.
*Individual donors, feeling bearish, are taking longer to send in their checks, often for amounts pledged in flusher times.
Sandy Oliva, the executive director of the Nassau County Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said that she did not know when, or if, her organization would collect the $70,000 it received last year from the budgets of individual legislators, money it was counting on again this year to finance 2002 programs. 
"We're going on faith and hoping the state funds come through late," Ms. Oliva said. "Otherwise, we'll have to reduce services."
The method of financing programs through the discretionary budgets of individual legislators, known as member item budgeting, has grown in recent years, said John T. O'Connell, the chief executive of the Health and Welfare Council, which represents some 300 private and government-run agencies on the Island. 
Mr. O'Connell said that if state money was not forthcoming, a number of social-service programs could be eliminated. "We're talking about losing programs that help people with breast cancer, legal services for battered women, nursing services for people with AIDS, socialization programs for seniors, and many others," he said. 
The terrorist attacks came just as nonprofit groups were beginning their fall fund-raising. Many decided to cancel golf outings, dinners and marathon runs scheduled for the rest of September, said Tracey Gittere, the managing director of Legendary Events, a Garden City company that plans and produces corporate and social functions. Because of the logistical challenges and complex planning required for the events, and because of the uncertainty over how long it would take before people were ready to attend social events again, many fund-raisers scheduled for later in the fall, even in the winter, were canceled, too. "Millions of dollars were not raised," said Ms. Gittere (pronounced GIT-tree). 
Theresa Regnante, a vice president of the United Way of Long Island, said charities that rely on special events for fund-raising were particularly hard hit. "Executives who bought a table for $5,000 last year are saying no this year," she said.
The tighter fund-raising environment is likely to have an impact on cultural and environmental groups in particular, said Ms. Markman of the Association of Fundraising Professionals. "If there is to be any diminution of funds, it's perhaps going to impact the arts and the environmental groups first," she said. "When people have to make choices, they are more likely to feed the hungry or help people in need than to send a contribution to a museum or a symphony."
Some foundation administrators and local philanthropists are saying they are tapped out. Local fund-raisers "are telling me that corporations are telling them not to even both to apply," Ms. Regnante said.
But that is not always the case. Lisa Platania, the director of community relations at Computer Associates in Islandia, said that the company had stepped up its giving this year in response to Sept. 11, but not at the expense of support for community programs. As she put it: "The disaster did not cut back on our current grant making." 
Other Long Island philanthropists said they were able to contribute to relief efforts without reducing their annual gifts to local causes. One donor, a former president of a large Long Island corporation who asked that his name not be used, to protect his privacy, said, "My feeling is that these organizations were having a hard time before Sept. 11 and now need more help than ever." 
Frank Castagna, a real estate executive in Manhasset, and his wife, Rita, contribute to a number of local cultural organizations and service programs. The ones facing serious problems, Mr. Castagna said, are those with relatively short histories or those that lack deep emotional commitment from their donors. Unlike past years, he said, those organizations will not be able to count on last-minute help from the private or public sectors. 
"We have had to cut back our giving a little this year, for various reasons," he said. "And the state and local governments are not in the position this year of stepping in to extend the funding." 
Suzy Sonenberg, the executive director of the Long Island Community Foundation, which administers grants for philanthropists, including Horace and Amy Hagedorn, said there was an urgency this season for nonprofit groups. "People who have given money year after year are not giving money this year to their favorite causes or are drastically reducing their gifts, because they are giving to Sept. 11," Ms. Sonenberg said. "We know these programs are hurting, and we worry the trend is continuing."

The Mission: Helping Women and Girls

BYLINE:  By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 

 BODY:
WHEN the Delta Minerva Life Development Center in Roosevelt wanted to hold a conference on how to prevent teenage girls in Nassau County from joining gangs, it approached the Long Island Fund for Women and Girls. Soon the center, sponsored by Delta Sigma Theta, a black sorority, had a $2,500 grant from the fund, which is dedicated to improving the status of women and girls on the Island.
 When Colonial Youth and Family Services in Mastic decided to offer workshops on parenthood and job skills for pregnant teenagers and young mothers, it applied to the fund. Linda Peck, Colonial's director of clinical services, said she was delighted to receive a $5,000 grant, which the agency will share with Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, which had requested money for a similar program. 
 "We've been doing the program on a shoestring," Ms. Peck said. "Now we will be able to have someone come that is really good in the field and teach them." 
In the last 10 years, the Long Island Fund has awarded $310,000, and at the fund's 10th annual breakfast on Nov. 14, another $100,000 was given out for 31 projects chosen from 86 applications. The grants ranged from $1,500 to $5,000.
Diane Cohen, the fund's executive director, says that its mission is to take the ideas of local women and help make them reality. Unlike traditional philanthropies, the fund often provides seed money for new groups and addresses the needs of diverse women, as opposed to groups that focus on business or professional women. 
"What we are doing is taking very local, grass-roots groups that can't find funding other places and saying, 'You know best the local needs and you know best your interests,' " Ms. Cohen said. "Tell us what you want to do about it and we will try to fund you."
The Long Island Fund for Women and Girls was founded in 1991 by four women who were active in philanthropy and fund-raising: Emily Berkowitz, Betty Schlein, Suzy Sonenberg and Barbara Strongin. At the time there was a recession, and women's programs were often the first to be affected by budget cuts. 
The founders held focus groups and systematically spread the word, holding meetings in several neighborhoods. Hazel Weiser, the fund's co-president, said that from the beginning it was a volunteer alliance that tried to include a cross section of Long Island women. At the group's founding, she said, 4 cents of every philanthropic dollar contributed in the United States went to issues that had specific relevance for women and girls; now it is 6 cents.
"The idea is for us to connect the communities of women on Long Island with each other so that we have a united voice," Ms. Weiser said. "Our board and our grantees reflect the growing diversity of Long Island. Our voice needs to change as the issues that affect women and girls on Long Island change." 
The fund's budget has five categories: promoting physical and mental health and ensuring the safety of women and girls; building skills and abilities; fighting discrimination; increasing women's involvement in philanthropy and fund-raising; and encouraging girls to pursue nontraditional interests and careers. 
To build skills and abilities, the fund awarded the Suffolk County Perinatal Coalition $4,000 to set up a program to train low-income women to become doulas, to assist during pregnancy and childbirth.
The Women's Project in Great River will use its $2,700 grant to offer children alternatives to traditional fairy tales by developing new stories in which women are role models. 
The fund gave the Boys and Girls Club of Bellport a $4,800 grant to teach girls photography and graphics and to create a calendar featuring women as leaders in the community. East End Kids received $5,000 for a robotics and technology program for girls 8 to 14. 
The fund's seed money helped start Something Old, Something New of South Country, a fiber-arts cooperative, two years ago. Recently, the group moved into its own storefront in Brookhaven hamlet. It hopes to sustain itself by recycling donated materials, selling members' handiwork and doing custom sewing. 
Nell Bard, the director, said the cooperative was an informal group -- many of the members were disabled, elderly or immigrants -- who were sewing, knitting and weaving baskets as occupational therapy when she applied for a grant. 
For this group, the fund and the grants totaling $8,000 were a lifeline. "They really are unique on Long Island in terms of the types of things they are willing to fund," Ms. Bard said. "It's hard to find somebody to take a chance on you when you don't have anything to go on. That's a real gift to people like us." 
For the first time, in an attempt to create safe environments, particularly for girls, the fund is planning to give grants to help high school students develop their own programs to fight bullying and harassment. The fund's third annual gender-equity conference will be in March. Ms. Cohen is seeking proposals to address nontraditional career paths for women, including math, engineering, technology and the trades. 
"Women who decide college isn't for me go into very low-level secretarial jobs, whereas men have the opportunity to become electricians and plumbers," Ms. Cohen said.
One of the fund's steps in that direction was a $2,000 grant to Nontraditional Employment for Women in Hauppauge. This center, a branch of a Manhattan group, trains, places and supports women in the trades. In partnership with the Long Island Building Trades Council and the State Labor Department, the center plans to offer 16-week training sessions to prepare 80 women to apply to unions and apprenticeship programs for jobs in carpentry, electricity, plumbing and other building trades. 
"It's a start for us," said Ruth Mulford, the program director. "We being women don't have very good percentages as far as the building trades are concerned. Yet it is an occupation where women can really break out of the cycle that they are often in where they can't afford a baby sitter, they can't pay their rent, they can't afford to go to work." 
The fund's grant will be used for a physical-fitness training program. Ms. Mulford said women often don't consider building trades because the work is physically demanding and working conditions are difficult. 
"Consequently, a lot of women get locked into jobs in the supermarket, jobs in a fast-food restaurant, cleaning types of jobs," she said. "This is an opportunity where they can earn three or four times that amount of money, and they can earn while they are an apprentice." 
The fund does more than just give money. Last spring, its first Women's Product Expo was held at the Middle Country Public Library.
Last month it offered a day of educational seminars for women who want to turn hobbies into businesses. Victoria Nesnick, a retired teacher from Dix Hills who has been trying to start a Kids Hall of Fame, was one of the women who attended.
"While I was sitting there and when I left, I felt like someone had given me a treasure chest or toolbox in terms of things I could use in order to help my business to grow," said Ms. Nesnick, who puts out a magazine, trading cards and a calendar celebrating children's achievements.
At the awards breakfast last month, the fund honored five women: Joan Saltzman of Sands Point, a community advocate who contributed the seed money that started the fund 10 years ago; Veronica Rose of Long Beach, the first woman to become a master electrician in New York City; Irene Morgan Kirkaldy of Roosevelt, who refused to move to the back of a bus in Virginia in 1944, 11 years before Rosa Parks; Audrey Livingstone, the first African-American and the first woman to become president of the Long Island Board of Realtors; and Joanna Howard, a student at Westhampton Beach High School who played the young Cosette in the touring company of "Les Miserables." 
"As we have matured as an organization, we have learned how to reach out to different communities and honor women who might not necessarily get the recognition for the work that they do," Ms. Weiser said. "Every year we say this is the best year we've had yet."

HEADLINE: Food Pantries' Cupboards Are Often Bare 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
JEANETTE SCHWENDE of Shirley was waiting for her plastic bag full of canned goods and pasta at an emergency food pantry in Riverhead the other day when someone asked what brought her there.
 It seemed like a dumb question to Ms. Schwende, a 48-year-old former home health aide, one of an army of hungry people stuck at the small end of Long Island's horn of plenty. 
 "Do you know why I need the food?" she replied. "Because I'm going to die, that's why." 
Across Long Island, the need for donated food has rarely, if ever, been greater, but some food pantries, the dispensers of last resort to people who have nowhere else to go but to supermarket Dumpsters, are having trouble keeping anything on their shelves.
So dire had the situation become in the days after Thanksgiving that the Long Island Council of Churches, a Protestant group that runs food pantries in Riverhead and Hempstead, issued an urgent appeal for donations.
"Our shelves were bare for several days," said the Rev. Thomas W. Goodhue, the council's executive director. "It's been fairly bleak. The number of people coming in has been just enormous."
The brutal statistics have only begun to trickle in, but Mr. Goodhue said the number of people in real and immediate need, already increasing before Sept. 11, had swelled sharply since then.
"It's far worse than it was on Sept. 10," he said. "Now we are seeing people who are very productive and very proud who never had to ask for anything before." A limousine driver whose clients worked at the World Trade Center and laid-off airline workers were among them, he said.
The pantries, barometers of social and economic distress, are traditionally needed most by the working poor, the elderly, the sick who can't meet medical expenses and people who are either awaiting or are not able to qualify for government assistance.
On Long Island, while some food pantries are struggling to meet demand, others said they were holding up. "We haven't had that problem," said Rose Ina Brady, a spokeswoman for the St. Patrick's Church pantry in Huntington. "We've had the same number of people coming in as usual, maybe a few more but not drastically so."
In nearby Huntington Station, the number of Hispanic day laborers eating the free breakfasts provided by the Salvation Army has held steady at about 125 a day, said Capt. Mitchell Brown, the commander of the group's East Northport Corps.
But Scott Stepp, the coordinator of public affairs and development for Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, said that in some parishes, pantries had been stretched to their limits.
The Rev. Bill Brisotti, the administrator for Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Roman Catholic Church in Wyandanch, said his parish was one of them. "Keeping the pantry stocked has become more difficult," he said.
Lynn Needelman, the executive director of Long Island Cares, a nonprofit regional food bank in Brentwood, said the economic downturn, the redirection of charitable giving after Sept. 11 and the first wave of welfare cutoffs for people reaching the five-year limit on federal welfare were affecting pantries and other programs.
"We have crisis 12 months a year," she said. "But I would say it is increasing in its enormity because we have got all these factors." 
Long Island Cares, started by the singer Harry Chapin in 1980, supplies scores of Long Island food pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters through its 504 member agencies. Ms. Needelman said supplies come from private and corporate food drives, state and federal assistance programs, and a national food network, Second Harvest. She said she has noticed in recent weeks that food donations have begun returning to normal after falling off in September and October.
There was disagreement over whether federal welfare cutoffs would bring longer lines at food pantries. New York is one of several states with a program meant to take up the slack for people no longer eligible for federal aid. But some advocates for the poor say the transfer process to state aid, called the Safety Net Program in New York, is mired in confusion, putting some federal welfare clients at risk.
Dennis J. Nowak, the director of public relations for the Suffolk County Department of Social Services, said there were no problems in Suffolk, where about 400 families reached the federal limit this month. 
"We sent out many notices and we have interviewed hundreds of people for Safety Net," Mr. Nowak said. Once enrolled in the state program, he said, "they get exactly the same amount of benefits."
Mr. Nowak said the federal cutoffs would not have a major impact on food pantries because of the state program. But Mr. Goodhue of the Long Island Council of Churches said the council pantries were now serving people recently dropped from the welfare rolls. "We are seeing that already," he said.
Not all federal clients make the transition to the state program. In Nassau, about 170 of the 290 cases facing the cutoff were enrolled in the state program, said Rita Mathews, a spokeswoman for the county's Department of Social Services.
Ms. Mathews said that of the 120 cases not signed up for the state program, 31 were found to be exempt from the federal cutoff and 43 cases were closed because the clients did not respond to notifications of the cutoff. In other instances, the cases were not eligible for various reasons.
Mr. Nowak said that after Sept. 11, problems with computer links involving severed telephone lines in Lower Manhattan slowed benefits for weeks. He said the county department issued emergency food and shelter vouchers during the disruption.
Both Nassau and Suffolk reported increases in applications for food stamps. In Nassau in September and October, they were up 12 percent, compared with a year earlier, Ms. Mathews said. "Requests for assistance are usually tied to the economy," she said.
In Suffolk, Mr. Nowak said that food-stamp applications were up 30 percent and that applications for public assistance were up 12 percent overall. Both the county Department of Social Services and Paul Tonna, the presiding officer of the County Legislature, have recently run outreach programs encouraging people to apply for food stamps, a possible factor in the increase.
Mr. Tonna, a Republican from Huntington, has formed a task force to fight hunger, and at a task-force conference two weeks ago he said that 40,000 to 60,000 Suffolk residents who were entitled to food stamps were not receiving them. He said that food-stamp use had declined by 51 percent in Suffolk since March 1996, reflecting the overhaul of the federal welfare system.
Other factors may be driving people to food pantries. Mr. Nowak said the high cost of housing on Long Island was one of them. He cited a study by the Long Island Association, done in November for the Long Island Housing Partnership. It showed that more than half of the renters on Long Island could not afford two-bedroom apartments. Federal figures put the fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $1,230 a month.
A fact sheet Mr. Nowak provided said that a worker would need to earn about $49,200 a year, or $23.65 an hour in a 40-hour week, to afford that rent without cutting into other basic expenses, including food.
Long Island's population of Hispanic day laborers appear not to be a major factor in the increasing demand at food pantries. Nadia Marin-Molina, the executive director of the Workplace Project in Hempstead, a private nonprofit group for Latino migrant laborers, said that some Hispanic workers were remaining through the winter instead of going home as seasonal work ended on Long Island. But others are leaving for good because of changed conditions after the terrorist attacks.
"It's the fear of being in a place where anti-immigrant sentiment is increasing," she said. She said that families were also telling men to come home because of fears of anthrax and of more terrorist attacks.
Ms. Marin-Molina said she was not aware of an increase in referrals to food pantries. "These are resourceful people, and day laborers are accustomed to going without work," she said.
At the Riverhead pantry run by the Long Island Council of Churches, Preston Brown said that Hispanic workers sometimes came in for food but not in large numbers.
Late last month the church council paid $2,200 to a Brooklyn food wholesaler to fill empty shelves at the pantry, which is at 235 Sweezy Avenue. The shelves, stretched end to end, would extend only a third of the way down the aisle of a large suburban supermarket. They had been empty for four days. 
Mr. Brown, an Air Force veteran who lives in Southampton and recently began working at the pantry, said he found it distressing to turn people away for lack of food.
"We're a community service organization and we can't even help meet the needs of the community," he said. "It's discouraging when you have to refer people somewhere else. But unfortunately, sometimes we have to pass them on down the line."
Even more discouraging, he said, were the phone calls from other food pantries and from soup kitchens saying that they, too, were stripped bare and not to send anyone else to them.
Figures kept at the Riverhead pantry showed that 789 families, 338 single adults and 133 elderly people came in in the last three months, September through November. In July and August, the pantry served 328 families, 377 adults and 56 elderly people; the center was closed for seven days during that period for vacations. No other figures were available. 
Mr. Brown said that when someone in need comes to the pantry, he fills plastic bags according to family size and need. "We try to balance the diet," he said. The supplies are meant to last three or four days. Everything in the pantry is nonperishable except for the day-or-more-old bread that Mr. Brown collects at the Pepperidge Farm store at the Tanger Factory Outlet Center.
Last week the shelves were full, but Mr. Brown and other pantry workers said they were stripped bare in the days after Thanksgiving. "As soon as we put something on the shelf, it was gone," Mr. Brown said. 
Many of the people who come to the pantry are referred by the county's Department of Social Services, but some come in on their own. Mr. Brown remembered one well-dressed woman in her 50's who burst into tears as she sat at his desk. "She didn't want to ask," he said.
Mark Aley, 50, of Riverhead, a frail man who said he broke his back twice and was unable to work, came for food for himself and his 14-year-old daughter. "I'm just about out, money-wise," he said. "No got."
He came with a friend, Thomas Matula, also of Riverhead. Mr. Matula said he had a disability that made him unable to lift anything heavy. He does odd jobs when he can, he said, but "there's no work now." 
He said his government assistance didn't go far enough. "I'm living day by day, and so is he," Mr. Matula said, motioning toward Mr. Aley. "We're just making ends meet. That's about it."
Mr. Matula, who was wearing a cap identifying him as a Vietnam veteran, said he no longer received food stamps. "I got a letter, and they cut me off," he said. "They cut me off. I served for six years, and I have to come in here and ask for food. Something is wrong."
"I'll tell you straight up, I just had a beer," he said. "That was my best pleasure for the whole month. Whole month." 
Mr. Matula paused frequently to fix his listeners with a long stare. He wore an American flag pin on his hat and a faceted stud earring. There was a pack of Pall Malls in the pocket of his torn shirt.
He said he was angry that the United States was sending food abroad while people at home went hungry. "What about our own people who don't have food?" he said. "We drop bombs over there in Afghanistan with food behind it? What about our people here?" 
Another client, Ms. Schwende, said she had worked as a home health aide before becoming disabled three years ago. She has diabetes and other health problems, she said.
Her food-stamp allotment of $131 a month had just been cut off. "I needed them, but they took them away from me," she said. "They said I didn't need them anymore. I guess they thought we'd eat nuts from the trees."
Raised in Riverhead by parents she described as alcoholics, she said she no longer worked and would not know how to find a job with decent pay. "People like us didn't get no education," she said. "What are we supposed to do? Where are we supposed to go? Do they want us to die in the streets?
"I'm very happy to have a center like this," she said. "I see people in the Dumpsters. A whole lot of people are going to the Dumpsters now. I don't want to end up in the Dumpsters.
"It never used to be like this," she said. "You could live very easily. Now everything is downhill. Actually, with the World Trade Center, everything is down. Everybody's life changed for the worse."

Hotel Developers Seek to Cash In on Casino Boom

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THE phenomenal success of the Mohegan Sun casino has spawned a hotel boom in the once-rural town of Montville, Conn., where along a one-mile stretch of Route 32 two hotels have opened this year and two others are on the drawing boards, even as Mohegan Sun develops its own 1,200-room hotel tower a couple of miles away.
 The 105-unit, all-suite Best Western Cristata has opened at Route 32 and Fort Shantok Road, and a 120-unit Microtel Inn and Suites opened just south of Route 2A. Two other developers have regulatory approvals for their plans: one for a 158-room hotel on the east side of Route 32, the other for a 54-unit hotel on the west side. A fifth hotel with 120 units is planned for the same area, but just over the town line in Norwich. 
 "There's no other area of the state that's seeing anywhere near the level of development that's going on down there," said Suzanne M. Hopgood, owner of the Hopgood Group, a hotel consulting firm. 
Deborah J. Donovan of Connecticut's Mystic & More Convention and Visitors Bureau, said there had been some concern about the impact a recession and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 might have on development, but so far no effect has been discernable. 
"Even with the recent events, the occupancy in the hotels is holding up pretty well in this area, much better than we've been hearing about in the rest of the country," Ms. Donovan said. "The average occupancy rate for the region in October was 74 percent, and some of these properties have occupancy rates in the 80's and 90's. In some areas, hotels are struggling to stay at 50 percent," including some in Connecticut.
The Sun is only a few miles from its only Connecticut competition -- Foxwoods Resort Casino, across the Thames River in Mashantucket, within the town the Ledyard -- and the two casinos are driving much of the hotel business in the area. 
Ms. Donovan said she's hopeful the latest developments will benefit the entire tourism industry. "There are more rooms for people to stay, and a much greater price range for them to choose from, which allows us to market to a wider demographic range," Ms. Donovan said. "It's good for the whole area that we have these new places opening."
Josephine R. Gustavsen, the owner of Oakdale Realty in Montville, said the residential market in town was also benefiting from the presence of the casino. A three-bedroom house that sold for $110,000 a year ago would now easily command $140,000, she said.
"Someone looking for a basic house that you can get into for $100,000 -- you're just not going to find it, and there aren't any rentals available either," Mrs. Gustavsen said. "The casino employees are buying everything at the lower end of the market."
THE two casinos together draw more than 70,000 customers a day, which is spurring hotel development throughout New London County. There are plans for new hotels in a half-dozen towns as close as Norwich and as far away as Niantic. As recently as 1995, there were about 2,000 units of hotel or other lodging in all of New London County, but by the end of this year the total could top 6,400 units.
Clearly, Montville will have the most significant concentration of new and proposed hotels, however. The situation is in marked contrast to what happened around Foxwoods, where the hotel development took place on the casino property, and there are few new hotels in the immediate area.
Richard R. Hamilton, general manager of the Best Western Cristata, said that to some extent, the hotels along Route 32 in Montville are benefiting from the other development at the Sun besides the growth of the casino itself. In addition to its 1,200-room hotel, which is to open next spring, a $1 billion expansion at the Sun that was completed this fall includes a 10,000-seat arena, a convention center and a spa.
"We're already getting calls from conventions that they've booked, looking for overflow rooms," Mr. Hamilton said. On the east side of the Thames, he added, "a lot of that overflow was handled by the Mystic hotels, which weren't that far away."
David P. Johnson, head of the Konover Hotel Corporation, which developed the Microtel hotel that opened this fall, said another limiting factor around Foxwoods was the lack of city water and sewer lines, natural gas service and other infrastructure.
"It made it a lot more difficult to develop on that side of the river," Mr. Johnson said. "You've also got better highway access on the Montville side, so it's not as isolated from the restaurants and shopping in Norwich or New London."
Montville's mayor, Howard R. Beetham, said the hotels require some city services, including police and fire protection, and they have begun to produce a lot of traffic at certain times of the day along Route 32. "But the impact is confined to a pretty small area right around the highway," Mr. Beetham said. The new hotels are each assessed at $3 million or $4 million, "and they generate a lot of local jobs," he added, so the overall effect has been positive for the town.
Mr. Beetham also said he would not be surprised if some developers who have won approvals for their projects wait several months before they start construction. "I think they'll want to sit back and see what happens when the Mohegans open their hotel," Mr. Beetham said. "How much business is going to be left on Route 32 after that?"
None of the hotel managers seem particularly troubled by the planned opening of the 1,200-room Mohegan hotel in the spring, however, because they say they serve a different market.
"To some people, the fact that we're close by but not actually on the casino grounds is seen as an advantage," Mr. Hamilton said. "We've done a lot of analysis of the market, and we think when the Sun hotel opens there will be some effect, but it won't be deep and it won't be long. This market will generate enough business to keep us all full."
Mr. Johnson said the casino had disclosed that it intended to target "high rollers," the more affluent gamblers, for its hotel, while the Microtel is aimed more at the budget market -- its published rates range from $59 to $89 a night. "If they're successful at what they intend to do, I will be successful in my niche," Mr. Johnson said. "We're aimed at very different kinds of clientele."
Mitchell Etess, vice president for marketing at the Sun, said he welcomed the nearby developments, because with 35,000 people a day at the casino, the 1,200 rooms planned on the grounds will not be able to accommodate all the business.
"There are people interested in spending their money on something other than a hotel room, and less-expensive lodging is going to be appealing to them," Mr. Etess said. "We're creating more demand than we can fill. And since almost all the hotels offer shuttle service to here, the more rooms that are available in the region, the better it will be for our customers. We support it, and we think it will benefit everyone."
Mr. Etess also predicted that some outlying hotels might also see more tourism business than they are expecting. "These hotels can succeed not only as Mohegan Sun dormitories, but they're close enough to Interstate 395 to draw a lot of off-the-road customers," Mr. Etess said. 
Ms. Hopgood, the hotel consultant, agreed. The casinos estimate that 26 million people live within a three-hour drive, and many of those people are not going to have the money or inclination to travel by airline because of the economy and the threat of terrorism. 
"Those people can drive to Montville and save some money," she said. "They're not spending a day flying to Las Vegas and a day flying home, so they've got two extra days, which could very well be used driving down to Mystic and seeing some of the local attractions. Southeastern Connecticut is one of those places that is properly positioned for these times, and there aren't very many of those."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Midtown Manhattan; 
Town Houses Used by Foreign Banks Are for Sale

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
DURING the 1990's as a wave of smaller foreign banks set up operations in this country, some of them decided not to occupy space in standard, multitenant buildings. Instead, they purchased town houses where they could be the sole occupants in some of the priciest neighborhoods in town.
 The elegant buildings, many of them mansions from New York's Gilded Age, helped establish the banks' image in a crowded city, and the small spaces in the buildings provided privacy for customers who had no interest in having their transactions observed by strangers. 
 "It's an image issue, clearly," said Andrew Davidoff, the chief executive of Emmes Group, which bought the Rockefeller town houses at 13-15 West 54th Street from a Danish bank called Unibank earlier this year. "These buildings are like the ones they operate in Europe. And because they are in the Plaza district, they are close to where their clients will be when they are in New York." 
The buildings at 13 and 15 West 54th Street were owned by members of the Rockefeller family from the early part of the last century until the death of Nelson A. Rockefeller, the former governor and vice president, in 1979. Other buildings in which banks set up their American operations may have lacked the pedigree of the Rockefeller building, but many came equipped with grand staircases, paneled walls and ornate fireplaces.
Many of the banks spent heavily on renovations to bring buildings that were built at the turn of the last century up to date in heating, cooling, lighting and telecommunications. But as times change, so do tastes in real estate, and some of the bank buildings have been sold or are on the market. 
In some cases, a bank that bought and renovated a building has been swallowed up in a merger by a larger institution that regards a town house not as a cozy headquarters, but as inefficient space for a branch operation and as an asset to be converted into cash.
One that is currently for sale is owned by Banco di Napoli at 4 East 54th Street. The asking price for the building, which was designed by Stanford White and completed in 1898, is $28.5 million.
Banco di Napoli, a regional bank in Italy, bought the six-story mansion in 1994 for $12.8 million and did a complete $7 million renovation of the building, which had been originally designed as a residence for a single family.
The renovation included the addition of one floor, which, to meet landmark rules, cannot be seen from the street. The building has a total of 23,000 square feet of space.
Last year the bank was acquired by a larger Italian institution, Sanpaolo IMI Bank, which has its American headquarters at 245 Park Avenue at 46th Street. The acquiring bank is reorganizing its New York operations and, while it may retain some space at 4 East 54th, has decided to offer the asset for sale.
It would not be unusual for a bank to retain some space in a location where it is well known. Mr. Davidoff said a successor to Unibank still has operations at the Rockefeller buildings, which are connected at the rear to a modern 13-story office building at 20 West 55th Street.
He said the bigger building was what most interested Emmes in the $30 million property, although the landmark town houses are fully occupied. Typical tenants for such properties are financial services companies, for whom the cost of real estate is minute in relationship to revenues generated.
He said the private banking division of U.S. Trust had operations in an adjacent building at 11 West 54th and had broken through a wall to add space in the Rockefeller buildings. "If I had more floors, I could rent them, too," he said.
"It is my sense that bankers feel better in these kind of offices than as anonymous tenants in a multiple office building," he said.
Richard Baxter, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, a brokerage and services company that is managing the sale of 4 East 54th Street, said Banco di Napoli followed a familiar route when it began operations in New York. After looking at the market, it decided to buy the building rather than rent space elsewhere.
"They bought the building, renovated it, and now it is being sold to recoup the profits," Mr. Baxter said. "It is a purely economic move."
THE building was built as a residence for a family named Stokes, Mr. Baxter said. However, the Stokes marriage failed before the building was finished in 1898. In 1900 it was sold to William Moore and his wife, who lived there until her death in 1955. Subsequently, it had a variety of occupants until it was purchased by Banco di Napoli in 1994.
The building is unusual for a New York town house because it is 36 feet wide, compared with the more typical 20 to 25 feet, Mr. Baxter said.
Another bank town house on the market is one currently occupied by LBS Bank, which is based in Slovenia, an independent country that was once part of Yugoslavia. The seven-story, 20,500-square-foot building is at 12 East 52nd Street and has an asking price of $14 million.
The bank needs to expand beyond the five floors it has in the building and may opt for an American-style configuration with all operations on one floor, said Noel L. Berk, a principal of Mercedes Berk Ltd., which is trying to arrange the sale in connection with Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company.
"Small foreign banks like to own their own buildings," Ms. Berk said. "It gives them an identity for 5 or 10 years, but then their needs change."
When they first come to New York, she said, the banks like to operate the way they do at home, with each division on a separate floor. But as they become accustomed to this market, they begin to see the value of integrating operations and find the town houses an obstacle to more efficient operations, she added.
"The American way of managing space is very different from Europe," said Ron Cohen, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG. "As they move to the United States, they learn there are more efficient ways to operate."
Another factor prompting foreign banks to leave their beautiful town houses for office buildings is the decline of private banking at smaller institutions, Mr. Cohen said.
A mansion with a discreet brass plate next to the front door appeals to the clientele of private bankers, he said. "They want a small, private building where they can come and meet with their advisers," Mr. Cohen said. "Unfortunately," he said, private bankers "are a dying breed. With globalization, they cannot maintain the same level of service and location."
Also on the market is a 10,500-square-foot building at 124 East 55th Street on what was once known as "bankers row" between Lexington and Park Avenues, Ms. Berk said. The building, a Tudor-style structure with original fireplaces, was owned for many years by the Bank of Chile. The bank sold it to an investment group, which ultimately found it unsuitable, she said, putting it back on the market with an asking price of $7.9 million.
The buyer of any of these buildings could easily be another bank, particularly because they are in areas zoned for commercial operations. Nonprofit organizations can occupy properties in residential areas, but profit-making companies are confined to commercial zones, Ms. Berk said. The zoning would also allow the reconversion of the buildings for residential use, she said, although many of the facades are protected by landmark designation. 
An executive of Emmes suggested earlier this year that the Rockefeller buildings could become home to someone who could come up with $20 million. 
"It is not that small foreign banks do not want to operate in mansions and town houses," Ms. Berk said. "They do, until their needs change. I have been showing these buildings to banks and consulates."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
A Slower Pace to Retailing's Growth in the State

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AT many a store and shopping center this holiday season, cash registers are ringing -- but maybe not as constantly as last year -- and merchants are discounting their prices and working harder to consummate sales. Outside, parking spaces can still be found.
 After four years of steady growth, the retail market in New Jersey seems to be deflating like a balloon with a slow leak. A shriveling national economy and rising unemployment coupled with the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 and the subsequent war have hammered consumer confidence and encouraged people to buy less and save more, retail consultants and brokers said. 
 "The market has reached the end of an unprecedented period of growth, and rents have peaked," said Matthew K. Harding, president of the Levin Management Corporation, a retail management and services firm in North Plainfield. Consumers are still buying, but they have shifted from luxury items to discount goods as they "buy what they need and for value," he said. 
Meanwhile, retail centers continue to open and new ones, many planned years earlier and substantially preleased, are being built, but at a slower pace. Evidence of developments on the way are three projects -- one each in Phillipsburg, Holmdel and Hamilton -- under way or about to start that will produce a total of nearly 2 million square feet. 
Stores are also closing as the bankruptcies of national retailers continue, with 26 so far this year, compared with 29 for all of last year and 31 in 1999, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group in Manhattan. Among those that have made bankruptcy filings this year are Ames Department Stores, a discounter in Rocky Hill, Conn., and Lechters, based in Harrison, which sold dinnerware and kitchen goods. 
But retailers as a whole are still expanding, though not as aggressively as in the past, and there is likely to be demand for some of the dark spaces left by chains that went bankrupt. Still, Mr. Harding said, economic conditions "affect the push for retailer expansion."
Additionally, retailers are "more selective in where they will go," said Ted Kraus, who heads a retail consulting and publishing firm in Mercerville. Centers in prime locations are still in demand because tenants know they will draw customers, while those in secondary markets "will take longer to fill," he said.
Tenants looking for space include big box retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy, the discount electronics chain. Grocery chains, including Wegmans, new to the state, are also in the market, as are smaller national retailers.
One is the Vitamin Shoppe, a discounter based in North Bergen. "We are looking to capitalize on the opportunities in the market left by retailers teetering on bankruptcy," said Corey M. Bialow, the company's director of real estate and construction.
This month the company will open its 100th store and the 12th in New Jersey at the Nassau Park Center on Route 1 in Princeton, and two more will open in the state by January. The company plans to add up to 50 more stores nationally in the next 18 months, six of which will be in New Jersey, Mr. Bialow said.
While the slowdown in the retail market started about a year ago, the state's dense population and diverse employment base are buffering it from drastic dips, said Jonathan Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization/TCN Worldwide, a commercial real estate services firm in Woodbridge. 
The vacancy rate for nine major shopping corridors in north and central New Jersey is now 5.3 percent, up from 4.8 percent last year, according to data compiled by his firm. "Though the current figure reflects a slight increase, it is still considered healthy by historical standards," he said, noting that a vacancy rate of 7.5 percent or below is considered strong.
Still Mr. Schultz, like other professionals, is less sanguine about next year. He expects more bankruptcies, a rising retail vacancy rate and falling rents, even though the recession is generally expected to end by the second half of 2002. 
How much worse things will get will depend in part on the final results of the holiday shopping season. While there were generally positive reports about retail sales immediately after Thanksgiving, Mr. Kraus said, profits have been small because of the discounts retailers have been offering to lure skittish consumers. His projection is that the state's retail sales for the full year "will be flat or in the negative column."
Mr. Harding said that despite the slow sales of other goods, home furnishings and home-oriented products would remain relatively healthy as families stay home to save money. Discounters will continue to do well, as will grocery chains, he added.
Developers who are armed with signed leases from tenants for big chunks of space are pushing ahead with projects. 
IN Phillipsburg, Starwood Ceruzzi L.L.C. will begin construction this month on the first 240,000 square feet of Greenwich Center, which will have a total of 326,500 square feet. The initial phase of the 49-acre project has been fully leased, said Louis L. Ceruzzi, president of the company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn. The five current tenants include a Target discount department store, with 126,000 square feet. 
Mr. Ceruzzi said the project makes sense because it has desirable tenants and because it is in "an exploding area." He pointed out that some 52,000 people with an average household income of $109,462 live within seven miles of the site -- which is along Route 22, just off Interstate 78 -- and 122,000 cars pass it each day. 
Construction on the project's remaining 86,000 square feet will start once half of that space is leased, Mr. Ceruzzi said. Completion of the entire center is expected next October. Rents are comparable to those in the area, which are $14 to $16 a square foot.
Going forward, the company's development strategy will be more conservative. "In large part," Mr. Ceruzzi said, "we will focus on projects with one to three large tenants like discounters, home improvement or grocery stores and not take on the risk of leasing smaller satellite stores, at least until the economy improves." 
In Holmdel, construction is under way on the Commons at Holmdel, a 235,000-square-foot center rising on part of a 127-acre site along Route 35 at Laurel Avenue. Tenants have signed on for 70 percent of the space, said Steven J. Denholtz, managing director and chief executive of Denholtz Associates of Rahway, which is developing the project with the Zaro Group, a real estate investment company in Ocean Township. Rents are $18 to $35 a square foot.
Mr. Denholtz said a few "minor tenants," had backed out of the project when their expansion plans were shelved, but they have been replaced. In uncertain times, "retailers are drawn to and put a premium on well-located centers," he said, adding that one attraction of this site was that other uses -- offices and residences -- were planned. 
Also, across Route 35 is an existing 295,000-square-foot center, which the partners purchased last February. It is 90 percent occupied. So far tenants at the Commons at Holmdel include Best Buy and Pier 1, Barnes & Noble and Vitamin Shoppe. It is to be completed by July.
In Hamilton, work has begun on a 1.2-million-square-foot center now that the developer has leases signed "with enough large tenants," said Donald T. Wargo. He is president of Global Property Investors in King of Prussia, Pa., which is developing the project with JDN Realty, a real estate invest trust in Atlanta. Its anchors so far are Wal-Mart and a Kohl's discount department store, a Lowes home improvement center and a supermarket. 
Ultimately, the project, Hamilton Crossings, will also include a wholesale warehouse club, several midsize stores of 10,000 to 25,000 square feet each and about 25 smaller tenants. It will rise over the next 18 months. The partners are betting that the strength of the major anchors will be a magnet for other tenants as will the 210-acre project's location along Route 130, where it intersects with Interstate 195. Demographics also support it, Mr. Wargo said, noting that some 112,000 people with an average household income of $77,000 live within five miles of the site.
Still, the partners would not consider starting another project this size today, Mr. Wargo said, adding, "The retail climate is too iffy."

HEADLINE: CITIES; 
Bright Lights, Big Retail

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
THE young professionals nesting in this mushrooming city's Newport and Avalon Cove waterfront developments can cradle their Zest in a Tommy Hilfiger soap dish. The fashionable recent arrivals in the Porto Fino or Gotham high-rise buildings can wash their hands of second-tier department stores and dry them with Ralph Lauren bath towels.
 Macy's has arrived on this former industrial shoreline. And with it, at least in retail terms, so has Jersey City. 
 Macy's, the department store chain synonymous with New York's Thanksgiving Day Parade, whose Herald Square flagship is the largest store in the world, has opened a 168,000-square-foot store in the Newport Center mall.
While hardly Saks Fifth Avenue or even Neiman Marcus, Macy's is certainly the most upscale department store in this city, whose status as virtually a sixth borough of New York has become increasingly obvious as jobs jump across the Hudson, rents rise like skyscrapers and trendier residents look around for places to lighten their wallets.
In the retail pantheon, Macy's occupies a loftier pedestal than the two other stores flanking it at Newport Center -- Sears and J. C. Penney. Even the space occupied by Macy's, which used to house a Sterns store, is inadequate in the eyes of executives at Federated Department Stores, the Cincinnati-based retail conglomerate that owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and they plan to build a new 210,000-square-foot store at Newport Center.
But Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, said it was difficult to tell whether building a new store was wise with the economy waning.
"A lot of people think the recession's going to end and the economy's going to get better," Mr. Feiner said. 
John D. Morris, a retail analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison, said that he feared retailers were overbuilding, but that it was difficult to alter construction plans at the drop of a market index. 
"It's kind of hard to turn the battleship around," Mr. Morris said.
As for the Jersey City retail market, Mr. Morris said construction of a Macy's did not necessarily signal a significant change, particularly when Sears and other retailers continued to court new customers.
"The lines are blurred," he said. "It's harder to distinguish between the kind of customer who shops at a Macy or a Sears or even a T J Maxx, for that matter."
Just in case too much arriviste significance is attached to the Macy's move into Jersey city, it is part of a broader corporate decision announced by Federated in February to dissolve the Sterns chain, which Federated also owned, and replace Sterns stores with Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
But in planning to build an entirely new store at the mall, Federated has made a commitment to Jersey City beyond its other Sterns conversions, since, as a company spokeswoman acknowledged, Federated recognizes Jersey City as an emerging retail marketplace.
Indeed, the market demographics of Jersey City -- once a bustling blue-collar town -- are rapidly changing as office, residential and hotel projects are developed, said the spokeswoman, Jean Coggan.
Ms. Coggan said the company expected the Newport Center store to divert some traffic from the flagship Herald Square, which is linked almost door-to-door to the Newport Center store by the PATH train, which stops at 33rd Street in Manhattan and Newport-Pavonia in Jersey City, though she said any overlap would be minimal.
For now, said Carl Reggie, marketing director for Newport Center, which is owned by the Simon Property Group, a mall developer based in Indianapolis, the former Sterns space would be leased to another department store or divided into smaller retail spaces once Macy's moves into the new building next year.
"I think a lot of people have been waiting for a store like Macy's to come into the area," said Michelle Alonso, a planner in the Jersey City Planning Department. "It's a place where you can get solid name brands for work. Really, I think that's it."
A prominent anchor tenant can also set the tone for an entire mall, and Ms. Alonso said the Simon Property Group was as eager as any shopper for Macy's arrival.
But Mr. Reggie said the mall could not use the arrival of Macy's to lure other more upscale tenants soon because "we're basically 100 percent leased."
Though Jersey City's incomes are rising proportionately to the skyline, local business owners lamented that new residents had not thought of Jersey City as a place to shop, dine and have fun. 
But some of that apprehension seems to be lifting. In addition to the arrival of Macy's, there has also been a proliferation of trendy boutiques, restaurants, cafes and night spots in the city's historic downtown neighborhoods, just off the waterfront. 
Parallel to the more prosperous nature of the waterfront residents, who live in sparkling new high-rise buildings, there is also an increasing hipness to the younger and perhaps less-affluent residents of the brownstones and brick walk-ups of the city's historic Van Vorst, Hamilton Park and Harsimus Cove neighborhoods.
Leslie McCall, a professor of sociology at Rutgers and a 30-something habitual acquirer of jackets who shops at the mall, said the change in the city's atmosphere was palpable.
"I always talk to my friends about Jersey City, so the conversation inevitably turns to places to eat, places to shop, places to see movies," said Professor McCall, who has kept her eye -- as sociologist and fashionista -- on Newport Center's progression.
Even with Macy's arrival, Professor McCall said she was still frustrated by the limited selection at Newport, which included such mall staples as the Gap, Victoria's Secret and the Limited.
"I think it's still extremely limited, and I think most people from Manhattan or whatever are still, 'It's Jersey City, Prof,' " she said, mocking others' disdain for her adopted hometown. "But all my friends who come out here are shocked at how nice it is."

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES; 
Holiday Shopping Altered by Sept. 11

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
IN any other year, Ellen Greenberg would have already clocked a fairly hefty number of shopping hours at the Palisades Mall in anticipation of her family's observance of both Hanukkah and Christmas.
 This is obviously not any other year. "I don't want to be in a mall," said Ms. Greenberg, an Irvington mother of three. Instead, Ms. Greenberg has shifted both the extent of her shopping and where she is making her holiday purchases. While she has gone to The Westchester mall in White Plains, mostly to satisfy the cravings of her 12-year-old daughter, Ms. Greenberg's preference has been the smaller stores in Irvington, or even the shopping district of Mount Kisco. 
 "I just feel like supporting the local stores," she said. "I feel bad for any merchant in a small town who's struggling this year."
Even so, Ms. Greenberg said: "I haven't shopped much. I haven't felt very materialistic lately. This is such an incredibly sad year. My husband works downtown, and I'm trying to key down what we're doing. What I feel right now is that I want my girls to be humble and grateful for what they have."
Like many other county residents whose shopping interests and habits have altered slightly this season, Ms. Greenberg's concerns reflect still another shift in the post-Sept. 11 landscape. Whether it's issues about personal safety in crowded places like malls in the aftermath of the horror of Sept. 11, anxiety about the economic uncertainties or even a lingering mourning process that casts a shadow over customary pursuits, the current holiday shopping season is subtly different from recent years. 
"I was at the Palisades Mall, starting to shop for Hanukkah, and part of me was pleased it seemed normal and part of me wished that the holiday was closer to Christmas, because it seemed too soon to be shopping like that," said Bonnie Moss, an Irvington resident who said she had been uncomfortable at the prospect of parking in The Westchester mall's garage. "You have to celebrate. We're going through the paces, but something seems wrong."
Granted, no one is saying that the malls are empty, or that suddenly there has been a wholesale swing to local merchants.
"We were very pleased with Thanksgiving weekend," said Robert Guerra, manager of The Westchester. "Traffic and sales were both up, compared to last year."
Similarly, at the Galleria mall in White Plains, "We have seen more traffic in the past three weeks, and I've seen people carrying multiple shopping bags," said Paula Kelliher, marketing director of that mall. "I've seen more of people wanting to indulge their kids than being skeptical of spending their money." 
While Harry Potter-themed merchandise, teenage paraphernalia and trendy products keep consumers flocking to malls, there also is increased interest in trimming the holiday gift list, supporting local merchants and searching for a different kind of experience. 
"There's a sense that people are quite concerned about their future and are cutting back on big expenditures for other people," said James Gould, professor of marketing at the Lubin School of Business at Pace University in White Plains. "People are holding back."
This translates into a desire to have these holidays be about something more than acquiring the latest must-have item, with some of the county's smaller stores and downtowns benefiting from this trend. 
"We've noticed an increase in foot traffic," said Manny Ennes, owner of Roberts Department Store in Mamaroneck, and chairman of the Mamaroneck Avenue Task Force. "There have been a lot of families out there on the street, especially Saturdays and Sundays. Our business is up considerably. What I'm hearing from customers is that they're more comfortable shopping in smaller stores. People want to come in and talk, they want to feel they can have a conversation. Knowing the person behind the counter seems more important now, instead of going where no one knows you."
At Buttermilk Blue in Irvington, a home decorating and folk arts store, Barbara Coccioletti, the owner, said: "I'm seeing people coming back after a quiet fall. I think people are ready for a joyous holiday, and I think Christmas and Hanukkah will be more meaningful this year. People may not buy as much, or may just want to buy something special. 
"They're going to hold family members closer," she added. "But in the back of everyone's mind is the idea of how difficult it is to sell stuff when so many people's lives have changed and there are people at war."

HEADLINE: In Florida, a New Emphasis on Design 

BYLINE:  By BETH DUNLOP; Beth Dunlop is an architecture critic and author based in Miami Beach.

 BODY:
BACK in 1981, a developer named Robert Davis set out from Miami on a sentimental journey through Florida. He had inherited 80 acres on the Gulf of Mexico in Florida's Panhandle, and he thought he would build a nostalgic beach town there. But nostalgia soon gave way to what came to be called "New Urbanism," and the result was Seaside, a tiny resort town that has attracted wide praise for its planning and architecture. Today, Florida has become a showcase for smart -- in several senses of the word -- development, with new towns that feature buildings by an array of illustrious architects and gifted young designers.
 Florida's New Urbanist developments -- ranging from sophisticated coastal resorts to college-town neighborhoods -- invoke historic architectural styles and turn developer cliches upside down. They offer houses on narrow, walkable streets that lead to parks, gardens, shops and even, in some cases, neighborhood schools. 
 Controversial at first, these traditional-neighborhood developments, whether new towns or suburban enclaves, are now considered by many real estate theorists to be the leading edge, especially as new studies show both growing demand for taut, livable neighborhoods, undergirded by strict principles of town planning, and better investment potential, indicating that houses in such developments appreciate better than their conventional counterparts. 
These new towns include Rosemary Beach and WaterColor on the Florida Panhandle; Windsor, near Vero Beach; and the much-discussed Celebration, near Orlando. At a time when luxury sales elsewhere, even in the recently booming South Beach section of Miami, are skittish, in the New Urbanist developments, houses and cottages, apartments and town houses command a premium price with no shortage of buyers, according to the developers.
"More than anywhere else in America, development in Florida proves that architecture and urbanism can transform the whole image, the value of a place," said the New York-based architect Robert A. M. Stern, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, who has been involved in the design of two of the Florida projects. 
What is happening in the state stems from a combination of idealism and hard-nosed business acumen. Twenty years ago, Seaside was regarded as a novel experiment, and scoffed at by developers accustomed to filling beachfronts with high-rises and suburban tracts with cookie-cutter houses on cul-de-sacs.
Today, Seaside is more often a source of admiration and emulation, and the Florida Panhandle, once derided as the "redneck Riviera," has assumed a far more sophisticated identity as other New Urbanist towns grow up on the sugar-sand dunes of the Gulf of Mexico. There are three of them now, with a fourth about to come out of the ground, all within an eight-mile stretch of coastline. "I can't think of any place else within hundreds of miles that is such a center of architectural excellence," said the Miami architect and town planner Andres Duany, who with his wife, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, planned Seaside and the nearby Rosemary Beach. 
Next to Seaside, which is only 80 acres, is the 499-acre town of WaterColor, which embraces both the beachfront and an inland coastal dune lake. Eight miles east is Rosemary Beach, a Caribbean-inspired cottage colony. Still to come -- with groundbreaking next year -- is WaterSound, to be built on more than a mile of untouched sand dunes.
"This is not some naive 'if you build it they will come' scheme,' " said Peter Rummel, chairman and chief executive of the St. Joe Company, the giant land company developing WaterColor and WaterSound. "This is calculated, and it starts with understanding the size and shape of the market. It is state of the art in terms of where we think community development is going, and philosophically we also believe that it's the right way to build."
It is not only the Florida Panhandle where this is taking place.
Celebration, the Walt Disney Company's much-watched new town next to the theme parks outside of Orlando, has just reached the ripe old age of 5 and has a population of approximately 5,000. Haile Plantation Village Center, with about 2,000 houses in a variety of neighborhoods connecting to a village center by wooded trails, greenways and a system of public commons, began two decades ago as a more conventional planned unit development on 1,700 acres near Gainesville just five miles from the University of Florida; its developers have recently annexed 550 more acres to continue building. And Windsor, the high-end resort town on the Atlantic coast just north of Vero Beach continues to grow slowly and garner admiration; it was the subject of the Institute for Classical Architecture's fall "salon" last month at the University Club in New York.
Axiomatically, such towns cost more than a typical subdivision. Home builders grouse that adding porches, almost an absolute in New Urbanist towns (although some codes call for garden walls and courtyards instead), automatically adds $8,000 to $10,000 to the price tag for construction that does not show up in the square-foot count.
The costs range widely: an average house in the New Urbanist-inspired SouthWood, near Tallahassee, sells for $171,800, and the bottom price at Celebration is $242,910. Haile Plantation, which already has 4,000 residents, offers numerous housing choices, from a $150,000 town house in the village center to a $450,000 house facing the golf course.
Seaside's cottages -- there are 430 of them, with a handful for sale at any given time -- are typically in the $800,000-to-$900,000 range but skyrocket into the low millions for those on the beach. At Rosemary Beach, "lofts" and "flats" sell for $315,000 and up, while a 5,500-square-foot house facing the gulf is on the market for $5.5 million. With 209 buildings completed and another 156 under way, Rosemary's prices go from $300 to $1,000 a square foot.
At Seaside, beachfront lots (no houses) sell for $1.6 to $2.3 million. Across the state at Windsor, lots sell for $200,000 to $3.6 million and houses list for $895,000 up past $5 milion. Windsor currently has 129 houses and will ultimately have about 350.
The list of those who have planned the towns reads like a Who's Who in architecture. Mr. Duany and Ms. Plater-Zyberk, who is also dean of the University of Miami School of Architecture, are among America's leading New Urbanists, with some 200 town plans to their credit, including Rosemary Beach and Windsor.
Mr. Stern and Jacquelin Robertson, a New York architect and former dean at the University of Virginia School of Architecture, together designed Celebration for Disney. Mr. Robertson is now the master planner for WaterColor, while Mr. Stern has designed WaterSound.
But that is just the beginning. Seaside has become a kind of architectural shrine, with buildings by architects as disparate as the Luxembourg-born Leon Krier and the late Aldo Rossi of Italy, both classicists, as well as such comparatively avant-garde designers as Steven Holl of New York and the firm of Mockbee-Coker of Auburn, Ala. There are houses and public buildings by such New York architects as Walter Chatham, Alex Gorlin and Deborah Berke, a mixed-use complex by Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti of Cambridge, Mass., and a new chapel by Scott Merrill of Vero Beach.
WaterColor's 60-room beachfront hotel was designed by the New York architect David Rockwell, known for his memorable restaurants, including Nobu. The Cambridge, Mass., architect Graham Gund designed WaterColor's $1.2 million beach apartments.
Celebration's downtown has buildings by Michael Graves, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown, Cesar Pelli, Philip Johnson and the late Charles Moore. At Windsor, there are a chapel by Mr. Krier, a beach club by Mr. Robertson and houses by the Duany & Plater-Zyberk firm and Hugh Newell Jacobsen. At Aqua, a New Urbanist-inspired residential enclave under construction in Miami Beach, the list of architects includes the firm of Harriri & Harriri as well as Mr. Chatham and Mr. Gorlin. 
Most buildings in these new towns are not by the famous, however, but by young architects based in Florida and elsewhere in the Southeast. "One of the things I'm proudest of is having been able to help young architects when they weren't well known," said Mr. Davis, Seaside's developer. "I have a pretty good batting average at picking young architects when they were just at the start of their career."
But architectural firepower is only part of the arsenal, according to Mr. Rummel of the St. Joe Company. "It all starts with an intelligent plan that you can execute wisely," he said. "It doesn't do any good to hire great architects unless you first hire great planners. However, if you plan really intelligently and put great architecture on top of that, the top line grows."
New Urbanist planning relies on the form and design of American towns built before World War II, and the principles derive from careful analysis by Duany & Plater-Zyberk and many others. Streets are purposely narrow, grids well-defined. Neighborhoods are organized on the idea of a "five-minute walk," which ensures that residents can get to a shop or park or tennis court without getting into a car.
OUT of this derives a set of architectural expectations, based on studies of local historic prototypes. As Celebration was being developed, for example, Disney sent the architect Joseph Barnes on a trip throughout the South, asking him to photograph every interesting small-town house and streetscape he could find. Celebration's houses are based on a range of architectural prototypes, up-to-date versions of Southern small-town domestic architecture. Current sales prices range from $242,910 for a town house to $975,000 for a seven-bedroom lakefront house.
Perhaps unexpectedly, architects say they luxuriate in working in the historic vernacular prescribed at these New Urbanist towns either by a code or a "pattern book." Mr. Robertson describes it as "exhilarating and liberating, a release." He added, "It's crossbred and so curious, an architecture that is at once rustic and funky and yet imbued with grand ideas."
At the 119-acre Rosemary Beach, the code calls for a tawny paint palette and houses with courtyard gardens and "sleeping porch" balconies. House styles based on an array of prototypes found in the Caribbean and early Spanish Florida, are prescribed and building materials are stipulated -- real stucco, lap siding, wood windows -- all to ensure that there is a high level of quality throughout the beachfront town. Every plan is scrutinized by the Rosemary Beach town architect, Richard Gibbs.
"You're buying a protection scheme, almost like hiring a bodyguard," Mr. Gibbs said. "You're trusting that somebody will watch your investment. My job is to watch out for the value of everybody's construction. We aren't changing the course midstream, so we don't entertain new ideas." 
That "protection scheme" yields houses -- the range is from full-fledged beach cottages to carriage houses -- that sell for $420,000 (for a one-bedroom dwelling) to $5.5 million on the beach.
Nearby, at WaterColor, home sites average $284,600 and new houses $518,000, though the apartments on the Gulf of Mexico more than double that price. WaterColor's house designs are based on a pattern book created by the Pittsburgh architect Ray Gindroz and his firm, Urban Design Associates, who first did such a book for Celebration. The pattern books offer what is in some ways a "kit of parts," showing designers and builders what is considered to be allowable massing, detailing and construction.
Critics of the New Urbanism range from tract home builders, who argue that the economies of large-scale production offered by their approach have wider market appeal, to academics who charge that the New Urbanism deflects attention from needy center cities.
New Urbanists respond to the former charge by citing studies showing a growing preference in the marketplace for traditional town developments. To the latter criticism, Mr. Duany, Ms. Plater-Zyberk and others can point to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Hope Six program, in which much-debased public housing projects are being turned into neighborhoods and to other in-town projects (one such is in downtown Stewart, Fla.) that have relied on the ideas of New Urbanism.
Critics have also described Florida's New Urbanist developments as not being "real" because they are resorts. And indeed a number of Florida's New Urbanist towns -- the four in the Panhandle and Windsor -- are essentially resort towns, with just a few full-time residents, though the number is growing. Mr. Duany points out that historically most Florida towns originated as resorts -- "Miami was a resort," he said -- that evolved. "Resorts have to be utopias, so they have to be better than normal. They are a laboratory to a higher aspiration."
Analysts are looking at the emerging markets of demanding buyers -- such as middle-aged baby boomers with mobility, buying either second homes or seeking new places to live where the quality of life is high. A current study by Lend Lease Real Estate Investments, the giant property management firm, asserts that buyers increasingly want the amenity of well-planned communities. 
"These may not yet be communities, in the full sense of the word," Mr. Stern said, "but they are sounder in terms of their respect for the environment. They have more green space. The architecture is more fully integrated. And ultimately, they are aggregations of houses that make visual communities and will become real communities."
Rosemary Beach has a series of town greens, as well as smaller pocket parks and its own butterfly garden. Houses are linked to parks, pools and the beach by a series of sandy footpaths and wooden walkways. Seaside -- the oldest of Florida's New Urbanist towns -- has shops, restaurants, offices, a new chapel and a school in addition to its 430 homes. Windsor has a widely admired new chapel and town center, as well as the more unusual offering of a polo field.
Two other towns built along New Urbanist principles -- Abacoa in Jupiter and SouthWood in Tallahassee -- both have outpost campuses of the state university system as additional attractions. Celebration, which Mr. Stern calls "the most important of these towns in terms of its scope," has a kindergarten-through-12th-grade school as well as a lakeside "downtown" with shops, restaurants and a movie theater.
WaterColor not only has the hotel and neighboring beach club and its inland lake with a boathouse built and a restaurant planned. It also has a 600-foot long "central park" with a linear butterfly garden, tended by horticulturalists, as its centerpiece.
"The most obvious payout is the visual, the qualitative difference that results from good design," said P. Michael Reininger, senior vice president for creative services at the St. Joe Company, developer of SouthWood in addition to WaterColor and WaterSound. "What's even more interesting than the visual is the palpable value, the experiential value. Some of it comes at an obvious and overt level, but some is at a subconscious and subtle level."
In Florida land development, St. Joe is the proverbial gorilla. The company is the state's largest private landowner, with holdings of one million acres in northwest Florida alone, roughly the size of the state of Delaware. The company owns more than half the land in at least six counties in Florida. This makes it a formidable force in both land development and environmental conservation.
Mr. Rummel was named chairman and chief executive in 1997, after heading the development arm of the Walt Disney Company. That, of course, included the creation of Celebration. As a result, he has become one of the country's most articulate proponents of the soundness of the ideas of the New Urbanism, saying "it is the right way to build long-term value."
In Florida, the idea of a patient approach to building long-term value can be an anomalous one. Developers of high-rise condominiums can sell out quickly in hot markets and move on to another site. But for builders of towns and neighborhoods, the process is much more drawn-out, creating a greater long-term responsibility for quality.
THOUGH Florida law requires that governance be turned over to the buyers within 10 years, developers like Mr. Davis at Seaside or Galen Weston at Windsor tend to retain ownership of the public and commercial buildings, making them stakeholders in their own developments.
Mr. Duany, who recently was co-author with Ms. Plater-Zyberk and Jeff Speck of the book "Suburban Nation" and who lectures and writes frequently on all aspects of the New Urbanism, has made a case study of land prices in the Panhandle. He has found that inland lots in conventional beach developments in other Panhandle destinations like Destin are selling at $13 a square foot. At Rosemary Beach and WaterColor, an inland lot goes for $57 and $61 a square foot, respectively, while at Seaside an inland lot is twice that, $119 per square foot.
The phenomenal escalation of land values at Seaside is almost the stuff of real estate legend. The earliest lots sold for as low as $15,000 in the early 1980's; today a plot in Seaside's new cemetery sells for that price. A beachfront lot goes for between $1.6 million and $2.3 million, unbuilt. Away from the beach, lots start at $300,000. Houses that cost less than $100,000 in the 80's now sell from $499,000 to $1.1 million. Offering prices at other New Urbanist towns also tend to be at premium levels.
A recent study by John Rymer, vice president of the Texas-based Morrison Homes, examined Celebration and two other traditional-neighborhood developments (Kentlands in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Md., and Laguna West near Sacramento) in comparison with nearby conventional counterparts. He discovered that though the initial investment was higher per square foot in New Urbanist neighborhoods, the appreciation over three years (1997-2000) was steadily better, an overall rate of 16.7 percent compared with 14.2 percent.
"People will pay more for well-thought-out design," Mr. Rummel said. "That's because we're building environments that have enduring value."

 BODY:
MORE feature films had scenes shot on location in New Jersey last year than in any prior year, with film production up 16 percent over 1999, according to an annual report issued by the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television Commission in November for 2000.
 The total number of film projects -- including features, television movies, television series and specials, music videos, short features, industrial films, documentaries and commercials -- was 664. Together they created a record annual revenue of $69.7 million for the state economy. 
 In 2000, part or all of 93 television series and specials were shot in the state, down from 118 the year before. Joseph Friedman, executive director of the commission, said the apparent decline was misleading because the commission, which was established in 1977, classifies each title as one project, even when it is a series with several episodes. 
Mr. Friedman added that in 2000 more episodes of television projects were filmed in the state than ever, pointing out that two series -- "Ed" on NBC and "Oz"on HBO -- are filmed regularly in New Jersey.
The report noted that since 1978, 8,314 film and television projects have been attracted to the state, and production companies have spent more than $648.2 million since then.
"Most of the reason for our success is we are getting repeat business," Mr. Friedman said.
Films with footage shot in New Jersey in 2000 include Woody Allen's "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," which used the Hoboken Terminal as a stand-in for Grand Central Station, and "Miss Congeniality," with scenes shot in Weehawken. In that movie, Sandra Bullock plays an undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who poses as Miss New Jersey in a beauty pageant.
Other films that used the state as a location in 2000 were "Riding in Cars with Boys," with scenes filmed in Bloomfield, East Orange and Newark, and "Ocean's Eleven," which filmed in Atlantic City and at East Jersey State Prison in Woodbridge. Some of the inmates were extras; their salaries went to the New Jersey Victims of Crime Compensation Board.
"Family Man," starring Nicolas Cage, was set and shot in the state, filming in East Rutherford, Fort Lee and other towns.
A year ago, Variety ranked New Jersey fifth in a list of the most popular states for location shooting, after California, New York, Florida and Illinois. But the state has a long way to go to catch up to New York City, where production expenditures add more than $5.6 billion a year to the city's economy, according to the New York City Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.
But it is expensive to film in New York. New Jersey is cheaper and has other advantages as well, producers and location managers say. These include the state's proximity to New York, its geographic diversity and its ample, low-cost studio space, including the Bayonne Military Ocean Terminal of the United States Army, decommissioned in 1999. This month, the Bayonne Local Redevelopment Authority is planning to request proposals to create a permanent film facility at the site.
The Jersey City Armory and the Teaneck Armory have also been used as studios by movie companies.
The state's population is largely enthusiastic about filmmaking in their neighborhoods, unlike New York's more cynical citizens.
"In the last year, filmmaking in the New York area has been huge," said Helen Robin, who was co-producer for "Jade Scorpion." "There are times New York has become oversaturated, and the people get cranky. But in New Jersey, filmmaking is still a thrill for people, which makes it a fun experience for us."
Mr. Allen's films are usually shot at locations within an hour's drive from New York, often in New Jersey, though that is not always apparent. "Sweet and Lowdown" had scenes filmed in New Jersey, for example.
The television series "Ed," in its second season, is about a lawyer who returns home to Ohio from New York City to run a bowling alley and a legal practice. His girlfriend is a high school teacher. Though the show has nothing to do with New Jersey, the producers have made a commitment to the state.
In the first season, they transformed the former Country Club Lanes bowling alley in Northvale into Stuckeybowl, the show's bowling alley. They also filmed scenes at Montclair High School and in a courthouse in Nutley.
This year, they used space at the Country Club bowling alley, and at other buildings on its property, to build a high school hallway set that replicates one at Montclair, complete with scuff marks, and a classroom set modeled on a Montclair High classroom. They also built a courtroom set based on the Nutley courtroom.
In 2000, "Oz" moved its studio space from Manhattan to the Bayonne terminal; this year its fifth season is being shot there. "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit," on NBC, is shot at a studio in North Bergen. And "The Sopranos," on HBO, filming its fourth season, uses locations around New Jersey.
Films made at state locations this year include "A Beautiful Mind," about a Princeton mathematician; it was made in Princeton and Madison.
For some movie makers, New Jersey is metaphor as well as location. "Storytelling," directed by Newark-born Todd Solondz, is set in New Jersey though not in a specific town.
"It is established as being a commute from New York," said Ted Hope, a producer of the film. "What the Jersey conceit provides is that the audience knows there is obviously always something else on the horizon and the promise of a true melting pot of people -- yet they have the false security of a suburban life."
"Storytelling" opens in January.

Black, White and Blue: The Layoffs at Steinway

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE O'DONNELL 

 BODY:
Pianos, the workers at the Steinway factory in Astoria will tell you, are more like humans than you'd think. It takes nine months to build one. Its wood does not respond well to extreme cold or humidity. 
 "Left alone, memory takes effect and tears it open again," said Michael A. Anesta, personnel director and piano-making expert, as he stroked a newly bent piano rim: 18 gingersnap-thin layers of unfinished maple glued together in Steinway's giant grand piano shape. So it was off to the hot room for the newborn rim, where heat would take care of the water-soluble glue and the rest of the maple's damp memory. 
 Mr. Anesta strolled around the sprawling factory the other day and was surprisingly well received by workers, given that he had recently laid off 60 of their colleagues, bringing the staff to 540. Piano sales had slowed with the rest of the economy earlier this year; Sept. 11 was the final straw. Not long ago the company produced a dozen pianos a week; now it's 10.
"I gathered everyone together and said: 'Guys, it's not you, it's external forces. Go out and tell everyone you know to buy a piano,' " Mr. Anesta recalled. "Then I go home and throw up. It's a good night."
Since the Steinways began building pianos on the Queens side of the East River 120 years ago, the piano maker has cultivated a reputation as a family employer for generations of New Yorkers. Men (and a few women) bend and sand and stain the instruments that will take center stage at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center and the Kennedy Center. They vacation in Las Vegas and visit their pianos in the flashy hotel lobbies. Many of them play, but only when they think no one else is around. Steinway is an intimidating place to play, with celebrity pianists dropping by and giving impromptu concerts inside the plant.
Given the appeal of making a Steinway, an applicant might wait several years before a position opens. He might then spend his first year as a sweeper before becoming an apprentice to an expert craftsman who spots flaws in a wood's grain or eyes the curve of its belly.
"You're here for one or two years and its right for you, and the next thing you know you're looking at a gold watch," said Mr. Anesta, a 15-year veteran.
The 60 laid-off workers all had less than two years at the factory. Some were sweepers. Others, like Paul Muhabir, a former sugar cane factory worker from Guyana, were machinists. He had waited five years for a friend who worked at Steinway to tell him of an opening. Now another friend has told him of a construction job in Brooklyn, and Mr. Muhabir sighs at the thought. 
"Steinway was a very nice, different type of job," he said from his home in the Westchester section of the Bronx. "We were making things that were beautiful."
Steinway said it received an unusually large number of orders Thanksgiving weekend at a sales promotion in a Westchester County hotel.
"Everybody knows the piano business is the first to get hit and the last to come back when the economy slows," said Harry Boot, president of Local 102 and a 43-year veteran piano maker. "It's not like a department store where you pick up a shirt and ring it in the cash register."

HEADLINE: The Future of Up 

BYLINE:  By WITOLD RYBCZYNSKI; Witold Rybczynski's books include "A Clearing in the Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the 19th Century" and "The Look of Architecture."

 BODY:
I LOVE the skyscrapers of Manhattan. After all these years it's still a thrill to see them from far away, across the Hudson River, piled up like exclamation points at the center of the metropolis, or sticking out of the treetops, forming a great manmade escarpment at the edge of Central Park. They are both impressive and, for some reason, poignant. 
 I like the feeling of walking down the urban canyons created by rows of tall buildings. Their sheer variety is also a source of pleasure: the classical tempietto atop the Municipal Building, the sober Empire State, the jazzy jukebox of the Chrysler's pinnacle and the Seagram's dark intensity. More than most buildings, skyscrapers acquire distinct personalities, not only because they are landmarks but also because they resemble human figures, giant sentinels, overlooking the city below. 
 People have always been fascinated by tall structures. The history of architecture is a cavalcade of steeples, spires, bell towers, clock towers, keeps, minarets and pagodas. Whether it was the structural challenge or the symbolic effect of a building that could be seen from a distance, the attraction of towers was universal. They were places to drop unpleasant things on attackers from, to hang bells in, to call prayers from and to look out from. 
Whether it's the campanile in Venice's Piazza San Marco, the Eiffel Tower, or just a village church steeple, there is something endlessly absorbing about looking down from a high place. So what could be better than a city of towers, not just lookouts, but places of work and residence from which you could enjoy the view all the time? 
But the exhilaration inspired by raw height has been tempered since Sept. 11. While much has been written about skyscrapers recently, as the debate about how to rebuild Lower Manhattan intensifies, it is critical to step back and consider how skyscrapers contribute to a vital city.
It is true that since the terrorist attacks, the same exciting Manhattan skyline suddenly strikes many as a liability. Some are even nervous about living or working in tall buildings, although such reactions, similar to those that follow great earthquakes, will most likely be short-lived.
Yet there is little doubt that our self-confidence has been shaken. The proud towers of the city are now described as emblems not of technological prowess but merely of hubris. Reaching into the sky is rash, we are told, tempting fate or, at least, tempting malevolence. Better to hunker down, keep a low profile. But it would be a shame if, in the rush to glean some meaning from the awful events of Sept. 11, we were to give up on the skyscraper.
The skyscraper is a New York product. Chicago is often called the home of the skyscraper, but the first modern high-rise office building was built in Manhattan. The seven-story Equitable Building at Broadway and Cedar, completed in 1870, not only incorporated Elisha Otis's newfangled safety elevator, it also featured an iron-frame structure and an integrated heating and ventilation system.
It was followed by Richard Morris Hunt's Tribune Building, which rose an unprecedented nine floors across from City Hall, 260 feet to the top of its clock tower, and George B. Post's 10-story Western Union Building at Broadway and Dey Street, with a flamboyant Renaissance facade marked by alternating bands of granite and red brick. That was only the beginning. By the early 1900's, skyscrapers had soared past 50 floors.
The skyscraper began life as a businessman's brainchild, a way to squeeze greater profits from expensive downtown real estate. Yet the dramatic spires of Hunt and Post's skyscrapers (both sadly demolished) are a reminder that these commercial buildings were also secular symbols, totems of corporate and technological prowess.
But skyscrapers were not simply private icons. They came to stand for the country itself: its newness, its brash self-confidence, its unfettered freedom. Although tall buildings have sprung up around the world, the Manhattan skyline remains as unmistakably American as jazz, jeans and fast food. No wonder the twin towers were the target of terrorists.
But, terrorists or no, there are two compelling reasons to continue to build tall buildings. First, they are how we make cities. We did not have emperors and popes and kings to lay out public squares, grand boulevards and palaces. Our prosaic, practical cities achieve a distinctive monumentality in their skylines. What makes our cities unique is their upward thrust. Skyscrapers are an integral part of their character. An American city without skyscrapers would be like, well, Washington; beautiful, but oddly alien.
The second reason for building skyscrapers is that they make sense, economically and urbanistically. Tall buildings exist not because urban land is expensive, rather, urban land is expensive because many people want to work and live near one another, whether they are trading stocks or exchanging information. Tall buildings efficiently accommodate this demand. They also do something else: they allow cities to be highly concentrated and create the conditions for vibrant city life, which in turn attracts even more people. 
Skyscrapers are definitely more vulnerable to terrorism than low buildings. There was a dramatic difference in the number of casualties in the attacks on the 110-story World Trade Center towers and the 6-story Pentagon. The immediate damage caused by the impact of a Boeing 767 was probably comparable. But in one case the destruction remained local, while in the other entire buildings collapsed.
Can skyscrapers be made safer? Engineers and architects have learned to design tall buildings that resist earthquakes, and they should be able to better protect buildings and their inhabitants from the sort of intense fires that weakened the World Trade Center structures. The necessary safety measures will increase the cost of construction, but like air bags in cars they will be demanded -- and paid for -- by the users.
I remember when you could simply wander into an office building lobby and go straight to the elevators. Just as most office buildings today have security desks, in the future they will probably incorporate a range of antiterrorist devices currently found only in airports and embassies. None of this need produce ugly buildings, but there will always be a self-imposed limit to architectural hardening.
Cities thrive on openness and human interaction, and a city of bunkers would be a contradiction. Architects will have to learn how to make buildings safer and more secure unobtrusively, the way they have learned to deal with handicapped access and energy conservation.
The debate should not be about whether to build tall buildings, but how tall they should be. Most skyscrapers built today are in the 30-to-40-story range; buildings like the 110-story trade center towers, and the Sears Tower in Chicago, are in a far different category: superskyscrapers.
When they were built, the World Trade Center towers were the tallest buildings in the world. Today, constructing the world's tallest building is a dubious accomplishment, like making the world's longest salami. It's a challenge, but once you know it can be done, you ask yourself, "Why bother?" 
Some things get better as they get bigger. The dome of the cathedral of Florence is impressive precisely because it is so large; so is the nave of Westminster Abbey. But skyscrapers don't necessarily improve with height. I remember my visit to the Sears Tower, an uninspired design that only a steel prefabricator could love. After an interminable ride in a banal elevator car, we arrived at the 103rd-floor observation deck, which had all the romance of an unoccupied office floor. The view was obscured by low-lying clouds. 
One of the most evocative skyscrapers is Daniel Burnham's Flatiron Building, whose narrow shiplike prow fills a triangular sliver of ground where Broadway intersects Fifth Avenue. It is all of 22 stories high. The Flatiron is a reminder that the impact of a skyscraper is less a function of its actual height than of its soaring expression of verticality. It's not about how tall the building is, but about how tall it makes us feel. Whenever I look across the Rockefeller Center plaza at Raymond Hood's RCA Building, which shoots up like a craggy promontory, I feel exhilaration. The Sears Tower just makes me feel small.
Superskyscrapers were obsolete long before Sept. 11, as outmoded as tail fins on cars. That is why there have been none built in this country in the last 30 years. The reason has to do with economics. Wind pressure increases with height, and in a superskyscraper, extra structure is required to resist this force. More structure means more and larger columns, either on the outside where they block the windows, or on the inside where they eat up space and interfere with the offices.
But the real sticking point is the elevators. If there are not enough elevators, it takes too long to reach the upper floors, but additional elevators reduce the amount of rentable space.
The economically viable height of a commercial building is a complicated function of land value, construction costs and rents, but I suspect that it is nowhere close to 100 floors. In New York, the maximum economic height for office buildings is probably in the 50-story range. In other cities, with lower land values and rents, 30 stories is probably the limit. Apartment buildings require fewer elevators, hence they can be higher, as the 72-story Trump World Tower shows.
The dubious economic advantages of superskyscrapers have stymied recent attempts to build them. In 1989, the British architect Sir Norman Foster designed a 170-story conical tower to be built in Tokyo Bay. The collapse of the Japanese real estate market, followed by a weakening of the entire economy, has delayed this grandiose project indefinitely. 
In the early 1990's, a 125-story skyscraper was proposed for the Chicago Loop, but was abandoned when the real estate market turned soft. A few years later, the project was revived with a slightly lower 112-story design. That proposal, too, died because of financing problems.
The only place where superskyscrapers continue to be built is in Asia. Here the driving forces are booming urban growth and the desire for attention. The world's tallest skyscraper, built by Malaysia's national petroleum company, is currently in Kuala Lumpur, and even taller buildings are planned for Hong Kong and Shanghai. 
These skyscrapers, largely designed, engineered and built by foreigners, are hardly homegrown products, so it's unclear exactly what they prove. Perhaps only that records that can be bought are not worth breaking.
There have been significant innovations in the design of tall buildings in the last decade, but they are not about building higher. Many of the skyscrapers being built in Europe and Asia are what is called mixed-use buildings, with shops, restaurants and entertainment at sidewalk level, offices on the lower floors, and hotels or apartments above, to take advantage of the views. Such buildings, 24-hour buildings, hum with activity and are a sharp contrast to single-use office towers, which empty out at 5 o'clock on Friday and remain empty all weekend, sucking the vitality from their surroundings. 
During the 1970's and 1980's, while postmodern architects toyed with reflective glass, ornamental granite veneers and Chippendale tops, the interiors of skyscrapers remained largely unchanged: repetitive floors of mind-numbing uniformity, sealed spaces with flickering fluorescent lights, stale air, and acres of suspended ceilings and nylon carpeting. 
In the 1990's a new generation of office buildings appeared. Their architects were not just concerned with creating dramatic corporate symbols. Recognizing that workers in skyscrapers cannot easily step out of their offices for a stroll in the park, they brought green space into the buildings. Sir Norman's Commerzbank headquarters in Frankfurt, for example, includes internal garden terraces every eight floors, giving workers a sense of community.
It is paradoxical that the most innovative skyscrapers of recent years have been built outside the United States. But the challenge of rebuilding Lower Manhattan creates an opportunity to redress the situation.
It gives us the chance to rethink how we build tall buildings, making them functionally and environmentally superior, conserving energy, providing a humanized environment in which to live and work, and encompassing an assortment of uses as varied as the city itself. Not taller, better.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Vacancies, Yes, but Guarded Optimism

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
HOTEL, gambling and cruise-line companies have been hit hard as thousands of would-be vacationers decided to stay home after Sept. 11.
 As the leisure-time industry moves into what is traditionally one of its busiest periods, bookings are down and prices are being cut. 
 The stock market, however, is not emphasizing those numbers. Investors have bid up prices of these stocks in recent weeks, apparently assuming that the worst is already over. 
Jason Ader, a leisure-time analyst at Bear Stearns, took some time last week to talk about trends in the industry. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. What is the holiday outlook for hotel, gambling and cruise-line companies?

A. Things have stabilized, but bookings are still well below last year's levels. The leisure market has been price-driven. Individuals are worried about traveling and are actively seeking the best deals they can get. They are also waiting until the last minute, which is a real problem for these companies.
The good news is that a lot of people were nervous traveling last year as well, and as a result the performance in 2000 was lackluster. Also, since Thanksgiving, when there were no reports of terrorism and no major glitches in the system, travel agents have seen a surge in bookings for the post-Christmas period.

Q. You seem to be taking a cautious view about these companies, but their stock prices are solidly above their post-Sept. 11 lows. Has the market overreacted?

A. Business has not come back nearly as much as the stock prices have. The stocks are reflecting a very optimistic recovery and are saying that earnings estimates are too low. We are expecting a 2003 recovery, but the stocks are a bit more optimistic than that.

Q. P & O Princess combined with Royal Caribbean late last month. Is the business worth an investment?

A. Financially, it was a good deal for both sets of shareholders. It will create a much stronger company with a lower cost of debt.
With this merger, there are now going to be two major companies in the business. Carnival Cruise Lines is the other. 
But the business is fraught with oversupply. The fact the industry has had to discount prices to drive sales volume is evidence of that. From an investment perspective, the industry will be a lot more interesting in a couple of years, when the industry has absorbed these new ships. 

Q. Are there sections of the leisure business that you prefer at the moment?

A. The best area right now is riverboat gambling, which after defense and health care has probably been the third-best segment of the American economy in terms of consumption since Sept. 11.
The riverboat business is very resilient, and more states will legalize gambling over the next few years. In 2002, 31 states are facing budget deficits. We expect a number will legalize gambling to help address that problem.

Q. Which companies have significant riverboat operations?

A. Harrah's Entertainment, Argosy Gaming and Penn National are my favorite stocks in this area.

Q. Do you favor hotel stocks?

A. The only hotel stock we are recommending is Starwood, which is still cheap relative to what its assets are worth. They have an asset value of $37 to $40 a share, and the stock is currently trading in the high $20's.
We think Four Seasons is overpriced. The high end of the hotel market is the segment that is the slowest to recover. Most corporations are discouraging luxury business-related travel. Much of the company's growth prospects are in properties in the Middle East, which doesn't look like it is going to be a popular destination for some time. And it is trading at twice the valuation of Marriott, its closest peer. 
Marriott is a great company, but it is very fairly priced.

Q. Over the last few years there have been a number of mergers in your business, including the cruise deal announced last month. Is it reasonable to assume that the leisure-time industry will see further consolidation?

A. The gaming industry will continue to consolidate because there are a limited number of riverboat licenses out there, and Sept. 11 taught the Las Vegas companies that it may make sense to diversify into areas of gaming that are less dependent on air travel.
There will be more acquisitions in hotels. The U.S. industry will consolidate with the Europeans to create global lodging companies. The question is how they will pair up.

HEADLINE: After Sept. 11, A Rise in Gun Sales 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "As Shooting Spate Persists, 15 Police Leaders Face Transfers" (news article, Dec. 5):
 A major cause of the increase in shootings is the spike in gun sales after Sept. 11. 
Nationwide, sales increased by 21 percent, and reports indicate that the increase may have been greater in New York. 
 Under increasing economic and psychological pressure (prescriptions for antidepressants increased by 22 percent in New York at the end of September), arguments once defined by angry words can escalate when guns are available. Guns kept in the home for self-protection are used 22 times more often to kill somebody you know than to kill in self-defense.
Terrorism has already caused untold misery. We need not add more deaths to the toll. People need to think before buying a weapon. If they buy one, they need to store it properly: unloaded, locked, with the ammunition stored separately and securely.

Warming Up, aBit, to Stock Offerings

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

 BODY:
INVESTORS have resumed dipping their toes into the market for initial public offerings. But with little prospect of making a fortune overnight, the buyers are more likely to be long-term shareholders than short-term opportunists. 
 The situation contrasts with the frenzied atmosphere of the late 1990's and early 2000, when shares of initial offerings were known to multiply in price on their first trading day, and many investors cashed out with quick profits. In those years, many institutional investors, from mutual funds and pension plans to hedge funds and private equity pools, were eager to buy hot new offerings at any price, regardless of how well they knew the balance sheet of a company or whether it had any profits. 
 But this year, jitters about stocks and the economy have led 160 companies to cancel their initial offerings. By comparison, only 78 have gone public, according to ipo.com, a firm in New York that tracks the market for public offerings and venture capital.
Not only are investors wary of risky companies, but the issuers and underwriters of public offerings are taking a hard look at which investors might be coming aboard. 
As a result, said Mark R. Tercek, global co-head of equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs, bankers are being particularly careful as underwriters in assessing how well an investment firm's analysts and fund managers understand an issuing company's financial statements, industry and competitors before they allocate stock to potential buyers. "In this market, there is a greater effort to work with and attract well-informed investors," Mr. Tercek said.
HPL Technologies, a software firm based in San Jose, Calif., had its lead underwriter, UBS Warburg, peruse trading data and regulatory filings on investors' holdings to help select buyers in the weeks before its $66 million initial offering on July 30.
Potential investors were screened by how long they had held individual software stocks in the past and what market news had led them to sell. Those using a quantitative approach, focused on movement in stock price and trading volume, were deemed less desirable than those using fundamental analysis of company finances.
"You wouldn't have seen this process a year or two ago," said Y. David Lepejian, president and chief executive of HPL. Mr. Lepejian and UBS Warburg declined to name investors who received reduced allocations, or none at all, as a result of the vetting.
During the boom in initial offerings that symbolized the dot-com frenzy, investment bankers, eager to sell stocks in young companies, knocked on the door of just about every potential institutional investor. "You used to take a 'turn over every rock' approach," said Mark Connelly, head of United States equity capital markets at UBS Warburg. Now, he said, "the road shows are more targeted and more focused on fewer institutional buyers."
To be sure, some investors, burned by investments in dot-coms that later went bust, have been passing up the new offerings. "There are some institutional investors sitting on the sidelines," said Wade I. Massad, managing director for United States capital markets at RBC Capital Markets in Minneapolis. He said some investors were more interested in buying depressed shares in companies that were already public than stock in companies trying to enter an uncertain market. 
NO new companies went public from Aug. 14 to Oct. 2 -- the longest halt in the business since the recession of 1973-74, said Kyle Huske, a marketing analyst at ipo.com.
Still, the business of taking companies public is showing signs of life, despite an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into questionable practices by some investment banks. Regulators are investigating whether banks allocated shares to investors in exchange for stock trades by the investors through the banks' brokerage arms at high commissions.
The 78 companies that have gone public this year, raising $34.9 billion, is far below the numbers of the last two years, according to ipo.com. In 1999, 527 companies raised $69 billion, while in 2000, 415 companies raised $100 billion, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. In dollars, this year is more in line with 1998, when 357 companies raised $36 billion. 
And the returns are much tamer. This year, the average new company has posted a gain of 12.88 percent on its first day of trading, versus 53 percent last year and 68 percent in 1999, ipomonitor.com said.
There is another big difference. "We haven't seen investors willing to go up the risk curve and purchase a good story with no earnings," said Jay Chandler, managing director of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch. Since Sept. 11, the offerings have been mainly from established companies with solid earnings records. Examples are Weight Watchers International or the Principal Financial Group, the insurance company -- a contrast to the dot-coms of previous years. 
Valuations, or the prices at which the new shares are set, are considerably lower, and many stocks have held up well after their first day of trading, Mr. Chandler said.
This week is to be the busiest this year. Nine offerings are in the pipeline, including Prudential Financial, the insurer, which plans to raise $3 billion on Wednesday. On Monday, Aramark Worldwide, a food and uniform services company, is set to raise $645 million, and Converium Holding, the reinsurance arm of Zurich Financial Services, plans to sell $1.7 billion. 
But some bankers say the new-offerings market cannot regain solid footing until it broadens to include companies in other sectors. "Things are not yet back," Mr. Massad said. "That would be an overstatement."

Trucking Awaits the Next Boom

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
TRUCKING company profits have been weak for close to two years, but share prices have begun to rise, as investors anticipate a payoff from an eventual economic recovery.
 The trucking business is highly cyclical, and share prices reflect expectations for the economy six months from now, said Jason Seidl, an analyst at ABN Amro. 
 Generally, analysts say, companies that haul full loads for a single customer are more promising than those that fill trucks with partial loads for several customers. The full-load side of the industry has moved along on low profit margins, they say, and is therefore likely to benefit more when demand returns. Tonnage hauled has declined by nearly 8 percent since late 1999. 
The full-load trucking business is very fragmented, with the top 10 companies accounting for only 5 percent of the segment's $280 billion in annual revenue.
Bankruptcies across the industry in 2001 are estimated to be four times the 1999 level, according to research by A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. Analysts say more consolidation may be ahead, helping stronger companies build market share.
Donald Broughton, transportation equity analyst at A. G. Edwards, said solid investment choices included Swift Transportation in Phoenix, Werner Enterprises in Omaha and J. B. Hunt Transport Services in Lowell, Ark. Werner has zero debt, he said, and the others' balance sheets are in good shape as well. 
Thom Albrecht, senior vice president for transportation research at BB&T Capital Markets, said he favored Landstar System of Jacksonville, Fla. Its stock now trades at $72.27, below its high this year of $81.14. The company consistently generates much free cash flow, Mr. Albrecht said, and has used it for stock buybacks. 
Ed Wolfe, a logistics analyst at Bear Stearns, recommended Knight Transportation of Phoenix, Covenant Transport of Chattanooga, Tenn., and Heartland Express of Iowa City, Iowa. Both Knight and Heartland managed double-digit increases in earnings per share in the difficult third quarter, versus the quarter a year earlier. While Covenant's earnings are not performing as well, he said, he believes that the company is at a turning point. 
"Covenant has really focused on the cost side," he added. "Because it has suffered from weak demand, it reduced the fleet size" and improved the efficiency of its routes.
When demand picks up and shipping rates improve, he said, its earnings and share price should rise.
Mr. Broughton said he thought shares of Knight and Heartland were now expensive. Knight closed on Friday at $29.16, near its high for the year of $30.46. Heartland closed at $29, just under its high of $30.90. Knight trades at 37 times earnings for the previous 12 months, while Heartland's multiple is 25. "These are great companies," he said, "but they are trucking stocks, not microbiology." 
Kevin Knight, chief executive of Knight Transportation, said it is, in fact, a growth company. It has expanded from the West into the Midwest and the East. "We are anticipating more expansion depending on how the economy does," he said. 
Daniel Moore, an analyst at Stephens Inc., recommended P.A.M. Transportation Services of Tontitown, Ark. It is in line with Knight in size and revenue, he said, and its earnings are growing, but it is trading at just eight times earnings.
Mr. Albrecht is bullish on the entire group, including Knight and Heartland. "It is only going to get better," he said. Share prices of a representative group of eight full-load trucking companies have risen 41 percent this year.
Mr. Seidl advised investors to stay on the sidelines for now. A post-holiday lull in demand for haulers is likely, he said, and winter delays may lower stock prices during the first quarter. When prices dip, he would move in and buy.

Onthe Home Front, a Welcome Economic Kick

BYLINE:  By JANE TANNER

DATELINE: WADEVILLE, N.C. 

 BODY:
TO this rural town, population 400 and an hour east of Charlotte, Afghanistan may seem far away. But not the war effort.
 Two days after the terrorist attacks, as the United States prepared for military action against the Taliban, Victor A. Karam, president of McRae Footwear here, got a call from Theresa Scheetz, a federal government liaison for military suppliers. 
 Ms. Scheetz, in Philadelphia, told Mr. Karam that tens of thousands of military combat boots would be needed -- fast. Within a few weeks, the supply order came through: 100,000 pairs by February. 
Mr. Karam immediately began revving up McRae for night shifts -- the plant now makes about 1,200 pairs of boots a day, an increase of 60 percent from its normal workload -- and adding workers. 
And the company started buying more leather, rubber compounds and boot laces that go into the thick-sole boots.
McRae Footwear is one of four United States companies that assemble combat boots for the Army, Navy and Air Force. It has made them under government contracts since 1967 in an old converted elementary school here next to the volunteer fire department, the Wadeville Baptist Church and a cemetery. The company is one of the area's few large employers.
The surge in demand was welcome news to the town and surrounding Montgomery County, where the unemployment rate has risen to about 8 percent, compared with 5.7 percent nationally, partly because of layoffs at a pine tree mill and the shutdown of two hosiery mills. "If we had tried to hire additional people a year ago," Mr. Karam said, "it would have been impossible." 
Instead, about 350 people lined up to apply for jobs. So far, the company has added about 50 people to its regular payroll of 130.
Longtime workers are putting in long hours. Larry Baldwin, an employee for 26 years, said he was working 13-hour shifts but did not mind. "It helps me double up on my mortgage" payments, he said, placing a leather boot upside down onto a metal mold. He then slid it into a hot chamber where melted rubber was molded into a thick sole. 
The workers, who are paid by the piece and have no union, make about $7.50 to $8.50 an hour, although fast, skilled workers can make $11 an hour.
The combat boot order was welcome news for the footwear company's parent, McRae Industries, based in Mount Gilead, N.C., five miles south. It lost $697,000 in its 2001 fiscal year, compared with earnings of just under $1.4 million the previous period; revenue was $57.1 million each year. The company, which also makes cowboy boots, leases office equipment and supplies bar-code readers, needed more business. Its shares, now at $5.35, have risen 45 percent since Sept. 11.
The combat boot order should add $2 million to $4 million in revenue for fiscal 2002, said D. Gary McRae, 51, the chief executive.
This is not the first time that the deployment of American troops has given the company's business a lift. 
Mr. McRae was 17 and working part time at his father's shoe factory when it got its first military contract. His father, Branson McRae, started the company in 1959 by making sturdy play shoes for children. Seven years later, it had more than $1 million in debt. "We were on the ropes, looking for an answer," Mr. McRae said. "The Vietnam War brought the answer. It was a savior." 
The Army liked the technique McRae and a few others were using: molding rubber soles directly onto the leather of the boots, rather than the prevailing method of stitching. The molded soles lasted longer and did not separate from the shoes. That is just what soldiers needed when stomping around in Vietnam's rice paddies and jungle muck. Water had been rotting their boot stitching.
"We had the machinery and know-how to bid on those boots," said Mr. McRae, who took over as president in 1997, after his father died. In 1967, McRae Footwear and 13 other companies shared the boot contract, and McRae has made boots for soldiers almost continuously since.
The industry has consolidated considerably. Besides McRae, only Wellco Enterprises in Waynesville, N.C., Belleville Shoe Manufacturing in Illinois and the Altama Delta Corporation in Roswell, Ga., make combat boots for the government in this country. The armed forces must have domestic suppliers under federal law.
American combat boots have their own style history. The Corcoran Jump Boot, first made for the armed forces by the Joseph Corcoran Shoe Company in the 1940's, has long been favored by paratroopers. The Vietnam era brought the Vietnam jungle boot -- green leather and canvas uppers with thick green rubber soles. The Persian Gulf war brought a new design, the desert boot, made with tan suede leather. This winter, some soldiers in Afghanistan will wear a cold-weather boot.
McRae Footwear has adapted to changing styles, but other problems are harder to solve. In mid-1985, finding enough labor was so difficult that Mr. Karam recruited Laotian refugees. As an inducement, the company put 20 mobile homes on one- and two-acre lots on a hillside near the plant.
Today, a visitor might mistake part of Wadeville for a transplanted Laotian village. Laotian families toil in big vegetable gardens. Flocks of chickens and ducks run around in yards. About one-quarter of McRae Footwear's workers in Wadeville are Laotian. 
Vone Thpphalath, 20, who lived in a refugee camp in Laos for eight years before she came to the United States a decade ago, inspects leather cutout boot sections for defects. Before the order increase, she inspected about three cases of leather sections an hour. Now, she looks at five cases an hour. "It is tiring," she said. 
The added work has had ripple effects on McRae's suppliers. Boot-making begins with large sides of cowhide. Mr. Karam, 56, pressed for quick delivery of big loads of hides from the S. B. Foot Tanning Company, based in Red Wing, Minn., and a large supplier of leather for military combat boots. 
S. B. Foot, however, had laid off workers in May and June because business had slowed. But when its president, Silas Buck Foot, saw the World Trade Center collapse in September, he said, he sensed that a military conflict would follow. He called Pentagon procurement officers and asked about the possibility of large orders. 
"We started gearing up immediately without the actual order for the product," Mr. Foot said. He had no trouble getting his hands on additional cowhides, but his staff had to put in six- and seven-day workweeks to send enough raw material to North Carolina. "We had people putting in difficult hours," he said. But, he said, he was happy to have the business.

HEADLINE: A Brighter Holiday (If the Goods Hold Out) 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
IF you visit garnethill.com, the online arm of the catalog retailer Garnet Hill, don't expect to buy those cute suede slippers from Italy. Every size but 7 is sold out. The same goes for those handsome suede shirts, one of the company's recommended holiday gifts.
 Lands' End, that paragon of mail-order retailing, won't have any of its hot new all-weather moccasins until spring. Its reversible down jacket is on back order for most children's sizes, scheduled to ship by Dec. 18, almost the last day it can ensure delivery by Christmas. 
 Spin Masters, manufacturer of the popular retro toy Shrinky Dinks, expects all 400,000 it made this season to have sold out of stores by now, and Amazon.com is already sold out of Epson's popular Stylus Photo 870 printer. 
In short, this holiday just might not be the bust it was cracked up to be, and therein lies a different sort of problem. Only halfway through the holiday selling season, inventory -- whether stores have too many goods, too few or just enough -- has emerged as perhaps the defining issue for retailers and manufacturers. 
Long before the government made it official last month that the country was in a recession, retailers from Federated Department Stores to J. C. Penney to Gap Inc. sensed a sharp economic downturn coming. They scaled back their holiday orders last spring. The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 further discouraged merchants, causing many department stores and large specialty retailers to cancel or return orders and toss out plans for reorders.
Now, some hit products are selling out. Though the examples cited may be isolated ones, it is rare for merchandise other than toys and extremely high-end fashion goods to be unavailable at this point in the season, particularly from mail-order companies. It suggests more, and more widespread, shortages over the next two weeks, and it presents a new obstacle for retailers in a year in which shoppers are already finicky.
For a vast majority of retailers, the Grinch visited long before the season began, officially the day after Thanksgiving. Sales are weak, with consumer spending shifting away from flashy big-ticket merchandise like designer handbags and jewelry in favor of simpler, homier fare like Ping-Pong tables and fuzzy slippers. Still, with corporate America cinching its purse strings, even with extremely low interest rates, the consumer's role in getting the economy back on its feet is bigger than ever. 
A true merchant hates to lose a potential sale, which is what often happens when inventories are lean and most merchandise is ordered from factories in Asia and other far-flung points. The idea of losing a sale because of not having ordered enough, in a season when any sale is hard to come by, is almost unbearable.
"You are at the beginning of what will be a frantic season, for retailers and for consumers," said Walter F. Loeb, head of Loeb Associates, a retail consulting firm. "Retailers are just not prepared for any unusual spike in demand. They've cut back on merchandise, they've cut back on people, they've cut back even on light bulbs."
INVENTORIES, of course, are always a vital issue; every year, retailers must walk a fine line. Wall Street applauds the companies that keep inventory tight -- on the theory that markdowns, which eat away at profits, will not be necessary. 
But this year, many are cutting it close. Most retailers would rather err on the side of falling short of a few popular products than having piles and piles of unsold goods to mark down. "In my speech this year to the troops, I'm telling them that no one ever filed Chapter 11 because their inventory turned too fast," said Michael Gould, the longtime chief executive of Bloomingdale's.
He conceded that inventories were leaner in general but said that posed no problems. "You're always going to have an item here or there that you can't replenish," he said. "But we've all learned better merchandise planning and better replenishment."
Manufacturers, though, say they are also keeping inventories lean this year. "We asked them to call early if they needed to replenish stocks," said Jeff Cove, a vice president at Panasonic Consumer Electronics, the United States sales arm for Matsushita's televisions, video and DVD players and one of the biggest consumer electronics suppliers in the country.
Mr. Cove skirted the issue of whether products ordered today would be available for Christmas, although he did say that merchandise priced promotionally, like basic TV's and DVD players, might run short. "Things are going to be tight at Christmastime," he said. "There are going to be some spot shortages."
No one is expecting consumers to storm the malls. Retailers, especially the department and specialty stores that trade in more fashion-sensitive merchandise, may end up with too much of some products because business is so weak. But they may also run short of goods that customers crave, which could alienate shoppers and leave stores with little to sell later.
"If the fears about running short come true, they will really get killed in January, which has been a very big month in the last few years," said Walter K. Levy, managing director for retail trends and positioning at Kurt Salmon Associates.
LANDS' END is one retailer that increased inventories for the holidays, buying more of its classic turtlenecks, dress shirts, coats and other popular items than last year -- although apparently not enough of popular new ones like the moccasins and reversible jackets. "We've made a commitment to these items, and we're willing to take the risk that they don't sell in order to make sure we have what our customers are looking for," said Emily Leuthner, a Lands' End spokeswoman.
But Lands' End is in a small minority. Steve Blatt, owner of Searle Blatt, a fashion coat maker that operates five boutiques in Manhattan and sells to department stores nationwide, said retailers placed smaller orders this year and pared them even further as the year wore on. "I've increased my own inventories on the theory that other people are maintaining too little inventory and will disappoint their customers," he said. "The big stores have cut back on inventory drastically."
Depleted inventories not only reduce sales potential but also discourage traffic, which is one reason retailers are so reluctant to discuss the issue on the record. Garnet Hill refused to talk about inventory at all, and those retailers willing to discuss it usually spoke only in general terms and through spokesmen.
Peggy Palter, for example, a spokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck & Company, said, "We anticipated a slowdown in the economy in the second half of the year, and our inventories reflect that." 
Retailers, it seems, are damned if they do and damned if they don't. Too much inventory means big discounts and investor accusations that they are failing to protect profit margins; too little means potential sales lost.
Generally, Wall Street prefers inventories that tend toward the lean side. Richard N. Baum, senior retail analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, is actually pleased that retailers have ordered less this year. "I think inventory is less of an issue than last year," he said. "At least this year, they had some notice that the fourth quarter was going to be weak and could trim back orders."
Last year, retailers blinded by the fast-growth economy entered the holiday season with shelves and warehouses bursting at the seams, only to see sales evaporate after the first week. Excluding Gap Inc., which had such a disastrous Christmas in 2000 that it skews comparisons, the net income of some 20 specialty apparel and jewelry companies fell 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year from the previous year, after being higher in every other quarter, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. 
This year, Mr. Baum predicts that the same group's profits will decline by only 2 percent because most retailers, forewarned by economic stagnation in general and then by a sharp drop in sales after Sept. 11, kept their orders on the low side. "They've definitely averted disaster pretty much across the board," he said.
Discounters are more insulated than the rest of the retail industry because their merchandise is largely basic, so that the khakis and coats that do not sell before Christmas have a good chance of selling later. Sales at the three big discount chains, Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, were up 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and are expected to rise an additional 6.4 percent in the period this year, according to Credit Suisse First Boston.
Analysts predict that department stores, with their more seasonal, trend-sensitive merchandise, are most likely to be whipsawed this holiday season. Last year, sales at seven big department store companies, including Dillard, May and Federated, fell 14.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, but Credit Suisse estimates that sales for the group will be down only 5.1 percent this year.
In addition, even with inventories tight, markdowns appear plentiful already, although merchants and analysts say the discounts are largely the normal enticements that stores make at this time of year to move fall merchandise.
Some are skeptical about that. "Maybe retailers were planning these promotions all along, but they're extending the promotion period so things are on sale sooner and longer and the discounts are deeper," said Doug Bade, leader of the supply chain strategy and operations practice at Deloitte Consulting.
Even retailers that pared their orders this year may find that demand is even lower than they originally expected. Federated, which operates Macy's and Lazarus, among other chains, ordered 3 percent less merchandise for this holiday quarter than for the same period last year. But the company is expecting sales to fall even more sharply, by 7 to 10 percent. So, after Sept. 11, Federated cut the number of orders not yet in warehouses by 5 percent. Reorders of particularly strong merchandise are being considered case by case, said Carol Sanger, Federated's spokeswoman. "It's definitely leaner this year," she said. "The early bird will get the pick."
Gap, which has been struggling for the last year, was also cautious. In its third quarter, which ended Oct. 30, the value of inventory for sale in a square foot of floor space fell to $70 from $83 in the period a year earlier. For the current quarter, Gap expects that value to be down 10 to 12 percent from last year, when it was $59. 
Gap, which is both a manufacturer and a retailer, also set aside a $52 million reserve for orders it canceled to reflect its business conditions. Stacy MacLean, a Gap spokeswoman, said the cancellations were not related to Sept. 11.
But many retailers were wary after the attacks, and a flood of companies reportedly canceled or deferred orders and shipments.
Paul R. Charron, chairman and chief executive of Liz Claiborne Inc., an apparel maker that also has retail outlets, said diplomatically that although no orders were rescinded, "we understand that universally that may not be the case."
He said many merchants overreacted to Sept. 11, adding that in several important areas, business at Liz Claiborne had actually improved since the attacks.
"Where business has been more challenging, for example, on the West Coast, we have been working out inventory issues month by month on a case-by-case basis," he said in a written response to questions. "Other retail businesses have outperformed their original expectations, resulting in requests for more product, and we have successfully chased fill-in product in many instances."
But other manufacturers do not have the inventory to replenish retailers' stocks.
The toy industry is always the most extreme indicator of holiday sales patterns, and lean inventories are quite obvious there.
"When my mother asked me how Sept. 11 would affect business, I didn't think the impact would be that much," said Anton Rabie, president of Spin Masters, which makes Shrinky Dinks, a crafts toy brought back to life this year after having a good run in the 1970's. "But it has had a large impact, not because people aren't shopping but because retailers were so, so cautious."
SPIN MASTERS filled orders for 400,000 Shrinky Dinks kits but figures that it could have sold 200,000 more had retailers been more optimistic. Getting the toys from Asia now, even by air, is next to impossible. "I've had vice presidents at several retailers screaming at me on the phone for inventory," Mr. Rabie said, echoing the comments of other toy makers. "Any product I've got coming in at all is being used to fill in all the rain checks retailers issued before the season began, not going on to store shelves."
Spin Masters has cut back on its publicity efforts for the toy and is now talking up its radio-controlled airplane, the Intruder, which is also selling well.
"But let me tell you," said Harold Chizick, Spin Master's publicity chief, "we have three other items we could fill a landfill with."

When, Oh When, Will Rates Rise Again?

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
RIGHT now, the bond market is expecting the economy to rebound smartly next year and is forecasting that the Federal Reserve will raise its short-term interest rate benchmark by next spring.
 But it is more likely that the Fed will wait. 
 The Fed's interest rate benchmark, the federal funds rate, is at 2 percent and is expected to drop another quarter-point when policy makers meet on Tuesday. The yield on the Fed funds futures contract for January is 1.74 percent, reflecting the expected reduction. 
But the yield on the contract for July is 2.2 percent, signaling a rate increase no later than the end of June. Until Friday's report that the November unemployment rate rose to a six-year high of 5.7 percent, investors thought the Fed would act even sooner.
On Wednesday, the yield on the May Federal funds contract surged to 2.01 percent after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index for the service sector surged in November. That news came after some positive economic reports for October and November, involving car sales, retail sales and durable-goods orders. The reports appeared to confirm the belief among many investors that the economy might have hit bottom.
The jobs report dampened hopes for a quick rebound a bit. But July is still too early for a rate increase.
For four reasons, the Fed is likely to hold the line longer than the market expects. The first is history: after the last recession, in 1990-91, the Fed funds rate on overnight loans between banks stayed at its low, 3 percent, for 17 months. John Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, says that since the 1950's, the rate has not been raised until after the unemployment rate has peaked. The median lag time after such peaks is three and a half months. Mr. Youngdahl does not see an unemployment peak until the second half of next year; that would mean a rate increase might not come until 2003.
Second, inflation is low and expected to decline, even as the economy gets back on its feet. As measured by the Consumer Price Index, the inflation rate was 2.1 percent in October, down from May's 3.6 percent.
Much of that decline came from the fall in oil prices, so the core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, gives a better sense of current inflation. That measure rose at a pace of only 2.6 percent in the 12 months through October -- still below its 3 percent-plus rate in 15 of the 17 months from September 1992 to February 1994, when the Fed held its benchmark rate at 3 percent.
The Fed is likely to find it hard to move interest rates higher, even with the economy growing, if inflation is in check. That has always been a difficult move politically, and 2002 is a Congressional election year.
Housing offers the third reason. A healthy housing market is crucial for economic recovery because it spurs consumer spending as houses are bought, sold and renovated. At the same time, a vibrant housing market provides support for that spending, as homeowners refinance their mortgages to take out some of their gains in equity.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, recognizes that, as he made clear in testimony in July. "We're also beginning to find," he said, "that as home ownership rises and as the market value of homes continues to rise, even in a period when stock prices are falling, we're observing a rather remarkable employment of that so-called home equity wealth in all sorts of household decisions." To preserve that growth stimulus, the Fed will keep a cap on interest rates as long as possible.
Finally, central bank policy makers have said recently that they think recovery will be slow.
In this environment, Richard W. Waugh, executive director and chief economist at Principal Capital Income Investors, which manages about $40 billion in bonds, is cautious. Although he thinks that the economy has hit bottom, he said, he does not see a rapid recovery next year, and he expects economic data to be mixed, keeping the bond market and the Fed on edge. "The Fed is not going to be in a rush to start tightening interest rates again," he said. He does not expect a rate increase until late 2002 or early 2003.
Like most other fixed-income managers, Mr. Waugh is not making many bets in the Treasury market, preferring instead the higher yields offered in other sectors, including corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, agency bonds and, in some cases, junk bonds. He says he believes that Treasury yields will rise next year as the economy recovers but that rates will not move up as much in the other sectors of the fixed-income market.
IN long-term bonds, Mr. Waugh is snubbing Treasuries in favor of 30-year agency bonds, which offer three-quarters of a percentage point of additional yield. He prefers higher-rated investment-grade corporate bonds, like Cingular Wireless 10-year notes with a yield of 1.5 percentage points higher than Treasuries. Enron, the most recent corporate implosion, is a lesson he is not ignoring.
Mr. Waugh is not running after the big returns in junk bonds, where average yields, according to Merrill Lynch, are more than 12 percent. But he is using them to enhance his portfolios here and there. He will pick a junk bond, like IMC Global, a fertilizer company, yielding 9.40 percent, over a lower-rated investment-grade bond because he considers the junk bond's yield high enough to pay for the added risk. But aside from such exceptions, he said, "it is not a good time to buy below the top levels."

HEADLINE: Troops Need Boots, So Closed Mill Will Reopen 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: BERWICK, Me., Dec. 3 

 BODY:
In the blink-of-an-eye downtown that passes for the business district in this river town, the Prime Tanning leather factory is almost all there is. There is no doctor or supermarket to serve the 6,400 residents, and the town only just snared its first bank branch.
 "We're the mill in the mill town," said Kenneth R. Purdy, Prime Tanning's president and chief executive. "This is it, baby." 
 Prime Tanning's boxy white and green factory is so embedded in Berwick, in fact, that the company holds its quarterly meetings at the town hall. It was at one of these meetings in August that people here learned that after 68 years of making shoe leather in Berwick, Prime Tanning would be closing its doors, cutting loose 250 employees here and another 300 at a plant in nearby Rochester, N.H. 
Now, in an unusual side effect of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Prime Tanning has changed its mind. 
The war in Afghanistan means more American soldiers need combat boots, which are required by federal law to be made from American shoe leather, the kind that only Prime Tanning and a few other companies produce. 
Mr. Purdy is also gambling that shoemakers and retailers will be looking for more domestic suppliers, because security measures will generate delays and red tape for imported goods. And he is counting on consumers, too, saying the surge in patriotism will make people "want to buy American." 
So, on Jan. 2, just two months after it closed, the Berwick plant will reopen. It will be a scaled-down operation, making less leather and using just 150 workers to accomplish what used to be done by the Rochester and Berwick factories combined. Some returning workers will take pay cuts at the plant, which is not unionized. Even longtime veterans have to apply for their old jobs, and if they are hired, they will start with entry-level vacation and sick leave benefits. All workers will be expected to learn at least two other skills in addition to the job they already know how to do. 
But in a flagging economy that has seen the undoing of dozens of manufacturers, the return of even a featherweight version of Berwick's largest employer and by far its largest taxpayer is, for most people, welcome news.
"I'm thrilled," said James McMahon, Berwick's town manager. "This is just about the only major business in town."
Conrad Nadeau, the plant manager who will now have his old job back, grew emotional talking about the roller coaster of the last few months. 
"It's been a difficult period for all of us," said Mr. Nadeau, 41, who started on the factory floor in the 1970's and whose father and brother both worked at Prime, which over the years has employed generation after generation of families. "There's a passion to this business, something about getting your hands in the leather. And the chance to be able to help out the cause by making leather for the military, you feel a sense of pride."
No one expects Prime Tanning to lead a revival of New England manufacturing. "Prime Tanning is essentially capitalizing on the fact that military boots have to be made from American-made leather," said Charles Colgan, a professor of public policy at the Muskie School of Public Service at the University of Southern Maine. "But I don't see a large call-up of reserves, a large change in military posture, which will guarantee them success. I think they are taking something of a risk, and I think they know that."
Prime Tanning, which conditions and dyes leather and sells it to companies like Nike, Reebok, Timberland and Coach, is one of the last holdouts of an American shoe-leather industry that once had tanneries on virtually every New England river. About 97 percent of the industry's operations have moved to places like Taiwan, Mr. Purdy said. Prime, started 95 years ago by the Kaplan family of Woburn, Mass., which still owns it, now has plants in China, Taiwan and Mexico. 
But the robust 1990's New England economy allowed the company to make a go of it in Berwick. "This was an area with 2 percent unemployment," Mr. Purdy said. "If they were breathing, you'd hire them."
As a result, when the company decided to fold here, people were surprised. "We were stunned," said Dennis Dupuis, who owns a T-shirt monogramming shop and is on Berwick's economic development committee. "Here we are trying to keep jobs in town and bring people to Berwick, and you lose someone that big."
Bill Thurber, 60, a manager in the conditioning department, where machines that look like gigantic pancake presses stretch and dry cow hide, said he was "devastated," adding, "It's been like a home to me for 37 years."
Prime gave severance packages of one week's pay for every year worked. By November, when the factory closed, about half of the Berwick and Rochester employees had found jobs. 
Still, within three days after the announcement in late November that Prime was reopening, some 240 people had applied, the vast majority previous employees. Mr. Nadeau, who a few weeks ago was helping laid-off employees find work elsewhere, has found himself interviewing people whose reference letters he wrote.
Inside the cavernous factory this week, pallets of wet-blue leather hides, which become powder blue after being tanned with chromium salts, awaited the dyeing process. Two color wheels, the large drums where the leather is dyed, were running, and a skeleton crew was breaking down obsolete machines. The factory plans to produce about 10,000 "sides" (half a cow hide) of leather a week, down from about 35,000 before it closed. 
Many employees, like Stephen Young, 34, will have additional responsibilities. Mr. Young is rising from color house manager to manager of the entire "wet end," the dozen or so steps leather goes through before being dried and conditioned. He is not making any extra money, but seems happy to be back, toting his brown-bag lunch of peanut butter and marshmallow sandwiches every day. 
"We work hard, we get dirty," said Mr. Young, who could have had a job at the Portsmouth shipyard. "It grows on you."
Not everyone is sanguine about the reincarnated company. 
"The way they're doing it now is bad," said Virginia Ruland, 65, a waitress at Diane's Diner, which is across the Salmon Falls River in Somersworth, N.H. Ms. Ruland, whose great-grandfather, grandfather, father and uncles worked for Prime, bristled at the fact that longtime employees would start with no seniority and possible pay cuts. 
So did Francis Ames, 47, a color wheel operator for 23 years, who also questioned the company's long-term health.
"The way the leather industry is in this country, I've got to have some security," said Mr. Ames, who found a job at a distribution warehouse. "It's a part of my life that's over." 
Mr. Purdy acknowledges that pinning Prime's hope on patriotism is "not a slam-dunk." But he says he is hopeful. 
"I think you'll see a lot of footwear being made for specific needs -- police, fire, security -- as a result of this tragedy that you didn't need before," Mr. Purdy said. "And I believe you'll see the fire boot as a fashion statement."

HEADLINE: Cleaning the Hudson 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The decision by Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, to go ahead with dredging the Hudson for PCB-rich sediment (news article, Dec. 5) is great news for the Hudson River ecosystem and for citizens of New York State. The E.P.A. has already successfully dredged a major Superfund site on the Hudson near West Point with no apparent ill effects. 
There is no reason to believe that dredging for PCB's will have more than minor and ephemeral effects. 
 It is worth noting that, unlike President Bush's administration, Gov. George E. Pataki did not take advantage of recent events or the current recession as an excuse to backpedal on the protection of our environment. We will all benefit from his vigilance and the persistence of many citizen groups in New York State.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Through a Prism of a Latin Past

BYLINE:  By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
THE novelist Isabel Allende was recently asked what came to mind when she heard the date Sept. 11. Without hesitation, Ms. Allende said she thought of Chile, her native land, and what happened there on Sept. 11, 1973. That was the day the military toppled the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende, causing his death. Ms. Allende, a second cousin of Mr. Allende, fled soon after. 
 That two barbaric events in the Americas happened on the same date is an eerie coincidence that startles Ms. Allende and other Latinos now living in the United States. But what resonates with many is not so much that violence has chased them to a new, democratic country. Instead, they are dreading what could come after -- and in their homelands often did. 
 Latino immigrants -- Chileans, Peruvians, Argentines, Uruguayans, Bolivians, Panamanians, Cubans, Venezuelans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Dominicans and Nicaraguans -- fled countries where ardent nationalism was often one step toward an increasingly authoritarian government; and where the military, at one point or other, ruled at will. Ideologies of the right and left were able to trump democracy repeatedly in the 20th century.
Apart from economics, this is a crucial reason that many Latinos have emigrated to the United States, a country where, they know, an Army general would not attempt a coup d'etat, nor would citizens allow it. In fact, the fastest rate of growth among Latino immigrants in the last decade was not among Mexicans, as in the past, but among Central and South Americans, who suffered the brunt of the hemisphere's most repressive regimes and bloody civil wars in the last three decades. Their numbers nearly doubled to 10 million by the year 2000, the Census shows.
With a growing population of 35 million, Latinos will soon be the largest minority in America. Many of them are just now learning about their new home and its government, and view Washington's recent actions through the prism of their past. From the lands they fled, they know about men in uniforms detaining people for no apparent reason. They know about government officials secretly wiretapping conversations, interrogating "suspicious" college students and intimidating professors who question the system. They know about authorities instilling fear in a segment of the population for the good of the country.
Now, safe in cities in California, New Jersey and Florida, many Latinos are reading in the morning papers stories that resonate in uncomfortable ways. Their common and often recent experience of violence in their native lands allows them to view what has happened here since Sept. 11 in a harsher light than many other Americans do. 
They remain critical of any abuse of power or attempt at censorship from those who think a united, unquestioning country makes a nation stronger. They know, they say, because they have lived it. And though they are careful not to equate the brutality of Latin American dictatorships to the Bush administration's measures to restrict civil liberties, they remain vigilant to the warning signs.
In the last two months, the administration has sought increased power to wiretap, search and detain immigrants. President Bush issued an order approving the use of military tribunals to try suspected terrorists. More than 1,000 people have been detained. And it was revealed last week that the Immigration and Naturalization Service can now hold immigrants it deems dangerous, even after a judge orders their release.
"Violence engenders paranoia, and paranoia can change the culture of a country," said Tomas Eloy Martinez, a writer who fled his native Argentina in 1975 after a death threat, and did not return until 1984, shortly after democracy was reinstated.
In Argentina, like many countries in Latin America, dictatorial and democratic governments succeeded each other for much of the last century. The erosion of civil liberties reached a critical point in 1976, when a junta took over and initiated the "dirty war." By 1980, the Inter-American Human Rights Commission documented the abduction and disappearance of more than 6,000 people in Argentina.
"Censorship and erosion of liberties are a destructive spiral that can lead to a radical change in any country," said Mr. Martinez, who now directs the Latin American program at Rutgers University. "Few countries can recover from that."
Unlike most countries in the hemisphere, the United States has the means to guard against any threat to individual freedoms. Already, some members of Congress question the administration's actions, and hearings were held last week. Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the Justice Department, charging its detentions violated the Constitution and federal law; other groups have said they are prepared to challenge recent measures. The press is examining the government in ways not always possible -- or safe -- in Latin America.
Anthony D. Romero, the new executive director of the A.C.L.U., is focused on the impact new laws will have on immigrants. And no group, he said, with the exception of those from Arab countries, will suffer more than Latinos. This is true not just in terms of detentions but also in the increasing talk about placing restrictions on immigration. 
"Unfortunately, the war against terrorism is turning into the war against immigrants," he said. "The impact on the Latino community can be devastating. What we are doing is undercutting the basic system of checks and balances. We are putting aside the power of the judicial branch to oversee the powers of the executive branch. That's precisely what has happened in Latin America."
IN Cuba, for example, Fidel Castro chipped away at civil liberties in 1959, by claiming that threat of attack from the United States forced his government to take extreme measures. Eventually, in a speech, Mr. Castro delivered his coup de grace, "Elecciones, para que?" -- "Elections, what for?"
Mabel Morana, a Uruguayan professor who fled in 1975 and now teaches Hispanic languages and literatures at the University of Pittsburgh, experienced a similar pattern from the right. The military seized power in Uruguay in 1973 and held it for 12 years, allegedly protecting the country against leftist guerrillas.
Professor Morana said she worries that a strong nationalistic discourse -- the beginnings of which she says are evident in the constant display of American flags and patriotic slogans -- can help generate support for a government that will then feel empowered to curtail individual liberties. 
"Those of us who have lived through it understand that fear is often manipulated to get backing," she said. "An outsized sense of nationalism is not the answer to fear. The answer is to keep freedom alive, and a relentless, critical eye."

HEADLINE: Why Grade Inflation Is Serious 

 BODY:
Harvard, long a center of excellence in so many forms of study, is becoming known as a pioneer in grade inflation, too. A recent report by the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences revealed that half the grades awarded to undergraduates in recent years have been either A or A-. The school is hardly the only institution of higher learning that has been troubled by nagging doubts about whether the line between mediocrity and real achievement is being blurred. The grading systems at American universities deserve to be re-evaluated, but it is important that the work be done on the basis of real data rather than guesswork. 
 The distorting effects of grade inflation at Harvard were uncovered earlier this fall by a Boston Globe investigation, which disclosed that an astonishing 91 percent of Harvard graduates received honors last in June. The faculty has since begun a vigorous debate about what's going on. Some argue that the quality of students is simply better. At least one veteran professor suggests that white professors are reluctant to give bad grades to black students and go easy on everyone as a result. But evidence across the country indicates that the problem has occurred even at second- and third-tier schools and in places where the minority populations are infinitesimal. 
 Potential causes for grade inflation abound at the nation's colleges. More than half of all college courses are now taught by part-time teachers, and it would be interesting to see if those faculty members, who are underpaid and overworked, award more high grades to keep their jobs and keep their charges quiet and happy. While Harvard does not have to worry about attracting students, there are certainly some colleges that discourage teachers from giving low grades that might drive tuition-paying customers off campus.
Fifty years ago, students probably gnashed their teeth about C's but kept their mouths shut. Now, in addition to simply haranguing their teachers, students can exact revenge through student evaluations that play a role in whether junior faculty members are retained and given raises. The universities have encouraged students to gripe with consumer-driven appeals committees that allow them to seek changes in their transcripts.
A forthcoming book by Valen Johnson, a Duke University statistics professor, argues that lax grading is distorting the course selection process as well. Mr. Johnson contends that the expectation of high grades in humanities classes is swelling enrollment in those subjects and draining university resources from science departments. He has proposed restructuring the lopsided grading systems to remove the incentives that he says drive people out of sciences and into the soft areas. Those ideas have drawn catcalls from his colleagues. But the recent reports out of Harvard and elsewhere suggest that grade inflation is not necessarily a laughing matter.

Was That the Future We Just Passed By?

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND 

 BODY:
FOR those who can remember it, the future was a time of unrivaled wonder. Oh, you remember the future, don't you? Not the hokey old future of flying cars and teleportation, but the future of just a couple years ago -- before Sept. 11, before the crash of the Nasdaq. It was in all the papers. With the stock market following a 1999 best seller called "Dow 36,000" and an e-book in every lap -- there was never a future like it. 
 Magazines like Wired and The Industry Standard sprang up to describe it. A new class of consultants, speaking a strange lingo and calling themselves futurists, mapped its every contour, enlightening a populace that might otherwise be mired in the present. 
 And what a future it was. Electronic communication allowed workers of all stripes to telecommute from anywhere on the globe, eliminating the need for urban centers. Web retailers put "bricks and mortar" stores out of business, but there were plenty of jobs delivering all the groceries and pet food bought online. Television sets were interactive marvels, allowing users to alter plots and characters from their armchairs. The "knowledge capacity" of the Web, marshaled by education visionaries like Seymour Papert of the M.I.T. Media Lab, replaced classrooms and books with richer, more creative on-line learning. 
New paradigms glistened like money; old paradigms receded into musty obscurity. Best of all, unlike the old future, which was always decades away, the new future was no more than a few years off. 
That, at least, was the idea. But even before Sept. 11 that future was history. Not only is there no e-book revolution; there is no longer, as of last summer, an Industry Standard. Overnight, the future was kitsch. 
Leaving the question: amid all the other irrational exuberance, why the bull market in hype?
The errant projections were to be expected, said George Forrester Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research, one of many firms that blossomed during the Internet boom by offering luminous pictures of the future. "The technology industry is driven by thunderstorms," Mr. Colony said, working the argot. "We can't be sure where the next thunderstorm will hit, or what it will look like." At the same time, he said: "There's tremendous incentive to be the first person to take advantage of a thunderstorm. You see poor predictions magnified and enlarged. Asinine ideas like e-books -- so much air gets pumped into them."
Mr. Colony owned up to his own flawed visions. He predicted that the personal computer, and with it Intel and Microsoft, would be passe by 2000, and that the sprawl of the World Wide Web would overwhelm America Online. "I predicted that twice," he said. 
He defended his overall track record, while conceding the field's inherent kitsch quotient -- a risk for futurists in any era, but especially acute in the age of the Internet, which collapsed the time it took for a bold prediction to fail. The space travel of Arthur C. Clarke's "2001: A Space Odyssey," at least, had 33 years before its author was held accountable. The new book "Radical E: From G.E. to Enron, Lessons on How to Rule the Web," has a shorter grace period, at least among people holding Enron stock.
The nature of prognostication itself changed in the dot-com boom, said Clifford Nass, author of "The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television and New Media Like Real People and Places" and a professor of communication at Stanford University. For most of the last century, futurists looked at sweeping, slowly developing social change: how family structures might evolve, for example, or whether societies could push toward utopia. The credibility of their predictions rested on how persuasively they could account for the past. 
"You used to look for a trend, then extrapolate," Professor Nass said. "Now, because change is so fast, you don't have time to wait for trends. Now futurists are ahistorical. This allows you to get away with anything. And if you're wrong, who cares, because by then we'll already know what happened." 
The problem, he said, was that while technologies change very rapidly, the people who might use them adapt much more slowly. Many of the predictions failed not for technological reasons, but for social ones, said John Carey, a professor of new media at Columbia University who has studied the success rates of various types of prognostication.
Professor Carey cites telecommuting, or using computer modems to work from home or other remote sites. Though it is technologically feasible, recent surveys show that even as more workers get 
Internet connections at home fewer are telecommuting to a significant degree. The problem, Professor Carey said, was that people felt that if they didn't go to the office, they couldn't schmooze their way to a raise.
E-books arose to meet a consumer need that did not exist. Interactive television, on the other hand, has not panned out technologically, despite the efforts of Microsoft, which in the mid-1990's added a second campus just to work on it.
Some of these failed technologies may emerge again in a new form, just as a failed heart medication resurfaced as Viagra. The fax machine, as Professor Carey pointed out, was invented in the 19th century as an adjunct to the telegraph, and failed several times before finding its niche in the 1970's. 
Such is the unpredictable march of technology, said Tim Lenoir, who teaches the history of science at Stanford. He points to cryogenics, a field that has extended many science fiction fantasies, but no lives. Though cryogenics failed, he said, "It has been replaced by a new imagination based on stem-cell research."
Of course, even the old future had a dark side. Testifying before Congress in 1993, the science fiction writer Bruce Sterling described a near future in which "violent conflicts between virtual and actual communities have become a permanent feature of the cultural landscape." Yet this prediction now feels even more misguided than its shinier cousins, especially with the Dow creeping back over 10,000 last week. In hard times and soft, we like our lenses rosy.

HEADLINE: Radicalism: Is the Devil in the Demographics? 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FROM Casablanca to Kabul, the statistics are stunning.
 Well over half the populations of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq are under 25 years old, according to the International Programs Center at the Census Bureau. In Pakistan, the number is 61 percent; in Afghanistan, 62 percent. 
 The boom in young people coming of age in a broad swath of territory where terrorists recruit might seem to pose one of the United States' most daunting national security threats. But the picture is more complicated than that. 
People who study statistics say the danger posed by such bulges actually depends, sometimes in surprising ways, on how rigidly countries are governed. And the effect on feelings about America can be even more surprising.
For example, the threat of instability is greater in a partly free society like Egypt than in a rigid dictatorship like Iraq. And in Iran these days, the rise of young people actually plays to, not against, America's interest in seeing that country become more democratic.
Historically, there's reason for some concern on the part of those who hold power. France experienced a "youth bulge" in the 1780's, which increased demand for scarce food supplies; that, in turn, drove up prices, hurt the business classes and helped to create conditions for its revolution in 1789. Iran was in the midst of a youth bulge before its 1979 revolution, when young people took to the streets, helping to bring down the monarchy in favor of a virulently anti-American theocracy.
The political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argues that the large number of unemployed males between the ages of 15 and 30 is "a natural source of instability and violence" throughout the Muslim world. But the connection is not that direct. Demographers are fond of saying "demography is destiny," but in doing so they unsually mean the economic health and social needs of nations, not necessarily riot and rebellion.
"I would describe demography as a challenge that the state needs to meet, whether it's developing countries with a youth bulge or developed countries with a graying population," said Jennifer S. Holmes, a political scientist and author of "Terrorism and Democratic Stability" (Manchester University Press, 2001). "It is not going to predetermine the outcome. In general, governments have the upper hand. If they reach out and make a half-hearted effort at placating the masses with economic and social programs, they can usually do it."
And societies at the political spectrum's extremes -- either open or closed -- are less susceptible than those in between. "Youth cohorts are more likely to cause conflict in countries with intermediate regimes than in countries with fully autocratic or democratic regimes," wrote Henrik Urdal of Oslo's International Peace Research Institute in a recent study.
Among the "in-betweens" are Algeria, where high unemployment, inadequate education, over-dependence on the oil economy and authoritarian rule have produced an explosive environment in which armed Islamic groups maneuver.
EGYPT, with 69 million people, is the Arab world's most populous state. Unemployment, especially among college graduates, is rising, reform of the planned economy has failed and one-third of the work force earns $70 a month. Meanwhile, the military gets most of the $2 billion in annual American aid. 
The countries in the region most vulnerable to the wrath of their youth, according to American intelligence analysts, are Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan, whose population will probably swell from 140 million to about 195 million by 2015, "will not recover easily from decades of political and economic mismanagement, divisive politics, lawlessness, corruption and ethnic friction," a Central Intelligence Agency report concluded a year ago. And Afghanistan has known only occupation and war for two decades. The result is a lost generation, much of it indoctrinated in the Taliban's repressive version of Islam.
The classic profile of a suicide bomber has been an impoverished, uneducated, rootless young man with nothing to lose. But there are exceptions. Most of the Al Qaeda terrorists who struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11 were middle-class Saudis. The Palestinian who blew himself up in East Jerusalem on Wednesday was in his mid-40's and had eight children.
In some cases, politics affects demography as much as demography affects politics. In 2015, Israel's population is expected to increase by only 20 percent, compared to 56 percent in the West Bank and 72 percent in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian birth rate is so high that if it continues at current levels, in a decade Jews will be a minority in the combined population of Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.
Paradoxically, because of generous United Nations refugee programs, Palestinian children and adolescents have one of the highest levels of education in the Arab world; most Palestinians live in cities with good health care and have one of the lowest mortality levels in the Arab world. All these factors should contribute to a decline in fertility. But fertility is also a weapon in the Palestinians' national struggle, and it remains high.
AND then there is Iran. There, a generation of young people were indoctrinated following the 1979 Islamic revolution to become Islamic warriors for God. "My soldiers are still infants," Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said, as he encouraged mothers to breed. The official annual growth rate soared to 3.2 percent until the ruling clerics concluded the late 1980's that the population increase was disastrous for the economy and launched a massive family planning program. The birth rate plummeted.
Today, Khomeini's generation is not ready to die. In fact, many have rejected their fathers' revolutionary ideals and strict religious rules. They have been an important part of the reform movement personified by Iran's elected president, Mohammad Khatami, and his struggle to create a civil society based on the rule of law.
Even anti-American fervor has waned. While some Pakistani youths demonstrated in support of Osama bin Laden after Sept. 11, upper middle class Iranian youths held a candlelight vigil to condemn the attacks and mourn the dead.
In the end, it is not just the number of young people but the degree of their exclusion from economic and political participation that rouses them politically. "What makes the demographic explosion dangerous is the perception by young people that their elders have failed them, that authority has failed them in all aspects of their lives," said Farideh Farhi, an adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute. "We live in a world that celebrates self-expression and individuality, and when there's only political despair and humiliation, that's when the potential for explosion is created."

DowRises Above 10,000, and Stays There

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Investors cleared some important psychological hurdles this week, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000 and the Nasdaq above 2,000 for the first time in months.
 What is more, the indexes held those levels on Friday, despite some backtracking. 
 One impetus for the market's rise has been hope for a robust and imminent economic recovery. Big technology companies, including I.B.M., Microsoft and Intel, pulled the market higher, as did a report by the National Association of Purchasing Management that showed surprising growth in the services sector.
 Those gains dimmed on Friday, when the government reported that more than 300,000 jobs were lost last month. Stocks fell and bonds rose, but the indexes did not drop below their benchmark numbers.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 197.9 points, or 2 percent, to 10,049.46. The Nasdaq composite index rose 90.68 points, or 4.7 percent, to 2,021.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.86 points, or 1.63 percent, to 1,158.31. Bond prices fell, pushing up yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 5.16 percent from 4.76 percent. MICHAEL BRICK

HEADLINE: Labor Runs Into Hard Times As It Negotiates for Raises 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Detroit's mayor has scrapped his offer of a raise to 17,000 municipal workers, saying the city can no longer afford pay increases. 
 In Middletown, N.J., a judge jailed more than 200 teachers who went on strike after the school board insisted that they pay more for health insurance. And United Airlines has told 15,000 members of the machinists' union, who are angry about not receiving a raise since 1994, that the company might not be able to give them a raise this year either because it is losing so much money. 
 For the nation's labor leaders, gathered here for the A.F.L.-C.I.O convention, the climate for collective bargaining has turned far chillier in recent months because of a confluence of negative factors: the war against terrorism, the recession, rising unemployment, soaring health care costs and slumps in many industries, most notably airlines. 
Tens of thousands of union members who just a few months ago were expecting large raises find themselves fighting demands to accept pay freezes. A period of relative labor peace is giving way to tensions and strikes.
"The worsening economy has certainly created challenges for unions," said Richard Hurd, a labor relations professor at Cornell University. "It will be especially tough for public employees because government budgets face tightening revenues."
In Riverside, Calif., teachers are fuming because the city reduced its offer of a 4 percent pay increase that the city's 1,500 teachers had voted to approve. The city said it had to lower its offer to 3 percent because Gov. Gray Davis was cutting the state's education budget by $844 million, reducing aid for school districts. 
In New York, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani criticized the union representing the city's 80,000 public school teachers, accusing it of being selfish for continuing to ask for the same raise -- 23 percent -- that it had sought before Sept. 11. The damage from the terrorist attacks helped swell the city's budget deficit, which is expected to climb to $4 billion next year. The union argues that the city needs to give a 23 percent raise to attract enough certified teachers. 
At the convention, many labor leaders were reluctant to discuss the wintry negotiating climate, fearing that acknowledging it could give management an advantage in bargaining. Instead, they prefer to dwell on instances in which unions navigated around obstacles and emerged with impressive contracts. But those contracts usually resulted from unusual circumstances.
For example, nine major Boston hotels agreed last weekend to a five-year contract that gives 3,000 workers an increase of 5 percent a year in overall wages and benefits. Hurt by the drop in travel since Sept. 11, the hotels were in no mood for a strike. 
In New York, the real estate industry awarded a pay increase averaging 3.8 percent a year over three years, as well as improved health benefits, to 30,000 building service workers at 1,000 office towers. James F. Berg, the industry's chief negotiator, said that building operators were generous partly because they wanted to avoid a walkout, especially when many companies were thinking of leaving New York after Sept. 11.
Such generous contracts, union leaders acknowledge, are becoming increasingly rare. One factor sharpening tensions is the sense among union members who last negotiated a contract three or four years ago, when Wall Street and the economy were booming, that they missed out on the good times. These workers are looking to the current round of negotiations for a large contract to get their share of the boom, but now management is telling them it is time to bite the bullet.
"A lot of unions feel we've shared the pain without sharing in the gain," said Andrew Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union. 
The nation's airlines laid off nearly 100,000 workers after Sept. 11 and are now taking a tougher line in wage talks. Teachers' unions are seeing school boards driving harder bargains as some cities have started dismissing teachers. For instance, Buffalo plans to lay off 550 teachers this month. 
Fearing a wave of layoffs, some unions have dug in to protect job security. In Connecticut last week, 5,100 workers went on strike against Pratt & Whitney, the jet engine manufacturer, asserting that the company was trying to weaken the contract's job security language.
Skyrocketing health costs are often serving as tinder in today's bargaining. In the Middletown strike, the teachers are protesting because the school board wants them to contribute up to $860 each a year toward health insurance, up from the current $250. The strike ended on Saturday when the teachers agreed to honor a court back-to-work order and return to their classrooms without a new contract. 
The union representing 3,600 teachers at Roman Catholic elementary schools in New York is threatening to strike, complaining that the archdiocese wants to place teachers into a less expensive health plan.
Sarah Palmer Amos, executive vice president for collective bargaining at the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, said health costs were soaring by more than 12 percent a year after rising by less than 5 percent annually under President Bill Clinton, who pushed the industry to contain costs.
"Companies are saying you're going to have to choose between benefits or wage increases," Ms. Amos said. "That's a choice we shouldn't be forced to make."
Some labor leaders say that employers are taking advantage of the war and the recession to demand bigger concessions than are actually needed. And many of the leaders acknowledge that the war has made them more reluctant to strike for fear of being accused of undermining the fight against terrorism. 
But management says events demand tougher bargaining. "It's obvious than when times are tougher employers are going to be more careful about the levels of wages and benefits they offer along with every other cost," said Randy Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce.

HEADLINE: Aspen Journal; 
Snowy Playground for Rich Resists U.S. Woes

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: ASPEN, Colo., Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Terrorist attacks? Fears of flying? Bad economy?
 So what. This is Aspen, playground for the rich, richer and richest. 
 O.K., so the Prada store on Galena Street that opened last Sunday was under construction for almost a year. It still opened. The latest issue of Aspen magazine is a fat 280 pages, loaded with advertisements. And if the economy is so bad, why is Jonas Weil, an entrepreneur from St. Louis, starting Aspen Air this month, offering first-class round-trip service on private jets from Teterboro, N.J., near New York City; Chicago; Dallas; West Palm Beach, Fla.; and Burbank, Calif.? Prices start at $3,300, and Mr. Weil is confident seats will sell. 
"Absolutely," he said.
For all the nation's woes, Aspen seems pretty resistant to them. Hotel operators and condominium leasing companies are reporting near sellouts through the holidays, the unofficial opening of the ski and snowboard seasons. With some slopes open now, traffic is building. Just try finding a parking space downtown near Aspen Mountain.
Still, the approaching winter is filled with uncertainties that have little to do with snowfall. For the first time since the Persian Gulf war a decade ago, town leaders are wondering if Aspen's bubble might burst after the last glass of New Year's Champagne.
"We've taken our flu shots in a sense," said John Norton, chief operating officer of the Aspen Skiing Company, which manages Aspen's four major mountains. "The indications right now are that we're going to suffer the fallout of the economy and Sept. 11 but a lot less than other places. We're not totally immune."
Thanks to early snows and World Cup ski races held over the Thanksgiving weekend, optimism abounds here for a sustained high-occupancy winter. Tom Yoder, who sells cowboy boots and Stetson hats in a popular shop called Kemo Sabe, said: "I'm shocked that since Sept. 11 our business is actually up. Maybe it's people taking pride in America; in our country there's nothing more American than cowboy things that are not exorbitantly priced."
But exorbitantly priced goods are what Aspen is all about. That's why concerns lurk. The same hotels and condominium managers who boast of robust December sales also say reservations for January and beyond are off as much as 7 percent from last year. Local stores, which are usually begging for sales help this time of year, are not hiring. Real estate sales are sluggish, even for "modestly priced" houses in the $1 million to $5 million range.
Jere Rood, director of Lift Up, a local provider of emergency food, clothing and housing, said the response to the organization's annual fund-raising drive, which began last month, was slower than usual.
"It may be that people are giving to New York causes as their charities of choice this year," he said.
Town leaders, like Mr. Norton and Mayor Helen Klanderud, acknowledge the anomalies but frame them in the context of a renewed town spirit, a rah-rah-sis-boom-bah mentality that began around the time of the World Cup races.
Ms. Klanderud said: "We're optimistic but cautious. There's a lot of uncertainty out there."
To offset what they fear most -- events that would leave hotel rooms and ski-lift seats vacant after New Year's -- the local chamber of commerce has decided to focus its marketing efforts on two cities, Dallas and Los Angeles, each with many wealthy people. The idea, said Christine Nolen, president and chief executive of the chamber, is "to identify the kinds of customers who are not as susceptible to the tremors" that might turn others away from an expensive vacation.
The city is also ballyhooing the ski company's decision to open Aspen Mountain this winter for the first time to snowboarders, ending the last ban against snowboarders in Colorado.
But even those efforts have not dispelled the feeling around town that this winter could be different from those of recent years. 
Bill Tomcich, president of Stay Aspen Snowmass, a reservations service, said there has been "more uncertainty surrounding this winter than I've ever seen." But he was heartened, he said, by a recent surge in calls.
Mr. Norton explained the optimism this way, in a tip of the hat to the moneyed classes who have always kept Aspen buoyant: "We have a tremendous repeat and loyal clientele, people who come here to get away from it all. They know it's a special, spiritual place, not one of those crowded roadside highway resorts. That's a promise to them that we don't want to break."

HEADLINE: Group Plans Asian College For Women In Poverty 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
With the women of Afghanistan, Cambodia, Vietnam and other poor nations in mind, an international group of leaders in education and development have begun raising money to establish a new private university for women in Asia that would be accessible to the poor.
 The proposed university, initially with the size and curriculum of a small liberal arts college, would bring together students from all Asian cultures, many on scholarships, said Lone Dybkjaer, a member of the European Parliament and former Danish environment minister who is a co-chairwoman of a group that announced plans last week for the new institution. 
 Her co-chairwoman is Prime Minister Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh, who has offered to donate the land for the new university. Her government is also considering an act of Parliament to ensure the college's independence in a part of the world where private universities are rare and government-supported schools are subject to political pressures. 
"I see this as a sort of role model, to stress the importance of higher education for women," Ms. Dybkjaer said in an interview in New York last week, while meeting with American foundations being asked to contribute. She said that traditionally, what focus there has been on the education of girls has often stopped with primary and secondary schools.
Dr. M. Osman Farruk, a former World Bank economist who is now education minister of Bangladesh, was also in New York last week to meet with potential donors. The university needs to raise $100 million to cover start-up costs and the initial endowment, its organizers say.
Dr. Farruk and Kamal Ahmad, a corporate lawyer in London who is acting as a pro bono administrator of the university until a staff can begin to be selected next year, said that they hoped to have the school open by September 2005. Hiring an administrative staff and a faculty will begin by the middle of 2002, they said. They hope to attract Asian women for both academic and administrative jobs.
Ms. Dybkjaer said that Bangladesh would be a good site for the new school, to be called the Asian University for Women. Bangladesh, an Islamic country, "has a good attitude toward women," she said. "There is a strong civil society." English is the country's official second language, after Bangla, a combination of Bengali and Urdu. Until 1971, Bangladesh was part of Pakistan.
Bangladesh, though not without political violence, has been generally receptive to outside development organizations and has many strong private agencies of its own, working on environmental issues and women's health among other areas. Dhaka, the capital, has an international center for research on diarrheal diseases, and its generally good experience in dealing with successive governments provides an example for the new university, Dr. Farruk said.
He is hoping to send Bangladeshi women to the college. The country has a system of subsidies to keep girls in school by rewarding their families. It already has a private college for women, but it is devoted to home economics.
The founders of the new university have met some resistance in Europe, Ms. Dybkjaer said, because private universities and especially colleges solely for women are considered unacceptable by many educators. But she said that she had been told in Asia that many women need what they call an "unthreatening" environment for study, where a dominant male society cannot intrude.
Dr. Farruk said that the university should be focused on the rural poor, on women who would not otherwise have a chance at higher education and could form their own international networks like those shared by Asian elites. He would like to see 50 percent of the budget devoted to a scholarship fund. "Otherwise," he said, "you will be accused of having another rich women's club."
Other members of the support group for the Asian University for Women are Mark Malloch Brown, an administrator of the United Nations Development Program; Mamphela Ramphele, the managing director of human development at the World Bank and a former vice chancellor of the University of Cape Town; Mary Robinson, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights; Thoraya Obaid, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund; and Stephen J. Friedman of the New York law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, a former chairman of the board of the Overseas Development Council in Washington.

HEADLINE: Newark's Plan for an Arena May Rise Again 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
A deal that would allow the construction of an arena here for the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils has been considered dead since it failed twice in recent months to advance in a State Assembly committee. But some of its backers said Friday that it might yet emerge from a lame-duck legislative session.
 Those backers said that in an intense round of talks, aides to Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco; James E. McGreevey, the governor-elect; and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins are trying to draft a measure that is stripped of many of the other projects that were tacked on to previous bills to try to broaden support for the arena proposal among suburban and South Jersey lawmakers. 
 At one point the cost of those sweeteners approached $1 billion, drawing criticism from the two gubernatorial candidates and prompting scores of arena backers to withdraw their support.
The proposal for the $355 million arena would allow the creation of a sports and entertainment district in Newark in which a portion of the sales tax revenue would be pledged to repaying $190 million in bonds issued by the state to aid the construction. Some $115 million of the cost of the 18,000-seat arena would be contributed by the YankeeNets, owners of the Nets and the Devils, which now play at the Meadowlands and would operate the arena under a long-term lease. The remainder of the cost would be borne by the city and Essex County governments.
One of the leading optimists about a revival of the proposal is Newark's Democratic mayor, Sharpe James, who said that most of the costly amendments that had been added to the arena measure would be dropped within a few days if the current negotiations succeeded. This would clear the way, he said, for the Legislature to consider a bill "without the fat and pork" that had sunk previous measures -- although it was likely to contain some smaller amount of economic development for South Jersey.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee, Richard Bagger, a Republican, said negotiators were also considering an arena bill that would be stripped of all grants. That measure would serve as an incentive by instead authorizing three sports and entertainment districts in other communities to aid development there, with the same kind of financing mechanism envisioned for the Newark arena. Those districts could help finance a Nascar racetrack in the Millville-Vineland area, a soccer stadium in Harrison and a family entertainment complex at the Meadowlands.
But it was not immediately clear whether the pared-down plan described by Mayor James would meet Mr. McGreevey's demand that the Legislature halt any new spending in light of decreasing tax revenues and ballooning deficit estimates. Nor was it clear whether Speaker Collins would go along with the other proposal to trim all grants to South Jersey projects in favor of a mechanism to aid financing of future development. Mr. Collins did not return repeated calls for comment.
There are only two chances left for an arena proposal to get a hearing before the new governor and a new Legislature take office: Appropriations Committee hearings on Dec. 13 and 20. But by the end of Friday, the deadline for scheduling new business for the Dec. 13 meeting, the agenda had not been amended by Mr. Collins to include an arena measure.
Still, a Republican official close to the negotiations said that Mr. Collins was reassessing his earlier position. "There is some indication that he might be satisfied with less," the Republican official said.
Mayor James, who also represents Newark in the State Senate, said that Mr. Collins had appeared to be "a changed man" in his recent conversations on the proposal and seemed willing to pare down his list of South Jersey projects to a $20 million appropriation for an athletic building at Rowan University in Glassboro.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: RESETTLEMENT; 
U.N. Doubtful That Refugees Will Rush Back

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
About 10,000 Afghan refugees have trickled back to the capital of Kabul, but United Nations officials said today that they did not expect large numbers of people to return to Afghanistan until next spring.
 The coming winter weather, drastic food shortages and lingering security concerns will keep most Afghans in neighboring countries from venturing home, said Kamel Morjane, assistant commissioner of the United Nations refugee agency. 
 "Today we cannot say how many will go back and when," Mr. Morjane said, hours after arriving in Islamabad from Kabul.
An estimated four million Afghan refugees have fled to neighboring countries, primarily Pakistan and Iran, in two decades of fighting, and another one million are living outside the region. Refugee officials said a multiyear rehabilitation program would be required to accommodate any large number of returning people. In the initial stages, the United Nations can offer only meager supplies.
Mr. Morjane said increasing incentives for refugees to go home and laying the groundwork for an international rehabilitation program would be on the agenda next month when donor countries assemble in Tokyo to develop a strategy for restoring a semblance of normalcy to a country ravaged by 22 years of war.
Pakistan and Iran are expected to step up pressure on refugees to return now that major fighting appears to have ended, but the United Nations officials said they did not expect large numbers of Afghans to be forcibly returned.
Security problems have slowed efforts to ship food into Afghanistan and reopen aid offices. Mr. Morjane said the refugee agency office in Kabul was still working with a small staff and that many United Nations workers had been unable to go back to Afghanistan because of the continuing danger.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. May Have to Raise Fares 50 Cents in 2003, McCall Says 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority may be forced to increase subway and bus fares by 50 cents in 2003 to help close a steep budget gap, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said in a report released Friday.
 But Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the transit agency, said yesterday that while he could not rule out a fare increase in 2003, he called such speculation "premature." 
 "Obviously, because of the current economic climate, it is premature to discuss what will need to be done in 2003 and 2004." 
Mr. McCall, a Democrat who is running for governor, has predicted that the M.T.A. could face an operating budget gap of as much as $927 million in 2003, and as much as $1.2 billion in 2004, because of declining ridership and increased capital costs since the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. 
The M.T.A. has an annual operating budget of about $6 billion.
"A gap of this magnitude would require a 50-cent increase in subway and bus fares, and higher fares on the commuter railroads, unless the M.T.A. acts quickly to implement alternative actions," Mr. McCall wrote in the report.
Mr. Kelly said that Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican who is running for re-election, had asked the transportation agency more than a month ago not to raise fares next year. Mr. Kelly said the agency has already started taking such internal steps as trimming expenses and reducing overtime costs.
Subway and bus fares last increased in New York City in 1995, from $1.25 to the current $1.50.
Frank Sobrino, a spokesman for Mr. McCall, said yesterday that the M.T.A. report was released as part of Mr. McCall's regular oversight of city and state government agencies. 
"He's just doing his job as the chief financial officer of New York," Mr. Sobrino said. "The numbers speak for themselves. All Comptroller McCall is saying is the M.T.A. needs to do something about them as soon as possible."

HEADLINE: Recession Is Stretching the Limit on Welfare Benefits 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Although the 1996 welfare law set a five-year limit for benefits, the economy is in recession at the very time the benefits are set to end, and many states are setting the deadlines aside for more and more recipients.
 The law was intended to get people off welfare and into jobs. But for some people in communities with chronic unemployment, relaxed deadlines mean that welfare remains as they have always known it. And advocates for the poor say the safety net of welfare checks for families with children under 18, food stamps, disability insurance and Medicaid insurance looks stronger than they feared when Congress enacted the law. 
 "If we really adhered to the five-year limit, we'd be in worse shape," said Wendell E. Primus, income security director at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities here and formerly a welfare official in the Clinton administration. "But the safety net is not in as bad shape as I would have thought." 
In Washington State last month, Gov. Gary Locke ordered permanent exemptions for all but 120 of 3,200 families for whom welfare would have been stopped when the state's five-year limit first takes effect next August. Kansas exempted 270 of the first 300 families likely to hit the deadline in the next year.
With unemployment rising, some states have decided to exempt recipients in communities where the jobless rate exceeds a specified level. In Virginia, the level is 10 percent.
Illinois stops the clock for recipients who are working at least 30 hours a week and earning too little to get out of poverty, are in college and earning at least a 2.5 grade point average, or are caring for a sick child who is dependent on life-support equipment. 
In September the state expanded the provision to cover recipients providing full-time care for any sick child or spouse. Because of such measures, Illinois expects fewer than 100 recipients to reach its five-year deadline next July, when it first takes effect. 
States stretch deadlines in part to help new workers get along better in minimum wage jobs. And more and more, states grant them a full welfare check, typically $200 to $500 a month, for six months or a year while they work. 
Deadlines are still essential, many welfare officials say. In tours of state welfare offices, Wade F. Horn, an assistant secretary in the federal Department of Health and Human Services, said, "Almost no state agreed that we should do away with time limits." Mr. Horn said the threat of being cut motivated recipients and their caseworkers, whose performance is often measured by the people they help get jobs. 
Ohio's administrator for welfare policy, John Potts, said, "We haven't seen any indication that time limits are a mistake." The threat of the deadline "has meant more people working and fewer living in poverty," Mr. Potts said. 
The number of families receiving cash assistance nationwide fell to a low of 2.1 million by June this year from 4.4 million in August 1996, when the law was enacted. But welfare rolls have started to rise this year for the first time since the law took effect, according to state welfare officials. 
With the more relaxed deadlines and rising applications for welfare from people who have lost jobs, populous states like California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio have reported recent increases in the number of welfare cases.
Indiana has reported one of the sharpest increases, of 22 percent, to 47,073 families in September from July 2000. Through September, New York's and New Jersey's caseloads were still declining but leveling off. 
States can relax deadlines quite freely because the welfare law permits caseload exemptions of up to 20 percent due to various hardships. Because of the strong economy of the 1990's and the abundance of jobs then, far fewer than 20 percent of recipients have stayed on welfare for five years and therefore are not approaching a deadline. 
That means that unless unemployment rises sharply, states say they can grant exemptions at the current pace and not reach the 20 percent for two or three years. By then, proponents of the welfare law say, the economy should be generating jobs again and leaving few people exposed to deadlines. 
Sheila Zedlewski, a welfare analyst at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, is skeptical. "It's definitely true," Ms. Zedlewski said, "that time limits aren't going to be a big huge disaster at one point in time." But as more recipients are exempted and states approach the 20 percent, she said, deadlines will matter more in two or three years.
The states do not have uniform requirements and experiences. New York, for example, is a special case. Regardless of the federal law, New York's constitution requires that the poor be protected. More than 38,000 people who have been on welfare for five years will be dropped from the rolls in December. 
But Brian J. Wing, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, said all should be able to qualify for a state program that covers their needs by directly paying their landlords and the merchants they use. 
Other states set much earlier deadlines, of two or three years, but even in those situations there have been exceptions to the deadlines. Connecticut's, the shortest, is only 21 months, but the state routinely exempts families. A few states, like Vermont and Michigan, do not use deadlines.
But deadlines and the welfare law face their toughest tests in the poorest communities with the highest unemployment, like those of the Mississippi Delta. 
In Greenwood, Miss., Dynetha Thornton, director of the Leflore County office of the state's Department of Human Services, said the county unemployment rate is 10 percent. Some clients go to heroic lengths to work, Ms. Thornton said. 
Six Leflore County mothers are picked up in vans at 3 a.m. for a ride to jobs in faraway chicken processing plants where they earn about $6 an hour, or $12,000 a year. With stops to deliver children to sitters, the trip takes three or four hours.
The women still collect a welfare check because the pay does not lift them above the poverty line, and the state pays for their child care and the van, and gives them $5 a day for lunch and a $3,000 bonus for working for two years. 
But not many of the Greenwood office's clients will go to the poultry workers' lengths to work. Of 438 welfare recipients, Ms. Thornton said only 151 are fulfilling the law's required participation in a work program -- working, or training and looking for a job. The others, still collecting welfare checks, can have their benefits extended for 12 months because of scarce jobs, and they can be extended again. 
"This is telling me that we still have individuals who believe it's not true that we have ended welfare as we knew it," Ms. Thornton said. "They think, 'I've been allowed to sit down and not do anything, so I'm going to test them.' They've already been granted a 12-month extension, so you tell me who's winning."

 The Tasks Ahead

EVOLVING STRATEGY -- When Afghanistan's transitional government takes power in two weeks, it will inherit a capital full of blaring horns, busy markets and a nearly universal desire for peace. But real peace will have to wait, for the unusual war that has wrested every last Afghan city from the Taliban is not over. The most complex and potentially perilous tasks the United States has assigned itself lie ahead -- including imposing enough law and order to allow medicine and food to reach an ill and starving population, and to prevent a resurgence of violence. A1

The Relief Effort

FRIENDSHIP BRIDGE -- After weeks of diplomatic pressure from the United States, the President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, agreed to open a crucial bridge that could help speed urgently needed food and medical supplies from this Central Asian country to war-ravaged Afghanistan. The decision to open the Friendship Bridge should free international relief organizations to move millions of tons of humanitarian aid into Northern Afghanistan and could enable United States forces based in Uzbekistan to resupply units in Northern Afghanistan. A1

UNICEF -- The executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund, Carol Bellamy, said the organization is striving to provide the basics of food and water to ensure the survival of an estimated 1.5 million Afghan children under 5 years old at the greatest risk. Of those, 150,000 are considered seriously malnourished, Ms. Bellamy said, adding that they need food, water, winter clothes, blankets and heated tents. A22

After the Taliban

THE DEVASTATION WITHIN -- As the Taliban retreat, the full weight of the devastation they wrought is becoming apparent, especially in places like Bamian, in remote central Afghanistan, the scene of some of the most devastating fighting between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance. The region was also home to the two giant 1,500-year-old statues of Buddha that the Taliban destroyed last spring. Tribal natives of the region, the Hazaras, are slowly returning to mountainside homes, but as the first snow fell last week, some wondered whether hunger or cold would be first to claim their children. A1

A FAMILY'S DESTINY -- In 1761, King Ahmad Shah Durrani, the founder of Afghanistan, received some free land from a powerful local clan where he built the city of Kandahar. Last week, the clan's latest leader, Hamid Karzai, said he had secured an agreement to reclaim Kandahar from the Taliban, and he is expected to lead Afghanistan's interim government starting on Dec. 22. The Taliban's surrender ended two decades of exile for the Karzais, whose fate, perhaps more than any other Afghan family's, has been intimately tied to the ups and downs of Afghanistan's tumultuous history. B1

A TRAIL OF DEATH -- With the Taliban gone, Mazar-i-Sharif hums with the joy of a city set free. But human rights groups say thousands of people died in the bloodletting, and mass graves wreathe this ancient city bearing the grim evidence of its central role in Afghanistan's civil war. As Afghanistan seems set to embark on a new Western-backed political experiment, the town stands as a somber warning. B1

ROUGH JUSTICE -- The Northern Alliance, demonstrating a willingness to impose harsh order over the largely lawless territory it captured from the Taliban in northern Afghanistan, attacked a band of highway robbers last week and hung the bullet-riddled body of a man it had killed from the barrel of a tank for two days to deter bandits. The interim government that starts in Kabul on Dec. 22 should eventually wield enough influence to impose law and order, but the Northern Alliance has shown that until then it is willing to resort to ancient elements of civic rule. B4

THE REFUGEES -- About 10,000 Afghan refugees have trickled back to the capital of Kabul, but United Nations officials said they did not expect large numbers of people to return to Afghanistan until next spring. B5

The View in Washington

THE PRESIDENT -- Dozens of friends and advisers of President Bush said in interviews that while he still could not resist a joke or two, he had conducted himself far more seriously since Sept. 11. While events have left Mr. Bush little choice but to rise to the challenge, many loyalists say they are nevertheless struck by how much more comfortable and engaged he seems now. B7

THE INVESTIGATION -- The United States is investigating intelligence reports of contacts between Pakistani nuclear weapons scientists and the Taliban or Al Qaeda and asked that two nuclear engineers, Suleiman Asad and Muhammed Ali Mukhtar, be questioned. Pakistani officials said their government is resisting American efforts to question their scientists for fear this may be a ploy to learn details of its nuclear program. While much about this dispute is unclear, it shows that the two countries remain at odds over vital issues despite recent cooperation. A1

DEMOCRATS' STRATEGY -- With President Bush's popularity rating in the stratosphere and the country solidly behind the war on terror, Democrats have adopted a delicate strategy for winning control of Congress next year and positioning themselves for challenging the president in 2004. While they express support for the war effort and refrain from the slightest personal criticisms of Mr. Bush, they are increasing their attacks on the president's economic and social policies -- on taxes and spending, on health care, on education and, especially, on the administration's response to the recession. B7

SECRET EVIDENCE -- In the 1990's, immigrants' groups, several federal courts and some politicians criticized immigration officials for using secret evidence against those they wanted to detain or deport. The practice had nearly ceased in recent years, but legal experts say that since Sept. 11, the government has shown a desire to resume it. The Bush administration, however, denies it intends to break the president's campaign pledges not to use secret evidence against immigrants. B1

Aftermath of the Attacks

ISLAM IN AMERICA -- After unusually high bail of $500,000 was set for a Yemeni man held on an immigration violation, Muslims in San Diego promised to provide it. But that sign of unity has become a symbol of division, as many Muslims have backed off after realizing their names would be publicized. B6

THE PENTAGON -- For the families who lost loved ones in the attack on the Pentagon, Cmdr. Yvette C. BrownWahler of the Navy has offered a tonic mix of maternal compassion and executive resolve as the head the Pentagon's Family Service Center. Now Commander BrownWahler is preparing to become a rarity in the Navy -- a woman in command of a warship, the guided missile destroyer Chafee, which is being built in Maine. B6

THE HOME FRONT -- While the Army investigates, the family of Pvt. Giovanny Maria, who was one of the first United States military deaths in the war on terror, is wondering if his death was accidental, or if he took his own life. B6

GROUND ZERO -- The Giuliani administration has abandoned plans to replace a city agency with a private construction company to run operations at the World Trade Center disaster site. B6 --

NEW LIFE -- In an unusual side effect of the attacks, a leather factory in Maine that closed last month will reopen on Jan. 2 and 150 workers will regain their jobs, because more American soldiers need combat boots, which must be made with American shoe leather. A49

COLLEGE ADMISSIONS -- Contrary to predictions that high school seniors would choose colleges closer to home and avoid cities after Sept. 11, college admissions officials say early applications are up and reflect the same geographic patterns as in past years. A50

Re "A New Health Plan May Raise Expenses for Sickest Workers" (front page, Dec. 5):
 You report that the big insurers' "new kind of health plan" will be less costly for employers, but workers who have the bad luck to get seriously ill or injured will have to pay substantially more. 
 You quote one corporate health plan director as saying the higher costs will make patients avoid unnecessary treatments. Other experts note that most people don't know what is and what isn't necessary and predict that lower income participants will simply avoid treatment. 
It will surely worsen the health care gap between the haves and have-nots. The Princeton economist Uwe E. Reinhardt is right to call it "a very dubious social policy."
Most other advanced countries have universal health systems financed by more equitable taxation. We need the same here, to end the worsening health care apartheid that belies our American traditions of freedom and equality.

To the Editor:
 The "cost-saving" measure for health insurance (front page, Dec. 5) will drive the horrific 70 percent unemployment rate for people with disabilities even higher. As an employed person with a disability, I and my family would be punished for my extra medical expenses. 
Most of these are for preventive care that enables me to keep healthy and working. 
 Under the new scheme, those who have a family member with a disability would forgo needed medical treatment if their salaries were not high enough to pay up to $5,000 out of pocket once their "annual allowance" was exhausted. What a concept -- medical insurance that only covers the needs of healthy people and discourages people with disabilities and their family members from pursuing healthy and independent lives (and jobs)!

Riverhead Stops Residential Subdivisions

BYLINE:  By John Rather 

 BODY:
Deluged by development, the Town of Riverhead has approved a six-month moratorium on residential subdivisions.
 The 3-to-2 town board vote last week will delay about 18 building projects involving more than 1,000 new housing units. 
 A one-year moratorium had been under discussion but was put aside before the vote.
The moratorium will give the town additional time to complete and enact a master plan that is expected to include zoning and planning measures to limit future growth.
A majority of the agricultural land and a large part of the remaining open space on the East End are in Riverhead.
The town supervisor, Robert Kozakiewicz, a Republican accused by environmental groups of being a supporter of development, voted for the moratorium. Mr. Kozakiewicz narrowly won election to a second term in November against a Democratic opponent supported by the New York League of Conservation Voters.
Eve Kaplan, the Riverhead coordinator for the North Fork Environmental Council in Mattituck, said the moratorium was an important step for the town.
"It remains to be seen whether this will really curb growth in Riverhead," she said. "But symbolically it's very important and it raises expectations about what the current administration will do."
Richard Amper, the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, said he supported the building pause. "Anything that allows anyone time to plan Riverhead's future is welcomed," he said. 
Farms, farm stands and wineries are drawing increasingly large numbers of visitors and are recognized by town officials as vital to the town's economy.
In Southold, Supervisor Jean Cochran, a Republican, proposed zoning that would allow no more than one house on every five acres of farmland. Mrs. Cochran was defeated in the November election by Joshua Horton, a Democrat who opposed the plan. John Rather

CORRECTION-DATE: December 23, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A brief article on Dec. 9 about a six-month moratorium on new residential subdivisions in the Town of Riverhead misstated the vote of the town supervisor, Robert Kozakiewicz. He voted against the measure, not for it. It was approved 3 to 2.

BYLINE:  By Merri Rosenberg 

 BODY:
With the recent opening of a HomeGoods store in Somers, the off-price home department store chain becomes the second one in the county, joining its Yonkers branch in offering trendy merchandise for the home to those in the northern reaches of the county. The store's opening adds 60 full- and part-time jobs to the local economy there. 
 "HomeGoods has identified Somers as a strong area for growth," said Jerry Rossi, president of HomeGoods. "We are confident that Somers-area shoppers will find HomeGoods to be an excellent resource for saving both time and money when shopping for today's most exciting home fashions." 
 As a division of the off-price retailer TJX, the Framingham, Mass.-based parent company of apparel discounters like T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, among others, HomeGoods features items in areas like dinnerware and glassware, bath and bedding, lamps, rugs, housewares and seasonal merchandise. Merri Rosenberg

In Search of Forever, Shoppers Return to 47th St.

BYLINE:  By LAUREN WEBER 

 BODY:
DENNIS MARLOW leaned across his jewelry counter on 47th Street in Midtown Manhattan and told what is becoming a familiar story. Last month, he said, "a guy just walked in and bought an engagement ring he's been promising his wife for 10 years." When they were planning their wedding, the customer explained, he didn't have enough money.
 "He just said, 'It's time,' " Mr. Marlow said. And so the customer, a china and crystal salesman from New York City, plunked down $8,000 for a 1.5-carat diamond ring. 
 Mr. Marlow, the owner of Solitaire Creations, surmised that his client had been motivated on some level by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "A lot of people are being spurred by the feeling that you never know when something's going to happen," he said. 
Many merchants along 47th Street, the heart of New York's diamond district, as well as others around the country, are reporting a surge in sales of diamond jewelry this holiday season, whether to people seeking long-overdue engagement rings or those merely splurging on themselves. The gain follows a slump immediately after Sept. 11.
But buyers should not let emotion alone drive their shopping. Diamonds are a complicated product, with many gradations of quality and price. And buying one in or near 47th Street, the source for many people around the world, can be daunting, to say the least.
The district -- the largest diamond market in the United States -- fills the entire block of West 47th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and encompasses parts of West 46th and 48th Streets. About 400 retailers are there, all vying for a piece of the nation's nearly $30 billion diamond jewelry market.
Many people strolling through the neighborhood, especially those from outside New York, see only the street-level retail shops. But above them, often in cramped, dingy offices, are more than 2,000 other small businesses -- wholesalers, diamond polishers, jewelry manufacturers -- that serve the global jewelry markets.
Many of the diamonds sold by jewelers on 47th Street are of comparable quality to those at Fifth Avenue salons like Tiffany & Company or Cartier. But diamond experts say shoppers can sometimes find better deals with diamond district merchants -- by some accounts as much as 50 percent savings -- because of the intense competition and their close proximity to jewelry manufacturers and diamond dealers.
"The people on 47th Street try to make as much as they can, but everything they do is negotiable," one veteran diamond importer said. "There are bargains you can create yourself." 
But creating them can be a challenge. "There is no consistency" with prices, the importer said. Markups vary widely -- the average at many established jewelers is 100 percent, but it can be higher for lower-end diamonds and lower for more expensive ones. 
These days, many diamond district merchants have been cutting prices further -- by an estimated 5 to 10 percent, according to dealers there -- to help prop up sales, which had been hurt by the weak economy as well as the terrorist attacks. For some merchants, sales dropped as much as 70 percent in the first few weeks after Sept. 11, and even now are down 15 percent, said Howard Herman, a fourth-generation diamond merchant and chairman of the 47th Street Business Improvement District.
"It's a very good buyer's market," Mr. Herman said.
Low prices are not always a guarantee of a good deal. Among the so-called bargains may be many overpriced and misrepresented gems, experts say. The best way to ensure a good deal is to go comparison-shopping. That, of course, is easy to do in the diamond district, where shops are bunched together. After speaking to a few merchants, shoppers will have a sense of a reasonable and realistic price for what they want. For higher-priced stones, though, experts advise buyers to get at least one independent opinion from a certified appraiser.
Amid the competition, some jewelers are more aggressive than others. The 47th Street Business Improvement District says consumers should avoid merchants who try to pressure them into making fast decisions. 
Although a good jeweler will explain the basics of diamond shopping, buyers should do some research on their own, at least to become familiar with the four C's -- carat, color, clarity and cut. (A flawless, colorless stone is considered the most valuable, and is, therefore, the most expensive.)
Many district merchants sell diamond jewelry with certificates that give the stone a grade for color and clarity and list the carat weight. The certificates come from independent laboratories like the Gemological Institute of America or the American Gem Society.
Consumers are entitled to a detailed receipt that includes the price and a description, as well as an accurate diamond grade and the carat weight information. It should also disclose any treatments or enhancements to the stone. And money-back guarantees are important; the improvement district says buyers are entitled to at least 20 days to make returns.
Web sites of trade groups and companies can provide useful primers for consumers, as well as tips on finding a reputable jeweler. Among the sites, Mondera.com, based in the diamond district, has a learning center with information about diamonds, colored gemstones, pearls and precious metals. Another, Buyarock.com, is designed with male buyers in mind. The Diamond Registry (www.diamondregistry.com), also in the district, has articles about buying diamonds. Visitors to the site can list the specifications of the diamond they want and then get prices.
PERHAPS another "C" should be added to the diamond-buying process -- conflict. The diamond industry has come under scrutiny during the last few years for its connection to "conflict diamonds," stones that are mined in rebel-held areas in Africa and sold to finance civil wars. Some dealers, like the Diamond Registry, say they have asked their suppliers to verify that all the diamonds they buy are "conflict free."
Late last month in Gabarone, Botswana, representatives of the industry, human rights groups and more than 30 governments agreed that all shipments of rough stones must contain certificates of origin. And the House of Representatives has passed a bill that gives the president authority to bring sanctions against countries that refuse to adopt a tracking system for diamonds. The issue gained momentum after reports that Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda, had bought diamonds from African rebels and sold them in Europe at a profit.
Consumers who are concerned about the issue should talk to their jewelers "and use the opportunity to say, 'I want to know that the jewelry industry is doing everything it can to end this trade,' " said Deborah DeYoung, an aide to Representative Tony P. Hall, an Ohio Democrat who was a sponsor of the measure.
Richard Winick, owner of Manny Winick & Son on 47th Street, said consumers were choosing "classic" products -- diamond stud earrings, anniversary bands, and engagement rings in a traditional four-prong setting. "Anything that was classic in the 50's and 60's" is selling well, he said.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Winick showed Dale Cahner, 43, some three-stone engagement rings. Never mind that Mrs. Cahner has been married for nearly 13 years. Every five years, she and her husband, David, 42, renew their wedding vows, and in 2003, they will go to Venice to be "married" for a fourth time.
"We were talking about the trip and planning the trip," she said, "and my husband said, 'We must get engaged before we get married.' " So he told her to pick out a ring.
Mrs. Cahner slipped a 5-carat diamond ring onto her finger. "Right now, I'm shopping for size and shape and to see what I like," she said. After she makes her choice, Mr. Cahner will buy it and then "surprise" her someday with the ring and another marriage proposal.

Looking for a Quality Diamond? Homework Can Help

IS a diamond on your holiday shopping list? Here are some buying tips from experts:

DO SOME RESEARCH -- Plenty of publications and Web sites offer useful information, including guidance on finding reputable dealers. Sites include the Jewelers of America, www.jewelers.org; the Jewelry Information Center, www.jewelryinfo.org; and the 47th Street Business Improvement District, www.diamonddistrict.org.

LEARN THE FOUR C'S -- Carat refers to weight. Color, for traditional white diamonds, is graded on a scale of D to Z, with D through F considered colorless and thus the most valuable. Clarity refers to a stone's flaws, or inclusions, which usually can be seen under magnification. The highest ratings are "flawless" and VVS-1 or -2 (very very slightly included). Cut refers to the angles of the diamond's facets, which determine the amount of light, or brilliance, reflected out of the stone.

COMPARISON SHOP -- It is easy to compare prices if you can visit an area where jewelry stores are clustered, like New York's diamond district on 47th Street. If you can't, check out a few stores in your hometown or look at reputable diamond Web sites.

DON'T BE PRESSURED -- Avoid jewelers who try to push you into a quick purchase -- you are probably spending a lot of money, so you should take all the time you need. Avoid stores that employ "hawkers" who try to lure you inside the store from the street.

GET IT IN WRITING -- Many jewelers sell diamonds with certificates from independent laboratories like the Gemological Institute of America. The certificates list carat weight and give a stone a grade for color and clarity. They should also provide a receipt with price information, the diamond's grade, guarantees and return policies.

NEGOTIATE -- If you're looking at an expensive diamond, you may be able to bring down the price. You can pay substantially less if you buy diamonds that are slightly under the standard weights -- for example, 0.97 carat instead of a full carat, or 0.47 instead of a half-carat.

HEADLINE: The Dangers Behind a Leap of Faith 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
TRUST me.
 They are two of the most common -- and dangerous -- words on Wall Street. 
 Trust-me companies are companies whose financial results gallop ahead of their businesses, companies with seemingly perfect control over their quarterly sales and profits. Companies whose financial statements are loaded with footnotes, companies that short-sellers often attack but rarely dent. Companies with executives who sell their stock every quarter even as they encourage investors to buy more.
They are companies like Enron and Providian Financial -- and Calpine and Tyco International and, maybe, General Electric. This year, Enron was on track to post $200 billion in sales with only 21,000 employees. That works out to revenue of almost $9 million a worker, far more than at other large companies. How did Enron generate such huge sales? How did Enron's energy trading operations make money? What was the relationship between Enron and the web of off-balance-sheet partnerships it created to finance its investments? 
Trust me, Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow said. "We don't want anyone to know what's on those books," Mr. Fastow told Fortune magazine in March, seven months before he was forced out. "We don't want to tell anyone where we're making money." 
That explanation was good enough for Wall Street. Between the end of 1997 and the beginning of this year, Enron's shares quadrupled, and the company won praise for its aggressive management and fast growth.
But when a trust-me story goes wrong, shareholders may find their investments vaporized. Amid questions about the truth of its financial statements, Enron has filed for bankruptcy protection; its stock has fallen 99 percent this year.
Investors in these companies are particularly vulnerable now. Because trust-me companies often depend on easy financing, they are especially dangerous when the stock market or economy turns sour, said Douglas Cliggott, the chief investment strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities.
"We're in a global recession, and it's in recessions where stretched accounting hurts you," Mr. Cliggott said. "I don't think it's a coincidence we're seeing examples of stretched accounting running into problems, where two years ago, we didn't."
Trust-me companies are often strongly supported by Wall Street, because they pay investment bankers hefty fees to raise money for them or advise them on mergers, said Howard Schilit, president of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a firm in Rockville, Md., that breaks apart balance sheets for institutional investors. "Wall Street likes things that will make them a lot of money," he said. "The game is always doing transactions."
Every public company depends to some extent on the trust of its investors. The largest companies, like Home Depot and AT&T, have hundreds of thousands of employees and tens of billions of dollars in annual sales. Even medium-sized public companies often have offices and sales around the world. No shareholder could personally check all of their operations or be certain that they have fully disclosed all of their investments and debts. Some companies use off-balance-sheet partnerships to raise money or to buy assets without ever telling their shareholders in their financial statements.
"It's difficult for any investor, even a good investor, to see what's happening," Mr. Schilit said, "because you're not doing an audit, you're simply relying on published information."
CERTAIN companies, and certain industries, are more likely to tell trust-me stories. Financial services companies and technology companies, especially software companies, like Computer Associates, bear special scrutiny, analysts, short-sellers and others say, because they can manipulate their earnings more easily than other companies.
Electricity and natural gas companies like Dynegy and El Paso Electric, many of which have moved rapidly into the volatile business of trading energy, bear close watching, too, they add. Tyco and G.E., both giant conglomerates, have also drawn the attention of some skeptics, because their operations are so large and complex as to be essentially unfathomable to outsiders.
Poorly understood businesses and footnote-filled financial statements are not the only warning signs, Mr. Schilit said. He pointed to companies that seem to rely heavily on acquisitions for earnings growth, like Tyco, which is based in Bermuda.
Short-sellers, who make money when stock prices decline, took aim at Tyco two years ago, accusing it of stretching accounting rules by taking big restructuring charges when it made acquisitions. The Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation, and Tyco's stock plunged almost 50 percent.
But L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's charismatic chairman, fought off the accusations, saying his accounting was proper. In July 2000, the S.E.C. ended its inquiry without taking action against the company. Tyco's stock has since hit a new high and remains a favorite of Wall Street. According to Bloomberg, the company has the highest rating from each of the 15 analysts who cover it.
Tyco has grown consistently for more than a decade, and its cash flow is strong, said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. As a result, he said, he has confidence in Mr. Kozlowski and Tyco's management.
Still, David W. Tice, the short-seller who initially complained about Tyco's accounting, said he remained skeptical about Tyco. "The underlying growth rate in the future is going to be less," Mr. Tice said. Tyco uses "acquisitions and charge-offs," he said. "It reads like a laundry list of the way companies can play games."
General Electric does not depend as heavily on acquisitions as Tyco, and it is renowned for its strong management. But Mr. Tice said G.E. was worth watching because of its huge financial services division and because it seems to be able to meet or just beat its earnings targets every quarter, no matter the economic environment.
In addition, like many trust-me stocks, G.E. trades at a premium to the market and its competitors because of its fast earnings growth. Having a high price-to-earnings ratio increases the pressure on management to perform, as well as increasing the risk for investors if the company falls short. G.E. is valued at about 24 times its expected 2002 earnings, compared with a multiple of about 23 for the average Standard & Poor's 500 stock. And almost half of G.E.'s earnings come from its financial subsidiary -- yet big banks like Citigroup and Bank of America trade for 13 to 17 times next year's earnings, much less than G.E.
Mr. Schilit says another sign of a trust-me company is a rapidly changing business model. "You transform the company into something that is much more sexy," he said. "Enron was transformed from a pretty boring energy company with modest growth, low price-earnings ratio, to a newfangled energy trading company." The same is true of many of Enron's competitors, including Dynegy, El Paso Electric and Calpine, which have moved aggressively into the business of trading power.
OF course, not every high-growth company is a trust-me story. With Wal-Mart opening stores around the world, the company's rising sales are as visible on the ground as in its income statements. Microsoft's high margins are no mystery, and the company's $31 billion cash hoard proves how lucrative a monopoly can be.
But Mr. Kelly, the Goldman, Sachs analyst, said he was wary of companies whose growth rate suddenly accelerates. "A lot of these shooting stars that we've seen over the last couple of years -- it's the new model, the new paradigm, which turns out not to be the new paradigm at all," he said.
Earnings that are rising more quickly than cash flow are particularly worthy of scrutiny, in Mr. Kelly's view. There are "a number of accounting techniques which will allow a company to report a certain earnings-per-share figure which might be noncash earnings," he said.
Enron, whose earnings per share nearly doubled between 1998 and last year after hardly budging between 1994 and 1998, is just one example. In the late 1990's, Coca-Cola was a classic trust-me story. The company's earnings almost tripled from 1992 to 1997, even though its sales grew much more slowly. Much of that growth came from one-time gains as Coke restructured and sold local bottlers to Coca-Cola Enterprises, a supposedly independent bottling company that is 38 percent owned by Coke.
Coke said the money earned from selling the bottling business was real and should be considered as part of its operating earnings. Despite complaints from short-sellers, who said growth in Coke's core business of selling soft drinks had slowed, Wall Street agreed, bidding the company's shares up fourfold, to a high of $87.94 in July 1998.
The shorts were right. In the last three years, fierce competition and slow growth have cut Coke's profits to barely half their 1997 level. Its stock has followed, closing on Friday at $46.60, down 23.5 percent this year.
FOR years, Computer Associates also had profits that outran its cash flow, as it booked as revenue contracts for which it would not be paid until many years in the future. Today, the company's reported sales and profits have plunged as it works off the backlog of sales it made years ago.
"Reported profits can be confusing," said Chris Galvin, a software analyst at J. P. Morgan. Some software companies, like Microsoft, use conservative accounting, while others are much more aggressive. "The devil is in the details," he said.
Mr. Cliggott advised investors to be wary of financial services companies, which can hide loan losses by extending repayment or rolling unpaid debts into new loans but can run into trouble if the economy sours.
Shares in Providian, a credit-card company that specializes in lending to borrowers with poor credit histories, have fallen from $60 in July to $3.20 today because of sharply rising write-offs on its cards.
"There's a lot of judgment as to when you want to be provisioning for the recognition of bad credit," Mr. Cliggott said.
Michael Freudenstein, a brokerage and specialty finance analyst at J. P. Morgan, disagreed. Mr. Freudenstein said that financial companies must disclose losses quickly and that analysts and investors would punish them if they tried to skimp on their loss reserves. "Finance companies are clear as day," he said.
But Mr. Freudenstein, who had a buy recommendation on Providian until mid-October, when he downgraded the stock to long-term buy and then to hold within a week, acknowledged that Providian's problems had surprised him. "Do I wish I had downgraded it sooner? Yes I do," he said.
Other finance companies that specialize in lending to weak borrowers, like Metris and AmeriCredit, may face problems similar to Providian's, said M. W. Montgomery, partner in a hedge fund that has sold those stocks short. "The amazing thing about the financial services industry," he said, "is the recurring times the market buys everything to be O.K. on the way up."
On that, you can trust him.

An article last Sunday about companies whose complex financial reports force investors to rely heavily on their managements' word misstated the name of one such business, which has moved rapidly into energy trading. It is the El Paso Corporation; El Paso Electric is an unrelated utility.

HEADLINE: Carrying Sticks and Hugging Trees 

BYLINE:  By Richard Brookhiser; Richard Brookhiser is the author of the forthcoming "America's First Dynasty: The Adamses, 1735-1918."

 BODY:
 THEODORE REX
By Edmund Morris.
Illustrated. 772 pp. New York:
Random House. $35.
 Among the many things that Sept. 11 will change is our view of the past. Even as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq have been jolted, so has the market in the reputations of dead presidents. It seems safe to say that the John Adams boom, so carefully nurtured by David McCullough and Joseph J. Ellis, is over. The lovable and passionate crank who couldn't administer a bridge game is simply not the man for this hour. The great Virginians of the first Republican Party -- Thomas Jefferson and James Madison -- so sublime in their principles, so incompetent in their diplomacy and warmaking, will also be trading at a discount. 
Who looks more interesting? All the general-presidents, from Washington to Eisenhower; Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was president during the original day of infamy; and Franklin's brave and bumptious older cousin Theodore. Two books that were planned to appear after the centennial of Theodore Roosevelt's first inauguration, in September 1901, acquire a grave relevance. 
"Theodore Roosevelt" (Times Books/ Holt, $20, to be published next month), Louis Auchincloss's contribution to the American Presidents series, surveys Roosevelt's not-long life -- he died at the age of 60 -- in under 200 pages. Better, however, to take a deep breath and dive into "Theodore Rex," Edmund Morris's sequel to his 1979 masterpiece, "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt." Morris's new book begins at the moment when an assassin's bullet elevates Vice President Roosevelt to the White House and ends, seven and a half years later, when he leaves office. Another volume will be needed to cover his last, eventful decade, which included a failed attempt to regain the presidency and World War I. In the fashion of modern megabiography, Morris devotes several hundred pages to a relatively brief period of time. But unlike many of his peers, he writes with a breezy verve that makes the pages fly, and that perfectly suits his subject.
Roosevelt was six weeks shy of his 43rd birthday when he became president, following the death of William McKinley, thus making him the youngest man ever to occupy the White House (John F. Kennedy, who was 43 years and 5 months old on Election Day in 1960, was the youngest man ever to be elected). The air of youth clung to him throughout his administration. Morris quotes the famous judgment of the British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice: "You must always remember that the president is about 6." Equally telling is the 1904 birthday greeting to Roosevelt from Secretary of War Elihu Root: "You have made a very good start in life and your friends have great hopes for you when you grow up."
Roosevelt had a boy's egotism and brutality; the "bully pulpit" (his phrase) was often the bully's pulpit. But he was also curious, eager, outgoing, energetic. "Isn't it a fine thing to be alive when so many great things are happening?" one lunch guest recorded him saying. Add to the mix his nimble intelligence -- one breathless interlocutor called him "a perfect flying squirrel" in conversation -- and it is no mystery that so many people found him so winning. He was like Rudy Giuliani with charm, Bill Clinton with principles.
Roosevelt made his most constructive contribution in the realm of foreign policy. Together with McKinley, he ushered America into the ranks of the world's great powers. As McKinley's assistant secretary of the Navy, he had pushed for a program of shipbuilding, which he continued as president. At the end of his administration, he sent the expanded Navy, painted white, on a cruise around the world. To facilitate the Navy's movements between oceans, he encouraged a revolution in the Colombian province of Panama. Morris's chapter on the Panamanian adventure skillfully uses a favorite device of his -- short, intercut minisections -- to suggest the fog of ignorance and chance in which high-stakes power plays of this kind always occur. After Roosevelt had won, Philander Knox, his attorney general, told him that "it would be better to keep your action free from any taint of legality." Many Americans condemned Roosevelt's assertions of national strength. But he understood that there had never been a moment of Arcadian apartness in our history. America had been an imperial venture from colonial times. He wished to continue the process in the modern world, and he hoped it would work to the nation's, and the world's, benefit.
But Roosevelt's foreign policy showed finesse as well as muscle. In 1904 a Greek-American named Ioannis Perdicaris was kidnapped from his Moroccan villa by Ahmed el-Raisuli, a bandit chief, and held for ransom. A phrase from a telegram drafted by Secretary of State John Hay -- Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead" -- electrified the Republican convention that was nominating Roosevelt for president. What has dropped from our collective memory of that threat is that it was addressed not to Raisuli but to the sultan of Morocco, whom Roosevelt was urging to treat with the kidnapper (Perdicaris walked as soon as the sultan met Raisuli's terms). Roosevelt could cut deals as well as hurl thunderbolts.
Sometimes he acted silently. In 1902 he warned Germany against forcibly collecting debts owed it by Venezuela, and he backed up his warning with a naval exercise off Puerto Rico. He conveyed his message discreetly, however, so that Germany would lose no face by backing down. So discreet was he that many historians have doubted that Roosevelt brought any pressure to bear. Morris argues that he did (here, as elsewhere, his footnotes are worth reading). Roosevelt adopted and popularized a West African proverb, "Speak softly and carry a big stick." Cartoonists naturally focused on the stick, but soft speaking was an equally important tool. "We are too big a people," Roosevelt wrote, "to be able to be careless in what we say." 
When it comes to Roosevelt's domestic policy, Morris has to try to make sense of that vague and earnest force, the Progressive movement. Roosevelt's most original contribution to its agenda was to push for conservation of natural resources. He offered the arguments of good stewardship, but his was the sensibility of a hunter and an outdoorsman who had seen firsthand two decades' toll on the American West. His record on race was mixed, which makes it better than that of the gross racist Woodrow Wilson. In 1903 a black man accused of rape and murder was seized from prison and burned alive -- not in the Deep South, but in Wilmington, Del. Roosevelt condemned the outrage: "There are certain hideous sights which when once seen can never be wholly erased from the mental retina. The mere fact of having seen them implies degradation." Still, in his second term, he let the soldiers of a black Army unit be railroaded on trumped-up charges of rioting in Brownsville, Tex., and he nearly got into a shouting match at a Gridiron dinner with a Republican senator who vainly tried to defend them. 
Roosevelt made the most noise, however, by picking a fight with the nouveau riche industrialists. Roosevelt himself was a brownstone Knickerbocker, whose caste marks included Groton, Harvard and the Porcellian club. He turned against his class, Morris suggests, in part because he found rich men boring. "You expect a man of millions," Roosevelt said, "to be a man worth hearing; but as a rule they don't know anything outside their own businesses." But his chief motive in taking on the great debut de siecle industrial combinations was a growing conviction that they were taking unfair advantage of their competitors and customers. "I am not deeply interested in" economic issues, he admitted as his administration wound down; "my problems are moral problems, and my teaching has been plain morality." Roosevelt's friend Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. warned that "no part of the conduct of life" would be safe from government interference on such vague principles. But Roosevelt and his fellow Progressives were off to the races. 
Roosevelt's perfervid self-confidence would bear fruit in 1912, outside the scope of "Theodore Rex," when the ex-president split the Republican Party and ran on the Bull Moose ticket. The aftershocks of that campaign would include the New Deal -- for if Wilson established all the administrative precedents for Franklin Roosevelt, cousin Theodore anticipated the moral fervor. Morris is not as enamored of flags, war and big government as Roosevelt was, but he too feels the tug. A combination of diffidence and enthusiasm allows him to write of our past -- which looks like our future -- with energy and clarity.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN IDEAS: A TO Z.; 
Blame The Brokers

BYLINE:  By Richard Siklos

 BODY:
When the irrational exuberance has vanished, taking with it $4 trillion of capital from the nation's stock markets, who is to blame? A growing army of bellicose investors has come to believe that the culprit is not impersonal market forces or their own excess greed -- it's the brokers who are to blame. Aggrieved investors argue that the way reputable Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston pumped up Internet and technology stocks was no better than the notorious schemes of small-time "boiler rooms," and they've filed an array of class-action lawsuits against major Wall Street firms and a record number of individual claims with the National Association of Securities Dealers.
 According to the Fordham University securities-law professor Constantine Katsoris, a veteran N.A.S.D. arbitrator, a burst in client complaints always follows a slide in the market. This year's suits, however, make a specific and often compelling claim: Wall Street analysts hyped the very Internet stocks whose dubious I.P.O.'s their firms were underwriting. The other new twist is that some investors are actually collecting: a New York doctor, Debasis Kanjilal, captured Wall Street's attention in July when Merrill settled his arbitration case for $400,000. Kanjilal claimed, among other things, that he lost his life's savings by following the firm's star analyst, Henry Blodget. Merrill has said it did nothing wrong; Blodget announced in November that he was taking a buyout from the company estimated to be $2 million. 
 If every investor who lost big on tech stocks was recompensed for his trouble, Wall Street -- itself bleeding and slashing jobs -- could face liabilities on the scale of big tobacco's. But this is not likely to happen. In August, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack dismissed several suits brought only weeks earlier by shareholders in Amazon.com and eBay Inc. against the Morgan Stanley analyst Mary Meeker, calling them an example of "abusive litigation" based on "a collection of market gossip" from media reports.
Still, angry investors aren't likely to give up their claims anytime soon; they're taking one last stab at cashing in on the Internet bubble. Richard Siklos

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
The Industrial Genius Who Hated Difference

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
AFTER reading Neil Baldwin's latest book, one might be forgiven for thinking that Henry Ford was nothing but a loon.
 Mr. Ford kept 50 investigators on the Ford Motor payroll to monitor employee homes for any hint of what he considered moral decay, riotous living, poor hygiene -- and boarders. The last taboo had sprung from his conviction that "next to liquor, dissension in the home is due to people other than the family being there." 
 He welcomed immigrants in his factories but expected them to quickly assimilate into the ranks with a nutty graduation ceremony involving a giant papier-mache melting pot. While their families picnicked and a brass band played, they would climb into the pot garbed in their native costumes, singing their national anthems, and climb out wearing derbies and singing "The Star-Spangled Banner." 
Of course, as easy as it would be to label Mr. Ford as just another eccentric genius, he was more than that. A folk hero whose influence extended beyond Detroit, he ran one of the country's most respected and biggest employers, and had the money and inclination to buy printing presses to disseminate what these days are considered bigoted views.
Hitler certainly used Mr. Ford's published tirades about Jews as part of his own propaganda when trying to rid the world of a group that Mr. Ford had vilified as the scourge of civilization.
Fifty-four years after Mr. Ford's death, it is still worth pondering how someone of his gifts could have become so consumed by hate as to let it taint all he had accomplished in life. The question is as timely today as ever, even if the particular hatemongers and scapegoats have changed.
Mr. Baldwin, a noted biographer, provides a partial answer in "Henry Ford and the Jews: The Mass Production of Hate" (Public Affairs Press, $27.50). The book builds on earlier efforts to examine Mr. Ford's obsession with Jews and is heavily documented in footnotes. And yet, Mr. Baldwin's book is less lively than Albert Lee's 1980 book, "Henry Ford and the Jews," and still hasn't cracked the riddle. 
Too often, the author and reader are left wondering what was going on inside the man's head as he spewed anti-Semitic vitriol. Did he buy it? Was he parroting others? Were there hidden motives? And what about those later retractions, like the published apology on July 8, 1927, in which he said "the righteous indignation entertained by Jews everywhere toward me" was justified? Had he even read the apologies?
As fascinating as it is to have Mr. Ford's and his mentors' words about Jews faithfully quoted, it is numbing after a while. Far more interesting than what he said is why.
His legacy should have been secure. A Michigan farm boy who grew to be a tinkerer and dreamer, he gave consumers wheels they could afford and operate. "Anybody can drive a Ford," he liked to brag.
As his Ford Motor Company prospered, he was also revered for his management style, delighting employees in 1914 by trimming the workday and raising pay. 
But Mr. Ford's penchant for social engineering also got him into trouble. Just as he had standardized production to ensure that a reliable car -- invariably black -- rolled off the assembly line every few hours, he seemed to believe he could mint picture-perfect Americans. 
Any signs of otherness obviously had to go. Mr. Ford harbored a special lifelong mistrust for all things Jewish. This aversion, Mr. Baldwin says, dated back to Mr. Ford's school days, when he was reared on the moralistic teachings of William Holmes McGuffey, whose booksharped on sources like Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice." 
Anti-Semitic stereotypes might have been hard for the boy to challenge because there is no evidence he ever met anyone Jewish before adulthood, according to the author.
By 1914, Jewish immigrants had begun to move west, drawn by Detroit's factories and the promise of jobs. They were hired at Ford on the proviso that they attend classes given by the much-feared Sociology Department, a vice squad responsible for turning new hires into proper Americans.
But the boss was not content simply molding the Jews who worked for him. He felt he had much to say about national woes and what he called "the Jewish problem" at their core. 
Some of his hate seems fueled by a need to blame someone for deepening problems at home, as the country was drawn into World War I, and he was quick to use the words "Jew" and "profiteer" interchangeably. A fledgling Zionism movement may have raised his suspicions that Jews had divided loyalties.
Mr. Baldwin makes the case, too, that Mr. Ford's aversion to Jews was entwined with a mistrust of bankers and financiers whom he feared had conspired through loans to wrest control of other men's companies.
"Henry called all the moneylenders of the world 'Jews,' " the book quotes his sister Margaret Ford Ruddiman as saying, "regardless of their religion." 
In 1918, seeking a soapbox from which he could speak his mind unencumbered, Mr. Ford bought The Dearborn Independent, a newspaper that was soon billing itself as the Chronicler of the Neglected Truth. 
One particularly vicious series, "The International Jew: The World's Problem," which ran for 91 weeks, began on May 22, 1920. It was followed by a decision to reprint portions of the "Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," a grand forgery that alleged that Jews were plotting to take control of the world.
To this day, Mr. Baldwin says, there is some debate over who was pulling the strings at the newspaper, as Mr. Ford's minions took pride in "amplifying" his often murky views. 
But Mr. Baldwin's narrative convincingly shows readers that Mr. Ford was his own man. He not only advised presidents and prime ministers but had himself flirted with higher office. Though described by the author as an indifferent student of history, Mr. Ford once famously muttered, "History is more or less the bunk," a comment many took to mean that history was whatever Henry Ford said it was.
As sensational as the articles in The Dearborn Independent were, circulation was uneven and the paper might have gone the way of the Model T had Mr. Ford not ordered his army of car dealers to sell the paper as they would any other Ford product. They did. 
FINALLY, in 1927, after years of failing to heed those around him and watching his business weaken -- too many black cars, perhaps? -- Mr. Ford finally sought to mend his reputation lest a serious boycott of his products make things worse.
He reached out to Louis Marshall, a prominent Jewish lawyer, who drafted a general letter of apology to Jews everywhere that one witness recalled Mr. Ford had signed without reading. More telling, Mr. Baldwin says, Mr. Ford refused to sell his printing presses, just in case the Jews someday forced him to "go after" them again. 
A grateful Mr. Ford offered his ghostwriter a brand-new Model A, which Mr. Marshall declined, saying he was "devoted to pedestrian locomotion," Mr. Baldwin reports.
Ever since, Mr. Ford's descendants, who are now running the company again, have had to answer questions about the sincerity of that apology and others that followed. Ford has also made serious amends, by, among other things, making investments and offering favorable financing in Israel and by sponsoring movies like "Schindler's List" on television. But for better or worse, Ford the company will have an image forever linked to Ford the man.

HEADLINE: A Stimulus Not Worth Passing 

 BODY:
If President Bush truly wants an "economic stimulus" package on his desk this year, he needs to do more than exhort Congress to get moving. He and the Republican leaders in the House and Senate should drop the pretense that tax-break giveaways to corporations and the wealthiest Americans are the key to reviving the economy.
 On Friday, Republicans broke off bipartisan negotiations on stimulus legislation, raising doubts about whether any measure to help the economy can be enacted this year. But in a slump like the one right now, an ineffective and lopsided bill is worse than no bill at all. Congress has to decide this week whether it wants to provide a real stimulus and help those hurt by the downturn, or give handouts to the people who need them least. 
 The country would be better off with no stimulus package than with one that abolishes the minimum corporate tax, as Republicans demand. Part of the sweeping tax reforms of 1986, the minimum tax is a sensible rule requiring corporations that have used loopholes and deductions to reduce their tax bills to zero to pay at least something to the federal Treasury. With the prospect of deficits stretching out to the horizon, and the administration claiming that it cannot afford to spend more money on homeland security, the idea of permanently eliminating this source of revenue is outrageous.
Republicans initially also wanted corporations to get refunds based on the repeal of these taxes, retroactive to 1986. The outcry over that proposed giveaway forced them to back down a bit from that idea. But tax law is infamously tricky, and the measure remains structured so companies could use it to recoup past taxes. The positive effect on the economy would be negligible, and the federal Treasury would be the loser. The winners, beneficiaries of huge and unnecessary windfalls, would include General Electric, General Motors, I.B.M. and even Enron, the bankrupt energy concern.
The Bush administration and Congress did enough damage to the government's long-term financial health with the tax cuts enacted last June, and the country is now seeing the results in the future deficits. The stimulus package backed by the White House would accelerate the high-end tax cuts that were approved earlier this year but are not scheduled to take effect for several years. These particular cuts will almost certainly be reconsidered and perhaps repealed by Congress when it starts wrestling with deficits and the need to make drastic spending cuts next year. Sticking them into the stimulus package is just a ploy to nail down a benefit to the wealthiest 1 percent of America before the country realizes it cannot afford the bill.
Last week, Republican leaders agreed to include in the stimulus an extension of unemployment benefits for nearly eight million Americans out of work. They took that step to secure Democratic votes for a separate bill to grant Mr. Bush expanded trade-negotiating authority. Republicans have also accepted the concept of tax breaks for those low-income Americans left out of the tax cut earlier this year. But these are only half-steps, hardly worth trading for the budget-wrecking effects of the other provisions. Extended unemployment benefits under the Republican plan would still go only to white-collar workers, not to part-time or recently hired people who were laid off. At a minimum, the stimulus bill needs to help all Americans who need jobless and health benefits.
There can certainly be room for tax breaks for business in a stimulus package. One sound approach would be to expand business tax deductions for future expenses and depreciation. Such steps would truly encourage new investment and also focus their benefits on the small and medium-size businesses hit hardest by the economy today. Congress should also include a measure to help the states close their budget deficits.
There is an impasse in Congress now on the stimulus, and Republicans favoring a bill for rich and big corporate taxpayers apparently think they do not need to make concessions. They simply plan to blame the Democrats if nothing is passed. That is why Mr. Bush needs to stop his exhortations and do the dirty work of negotiating with Congress. The presidential bully pulpit goes only so far. More welcome would be some tough decisions to get a bill that can not only be passed but can also do some good.

HEADLINE: German Chancellor Shores Up His Shaky Coalition 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, by playing active host to the negotiations forming a new government for Afghanistan, has shored up his shaky coalition by putting Germany on the side of postwar reconstruction.
 Just a few weeks ago, his Green Party partners, with their roots in pacifism, nearly imploded over a vote in the German Parliament supporting the deployment of German troops in a support role in and around Afghanistan. 
 But last week, as Mr. Schroder and his Green foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, beamed at the closing ceremony of the 10-day Afghan conference near Bonn, German officials were talking happily about how Germany had become an important actor for peace, enhanced its position inside Europe and even put down a marker for any future expansion of the United Nations Security Council. 
"This is a historical agreement," Mr. Schroder said at the former German government guest house, the Petersberg. "This is a great day for Afghanistan and the United Nations."
As Berthold Kohler wrote astringently in the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, Mr. Schroder's "assessment likely came easily to him since it also reflects on the host of the talks on Afghanistan's future."
But in political terms, Germany's involvement has been a shrewd boon to Mr. Schroder, who was aided by the swift progress of the war itself. Since Sept. 11, Mr. Schroder has put himself firmly on the side of Washington, but he has also tried to use the war to convince Germans that it is time to get over the hesitancies of the past and to act like the big European power the reunited Germany has become -- and with all the instruments of state, from foreign aid and diplomacy to the military.
Still, Mr. Schroder needs to find a balance between military solidarity with allies and the struggle for peace, and that is what the Bonn conference enabled him to do.
"It helps the government that the foreign-policy headlines every day were about what was going on in Bonn, rather than whether German soldiers were being sent to war," said Bernhard May, deputy director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. "This was very important to the government."
The Afghan authority decided upon in Bonn is hardly perfect, as even the United Nations negotiators acknowledged, and it may fracture or be unable to assert its authority outside Kabul. But the conference produced a success, the first peacefully negotiated, internationally supported government for Afghanistan in more than 20 years -- made possible by the American-led war against Osama bin Laden and his own hosts, the Taliban.
With elections next autumn and an economy in recession, and with unemployment rising toward four million and the Greens anxious about their souls, Mr. Schroder had pushed the United Nations and the United States hard to be able to play host to the conference, German and American officials say.
Germany already is the current chairman of the Afghanistan Support Group, which has been raising Western aid to reconstruct Afghanistan and held a financing conference last week in Berlin, almost simultaneously with the closing of the Bonn conference. Germany is also pushing for a German diplomat to be named the European Union's representative to Kabul.
But to support the new authority in Kabul, scheduled to take office on Dec. 22, the Afghan delegations also requested the United Nations to authorize a peacekeeping force to improve security in Kabul and create a neutral political zone there for opposition politicians to feel more at ease.
The United Nations and the United States clearly want a European core to any such force, and discussions are continuing. The British could organize it, but given British colonial history and participation in the war against the Taliban, some Afghans are nervous about too prominent a British role. There is talk about French participation -- and German.
Mr. Schroder has been coy on this question. "It's up to the U.N. to decide on the mission's composition," he said. "In case a German role is sought as part of a European solution, Germany will neither want to, nor be able to, decline its participation."
Asked about German participation in such a force, a senior United Nations official said, "We haven't asked them, exactly, and they haven't asked us not to ask."
But not all Germans would be happy with a new deployment of German forces, even for peacekeeping, when they already serve in Bosnia and Kosovo, lead the force in Macedonia and need more budget support. The weak defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said German interests in Afghanistan are unclear, and "above all, we have limited military and financial resources."
Christoph Schwennicke, writing in the Suddeutsche Zeitung, warned about German heads becoming dizzy with flattery.
"Everyone is full of praise now for the hosts of the Afghanistan conference," Mr. Schwennicke said, suggesting that "he who can put together so successful a diplomatic arena for arranging a new order in the Hindu Kush must also be capable of taking over the military flank when a provisional government is established in Kabul."
Mr. Schroder should resist such flattery, Mr. Schwennicke said. "A German Army operation in Afghanistan is a perfectly appropriate way to overstretch their endurance," he added. But what seemed to bother him more was the potential for danger, noting that the revolt of the Arab Taliban in Mazar-i-Sharif shows that "a peace mission in Afghanistan will by no means be a peaceful mission."
But for Mr. May, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, Afghanistan represents "another step in a long learning process for the German public about how assertive the government can or should be in foreign policy." The country has come a long way since reunification in 1990, he said. At that time, he noted, a poll found that two-thirds of Germans felt the model for their foreign policy should be neutral Switzerland.

HEADLINE: For Britain, Euro Is Invasion It May Have to Invite 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BATTLE, England, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Deep in southeast England, this ancient village of turreted towers and beamed cottages was named for the Battle of Hastings, when William, the Norman conqueror from across the channel, overwhelmed the forces of King Harold in 1066 to begin the conquest of olde Englande. These days, some suspect another intrusion from roughly the same direction could be in the offing.
 In less than four weeks, 280 million Europeans living in a swath of land from the Arctic to the Mediterranean will adopt the notes and coins of the euro single currency, jettisoning their francs and marks and drachmas and pesetas. Britain, along with Sweden and Denmark among the 15 members of the European Union, will not adopt the new currency. 
 However much Britons may sniff at the new money -- formally in existence only in electronic transactions since Jan. 1, 1999 -- its use in continental Europe seems certain to spill over to a land whose people mainly reject it, but whose businesses are already converting telephone booths, invoice forms and store tills to accept it. 
"There may be those who want to keep Britain out of the euro," said Simon Buckby, head of the pro-euro Britain in Europe advocacy group, "but you can't keep the euro out of Britain."
That, in turn, has long-range implications for Britain's broader relationship with the rest of Europe. In recent months, those ties have undergone a quiet change as Prime Minister Tony Blair has gathered enhanced status and authority as America's leading ally in the war against terrorism.
Indeed, some of the continent's most important figures say privately that British membership in the euro -- a deeply contentious issue in Britain, but crucial to greater British influence in the continent's affairs -- is no longer in doubt. "The only question is when," said a French diplomat, insisting on anonymity.
Traditionally, the British harbor a deep mistrust of continental Europe as a place apart, exemplified by Winston Churchill's remark: "We are with Europe, not of it. We are linked, but not comprised."
It is that sense of divergent destinies -- and the maneuvers that have flown from it -- that Mr. Blair now seeks to redefine.
"The history of our engagement with Europe is one of opportunities missed in the name of illusions and Britain suffering as a result," Mr. Blair told an audience in Birmingham last month in what his aides had flagged as a keynote speech. The change he seeks, he said, is to make British influence felt, not as a tag-along nation playing catch-up to French and German initiatives, but as a leader.
"The argument is simple," Mr. Blair said, forgoing Churchill's caveats. "We are part of Europe. It affects us directly and deeply. Therefore we should exercise leadership in order to change Europe in the direction we want."
European diplomats insist, though, that the inevitable entry price for this exalted status is membership in the euro zone, which is where Mr. Blair's grand strategic vision, and his personal ambitions, collide with the realities of politics.
The peoples of the existing nations in the euro zone accepted the currency virtually at the decree of their political elites. By contrast, Britain has promised not just a referendum, but a referendum based on an assessment of the currency's economic advantages overseen by Chancellor Gordon Brown, a hard-nosed economist and political rival to Mr. Blair.
Opinion surveys, moreover, show consistently that two-thirds of Britons are opposed to adopting the new currency. Consider, for example, Alastaire Riy, a butcher and purveyor of venison on Main Street in Battle whose customers are so committed to their tradition that they would prefer to buy his chops and sausages in the pounds and ounces of the past, not the metric weights of the present.
"Most people here are against the euro because everything is very traditional here," said Mr. Riy (pronounced rye). "They don't like it because they think Europe is taking over. They feel they fought a world war and now everything is being taken away."
With the anti-euro Conservative opposition still weakened by a second successive electoral thrashing last June, and given Mr. Blair's status as Europe's main interlocutor with Washington after the Sept. 11 attacks, the British leader might begin openly now to persuade people like Mr. Riy to change their minds.
As in the past, however, the politically attuned prime minister has remained elusive about a referendum date and cautious about the likely outcome of any economic assessment. With the opinion polls against him, said Charles Grant of the pro-euro Center for European Reform, "there is a limit to his messianic powers."
While Mr. Blair may have emerged strengthened as a war leader, that may not carry through to persuading Britons to abandon their cherished pound. "Churchill was a great war leader," Mr. Grant said, "but he didn't win the election in 1945."
Nonetheless, on Jan. 1, 2002, the European currency will come to rival or even surpass the dollar as the single most important foreign currency for Britons. The country conducts over half its trade with the 12 euro member states.
Major department stores including Harrods, Harvey Nichols and Selfridges have said they will accept payments in euros, although change will be given in pounds and pence. 
Banks, exchange booths at airports, and the Eurostar train station are preparing to switch from converting 12 currencies -- marks, pesetas, francs, escudos and so forth -- to accepting only euros from some of the 13 million visitors from the euro zone who spend the equivalent of over $5.5 billion a year in Britain.
Britons in turn make an average 40 million trips a year to euro zone countries. "Half the population will see the euro, feel the coins, use the coins," said Peter Hain, Britain's minister for Europe, who has been touring Britain to try to soften the skepticism about the euro. "That is going to turn the euro from an object of some mystery, some suspicion, fear and ignorance to something that is real."
Indeed, while Britons have been talking, conducting opinion surveys and generally postponing a final decision, the euro has already been creeping up on them. Some companies like the Japanese automaker Toyota -- whose plant at Derby in the British Midlands exported 80 percent of the 170,000 cars it produced this year to the European Union -- already send out their invoices to suppliers in euros. "We have to be Europe-minded," said Graham Hillier, the manager of planning and communication at Toyota Manufacturing.
Even on Main Street in Battle, a local bank offered customers a hologramlike conversion card so that they could figure out how much a euro would be worth in pounds. (Currently, about 62 pence or 89 United States cents equals one euro.)
Kay Hunting, the president of the local chamber of commerce, noted, "We haven't quite caught up with it in Battle."
Carolyn Bell, owner of a tea shop called Tea on the Green in the shadow of the battlements of the 800-year-old abbey here, said shopkeepers like herself had only just decided that "we need some schooling" in the euro.
But, as elsewhere in Britain, there was no unanimity when it comes to actually joining the euro. "I would rather stay out and have my own money, like the U.S.A.," Mrs. Bell said.
"I'm all for the euro," said Ray Woollard, a local picture framer and art dealer. "We are either going to be in Europe or be under the wing of the Americans. And I think we want to be in Europe."

HEADLINE: Canada Relies On Discipline As Economy Slows Down 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Finance Minister Paul Martin will present his budget to Parliament on Monday, and it is expected to demonstrate that the Canadian government is choosing a different way than the United States to deal with tough economic times.
 Even as talk in Washington revolves around a stimulus package of tax cuts and higher government spending, Mr. Martin has sent a clear signal that his emphasis will be on fiscal discipline. "It's very, very important that we stay out of deficit, and we've got to do everything within our power to do that," Mr. Martin said on Friday. 
 Most Canadians are unlikely to disagree, at least for now, even though their economy is in recession and unemployment is rising. Mr. Martin has worked hard to put the government's finances on a more solid footing in his eight years at the finance ministry.
"Credibility is a newfound luxury we've got in fiscal policy here," said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. "It was a hard-fought battle to gain that credibility, and you can lose it quickly."
Economists are virtually unanimous in predicting that Mr. Martin will loosen the purse strings only enough to provide a few billion extra dollars for domestic security and the military, and to improve infrastructure, like roads, bridges and customs offices, along the United States border. Foreign aid may increase modestly. Tax cuts are out of the question.
"I'm not looking for a great deal in new initiatives," said Mr. Wright.
Derek Burleton, an economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said, "The government has made it very clear that they're going to target a balanced budget for 2002-03."
Edward Carmichael, the chief economist at J. P. Morgan in Toronto, predicted in a note to clients on Friday that "spending on new priorities will need to be offset by some combination of increased revenues and reduced spending in other areas." Mr. Carmichael said plans for a national high-speed Internet network would be delayed, and proposed spending on university and health research would be pared. Canada's finances have improved significantly under Mr. Martin's stewardship. The federal budget swung from a $18.2 billion deficit in the fiscal year that ended March 31, 1996, to a $10.9 billion surplus last year.
The turnaround has enabled Canada to allocate an ever bigger slice of tax revenues to debt repayment. The ratio of government debt to gross domestic product, an important measure of a country's financial stability, has fallen to about 50 percent from a peak of 71 percent in 1996.
Many political analysts believe that Mr. Martin's determination not to tarnish his reputation for fiscal prudence is compounded by his political ambitions. Eleven years ago, he lost the race for the leadership of the Liberal Party to Jean Chretien, now the prime minister. Mr. Martin has made little secret of his wish to have another crack at the top job when Mr. Chretien, 67, decides to step down.
But the recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have interrupted Mr. Martin's good news. A slump in corporate profits will reduce tax revenues, while rising unemployment is certain to lead to higher welfare and other social spending.
One hundred and seventy-four Canadian companies surveyed by The Globe and Mail newspaper reported a combined loss of $952 million in the third quarter, compared with $5.6 billion in profits a year earlier.
Statistics Canada, the government's reporting agency, said on Friday that the jobless rate rose to 7.5 percent in November, its highest level since mid-1999.
For the time being, Mr. Martin appears to be relying on lower interest rates and an early recovery in the United States to come to Canada's rescue.
The Bank of Canada has lowered short-term rates nine times this year, with banks' prime lending rate now at 4 percent. According to J. P. Morgan's Mr. Carmichael, Mr. Martin's commitment to balanced budgets or "modest" surpluses should see the ratio of debt to gross domestic product maintain a gradual decline.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED -- AN OVERVIEW: DEC. 8, 2001; 
Opening a Gateway, Closing In on bin Laden and Setting the Priorities

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Supplies of food and medicine may soon be flowing into northern Afghanistan over a long-closed bridge from the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. Colin L. Powell, the secretary of state, who is visiting central Asian republics to say thanks for helping America in the war on terrorism, and the Uzbek president, Islam Karimov, announced in Tashkent that the so-called Friendship Bridge, a Soviet-built span closed since 1996, would be reopened today.
 SHIFT IN FOCUS -- The focus of the war shifted from fallen Kandahar to the eastern mountains around Tora Bora, where Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda fighters were believed to be dug in. A day after Taliban forces abandoned their last stronghold at Kandahar, pockets of resistance led to isolated skirmishes near the city. While fighting among victorious factions inside Kandahar quieted down, rivals claimed control of key parts of the city and tensions were running high. 
 Hamid Karzai, designated leader of the government that is to assume power in Kabul soon, called on fellow Afghans to help capture Mr. bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, who slipped away during Kandahar's chaotic surrender, and he promised to deliver both to "international justice."
Mr. Karzai, who appointed a tribal commission to run Kandahar and seek some compromises among the feuding warlords, also laid out the priorities for his administration: peace and security for the Afghan people, economic opportunity for all, good relations with the world, and an end to terrorism.
SO FAR, SO GOOD -- With Kandahar's fall, Taliban forces that held 90 percent of Afghanistan just two months ago have been defeated. But the war is far from over. Two of three United States goals remain: to dispose of Mr. bin Laden and his thousands of Al Qaeda fighters, and to restore stability so terrorists can no longer find a haven in Afghanistan.
Looking back, the campaign -- a strange blend of 21st Century air attacks and 19th Century calvary charges -- has been quite successful. America has committed no large ground forces, suffered no extensive casualties and let its allies do the hard fighting. Besides sweeping the Taliban out, the campaign has destroyed a network of Al Qaeda camps, opened the way for a new government in Kabul and perhaps brought the dawn of a new era for the Afghan people.
COMING STRUGGLES -- But tracking Mr. bin Laden and his diehard followers will be tough. The rugged mountains around Tora Bora is their turf. Casualties could be heavy, and the results iffy. Bombing alone may not work, and a siege may be required. Even then Mr. bin Laden could escape across the border into Pakistan.
In Kabul, the streets are strangely normal. But getting a stable government going could be harder than the military campaign, given centuries of rivalries among groups who will share power. Reconciliation may depend on Mr. Karzai. A bit of bio: He is descended from a clan whose fate has mirrored the tumultuous history of Afghanistan. It gave the nation's 18th century founder land on which Kandahar was built, and its men were national leaders until Communists seized power in 1978 and the clan was exiled. Mr. Karzai did not fight, but funneled covert American aid to rebels who beat the Communists in 1992. He returned as deputy foreign minister, but quit in 1994 when the Taliban seized power.
CRIMES OF HATRED -- With the fall of the Taliban, the extent of its crimes of hatred, especially against Mongol-featured Hazaras, is becoming apparent. The destruction of two 1,500-year-old Buddha statues near Bamian last spring was only the most visible of the crimes. The ones nobody heard about included the massacre of thousands of people, many of them hung upside down for slaughter, the burning of whole villages and the destruction of crops and wells.
In recent days, some former residents have been drifting back to Hazara mountain villages, but not to one called Qezelabad, near Mazar-i-Sharif. It was there, three years ago, that Taliban soldiers swept in and destroyed nearly everyone and everything. Now, all that is left there are shallow graves. 
WARTIME PRESIDENT -- In the 13 weeks since Sept. 11, President Bush has matured as a wartime leader, interviews with dozens of friends and advisers suggest. He has tended to be far more serious, restraining natural jocularity, but also has tried to strike a balance so as not to seem gloomy. ROBERT D. McFADDEN

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DEMOCRATS; 
The Challenge: Criticizing Bush's Policies Without Attacking Bush

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
With President Bush's popularity rating in the stratosphere and the country solidly behind the war on terrorism, Democrats have adopted a delicate strategy for winning control of Congress in next year's elections and positioning themselves for challenging the president in 2004.
 They express unwavering support of the war effort. They refrain from even the slightest personal criticism of Mr. Bush. But they are stepping up their attacks on the president's economic and social policies -- on taxes and spending, on health care, on education and, especially, on the administration's response to the recession. 
 This is how Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, made the case this week: "I have absolutely the greatest respect for the president personally, admire him in many ways. I happen to differ with him on many of his domestic proposals, but I generally share his view about foreign policy currently and what he's attempting to do in Afghanistan. So it's an easy distinction for me to make. I think that most of my colleagues feel the same way."
So, Mr. Daschle was asked, is the president to blame for the recession?
"I don't think the recession is his fault," Mr. Daschle said. "I do believe that efforts that have been made in this administration over the course of the year have contributed to the economic slowdown and to the problems we're now having. I don't think there's any question that the deficits have been created in large measure because of the tax cuts that were passed at the insistence of the administration."
Three prominent Democratic tacticians -- James Carville, Stanley Greenberg and Robert Shrum -- described the strategy in detail in an 18-page memorandum, "Politics After the Attack."
"It is important to support the president and set a tone that lacks a sharp partisan quality," the strategists wrote. "Democrats," they declared, must be "committed to fighting terrorism but also committed to addressing the economy and jobs, health care and education."
Weekly polls and focus groups conducted since Sept. 11, they said, indicate that Democrats have a strong hand on pocketbook issues and that "Republican economic policies are oddly out of sync with the national mood currently sweeping America."
Paradoxically, the notion of supporting the president while attacking his policies is exactly the opposite of the Republicans' approach during most of Bill Clinton's presidency. Often reluctant to attack Mr. Clinton's policies, which were generally popular, Republicans concentrated on attacking him personally.
"The Democrats are taking a page out of the Republican playbook and turning it upside down," said Tony Coelho, the former Democratic congressman who ran Al Gore's campaign in the 2000 presidential primaries.
Marshall Wittmann, a political scientist who specializes in Congress and the presidency, said, "Bush is now the anti-Clinton."
The closest a leading Democrat has come to an outright attack on the president since Sept. 11 was when Representative Nita M. Lowey of Westchester County, chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was quoted in USA Today referring to the "Bush recession."
In an interview, Ms. Lowey said what she meant was that Mr. Bush would ultimately be judged on the way he handled the recession, and that Mr. Clinton could not be held responsible for it.
When Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, was asked in an interview this week about Mr. Bush's responsibility for the recession, he stuck to the party line: criticize the policies, not the president.
"I don't know that you can ever say one figure in history caused a recession," Mr. Gephardt asserted, "but in the last year, his budget, tax and economic policies have been misguided, have been wrong."
The Democratic strategy of focusing on domestic issues seemed to have borne fruit in last month's elections. Democrats won the only governorships at stake, in New Jersey and Virginia, and the races for mayor in Los Angeles and Houston. The only consequential Republican victory was Michael R. Bloomberg's election as mayor of New York, and that race was not fought on partisan ground.
"The American public absolutely will accept well-founded criticism of Bush's domestic policies," said James Jordan, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "The elections last month settled that forever."
By a one-vote margin this week, the House voted to give Mr. Bush expanded authority to negotiate trade agreements. But the rest of his domestic agenda remains stalled in Congress, including an economic stimulus package based on corporate tax cuts, education legislation and energy policy. 
In an odd way, Mr. Bush has abetted the Democratic strategy by opting to stay out of the political fray in the interest of preserving unity on the war against terrorism. This could work to Mr. Bush's benefit in 2004, many political experts say, but it could hurt his party's chances of retaining control of the House and Senate.
By staying clear of partisan politics, Mr. Wittmann said, Mr. Bush has effectively made Representatives Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, the House majority leader and whip, the leading voices of the Republican Party. Mr. Armey and Mr. Delay, both Texans, are ardent conservatives whose style may seem strident in the swing states and districts that will be decisive in the elections.
"The Democrats are lucky to have DeLay and Armey to shoot at," he said.

HEADLINE: Changed World Puts Rare Talent in Rolodex of Mayoral Transition 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
One resume is from a senior advertising executive who wants to get New York's tourism industry back on track. Another comes from a partner in a large law firm who is ready to give up a big paycheck to take on the city's housing problems. A woman who served in two city administrations and left to form a successful business, never looking back, now wants to return to government.
 The confluence of a terrorist attack on New York City, a softening economy and a change of administration at City Hall has resulted in a flurry of interest in jobs in the Bloomberg administration from unexpected corners, members of the transition team say. 
 Moved by the events of Sept. 11, people from all economic classes and neighborhoods -- many of whom have served in government before and thought they would never return -- suddenly see public service as honorable and a way to help the city.
Raymond W. Kelly, who was recently designated the next police commissioner, said the attack on the World Trade Center was the single event that drew him away from a lucrative job with an investment bank, against the wishes of his wife. His feelings have been echoed in job interviews with many others, transition team members say. 
"We have talked to a number of people who are interested in major posts here who say their desire to be of service was prompted by Sept. 11," said Nathan Leventhal, who is in charge of Michael R. Bloomberg's transition team. 
"That has been very encouraging," he said, "because the quality of people we are talking about is very high."
Further, many candidates, particularly those looking for deputy commissioner or more subordinate posts, are well aware that the New York City economy does not offer the types of private jobs that were readily available even six months ago, and at the same time believe that Mr. Bloomberg, who is a billionaire businessman, might be able to help them re-enter the private sector once his term is over.
"As I talk to a lot of young people," said Deborah C. Wright, a transition team member and chief executive of Carver Bank, "they say they feel like they are not sacrificing a future to be in government now. In the last few years, a lot of elected officials have denigrated public services, but now, the combination of a mayor from the private sector and an economy in trouble means he has the pick of the litter. It may be the best opportunity to get good people since the Lindsay administration."
In a dozen interviews with transition team members and others close to the process, many said they were struck by the eclectic group of candidates who were putting their names in the hats for jobs. Many are from the private sector, long gone from government, or are novices, like the mayor-elect. Some younger candidates hold business degrees from prestigious universities. Others have made a lot of money in the private sector, like Mr. Kelly.
"As a native New Yorker, I hear the call," said one candidate who served in the Dinkins and Giuliani administrations. "If the mayor-elect's transition team finds an appropriate match for my talents and interests, I would find the emotional and psychic rewards more compelling than my own personal financial interests."
Mr. Kelly said he has heard the same from potential candidates for his department. 
"Lots of people are expressing a kind of frustration at having watched it all happen from their couch," he said. "I have resumes as a result for all different jobs in the Police Department." The applicants feel "somewhat powerless being outside of government," Mr. Kelly said. The Police Department is one of the few areas of government that compete directly with private businesses, as security firms and other businesses seek police officers trained and ready to work for more money.
But looming budget gaps, and a culture of sacrifice those shortages will create, color the way Mr. Bloomberg's transition committee is looking at candidates. They must be more than do-gooders, say committee members, and many jobs require that they be well versed in municipal finance and have creative ideas about how to cut budgets and maintain services. They have to be able to deliver bad news in a diplomatic way. 
At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg has given his team a mandate to put together a diverse administration, and some jobs have not attracted as many minority candidates as some committee members had hoped. "We are doing as much as we can to reach out to as many people as possible," said Bonnie Wong, a committee member. "I make a point of making sure that minority candidates are considered in all areas."
Mr. Leventhal, who said some new job titles might reflect the specific problems that the city faces now, said the current situation was similar to the one in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, when many people from various unexpected corners turned out to try to help New York rebound.
"Some terrific people came forward to be helpful," he said. "The content of some jobs is obviously different now because of the need to rebuild." Candidates must be "sensitive to the extreme seriousness of the fiscal situation," he added. "We are looking for creative people, and by that I don't mean artistically, but people who think outside of the box."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE NEW GOVERNMENT; 
For Afghan Clan, a Full Circle Back to Power

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: QUETTA, Pakistan, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
In 1761, King Ahmad Shah Durrani, the founder of Afghanistan whose descendants would rule until a Communist coup in 1978, received some free land on which he built the city of Kandahar. The gift came from a powerful local clan called the Populzai.
 Last week, the clan's latest leader, Hamid Karzai, said he had secured an agreement to reclaim Kandahar from the Taliban, and he is expected to lead Afghanistan's new interim government starting on Dec. 22. The Taliban's surrender ended two decades of exile for the Karzais, whose fate, perhaps more than any other Afghan family's, has been intimately tied to the ups and downs of Afghanistan's tumultuous history. 
 "It means a lot to us," Ahmed Karzai, the new leader's youngest brother and chief spokesman, said of the appointment.
He spoke last week here in this Pakistani city, where the Karzais, so tied to their land back in Afghanistan, have made a point of renting, never buying, the houses in which they have lived since 1981.
It was on a street corner near their gated compound here that, on July 14, 1999, Hamid Karzai's father was killed -- presumably by Taliban assassins who objected to the Karzais' anti-Taliban activities. After his father's burial in Kandahar -- even the Taliban did not try to deprive the head of the Populzai of a final resting place in his native soil -- tribal elders chose Hamid Karzai to be the successor.
Hamid Karzai became known as the "King of Kandahar."
Mr. Karzai was born in Kandahar in 1957, roughly in the middle of Mohammad Zahir Shah's reign, a period remembered by many Afghans with nostalgia. He grew up in Kabul, where his father served as speaker of the Parliament.
But the situation in Afghanistan changed significantly when he was in high school. The king went into exile in 1973 after one of his cousins, Sardar Mohammad Daoud, seized power, charging that the royal family was corrupt and declaring Afghanistan a republic.
Another coup followed -- along with a Marxist reform program inimical to the conservative traditions in Afghanistan and especially of its Pashtun ethnic group, which includes the Populzai. Changes in marriage practices and land reforms were pushed through. Traditional rulers, intellectuals and religious leaders were made targets, resulting in killings and prison terms.
The Soviets entered Afghanistan in 1979. But despite vast numbers of Soviet troops, pro-Soviet governments in Kabul never succeeded in establishing control outside the capital. 
It was during this period that the Karzais left Afghanistan, settling here in 1981. Countless Afghans gravitated to Quetta, a city close to the border with Afghanistan, and close in culture and spirit to the area of southern Afghanistan.
Exile sent the Karzai children -- seven brothers and one sister -- off on different paths. Hamid went to India where he earned two university degrees.
Ahmed left for the United States in 1983, to Chicago, where he opened the family's first restaurant a block away from Wrigley Field. He became a staunch Cubs fan.
"They were always good for business," Ahmed Karzai recalled.
The family opened more restaurants in Boston, Baltimore and San Francisco. Today, six of the eight siblings live in the United States.
But Hamid Karzai chose not to do so. According to a short biography printed by his family, he "joined Afghan jihad in 1982," eventually becoming a spokesman for a Pakistan-based mujahedeen group.
The Soviet occupation began attracting mujahedeen fighters from the Islamic world, including Osama bin Laden. In 1984, they began receiving broad assistance, in weapons and training, from the United States.
Hamid Karzai did not fight on the front lines, but found his role funneling covert American aid to the mujahedeen. It was the beginning of a relationship that would eventually lead a different generation of American policy makers to turn to him, two months ago, as their main ally in southern Afghanistan.
After the defeat of the Soviets, Mr. Karzai was appointed deputy foreign minister in 1992. But with the mujahedeen government contributing to the spreading anarchy in Afghanistan, he resigned in 1994.
It was around the same time that a radical Islamic movement began emerging from his hometown, Kandahar. The Taliban, as they called themselves, promised order and stability, a message that attracted many Afghans, including Mr. Karzai, who helped them from 1994 to 1995.
The Taliban had their roots in the same conservative Pashtun culture as the Karzais. But while the Karzais were Pashtun aristocrats with an international outlook, Taliban leaders were generally little-educated men who had not ventured much beyond rural Afghanistan and Koranic schools.
Mullah Muhammad Omar, for instance, was born in a village near Kandahar, a member of a little-known Pashtun clan called the Hotak. The son of poor, landless peasants, Mullah Omar's social position was the opposite of Mr. Karzai's.
Unlike Mr. Karzai, who met policy makers in Washington and testified before Congress, Mullah Omar was famous for almost never having left Kandahar and for almost never having met non-Muslims. In his years in power, Mullah Omar is said to have visited Kabul only twice.
In private, Pakistani officials, who have always kept a close eye on Mr. Karzai, describe him as intensely nationalistic and more secular than most Afghans. Indeed, Mr. Karzai -- who had to be pressured by his family to get married, in his 40's, to a doctor -- rejected the Taliban's extreme social and religious views.
"After he saw the Taliban as they really were, he cut all his ties in 1997," Ahmed Karzai said.
With the end of the cold war, the United States' interest in this region had greatly diminished. So Mr. Karzai struggled to rally international support against the Taliban, though American ears perked up whenever he mentioned that foreign terrorists had become ensconced in Afghanistan. Then the events of Sept. 11 and the latest war in Afghanistan changed Mr. Karzai's life.
Afghanistan was back in American minds. So was Mr. Karzai.
He slipped secretly into Taliban-held southern Afghanistan and slowly persuaded Pashtun tribal leaders to turn against the Taliban. He gave interviews to the BBC Pashto-language service to gather popular support behind him. 
"So many people are trying to rid the country of foreigners," he once said in an allusion to Mr. bin Laden and his Arab fighters. "I am trying to do the same." 
It was mostly through persuasion, not fighting, that Mr. Karzai was able to descend from Uruzgan province down to a town about 10 miles north of Kandahar, the last Taliban stronghold and the city built on his ancestors' land.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PRESIDENT; 
Jokes Remain, but Many Say Bush Is Showing Signs of War's Burden

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
He may be a wartime president, but President Bush was hardly solemn during a meeting at the White House with a handful of lawmakers last month, days after he threw out the first pitch of a World Series game at Yankee Stadium.
 "He said, 'I didn't know then that New Yorkers could wave with all of their fingers!' " recalled Representative Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican who is close to Mr. Bush. 
 "This is serious business," Mr. Blunt said of the burdens on the president, "but he has definitely not lost his sense of humor."
While he still cannot resist a joke or two (even ribald ones), dozens of friends and advisers who have spent time with Mr. Bush said in interviews that since Sept. 11 he has conducted himself far more seriously than he had before. 
Friends say that while Mr. Bush usually appears upbeat -- and is trying to convey a sense of normality -- the terrorist attacks and their aftermath have weighed on the 55-year-old president far more than the lowest moments of the grueling presidential campaign.
"It's aged the hell out of him," said Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, a Republican who for years has been close to Mr. Bush and his parents. "Look at his hair. Look at the lines on his face. It's incredible, the toll. He's the only guy in history who had to take lessons to get that smirk off his face. He's a jokester. But right now he's probably consciously trying to avoid that stuff. He sees the mortality of himself and others. The fact that he lives in a building where an airplane may have been heading to blow him up -- that would weigh on you enormously."
Describing the demands on Mr. Bush as unimaginable, Mr. Janklow said: "Good grief. He goes to bed at night not knowing when the next suicide idiot is going to blow himself up in the Middle East, in New York City or Timbuktu, Ind."
Given the solemnity of the times, several of Mr. Bush's friends say, he has restrained his natural jocularity but also sought a balance so as not to set too gloomy a tone.
"It's a little more somber when you're dealing with life-and-death issues instead of the patients' bill of rights," said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser. "I don't think the genuine warmth and charisma are gone. But being a wartime president means you're dealing with war. There's a clear command presence. When those admirals and generals leave the Oval Office, you can see they've been with the commander in chief."
Events have left Mr. Bush little choice but to rise to the challenge, but many loyalists say they are nevertheless struck by how much more comfortable and engaged he seems than three months ago.
In a White House that prided itself on punctuality and brevity in meetings and memos, aides say Mr. Bush has become even more businesslike and less patient with long-winded advisers. Meetings that in more tranquil times ran 45 minutes now often take about 20. But people who have met with Mr. Bush say he speaks intensely about his religious beliefs and what he views as his mission to guide the country through war.
While Mr. Janklow said Mr. Bush "will acknowledge the pressures" when asked privately, most of his friends say he conceals any stress he may have.
"Quite frankly, he's very low maintenance," said Marc Racicot, the former Montana governor whom Mr. Bush this week named as chairman of the Republican National Committee. "I've never seen him agitated or anxious. His heart is heavy for the pain, there's no question about that, but everyone's is."
Mr. Racicot said that when he and his wife, Theresa, had dinner with the Bushes a few weeks ago in the White House, Mr. Bush acknowledged that he was "moved by the extraordinary heroism" displayed on and since Sept. 11. But he said the president comfortably went on to chat about his twin daughters.
"He knows my children; I know his," Mr. Racicot said. "We just talked about the impossibility of raising young children. He has two daughters and I have three, and we were just commiserating about the challenge of 50-year-old fathers with 20-year-old daughters."
Some of Mr. Bush's friends say his strength lies in what he was often ridiculed for during the campaign: seeing the big picture and not delving into details.
"My personal view is that complexity in a leader is not a helpful thing," Representative Blunt said, "and certainly not a helpful thing in a crisis."
Mr. Bush's advisers insisted that he was quite engaged in the day-to-day war operations. But they conceded that he was not by nature as hands-on as presidents like Jimmy Carter, who during the Iranian hostage crisis was involved with such details as the number of helicopters needed for a rescue mission. 
Former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, a confidant of former President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, said the current President Bush had displayed a fortitude that comes from having overcome his drinking more than a decade ago.
"Once you've licked one of those things, there are no phantoms out there -- and you're ahead of the game emotionally," Mr. Simpson said.
White House officials and Mr. Bush's friends are extraordinarily sensitive to observations that the president has grown into the job. They argue that people never gave him enough credit during the campaign.
"All the doubters and cynics will say he's changed," said Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, chairman of the Republican Governors Association. "He's not changed. I'll argue that till death. What you see is what you get. "
Others who have known the president for years remarked about his maturation.
"If you look at pre-Sept. 11, he was getting his sea legs, he was dealing with a change in the Senate majority," said Gov. Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, a former senator. "He was realizing that it is a rough-and-tumble world of politics in D.C. He was experiencing for the first time that it is a contact sport. But the pressures of the terrorist attacks have really enhanced the maturing. All the potential was there; it's now harnessed into reality."
Recalling that Mr. Bush was a cutup at governors' meetings not so long ago, Mr. Kempthorne said the transformation had been striking. "At the National Governors Association meeting, he'd be one of us sitting at the table and there'd be a twinkle in his eye," he said. "You knew there was something he was thinking that would be humorous, always lighthearted. There's still going to be a joke, but it's followed by the harsh reality of what he's dealing with."
Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said the president did not display "quite as much of the hail fellow well met." At a recent meeting with some governors, Mr. Owens said, Mr. Bush displayed a new stature. "It wasn't our friend the president who used to be a governor," he said. "It was the president. We all looked at him a little differently that day, given what he was in the middle of."
When Mr. Bush does tease people, the subject often involves one of his passions, baseball. Just before Thanksgiving, on a trip to Fort Campbell, Ky., to buck up the 101st Airborne Division, Mr. Bush bounded out of his cabin on Air Force One to greet his guests, including Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky, a former major-league pitcher who is in the Hall of Fame. "The president appears in the cabin, very confidently, and there's Jim Bunning and the president says he threw a fastball at the World Series that Bunning would be jealous of," Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee recalled.
Despite the view -- not universally shared by his friends -- that Mr. Bush has aged visibly, he has been working out even more rigorously since Sept. 11. 
"The fact that he's running a seven-minute mile now attests to the discipline he's bringing to his whole life right now," said Mark McKinnon, Mr. Bush's chief media consultant during the 2000 campaign. "He has more snap, more energy, more focus." (Before Sept. 11, Mr. McKinnon said, Mr. Bush was 27 to 30 seconds slower.)
Mr. Bush is a better listener at meetings than he was before Sept. 11, aides say. Yet they also say he asks more questions, and sooner, in an effort to shorten meetings.
"He'll say, 'Let's move it along,' " said one of Mr. Bush's senior aides. 
After a recent meeting of the National Economic Council, the aide said he complimented Mr. Bush for prodding the participants into ending it 10 minutes early -- without their seeming to realize what he had done.
"He laughed and said, 'Don't tell anybody,' " the aide said.
Some of Mr. Bush's oldest friends say they regret that they have not heard from the president since Sept. 11. But, they insist, they understand.
"He doesn't write; he doesn't call," said a tongue-in-cheek H. Grant Thomas, who has known Mr. Bush since junior high school. "But somebody described him as the least neurotic person on the planet, and I think that's true. In terms of the big picture he has a sense of buoyancy, of calm, of focus, which comes in handy in a situation like this where it can be very easy to get confused and scared."

HEADLINE: Compressed Data; 
Tight Bandwidth Snarls Web Traffic in Middle East

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Information restrictions in the Arab Middle East are not always the result of government censorship. Network bottlenecks also play a role.
 It is well documented by now that one of the inconsistencies of the global economy is the skewed distribution of information technology. But the disparity may be most striking when it comes to communications bandwidth -- the basic information carrying capacity of a network to transmit phone calls and bits of data. 
 In the United States and Europe, the rapid expansion of fiber optic systems in the late 1990's resulted in a bandwidth glut, forcing some carriers into bankruptcy.
Increases in capacity extended to parts of Latin America and Asia, where undersea cables and intraregional links guaranteed healthy communications capacities. Analysts are even predicting an oversupply in the poorest continent, Africa. 
But the Arab countries of the Middle East, including those in North Africa, with a few exceptions, are facing a different problem, according to a report expected to be released today by Pyramid Research. In fact, the Middle East is perhaps the only region in the world with a bandwidth shortage.
Internet service providers across the region are already complaining that increases in bandwidth-intensive services like Internet-based telephone calls and streaming audio have resulted in congestion, according to Joseph Braude, an analyst at Pyramid, a telecommunications consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. 
The shortage is especially acute in Internet links between countries. For example, a computer user in Cairo who wants to listen to a sermon via streaming audio from a Web site in Qatar must use a connection that runs from Cairo to Amsterdam to Atlanta then back across the Atlantic into the Persian Gulf. The result is a painfully slow Internet connection.
Part of the problem stems from the reluctance of most countries in the Middle East to award multiple licenses to companies seeking to operate international Internet gateways, since most prefer to maintain domestic monopolies. By contrast, 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have abandoned such monopolies and are served by multiple international gateway licensees.
The most notable bandwidth deficiencies, according to Pyramid, are in Syria, Libya, Lebanon and Bahrain. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt have relatively ample supplies. 
Anticipating a relaxation of restrictions on international gateway access, a handful of companies including Cable and Wireless of Britain, Telkom South Africa and France Telecom are exploring ways to increase bandwidth in the Middle East. But it is not clear when or how the Arab governments might allow competition. SIMON ROMERO

HEADLINE: ARTS ONLINE; 
Making an Opera From Cyberspace's Tower of Babel

BYLINE:  By Matthew Mirapaul 

 BODY:
What is the sound of one hand chatting?
 Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin can answer this Zen-like riddle. For "Listening Post," their new artwork at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, they are monitoring the live activity in thousands of Internet chat rooms and message boards, then converting these public conversations into a computer-generated opera. 
 For instance a lone chatter occasionally heard in isolation might produce a bell-like tone, accompanied by a crisp British-inflected voice speaking the recently typed text. The musical backdrop is usually more complex, as computers analyze the chatter and convert that mass of statistical data into dense chords or a resonant drone that represents the underlying patterns in the online communication. 
At the same time "Listening Post" has been programmed to find the Net's most popular topics at any given moment. Specially written software culls related comments from diverse chat rooms and combines them musically into a chorus about President Bush, the economy or a certain hobbit movie. Mr. Hansen said, "You hear this wash of 30 to 40 voices, and you hear phrases, and it really does give you a sense of what's out there."
In addition to transforming this mundane material into music, "Listening Post" is meant to reveal the sheer magnitude of online discourse, a digital Tower of Babel. Mr. Rubin said, "There are an untold number of souls out there just dying to connect, and we want to convey that yearning. I hope people come away from this feeling the scale and immensity of human communication" on the Internet.
"Listening Post," part of the Next Wave Festival, is meant to be seen as well as heard. For its installation in the academy's Hillman Attic Studio (30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene), where it can be viewed through Dec. 16, the creators have erected a grid of 110 tiny screens that are normally used in cash registers. Here they display chat-session excerpts, which sometimes crawl from screen to screen and then erupt into a blitz of blinking teal text. (Although "Listening Post" is based on live Internet data, it is not being shown online. Project details, however, can be found on Mr. Rubin's Web site at Earstudio.com.)
"Listening Post" is the outcome of an unusual collaboration between Mr. Rubin, a New York artist, and Mr. Hansen, a statistician at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs research center in Murray Hill, N.J. In 1999 the Brooklyn Academy and Lucent held a two-day workshop at which artists and engineers could discuss possible partnerships, similar to the pairings of Bell Labs engineers and New York artists that produced a series of events in the 1960's called Experiments in Art and Technology.
The Rubin-Hansen team was formed after Mr. Hansen showed Mr. Rubin a 37-page, previously unpublished technical paper from 1974 on turning data into sound. It was written by Max Mathews, a pioneering computer musician who is one of Mr. Rubin's idols, and John Chambers, Mr. Hansen's laboratory mentor. At first Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hansen experimented with data from Lucent's Web site, assigning tones, timbre and rhythms to various kinds of online events. They found they could hear differences between the volume and the character of early morning and midafternoon traffic. The sounds told them for instance that visitors tended to linger more in the wee hours.
But data is the raw pigment of Internet-based art, and the Lucent site presented a limited palette. On the other hand, chat rooms were a ceaseless supply of material, both the content itself and the patterns and statistics associated with its ebb and flow. The artistic question for Mr. Rubin was, "How can we listen to those things and hear something new?" They began writing software to collect the raw data, and they modified the software program Max (named for Mr. Mathews) to turn the bits and bytes into appealing music.
Early last year the pair received one of the academy's three Arts in Multimedia grants. As the project progressed, they decided to add a visual element -- the grid of 110 screens -- to what had been an audio-only concept. "The quest grew from the question of how do we sonify data to how can we fully experience this particular data source," Mr. Rubin said. "Ultimately we found that in order to listen to it, we really wanted to see it at the same time."
Despite the artistic setting for "Listening Post," for Mr. Hansen the project represents serious research that may eventually yield a commercial product. For instance a Webmaster might use this system to monitor online activity, with discordant sounds signaling a problem that needs attention.
"Listening Post" is something of a coming-out party for the technically adept Mr. Rubin, who is 37 and a graduate of the M.I.T. Media Lab. Although he works frequently with some of New York's leading artists, he is rarely in the spotlight. But he has collaborated on major projects with the composer Steve Reich and the video artist Beryl Korot ("The Cave") as well as with the musicians Laurie Anderson and Arto Lindsay. He also designed the sound for the artist Ann Hamilton's entry in the 1999 Venice Biennale.
Among his work with the architectural firm of Diller & Scofidio was the eye-catching video-art project for the Midtown restaurant Brasserie. "He doesn't just come up with the solutions, he comes up with the problems," said Elizabeth Diller, a partner in the firm. "Artists are always surrounded by technical help, but it's formulating what the problems are that's the most significant thing."
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hansen, also 37, say they intend to continue their research collaboration, which they call "Ear to the Ground," when the "Listening Post" installation closes. It will also mark the end of the academy's Artists in Multimedia program, announced with fanfare last year. 
Although Lucent still pays Mr. Hansen to conduct research, the company yanked its grant support when it began to struggle financially, and the academy had to scramble to find funds to finish "Listening Post" and two other new-media projects.
Karen Brooks Hopkins, the academy's president, said she was disappointed that it had been forced to pull back from its commitment to new media in favor of the stage performances that are its core focus. "You've got a limited amount of money, and you've got to figure out where to put it," she said. 
Still, as "Listening Post" demonstrates, many Internet-based artworks contain a strong performance element. The Brooklyn Academy, with its history of presenting live events, would have made an ideal place for these new digital variety shows. Ms. Hopkins said she hoped funds could be found so such works could be scheduled in the future. Until then what is the sound of one BAM napping?

The Creativity Born of a Town in Texas

BYLINE:  By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
BEGINNINGS
A Memoir
By Horton Foote
Illustrated. 270 pages. Scribner. $24.
 As a playwright Horton Foote depicts people firmly rooted in time and place, but with his keen artist's eye he transforms a seemingly small slice of Americana into a microcosm. Theatergoers can connect with his characters as intimately as if they were members of their own family. 
 In his memoirs he applies the same principles that he does in his plays. Revealing but not confessional, indirect and understated, Mr. Foote has a beguiling sense of proportion. Intuitively he knows those moments that can never be forgotten. In the first book, "Farewell" (published in 1999), and in the current "Beginnings" he writes about himself and his extended family, about the town in which they lived and about its lingering effects on his life. In the new book, with his limpid prose and artfully reconstructed dialogue, he also writes about his quiet craving for creativity. 
"Farewell" transports us to the 1920's and his boyhood in Wharton, Tex., the real-life model of the fictional Harrison of his plays, and introduces the people who were to become the models for Lily Dale, Horace Robedaux and Mr. Foote's other memorable theatrical characters. At the end of that book he leaves home at 16, traveling to California to become an actor.
As "Beginnings" opens, it is 1932, and he is on a bus on the outskirts of Los Angeles, about to enroll as an acting student at the Pasadena Playhouse. These early pages resonate with innocence, as he learns more about life, and about art, as in that eye-opening moment when he sees Eva Le Gallienne in a touring production of "Hedda Gabler."
He remembers how he felt "not knowing what was going to happen, when I heard the pistol shot offstage and I learned she had killed herself." Writing 67 years later, he recalls the vividness and the immediacy of that first impression: "In a very fundamental way it changed my life. What I saw on the stage that night made me determined from then on to somehow spend my life in the theater."
This book is filled with the aspirations of youth, as Mr. Foote avidly pursues the art of acting, learning from all those who took time to teach him and all those he watched in performance. There are poignant glimpses of actresses like Rosemary Pinchot (a sudden star on Broadway who subsequently took her own life) and Pauline Lord, whose unsparing acting in "Ethan Frome" was to be another of Mr. Foote's theatrical milestones. One can sense that he is looking at plays as an actor and also as an incipient writer, wondering how a character can become so real onstage.
Recalling the eagerness and the longing, he recreates his days as a hopeful, often unemployed actor in New York. Resolutely, he keeps making the rounds. Despite rejections he never seems to lose his innate optimism and the joy that he feels when encountering the genius of others. In his book he etches illuminating vignettes of theater people and also of choreographers like Martha Graham, Louis Horst and Agnes de Mille, who were to play significant roles in his education.
It was several years before he moved from acting to writing, a shift that in the book seems almost casual, but is actually organic. He was always a good listener and observer and soon found that he was a natural storyteller and had a gift for finding drama in less than overtly dramatic events.
A one-act leads to a full-length play, "Texas Town," presented in an Off Broadway theater in 1941. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised the author and the actors for a "feat of magic" in conjuring "the waiting and idle atmosphere of a small town in Texas." For all the encouragement of the new playwright, Atkinson noted that one performance was off key, that of Mr. Foote, himself, who, he said, acted "without much talent and with no originality." Naturally, the author was stung by that criticism even as his plays began to open on Broadway.
While he was embracing his career as a writer, he was also to have one notable experience as a director. To support himself, he worked in a bookstore in Manhattan. One day a friend of his, a fellow playwright, told him he had finished "another uncommercial play." Mr. Foote read it, was very much taken with it and got his friend's permission to stage the last half in a directing class. That workshop might have led to a full production, but the play was optioned and two months later, under its new title, "The Glass Menagerie," it opened in Chicago and began Tennessee Williams's career. At Williams's invitation Mr. Foote saw the play's Broadway premiere, standing in the back of the orchestra.
As Williams was finding his own voice as a playwright, so was Mr. Foote, who looked to his past to discover his artistic provenance. The most definitive title of a Foote play is "The Road to Home." It was only by realizing that his principal subject was his as a birthright that he could fulfill his creative potential. In his long career he has written more than 60 plays, and, he says, "most of them are set in the Texas town I began writing about all those years ago."
The book ends with a valentine to his wife, Lillian, who died in 1992, and a brief mention of his work on live television and in films: he wrote the screenplays for "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Tender Mercies," among many movies. Quickly he sketches what for him were extraordinarily prolific decades. 
Mr. Foote is a vigorous 85 and there are, of course, more plays to come, and, one would hope, at least a third memoir, as he continues to expand his humanistic vision, welcoming his readers -- and his audiences -- to share his knowledge of essential home truths.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Concepts that once seemed far-fetched suddenly have a tantalizing whiff of attainability as chip researchers meet.

BYLINE:  By Barnaby J. Feder 

 BODY:
RESEARCHERS working on the microchips of the future see themselves entering a golden age. Even with the end in sight for their ability to squeeze more performance out of well-known silicon designs by shrinking transistors and other components, doors are opening wider for serious research into materials and designs that were once regarded as far-fetched.
 "Life is getting more difficult for the decision makers in the industry, the ones who make investment choices," said Krishna C. Saraswat, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University. "But for those who do research, it's become very exciting." 
 Current events intruded on the futuristic excitement last week in Washington, where chip researchers held their most important annual gathering, the International Electron Devices Meeting. The one-two punch of recession and fear of terrorism cut attendance to just over 900, about half what the meeting's organizers expected when they began preparations a year ago. And it took a last-minute surge in reservations to reach even that level, according to Judy Hoyt, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was general chairman of the year's meeting. 
There was so much uncertainty in the weeks leading up to the meeting that Ms. Hoyt created a spreadsheet with the names of the more than 200 researchers selected to present papers and organized a phone tree of organizing committee members to contact them and make sure they would attend. 
Among other effects, the low attendance cost the meeting's sponsor, the International Electron Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, several hundred thousand dollars. Industry leaders like I.B.M. had fewer promising graduate students to court. And researchers in rival academic and industrial programs missed out on many of the informal networking opportunities by which research programs cross-fertilize one another in ways that can never occur long distance.
For all that, though, the four-day session provided a broad snapshot of the exciting future Dr. Saraswat and others anticipate. I.E.D.M., as the meeting is known, covers engineering research that will have an impact on commercial products within two or three years, as well as topics that Jack W. Judy, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, described as "things that are just starting to become real."
That description certainly fit the opening talk in a session led by Professor Judy, in which Peter Fromherz, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, described his experiments in Munich trying to link microchips to brain cells. Many futurists have speculated about the potential benefits of monitoring or controlling brain behavior electronically -- not to mention the more mind-stretching reverse concept of machines being driven directly by human perceptions or thoughts. But Dr. Fromherz is among the few researchers actually trying to combine silicon and nerve cells into complete, if primitive, circuits.
Dr. Fromherz confessed later that he had harbored strong doubts about whether the chip designers would be interested in his work. Electrons zip through silicon circuits controlled by gates that are just scores of atoms wide, resulting in switching times measured in billionths of a second. Electrical signals in the brain, however, are triggered by movements of ionized molecules pumped through water in the nerves. The milliseconds that it takes a brain neuron to fire in response to such a signal seem like an eternity in the world of electronics. 
"These engineers are from a different solar system," Dr. Fromherz said of the chip researchers. Nevertheless, the room was packed with scores of them to hear Dr. Fromherz's report on progress in building circuits that can move voltage from a chip to a neuron in a manner that produces a measured response in subsequent neurons.
The smorgasbord of novelties included presentations on ways to design chips so that processing and memory functions that today are spread across the horizontal planes of a chip could be built vertically. "With 2-D, you eventually get dominated by connection problems, the way Silicon Valley is dominated by roads," Dr. Saraswat said. 
Other papers explored the prospects for replacing metal wire connections between chip components with optics; progress in creating light-emitting diodes on chips; and advances in chips that can form, move and analyze microdroplets of liquids. Such "microfluidic" chips might serve as efficient miniature laboratories for tasks like disease diagnosis, gene research, pollution assays and the mixing of novel chemicals. 
In one of 22 I.B.M. presentations, the company showed off a carbon nanotube transistor, in which researchers linked power components by a hollow tube of carbon atoms. At the same session, European, Korean and Japanese researchers presented papers that explored the challenges arising from experimental circuitry so small that the behavior of individual electrons -- either in wave or particle form -- controls how the device functions.
"Alternative structures were always a fun part of the meeting," said Paul Packan, manager of compact device modeling at Intel. "Now more and more people are going to those talks."
Despite the broader horizons, a primary goal for most researchers for many years will continue to be to develop ways to wring more gains out of industry's decades of investment in silicon structures. Recent advances, including several described in detail for the first time at I.E.D.M., make it probable that the industry can continue to double the number of transistors on a standard processor chip every 18 to 24 months -- the long-term trend known as Moore's Law -- through 2010.
But even the standard processor is presenting fascinating problems as its features shrink. Heat buildup and power leakage threaten to become unmanageable problems, forcing chip makers continuously to re-examine the implications of their research. 
One development at I.E.D.M. that caught many researchers' attention was an Intel chip design incorporating a layer of silicon dioxide, an insulating and power-saving compound that I.B.M. has championed. Among other benefits, the layer, placed between the bulk silicon substrate and the active components of the circuitry in the top layer of the chip, reduces the amount of charge that must be applied before the circuit switches on and, in some designs, blocks electrons from leaking out of storage when the circuit is inactive.
Intel's paper highlighted another function of meetings like I.E.D.M. -- namely, providing a relatively neutral and face-saving forum for leaders in the industry to signal their support for a technical development that someone else pioneered. Agreement by leaders like Intel and I.B.M. on any aspect of the technology future is something equipment and materials suppliers -- and researchers elsewhere -- ignore at their peril.

HEADLINE: Americans Urge Japanese To Move Fast on Bad Loans 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: GOTEMBA, Japan, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
Hours after Japan's Parliament gave final approval on Friday to a strengthened bad-loan agency, two visiting Bush administration officials urged Japan to use it for a quick attack on what they called the nation's main economic problem: a growing mountain of debt.
 "The massive overhang of nonperforming loans in the banking sector needs to be resolved swiftly and efficiently," said Kenneth W. Dam, the deputy Treasury secretary, at a Harvard Law School symposium at this resort town near Mount Fuji. The gathering, closed to reporters, drew 100 Japanese and American financial executives and academics. 
 R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the United States Council of Economic Advisers, gave a speech calling for the bad-loan agency to conduct "rapid purchases and equally rapid sales." He added, "There is no reason why purchases and sales should not begin immediately." 
The United States officials released copies of their speeches in Tokyo, saying they did so because the need for urgent action was so great. "The more quickly you can get those loans out the door," Mr. Hubbard said in an interview, "the better for the economy."
The American calls for action came as the International Monetary Fund is ready to start an assessment of Japan's finances this week. In a parallel investigation, the Financial Services Agency, the government watchdog agency, is studying the financial condition of the nation's 100 largest debtor companies. On Thursday, in what may be the first of several bankruptcies this winter, one of the companies, the Aoki Corporation, a construction company, filed for bankruptcy.
Measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, Mr. Dam said, Japan's bad-loan problem could be four to six times as large as the insolvency crisis that swept through the American savings and loan industry in the late 1980's. 
"Real assets -- be they real estate, capital goods or viable divisions of failed conglomerates -- must be put to effective use to revitalize Japan's economy," he said. "The process is far less important than the result: putting real assets back to work in the real economy."
Under legislation approved Friday, the agency, called the Resolution and Collection Corporation, will be allowed to buy bad loans at market value, with the goal of disposing of the loans within three years.
Separately, in Sapporo on Saturday, Taku Yamasaki, secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said he wanted the agency to buy about $8 billion worth of bad loans. But some bank economists in Tokyo calculate that Japan's bad loan total is more than 100 times that amount. Just through March, Japan's 14 biggest banks plan to book loan loss charges of $51.5 billion.
In Gotemba, the participants emerging from discussion sessions warned that Japan's new agency could prove to be slow, underfinanced and subject to political pressure.
"There is nothing in the new legislation that forces the R.C.C. to dispose assets into the economy," said L. William Seidman, a Morgan Stanley debt adviser who was chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation at the time of the savings and loan crisis in the United States. "Are they creating a warehousing company or a resolution company?"
Wilbur Ross, a New York-based financier who specializes in turning around bankrupt companies, called for a one-year limit for the new bad-loan agency to dispose of assets. "You can have a bottle of wine sitting in a cave, and it gets better," he said. "That is not the case with a loan."
Others questioned whether the new agency would have the financing or the staff to make much headway. From a staff of 20 to 30 today, the expanded agency needs "an army of 1,000 experts," said Robert H. Dugger, managing director of Tudor Investment Corporation, a fund management company.
"They need staff on a significant scale," he said, repeating points he made in a speech here today, "they need to fund it significantly, they need to set a limited life. Loans need to come in; loans need to go out. And there needs to be protection for the staff from political pressures."
Hugh T. Patrick, director of Columbia University's Center on Japanese Economy and Business, said that with representatives of the Tokyo operations of Goldman, Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter saying here that they were interested in working on distressed debt, the government should use private incentives and market forces to clear away the bad debt.
As United States investment bankers streamed out of discussions with Japanese officials, Mr. Patrick said that foreign debt liquidators would be less vulnerable to political pressure. "This is why they want the Morgan Stanleys and the Goldman Sachs to come in," he said. "They can be the foreign hired guns."
Mr. Hubbard, the Bush administration economist, said the same thing, although more diplomatically. He argued in his speech that the loan agency "should not seek to become a key player in corporate workouts -- its role should be limited to rapid purchases and equally rapid sales."
Hakuo Yanagisawa, a cabinet minister who runs the Financial Services Agency, addressed the group on Friday night. Although a text of his speech was not released, people who heard it said he restated the current government policy: no more bank bailouts, new limits on deposit insurance in April and faster liquidations of bad bank loans.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Making sure that search engines give a site a nice perch on their page. Some companies have ideas.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
HEADING into the home stretch of the holiday e-tailing season, millions of consumers will once again rely on search engines to help find the items they want.
 According to the Internet consultancy Jupiter Media Metrix, 59 percent of online buyers start at least some of their shopping excursions by typing a product name into a search site. For portals that double as search sites, like Yahoo, MSN and AOL, the shopping urge means huge numbers of visitors. 
 And for the merchants trying to put their links to the top of the search listings, it can mean huge headaches.
Jockeying for position at the top of the search results "is very important, but it's also a nightmare," said Chris McCann, president of 1-800-Flowers.com, a floral and gift retailer. "The more you get into it, the more it drags you." 
The process has devolved into a cat-and-mouse game in recent years, with retailers trying to crack the search criteria of the most popular engines, so they can design their pages in ways that will catch the search engines' attention.
But those criteria constantly change, analysts say. A typical search engine scans the Web every day, taking snapshots of Internet sites and keeping that information in a massive database. When someone types a search for "flowers," the engine will scan its database and return results based on a formula -- the number of times "flowers" appears on a Web page, say, or the number of pages on the site with that word in the title, or some such combination.
Technologies and businesses have emerged to help e-tailers game the system. "A lot of them will promise to get you in the top 10 of the search results, but we've always been pretty skeptical of the results they give," said Marissa Gluck, an analyst with Jupiter Media Metrix, an Internet research and consulting firm.
Cynics say the search engines have good reason to make it hard to decode their search criteria. By doing so, they create a market for themselves for so-called paid listings and paid placement that enable Web sites to increase the chances -- or guarantee -- that their links will appear at the top of the search results.
Ms. Gluck, of Jupiter, said she did not necessarily see a conspiracy at work, but she does see merchants and marketers rushing to paid listings in much greater numbers than in years past. 
The paragon of this business model is Overture, formerly known as GoTo.com. The company, based in Pasadena, Calif., serves nearly 50,000 client advertisers, according to Ted Meisel, its chief executive. Those companies bid for placement in the search results that consumers type into the Overture.com site, as well as Yahoo, AOL, Alta Vista and others.
On Yahoo, for example, a few Overture search results appear atop those generated by the Google search engine, which delivers a broader array of Yahoo's search results. Overture pays an undisclosed amount to its partner sites or lets them share in the revenue gleaned on every click.
Overture shares nothing, of course, when consumers go directly to its site to conduct searches. ExtraTouchFlorists.com bid $3.23 last week to appear atop Overture's listings. Each time someone clicked on that listing, ExtraTouchFlorists.com, which helps consumers locate local florists, paid Overture that amount.
Transactions like these have helped Overture reach profitability in recent months, in an environment where many other advertising-dependent Internet companies are on life support. Overture, which is publicly traded, earned $9 million in the third quarter on $73 million in revenue, and Mr. Meisel said he expected better results this quarter.
Danny Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch.com, a site that tracks the search engine industry, said there was a clear reason for Overture's gains. "The money that's going to them had been going to banner ads and portal partnerships and those sorts of things," he said.
After the Internet bust and the onset of the recession, companies became less willing to commit to advertising deals that could not guarantee results. But businesses that appear in the search listings of Overture or LookSmart, a competitor, only pay the listing fee if someone clicks on the link. 
"Marketers are realizing that search engines deliver a targeted audience that converts well" into buyers, Mr. Sullivan said.
According to Ms. Gluck, "Customers tend to focus on search results rather than the advertisements that surround the listings."
The retailer Brookstone, which sells unusual gifts and tools on the Web, through catalogs and 245 retail stores, is using Overture to good effect, according to Gustavo Pena, Brookstone's director of marketing communications. Mr. Pena says customers who come to the site from Overture's partners actually buy goods at a much higher rate than Brookstone expected, though he declined to be specific.
Brookstone bids on 10 search terms on Overture, including the store name, and others like Tempur-Pedic, the brand name of a mattress the company sells. Brookstone bid less than 7 cents per click last week, and fell to number 27 on the search results. The top bidder, HealthyBack.com, paid 73 cents per click. 
The company benefits from its relationship with Overture in other ways, Mr. Pena said. Overture works with its clients to help determine the search terms that best lead customers to the company -- "gifts for men" is better at yielding Brookstone customers than "men's gifts," for instance. 
Brookstone has, in turn, given that information to a search engine consultant, @Web Site Publicity, which has helped improve the company's standing even with search engines that do not use the bidding system. 
Ms. Gluck says such services show that search engine consultants, while they can sometimes inflate their claims, can be instrumental. Even businesses that bid for search placement can use outside help, she said, from companies like Newgate Internet, which, among other things, automates the process of tracking and bidding.
Mr. McCann, of 1-800-Flowers.com, said his company had succeeded fairly well so far with the search engines, despite the fact that it had not yet bid for placement. He said that earlier this year the company earlier began using technology from Inceptor, an online marketing company, that has reduced the number of hours his staff must spend testing the search engines to see where 1-800-Flowers shows up, and tweaking the site's design to affect those listings.
Mr. McCann said he would like to test the bid-for-placement search engines, but had reservations. He was not more specific, other than to say he was unsure whether some of those sites infringe on his company's trademark if they allow another company to bid for the search term "1-800-Flowers."
An Overture spokesman, Jim Olson, essentially ruled out such a possibility, saying that if a company bid on a term that was a trademarked name of another company, such a bid would only be accepted if the content on the bidding company's site was relevant to the trademark holder -- not as simply a gambit for siphoning off a rival's traffic. 
In any event, at the current price of roughly $3 for the "flowers" search term, Mr. McCann said he would probably sit out the bidding on that term, at least. He said that even assuming that 10 percent of the people who clicked on that link would actually buy something -- an optimistic assumption -- "You're paying $30 for a sale, which isn't very cost effective."

HEADLINE: Patents; 
Some inventions for the season of gift giving, including how to pass along virtual fruitcake.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
MARK TWAIN once observed that the gift-giving pressures of the December holidays bring "harassment and dread to many excellent people." Twain (who was an inventor as well as a writer -- his hottest idea being the scrapbook, which he patented in 1873) might have embraced a patent that was issued last month to RichFX, a company that make 3-D video graphics. It has headquarters in Manhattan and Israel.
 RichFX has patented the concept of virtual gift exchanging. "The idea is that you get a gift online before it is actually shipped, and then you can decide, 'No, I don't want this,' or 'I want it in a different color' and then exchange it," said Tal Kerret, RichFX's chief executive. 
 The patent, Mr. Kerret said, covers not only exchanging a gift, but also the digital acceptance of a virtual gift.
Christmas shoppers who procrastinate would be able to call up a retail site on Christmas Eve and have the virtual gift -- or, rather, an image of the gift -- arrive via e-mail to a recipient on Dec. 25.
"So my aunt on the West Coast gets the gift online right on Christmas and she feels happy -- even though I didn't actually get around to picking it out until the day before Christmas," Mr. Kerret said. The recipient has "the feeling of getting the gift," he said. "It's different from a gift certificate. It's not impersonal." 
Is the online retailing world likely to protest that such a concept is so obvious that it shouldn't be patentable? After all, Amazon created a furor when it patented its one-click shopping.
Andrew Riddles, a partner with Morgan & Finnegan, a New York law firm specializing in intellectual property, which is not affiliated with RichFX, does not necessarily expect an outcry over the patent, No. 6,321,211.
"I don't see anything in this that makes me sit bolt upright and say, 'Hmmm, this is very unusual,' " he said. "The way our economy has evolved, we're inventing new ways of doing things. These types of patents are becoming more and more prominent."
The gift-exchange feature probably will not be in place on any retail site before next holiday season. But the behind-the-scenes technology developed by RichFX -- compression software that permits quick transmission of 3-D streaming video and graphics over low-speed connections -- is already being used by online retailers, including Gift.com, Neimanmarcus.com, Coach.com, and Spiegel.com. 
RichFX, whose software media player is distributed by RealPlayer, received a patent in October for that technology. The company contends that its files take up only 10 to 70 percent of the bandwidth required for files sent with Shockwave, a competing product.
Arye Sachs, an inventor and businessman in West Hempstead, N.Y.,, has also been meditating on the possibilities in online gift giving. His patent, No. 6,240,397 should intrigue thrifty gift-givers.
Mr. Sachs envisions software for retail sites that allows someone to buy the equivalent of a gift certificate. The recipient does not receive an e-mail message with a dollar amount, however. Rather, the recipient is given a choice of gifts -- none of which has a price tag attached.
If the giver is willing to spend up to $500, for example, the recipient would be allowed to choose from presents that range in price from $50 to $500. If the recipient chooses the $50 item, the giver gets back $450.
Mr. Sachs said that he had done market research offering one of three gifts: a Palm organizer, a designer pen and a silk tie. Even though the Palm would actually sell for less than the other two items, most people chose it, he said.
"My theory is that the ultimate gift is what you need now," he said. "A thousand dollar gift is a worthless to you if you don't want it. If I take a friend to the restaurant, he is not going to choose a five-pound lobster just because I'm paying for it." 
Mr. Sachs's patent also covers another concept: recycling unwanted gifts.
Does this mean that a virtual fruitcake could be passed on from giver to giver for eternity? Yes. "If you don't like the gift when you look at it," he said, "you can have it sent right away to someone else."

Workers Paying Bigger Part Of Their Health Care Costs
Employers nationwide are requiring workers to pay a larger share of their medical costs, according to a national survey to be published today by the William M. Mercer consulting firm.
 Some health economists say the added costs will make consumers more cautious about medical spending. But the cost shift has had little discernible effect yet on surging health care inflation. Page C6.

HEADLINE: Employees Are Shouldering More of Health Care Tab 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Employees at the Valencia Technical Service, a small business in northern Los Angeles County, used to pay $25 each time they saw a doctor in their managed care network. California Blue Cross picked up the rest of the $80 or more of charges. But since January, the Valencia workers, who refurbish and sell used medical equipment, have had to pay the first $250 of total charges.
 Moreover, even after paying the $250 deductible, their cost for a doctor visit rose 20 percent, to $30. 
 Employers nationwide are requiring workers, like those at Valencia, to pay a larger share of their medical costs, according to a national survey to be published today. 
Some health economists say the added costs will make consumers more cautious about medical spending. But the cost shift has had little discernible effect yet on surging health care inflation.
Forty percent of large employers, those with 500 or more employees, said they would require workers to pay a higher portion of the total cost in 2002, according to the survey by the William M. Mercer consulting firm. The survey classified small employers as those with 10 to 499 workers.
The survey, based on a national sample of 2,800 large and small employers, said cost increases averaged 11.2 percent, to $4,924 for each employee in 2001. Company officials expected an even steeper increase, 12.7 percent, in 2002.
The averages smoothed over previously reported increases of as much as 100 percent for some small employers.
For large employers, costs rose 12.1 percent, to $5,162 for each employee. In the higher-cost New York metropolitan area, spending by large companies rose 10.6 percent, to $5,775 for each employee. New York employers also said they were bracing for an increase of about 12 percent next year.
In the most popular type of managed care, preferred provider networks, at least half the nation's smaller employers had deductible charges of $500 or higher this year, double the $250 median in 2000. Workers at one in six small companies faced even higher deductibles: $1,000 or more.
In line with the trend, Pacific Health Advantage, a purchasing coalition of 11,000 small California employers, offered workers a choice of preferred provider plans for the first time this year, with a $500 or $1,000 deductible, said John Grgurina, executive director of the group, a unit of the Pacific Business Group on Health. The coalition also offers an array of health maintenance organizations and other managed plans. 
Not all employers are dealing with cost increases by raising deductibles, of course. Workers at many small companies in The Alliance, a business coalition in Denver, will pay $850 next year each time they are admitted to a hospital, up from $100 in the coalition's current standard H.M.O.
Tom Rockers, chief executive of The Alliance, said that by increasing deductibles and other payments, employees will think harder and become "more judicious buyers." But some health care experts said financial barriers could lead people to postpone needed treatment, adding to costs later.
Taking another tack, Gnossos Software Inc., a small company in Washington, will start charging employees $600 a year on Jan. 1, to pare down a 20 percent rate increase from its insurer. The company did that "rather than switching to a plan with a higher deductible," said Steve Kantor, president of Gnossos. 
But many employers, burned by medical costs rising at least twice as fast as general inflation, are trying even more stringent approaches. 
Seventeen percent of all employers in the survey said it was "somewhat or very likely" that within the next two years they would introduce a new type of health plan that could shift more of the costs to people who have several thousand dollars of medical costs. Healthy workers would receive a bonus credit for future medical spending. 
In these plans, people typically pay the full cost of care, including prescriptions, first using an employer-provided health savings account. When the account is exhausted, they have to use their own money until they reach a deductible threshold, after which traditional preferred provider coverage takes over. After they spend an additional $1,000 or so, they are fully covered.
Accelerating medical inflation in uncertain economic times may be "an early warning sign to put employers and insurance carriers on notice that if managed care doesn't deliver on its unfulfilled promise, they may have to fight this battle on another front," said Barry Schilmeister, a benefits consultant in New York with Mercer.
"Are we going to see another suggested solution around universal national health care, like we faced in 1993?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Recovery and the Reluctant Consumer 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
As the ritual of end-of-the-year forecasts begins, Wall Street's legions of economists are lining up to predict the recession's imminent end. With signs emerging that manufacturing orders and business investment are starting to perk up, all that is needed, the optimists say, is for consumer spending, which has held up better than in past downturns, to improve just a little. All will then be well.
 But one group of people may have a different idea: American consumers themselves. Though many still want to spend, the earnings gains that fuel buying are slowing and the fat bonuses that upper-income households have come to depend on around the new year are going to be much leaner. With unemployment mounting rapidly and salary freezes increasing, plenty of people have reason to keep spending tight and their credit cards under control. 
 "I still think consumers are being very, very selective in their purchases," said Robert L. Nardelli, chief executive of Home Depot. "I don't see all of a sudden a switch in which the frugality is gone." 
Indeed, holiday shopping so far has been even more disappointing than anticipated. And the one clear piece of good news in consumer purchases -- the stunningly high automobile sales of the last two months -- has a dark lining to it. Once car companies stop offering the profit-sapping zero-interest financing that has lured buyers into the showrooms, sales are likely to drop sharply.
Certainly, there are still significant factors at work that should help counter these forces and buoy the economy next year. Low energy prices are saving people millions of dollars every day, money they can spend on products and services that employ Americans. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates for the 11th time this year when it meets tomorrow. Auto production is scheduled to expand to rebuild depleted inventories and housing activity remains healthy.
With hopes rising that the recession, which began in March, could soon end, investors have sent stock prices and bond yields higher in recent weeks.
But the potential for weakness in consumer spending underscores the unusual nature of this recession and heightens the risks facing the economy in the next few months. Even after a recovery begins, chances are good that it will be slow in picking up momentum, many economists say.
"This is a period in which you are going to see a number of cross-currents," said Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a research group in New York. Even though she expects a recovery to begin soon, "I see it as much more of a slow-starting recovery," she said, in which joblessness continues to rise and most Americans consider the country to be in recession well after economists decide it officially ended. Fed officials have made similar comments in recent days.
A chief cause of the current recession has been the sharp decline in business spending, which has fallen as a result of the overcapacity caused by excessive investments in the booming late 90's. By contrast, household spending, while slower, has continued to rise this year.
This pattern is far different from the recessions that have occurred the last few decades. Such downturns almost always followed increases in interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to dampen inflation. That caused consumers to delay or cancel many purchases, setting off a wave of production cuts and assembly-line job layoffs.
Soon, however, Americans began buying again, and the pent-up demand for new houses, cars, kitchen appliances and other high-cost items helped the economy rebound.
This year, spending on such items has remained surprisingly strong, and there is probably less pent-up demand than at the end of previous downturns. As a result, consumer spending could be weak even as business investment recovers, some economists say.
"Simply put," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist at Hoenig & Company, "a boom in autos and housing is impossible from current levels."
Spending on less expensive items has already slowed, although the unusually warm weather last month could have temporarily depressed interest in things like sweaters, coats and scarves. Chain stores reported last week that their sales in November, adjusted to take account of differences in the calendar, were only 0.5 percent higher than in November 2000, according to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
That was an even smaller year-over-year increase than in September, when the terrorist attacks kept many shoppers at home.
"This is definitely a difficult economy, and that's not going to change in the near future," said Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated Department Stores.
That is coming from a company that was one of the few retailers with increased sales last month. At both J. Crew and The Gap chains, sales fell 25 percent compared with November 2000. At Men's Wearhouse, the decline was 15 percent.
The weak sales figures followed months of slowing salary increases. From the mid-1990's until early last year, pay increased at annual rates of 5 to 7 percent, according to the government's broadest measure of income received by working Americans. This summer, the rate fell to about 3 percent.
While rank-and-file workers are still benefiting from modest hourly wage gains, the overall measure -- which includes salaried employees -- dropped to zero between June and October, the most recent month for which the Commerce Department has published data.
And it is unlikely to pick up early next year, compensation experts say, because many companies are cutting back on salary increases for 2002 and on year-end bonuses, most of which will paid early next year. Because variable-pay plans are far more popular than they were a decade ago, when the United States was last in recession, the cutbacks could have an unusually big effect on the broad economy.
In 1990, only 47 percent of companies used at least one form of variable pay -- including bonuses, stock options, and stock grants -- according to a survey by Hewitt Associates, a human resources consulting firm. Last year, 78 percent did.
At many companies, workers are now experiencing the flip side of the raises and year-end checks of the booming late 90's. From 1996 to 2000, those pay increases helped consumer spending grow faster in the first three months of the following year, by an average of 0.8 percent, than it had in the previous two quarters, said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
In early 2002, said Mr. Roach, one of Wall Street's relatively few pessimists, pay cuts will limit household spending. "In a few weeks, people will hear the bad news," he said.
Already, Credit Suisse First Boston said last week that it was postponing year-end raises indefinitely. Merrill Lynch has frozen salaries until the middle of next year. Ford is requiring many workers to pay more of their health care costs and is not giving any merit raises to 2,000 executives.
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the nation's largest law firm, plans to pay year-end bonuses that are just a fraction of last year's. Another big New York firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell, told lawyers not to expect any bonus. Last year, many of the richest law firms paid bonuses of more than $50,000.
Over all, 55 percent of big companies have reduced the pool of money they set aside to pay bonuses, according to a survey by William M. Mercer, a consulting firm. Twenty percent already plan to hold down salary increases, 8 percent are lengthening the time between raises, and 2 percent are freezing salaries entirely, the firm said.
Steven E. Gross, the head of Mercer's employee-pay practice, said he expected that the reductions could become even greater once companies made the final, year-end comparison between their profits and their salary budgets.
"There's some wishful thinking going on," Mr. Gross said.
With so many people being asked to settle for little more than a nice pat on the back from their bosses this year, many executives are less optimistic than forecasters and investors are, and say that they will be happy to eke out modest gains until late next year. 
"I certainly don't feel that this is going to be a V-shaped recovery," Mr. Nardelli of Home Depot remarked.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Gives Budget-Cut Order to Argentina 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that it had agreed on the spending cuts needed from Argentina to get its loan program back on track and that it was awaiting action from Buenos Aires on that issue.
 A fund spokesman, David Hawley, said there were "fruitful discussions" with Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, but that specific cuts were not proposed. 
 News reports in Argentina suggested that the cuts could total about $4 billion, nearly 10 percent of the total spending foreseen in the country's draft 2002 budget bill.
Crisis-ridden Argentina was cut off from the monetary fund this week when the fund said it could not approve a vitally needed $1.3 billion December loan payment over issues related to the 2002 budget, further raising fears that the country would default on its $132 billion debt.
With local industries crumbling and unemployment surging above an estimated 20 percent, gathering the congressional support needed to make the cutbacks will be difficult. And despite widespread fears that the debt crisis might lead Argentina to devalue its peso currency, which would instantly bankrupt thousands of people, popular backing for further austerity is also very thin.

HEADLINE: Reading Putin's Mind 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: MOCKBA 

 BODY:
Last week, I induced the 19 NATO countries to count themselves as 20. That makes Russia officially part of the NATO military organization set up to defend Europe from Russia. We will soon have access to all the West's defense plans, and a strong say (in reality, a veto, though they cannot yet admit it) in every action it plans to take. 
 That also transforms the West's military alliance into a boiled-cabbage political bureaucracy that I can "consult" into impotence. No more attacks on Serbs over our objections -- we'll consult nyet and disrupt the consensus. 
 I read in The New York Times that my friend George and my friend Colin agreed to this Russian diplomatic triumph despite the protest of the warrior Rumsfeld. (Why doesn't George shut down that paper? I would in a minute. Revelation of internal struggle encourages opposition.)
Now I will permit NATO to welcome the Baltic states. I will pretend this is against the desires of my generals (hmm -- maybe that Rumsfeld protest was a trick) and by so approving, solidify my unwritten veto power. Of course, the other 19 nations don't need my approval, but the useful idiots of the West don't realize that. 
That came on top of what my generals call "Bush's Surrender at Crawford." The strategic deal I had agreed to with Bush beforehand in Shanghai was this: George would reduce his missiles all the way down to the number we could afford to equal, and in return, I would let him amend the ABM treaty so he could test a limited antimissile system. 
But at his ranch in Texas, smiling through all the strange food, I got the U.S. to cut its missile force down below 2,000 -- but didn't give the Americans an inch on ABM. I blamed my generals, which was disinformation, but how could Colin complain publicly? Wasn't I letting the Americans fly over Russia to get to Uzbekistan in our joint war on terror? 
Ah, the war. The world now forgives me for wiping out our Chechens because all those Muslims are terrorists. And didn't I score yet another personal triumph by sending our people into Kabul just after it surrendered, ahead of the Americans and British? The Russian people, who saw our return on TV, now believe we finally won our war in Afghanistan, with a little U.S. help at the end.
But George had better not carry this antiterror business too far by attacking Primakov's friend in Baghdad. Iraq owes us $8 billion for our arms shipments, and we'll never get that money if Saddam is out of power. Currently he's paying us for new weapons out of his oil smuggling, and if he uses our SAM's to bring down American gunships, that's not my fault. 
Oil. That has been the key to my economic success. After the Saudis, we are the world's largest producer of oil and gas, and have never been part of OPEC. George was so happy to see us pumping away, breaking the monopoly and bringing down prices. This fall's drop in oil prices was equivalent to a huge tax cut, helping stimulate the U.S. out of its recession.
But last week, I made a deal with OPEC to cut our production by a symbolic 150,000 barrels a day, and we're ready to reduce our output much more to help our Arab friends push up world prices. As the capitalists taught us: Sorry, George, business is business.
I felt I could do that without troubling the new personal trust between George and me. At the Crawford summit, he complained a little about my sale of nuclear materials to Iran, and he wished we would stop sending the best and hungriest Russian scientists to help the Iranians develop their bomb and multiple-stage rockets. I sympathize, but why stop? The ayatollahs pay in cash, and if Iran and Iraq -- and Israel -- want to fight wars, let them be equals.
Nothing beats an antiterrorist pose. I crushed my media critics. I neutralized NATO. My obliteration of Grozny is forgotten. I'm bringing prosperity to Russia by arming America's enemies and fixing prices with the oil cartel.
My friend George may be a little ahead of me in our nations' popularity polls, but I have this advantage: he's not president for life.

HEADLINE: Tourists Staying Away From Capital 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
Despite efforts to revitalize the tourism industry in the nation's capital, the closing of many federal buildings and monuments for more than two months has kept some visitors away and caused the loss of thousands of jobs at hotels, restaurants and airlines.
 One step toward addressing the problem came this weekend, when tours of the Capitol resumed. Tours had been scheduled for Wednesday, but the Capitol Police canceled them abruptly on Tuesday night. 
 Charlene Jarvis, the chairwoman of the Washington Convention and Tourism Corporation, said that opening the Capitol and the White House to the public would be "evidence that Washington, D.C., is welcoming to visitors." 
The White House is closed to the public indefinitely. This time last year the White House had about 3,500 visitors a day, officials said. 
While the Tourism Corporation reported last month that hotels were working at 68 percent of their capacity, outpacing the national average by 10 percent, many hotels had to take immediate action after Sept. 11 and lay off workers. 
About 24,000 workers in the area are now unemployed, said John Boardman, an executive for hotel and restaurant union employees. At a meeting of the workers' rights board this week, members of Congress and the City Council came together with charities to talk over solutions to help the unemployed.
Even at this time of year, when Washington is usually a big draw for tourists, the drop in the number of visitors has been so great that an official of Teamsters Local 922, Aaron Sawyer, said, "Over 75 percent of the work force at Tourmobile, which ferries tourists around town to view the monuments, have been laid off." 
Reagan National Airport, which was closed for three weeks, was the last airport to reopen after the attacks. It is offering flights to 20 percent of the usual destinations. Employees at rental car agencies, food servers and hotel employees are suffering from the dropoff. 
"I've lost everything I had," said Dorothy Hilliard, an employee of SkyChefs Flight Kitchen, who lost her job in September. 
Local efforts to increase tourism, like a recent tax-free shopping week, which resulted in a 1.7 percent increase in sales, may not be enough to save the tourism industry or help workers who have lost their jobs, city officials said. 
"Where I'm from, family and friends chip in support when you need it," said Kwesi Oginga, a bellman from Guyana who was laid off at the Washington Hilton. "Here in the U.S., I don't even know my neighbor." 
The Smithsonian Institution had fewer visitors, in part, said a museum spokeswoman, Vicki Moeser, because many people assumed incorrectly that it had been closed. 
Last month numbers were down by 46 percent, she said. Since many school groups visiting the White House and Capitol have been forced to cancel trips, Ms. Moeser said, they have also canceled their tours of the Smithsonian.

HEADLINE: States Calling For More Help With Medicaid 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
New York is helping to lead states in a nationwide effort to persuade the federal government to provide billions of dollars in additional aid to help the states cover the cost of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.
 The nation's governors are predicting that because of the slumping economy, at least four million more people will go on the Medicaid rolls in the next six months, even as states face budget shortfalls that are forcing them to reduce other services. 
 The federal government sets general Medicaid policy and pays for part of the program, with the states paying for the rest.
Medicaid is the largest, fastest growing part of nearly every state budget; on average, it accounts for about 20 percent of state budgets nationwide, according to analysts for the National Governors Association. 
Put another way, states spend nearly as much on Medicaid -- about $87 billion in the current fiscal year -- as they do on elementary and secondary education combined, the budget analysts say. The federal government contributed about $112 billion.
While it is too early to say how the federal government will respond, the governors and their allies see some encouraging signs. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, included a provision increasing Medicaid funding for states in the economic stimulus package his committee approved.
In the House, Gov. George E. Pataki is working with Republicans and Democrats on a similar plan to provide more federal Medicaid dollars for the states, according to his aides. The governors are seeking at least $5.5 billion in additional federal Medicaid funding for the coming year, with nearly $500 million of that for New York. Another version of the plan, being developed in the House, seeks even more money and would set aside about $1.5 billion for New York.
The issue is critical to New York, which has long had among the most expensive Medicaid programs of any state. The current price of Medicaid in New York is more than $30 billion annually, with the federal, state and local governments sharing the cost. The program serves about 2.8 million people.
In a measure of how seriously Mr. Pataki is taking the issue, he plans to travel to Washington this week to urge Congressional leaders to provide more Medicaid money.
"The growing state budget shortfalls in nearly every state will continue to be a major drag on economic recovery," Mr. Pataki said in a letter to members of Congress. "I urge that the final economic stimulus package build upon the existing federal-state partnership by including a temporary increase" in federal Medicaid funding.
The executive director of the National Governors Association, Raymond C. Scheppach, said that additional Medicaid dollars would be crucial for governors and state legislatures given that unemployment is expected to rise sharply in the next few months, even as tax revenues are declining in many states.
He said that the additional funding was the only proposal that the governors were pushing in the current Congressional debate over how to fashion an economic stimulus package for the nation. The effort to get more money -- which would require tinkering with the arcane Medicaid funding formula -- was recently endorsed in a letter that governors of both parties agreed to send to Congressional leaders, Mr. Scheppach said.
"The fiscal crisis in states is growing every day," he said, "and this change is the only federal policy that will provide relief to both the states and the millions of new Medicaid recipients we expect."
The nation's governors have considerable sway here in Washington. Policies advocated by the governors association resulted in the 1996 law that overhauled the nation's welfare system and moved millions of recipients off the public assistance rolls.
President Bush is a former governor of Texas, and Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary for health and human services, whose agency oversees the Medicaid program, was governor of Wisconsin.
Medicaid began in 1965 as a health program for the most desperately poor. But over the years, it was expanded to cover people with higher incomes, particularly in New York, which recently broadened its eligibility requirements to allow even more people to qualify.
The lobbying effort comes as the economic picture is growing increasingly bleak for many states. The states project budget gaps totaling $30 billion in the current fiscal year, according to budget analysts for the governors association.
"It's real bad out there," Mr. Scheppach said, adding that the looming increase in the Medicaid rolls would only make things worse.
In New York, which is reeling from the attack on the World Trade Center, the fiscal outlook may be even bleaker. Mr. Pataki's budget office estimates that the state may lose $9 billion in revenues over the next 18 months because of the attack, and he took the remarkable step of asking the federal government to compensate the state for such losses.
But Washington lawmakers have been cool to this proposal, saying that the federal government has never compensated localities for lost revenues in previous disasters. In that context, New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, says that the additional federal Medicaid money would be a way to offset New York's revenue losses without calling it a bailout.
"This proved to be a great alternative," he said. "This is another way to skin the same cat."
The states are bracing for even more bad news. The governors predict that the Medicaid rolls, totaling about 36 million people, could grow by 3 million people within six months if the unemployment rate reaches 6.5 percent, or 4 million if the jobless rate climbs to 7 percent. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the national jobless rate had climbed to 5.7 percent last month from 5.4 percent in October.
In the worst-case scenario contemplated by the governors, the new wave of 4 million Medicaid recipients would include 1 million adults, 2.6 million children and nearly 400,000 disabled people.

HEADLINE: French Bank to Buy United California 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
BNP Paribas of France agreed today to buy United California Bank from UFJ Holdings Inc. of Japan for $2.4 billion to expand its retail banking business in the Western United States.
 BNP Paribas, which is already acquiring the 55 percent of the BancWest Corporation of Honolulu that it does not already own, will become one of the biggest banks in the region after the acquisition, with 1.5 million customers, 370 branches and a staff of 8,000, Paribas said in a statement. 
 Japanese banks have been selling overseas assets over the last two years to bolster finances as they write off record bad loans and try to weather a deepening recession at home. UFJ is the world's sixth-largest bank, formed by a merger between Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank and Toyo Trust and Banking. 
United California Bank, which is based in Los Angeles, has 117 branches and $11 billion in assets. The banks plan to complete the transaction by the end of March.

HEADLINE: Australian Miner Accepts Offer 

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Monday, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
The board of Normandy Mining, Australia's largest gold producer, accepted an offer from the Newmont Mining Corporation today that values the company at about $2.2 billion. The deal could be the final piece of a three-way merger with the Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation of Canada, which would create the largest gold producer. 
 The deal points to the continued consolidation in the mining industry at a time when commodity prices have slipped and the quest for economies of scale has taken on increasing significance. 
 Newmont, based in Denver, added $367 million in cash to its offer, topping the latest bid from a rival bidder, AngloGold, by about 15 percent. Normandy's board recommended that shareholders accept Newmont's offer. 
By sealing the deal, Newmont obtains access to rich and relatively low-cost gold mining operations in western and northern Australia and exposure to a country seen as politically less risky and operationally less complex than other gold mining regions, like South Africa. The company plans to complete the deal early in 2002. 
Once the merger was complete, the company would be one of the largest in terms of gold reserves, with 97 million ounces. Its annual production would swell to 8.2 million ounces a year. 
Normandy's board had been expecting Newmont's next move in the takeover tussle to come this week. The directors, who had delayed responding formally to AngloGold's latest offer, told the Australian Stock Exchange that they expected to advise shareholders by Dec. 13. 
Newmont's proposal values Normandy at about 1.90 Australian dollars (98 cents) a share. The winning bid is near the top of the value range set by an independent report from Grant Samuel & Associates.
That price makes it less likely that either AngloGold or another suitor will try to top it, said Stuart Dodd, portfolio manager at Rothschild Australia.

HEADLINE: In Louder Voices, Iranians Talk of Dialogue With U.S. 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
For 22 years, and as late as this week, chants of "Death to America" have been used to rally the Islamic revolution's faithful at the Friday Prayers. 
 But in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States and the subsequent war in Afghanistan, a rhetorical countercurrent is gathering strength here. 
 Talk to America.
For the first time since the United States severed relations with Iran in 1980, officials here are openly pushing for a resumption of dialogue. For now, they say, it should be over Afghanistan, but they also describe Afghanistan as only a means to the end of eventually resuming relations. 
In the press and on the street, there is an increasing boldness about arguing the merits -- seen as primarily economic -- of talking. Members of Parliament openly discuss their desire for a dialogue, and have established a parlimentary committee to push for one. An adviser to President Mohammad Khatami wrote an article calling for him to sit at the negotiating table with President Bush over Afghanistan. 
Even a leading conservative, Moshen Rezai, the secretary general of the powerful Expediency Council, has acknowledged the two countries' common interests in Afghanistan and obliquely suggested that better relations might be possible were the United States to take the first step. 
"There is a new discourse for relations with America," said Ahmad Bourghani, a member of Parliament. 
But discourse is both everything and nothing here. It can signal a fundamental policy shift. But given the country's consitutional structure, in which appointed clerics have far more power than elected representatives, it can demonstrate the powerlessness of those seeking such a shift to effect it.
Relations with the United States have become one more political weapon in the pitched battle between reformers, who tend to favor relations, and conservatives, who at least publicly oppose them. As reformers intensify their calls for dialogue, conservatives step up their opposition, and some reformers say conservatives may try to stall any improvement in relations to prevent reformers from getting credit. 
Similarly, there is resistance in the United States to any improvement of ties with Iran. The United States believes that Iran is developing weapons of mass destruction including, with Russia's help, nuclear weapons. While it is not clear whether Iran still harbors terrorists, the country has not disavowed support for groups like the radical Palestinian group Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Iran, which bristles every time it makes the annual State Department list of countries that support terrorism, argues that it does not define such groups, which it sees as engaged in a struggle against an occupying force, as terrorist.
Iranian reformers are also ruffled by the rhetoric of those American policy makers implacably opposed to improving ties with the current Iran. Richard Perle, a Pentagon adviser, recently said: "We should be doing everything we can to encourage the centrifugal forces in Iran that, with any luck, will drive that miserable government from office." 
Mahmoud Shamsolvaezin, a journalist and political analyst, likened the ties between Washington and Tehran, which was ruled for decades by a pro-American shah put in place with the Central Intelligence Agency's help, to a long-lost marriage in which both partners harbor lingering tinges of passion.
"The relationship between Iran and the United States is like the relationship between two lovers who've broken up 20 years ago," he said. "Just based on ideological reasons, the two countries seem unable to resolve their problems." 
Before Mr. Khatami traveled to New York last month for the United Nations General Assembly, for example, Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, delivered a harsh attack on those calling for closer ties with the United States, saying anyone who did so was unfit to hold office. Many people interpreted that as a warning to Mr. Khatami not to talk to American officials. 
Soon after, the leader of Iran's judiciary created a legal committee to deal with members of Parliament and other political officials if they call for starting dialogue with the United States, although it is not clear whether anyone has actually been called before the committee yet. 
There is certainly a radical faction of conservatives who see opposition to the United States as essential to their political survival. 
Others are believed to fear that a renewal of economic ties, and the resulting influx of American products it would probably bring, could undermine the economic control they have amassed since the revolution via government-controlled monopolies. 
Some conservatives, on the other hand, secretly favor closer ties, believing that they would profit economically.
Close watchers say that even Ayatollah Khamenei's position is more complicated than it might appear. Two recent developments, they say, almost certainly had his approval: a dinner meeting between Iran's representative to the United Nations and members of the United States Congress, and the dispatching of Khamal Kharrazi, the foreign minister, instead of his deputy, to the second meeting of the six countries bordering Afghanistan, the United States and Russia. Yet another sign: Mr. Kharrazi shook hands there with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
Some say that were Ayatollah Khamenei to allow any talks with the United States, it would mean conceding the failure of an Islamic revolution built in large part on opposition to the "Great Satan." As the writing outside the former American Embassy here says, "On that day when the United States of America will praise us, we should mourn." 
And yet, the chants of "Death to America" were temporarily halted in the two weeks after Sept. 11.
Such abrupt shifts have been made before. Most notably, in 1988, Ayatollah Khomenei ended the Iran-Iraq war after previously vowing that Iran would fight to the death. That reversal was made more palatable by the fact that public opinion strongly favored ending the war. The same may hold true now, since conversation suggests that most Iranians favor talking to the United States.
That does not mean, of course, that they have forgiven the United States for what they see as its sins, most notably the downing of an Iranian civilian aircraft in 1988, killing all 290 people on board. Attitudes in Iran may have progressed from animosity to aggrievement, but the aggrievement is strong. 
Iranians believe that they have been given too little credit and no reward for their behavior toward Afghanistan. They point out that they opposed the Taliban from the start, and have borne the burden of some two million refugees and the flow of drugs from an unstable neighbor.
When the American bombing began, the Iranians sealed their border to prevent a new flow of refugees, certainly, but also to close off a potential Taliban escape route. They have provided the coalition with intelligence on the Northern Alliance, played a constructive role at last week's conference in Bonn on forming a new transitional government, and want to participate in Afghanistan's reconstruction. 
In return, officials here thought that they would at least hear talk of sanctions being lifted, or of the Caspian Sea oil pipeline being allowed to pass through Iran. "There was and still is the expectation that the United States would take more significant steps because Iran has taken steps totally in the interests of the Afghan people," Mr. Bourghani said. 
There is a sort of stunned disbelief here that Pakistan, which so clearly backed the wrong horse in Afghanistan, is now reaping the benefits of reversing its stance. Indeed, the events after Sept. 11 have done much to feed Iran's sense of injustice. 
Iranians resent being repeatedly placed on Washington's list of states that sponsor terrorism. "It is very obvious which countries have been sponsoring terrorism, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates," said Abdullah Ramazaanzadeh, who sits in President Khatami's cabinet, and wrote the article calling for Mr. Khatami and Mr. Bush to negotiate over Afghanistan. "If America had close relations with these countries, what is the reason not to have them with Iran?"
If Iran is such a strong supporter of terrorism, even ordinary Iranians ask, why was it that 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 came from Washington's ally, Saudi Arabia? Why is that Iranians, and not Saudis or Pakistanis, who travel to the United States are fingerprinted like criminals? 
Iranian officials are also angry that American courts have allowed former hostages in Lebanon to bring cases against Iran. In response, the government has set up its own special court, at the former American Embassy, to open cases for Iranians who say they were damaged by the United States-backed coup in 1953. 
Reformers also say Iran should be given more credit for being a Muslim country with a democratic movement and a populace that, despite its leadership's rhetoric, has evidenced little anti-American sentiment. Some reformers say that American officials see the push for more democracy in Iran as a threat to their military and economic interests in countries like Saudi Arabia, where greater democracy would likely mean a turn against the United States.
The problems posed by rapprochement can be seen in the new, tentative closeness between Iran and Britain. Since Sept. 11, the British foreign minister, Jack Straw, has visited Tehran twice -- the first visits by a British foreign minister since 1979. 
While the two countries did not agree on everything, Mr. Straw and Mr. Kharrazi have since maintained a cordial dialogue. President Khatami and Prime Minister Tony Blair have also spoken by phone, and last week Mr. Khatami spoke warmly about the improving relationship between the two countries.
Then came Mr. Blair's comment, in response to a question in Britain's Parliament on Wednesday, that countries like Iran would have to renounce their support for terrorism before they could think about a new relationship with Britain. The comments caused a furor here, with the foreign ministry summoning the British charge d'affaires to express displeasure. 
Ayatollah Khamenei made a blistering attack on Britain at this week's Friday Prayers. No country, he said, "has had such a terrible or bloody record in this region." Having lost its political credibility, he said, Britain had become a puppet of the United States.
"Death to America," the crowd chanted.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: BUSINESSES; 
RIPPLES OF SEPT. 11 WIDEN IN RETAILING

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
On West Eighth Street in Greenwich Village, shoe salesmen stand forlornly on the sidewalk in front of Leather&Shoes.com, smoking cigarettes and staring blankly into the distance, wondering where all the customers have gone. 
 Down the block, Raja Chaani, the manager of India Imports, and two of his employees sit on stools in a sprawling space chock-full of leather jackets, silk scarves and Indian curios -- but devoid of customers. 
 Across the street, at Man Plus, Sonny Shahani and three other salesmen spend their time rearranging sweaters and calculating how much their commissions have fallen. And at House of Nubian, no one but a few Internet shoppers is buying Negro League jackets and hats, or buttons with pictures of black leaders like Malcolm X and Haile Selassie.
While it was expected that small businesses near the site of the World Trade Center would suffer from the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, which displaced 100,000 potential customers from office buildings in the area and thousands more from their homes, wider economic damage from the attack is still rippling outward from ground zero. 
The national economy, of course, was already slowing before Sept. 11. But the attack sent shudders through small businesses, not only in New York City but also across the nation. Some economic forecasters say they believe a wave of business failures in New York and elsewhere could come soon after the first of the year, as retailers and other entrepreneurs succumb to the continuing lack of new business in what is traditionally their busiest season.
"I've been on this street for 15 years, and it's never been this bad," said Kawal Bhatia, whose family owns Leather&Shoes.com, a shoe and leather goods store at 22 West Eighth Street which, despite its name, does not have a Web site. "In past years, no matter how bad it was the rest of the year, at least you knew you would cover all your losses with the holiday shoppers." But on a recent Friday, he said, "I did $25 worth of business."
Last week, Mr. Bhatia put up a new sign: "Store Closing."
Small businesses, including many retail establishments, account for two of every five jobs in New York City and roughly half of all jobs statewide, so the drought among small-business owners presages economic pain that is likely to spread far beyond Lower Manhattan. And while numerous grant and loan programs have sprung up to help small businesses recover from the disaster, business owners have complained, in a growing chorus, that the grants are too small to stem their losses and that loan agencies are not approving loans.
On Eighth Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, for example, roughly two miles north of ground zero, businesses that depend on people who travel into the city to shop have been devastated. The block, the professed shoe district of Manhattan, has for decades served as a crucible for small businesses, a place where shoe and leather goods shops have mixed with funky clothing emporiums serving an eclectic mix of college students, tourists and New Yorkers in search of bargains. But tourists have stopped coming, and retail sales not just in the Village but across the city have been suffering.
Economists say it is too early to tell just how many small businesses are likely to end up closing or in Bankruptcy Court, but they say that the signs are not good. 
"I think there is a strong likelihood that come the first quarter, small businesses that are holding on by the seat of their pants may not be able to hold on anymore without some outside assistance," said Ian E. Novos, senior director for economic consulting service of KPMG. 
A report assessing the economic impact of Sept. 11 that was prepared for the New York City Partnership, by KPMG and SRI International, another consulting firm, predicted that for the next two years, small businesses' sales would continue to fall short of what was expected before the trade center attack. Employment among small businesses will continue to fall through the first quarter of next year, the report said.
During the recession of the early 1990's, in a downturn that was short-lived by historical standards, business failures in New York State peaked at more than 6,000 companies per year, according to Dun & Bradstreet. The failures involved less than 1 percent of the small businesses operating in the state. In 1997, the most recent year for which data is available, there were roughly 1.2 million small businesses operating in New York State, according to state statistics. (Federal data on small businesses, using different measurement criteria, put the number at about half that.)
The 1990's recession lacked some of the ingredients of today's problems -- most important a cataclysmic event that sent jobs streaming away from Lower Manhattan, immediately closed off spigots of corporate spending and sent consumers into a kind of anti-spending shock.
Since the disaster, the United States Small Business Administration has approved only about one in three applications for disaster loans. Those loans have provided $164 million to more than 2,000 businesses so far, but the approval rate is well below the rates of 50 percent to 64 percent that have followed other major disasters over the past decade.
Hector V. Barreto, the administrator of the S.B.A., told the House Committee on Small Business on Thursday that the loan approval statistics were a result of what was a very different disaster. But he also agreed to review all loan applications that had been rejected in New York so far, to see if the agency's loan standards, which often rely on cash flow and the value of tangible property, had been applied too rigidly.
Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, which inflict property damage mostly on homes and homeowners, the World Trade Center attack did most of its property damage in a small area around ground zero. Most of the loans requested and made have been for economic injury to businesses in a far wider geographic area, stretching over several counties near New York City.
Economic disaster loans to businesses account for three-quarters of the disaster loans approved so far, compared with 20 percent after events like the flooding of the Red River of the North, in North Dakota in 1997, and Tropical Storm Allison in Texas and Louisiana earlier this year. Economic injury loans require more documentation of losses and of a borrower's ability to repay them than property damage loans do. 
A bill that would ease eligibility rules for disaster loans as well as create a grant program to go with the loan program was recently sent to the full House of Representatives by the House Committee on Small Business.
Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, whose district includes parts of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens and who is the ranking Democrat on that committee, said the current loan program needed to be revised as the bill would require because the existing loan program "is not suitable for the new reality of this disaster."
Some businesses that have been turned down for loans say they cannot fathom whom the loan program is supposed to help, if not them. Carla Behrle, who designs, manufactures and sells custom-made leather clothing from a shop on Franklin Street in TriBeCa, said she was told by S.B.A. officials that her application would be rejected because her business did not have enough cash flow to make the loan payments of $143 a month. 
"Some people spend more than that on cigarettes," said Ms. Behrle (pronounced BURR-lee), who does not smoke. She said the agency did not seem to take into account her plans for the money, which included relocating her business, which had revenues of about $125,000 last year, and shifting her focus to wholesale sales, eliminating her retail store. 
"I spent hours and hours filling out all this paperwork," she said. "If I had known what I know now, I would have put my energies elsewhere."
Other entrepreneurs complain that the city and state efforts to restore the economy are tailored to the needs of large corporations rather than to small businesses. They note that when Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed members of the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation last month, corporate and political interests were well represented, but no representatives of small business from downtown Manhattan were included.
Asked what he would say to people who operate small downtown businesses that are ailing, John C. Whitehead, the newly appointed chairman of the group, said: "I don't know what we say to them, but we want to keep them and we don't want them to be discouraged. I think there is assistance available for them."
Carl Weisbrod, president of the Downtown Alliance, which represents businesses in the financial district and around the trade center site, said the redevelopment agency's "primary mission is going to be repairing the infrastructure" and creating a physical environment that will draw customers back to small businesses downtown.
Whether small businesses downtown can wait for those improvements, which could easily take years, is uncertain. On West Eighth Street, merchants up and down the block who are not covering their expenses say their landlords have so far refused to give them a break on their rents.
At Mofa Shoes, Moses, the manager, who would not give his last name, spoke woefully of the outlook. "This used to be the shoe capital of the world," he said. "We'd get customers who came to Eighth Street from Italy, Brazil, Spain. Now, well, you see. The street is empty."

Many small retailers far from the trade center say business dropped after the attack. (Photographs by Vincent Laforet/The New York Times)(pg. B6) Chart: "LEDGER: Large Needs for Small Businesses"The approval rate for disaster loans following the World Trade Center attacks is lower than for other major disasters in recent years. Small Business Administration officials say that most loan requests and approvals in the current disaster have been for economic-injury loans rather than for property damage, contrary to the usual case following large disasters. Qualifications for economic-injury loans are somewhat stricter, the officials say, requiring more documentation of injury and eligibility, thus producing a lower approval rate. Because the recent loans are mostly for businesses rather than for homes or other property, their average value is higher as well.

HEADLINE: Chile's Leader Remains Socialist but Acts Like Pragmatist 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LOTA, Chile, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
President Ricardo Lagos is known as a formal man who keeps his feelings and thoughts to himself. But tears welled up in his eyes as he listened to a young woman tell her story at the opening of a state-run bank office.
 "A few months ago all I could look forward to was a life selling fish door to door," said Vitalicia Ulloa, 37, tears falling down her face as she spoke to an audience of 400 people. "Thanks to you President Lagos I am now going to sell insurance!" 
 This was no small miracle in a town that a generation ago was rife with labor unrest and Communist and Socialist agitation, leading Salvador Allende, then the president, to nationalize the local coal mines. After Gen. Augusto Pinochet overthrew Dr. Allende in 1973 in a coup supported by the United States, the mines were privatized and finally closed in the 1990's, leaving Lota depressed, hungry and angry.
As the first Socialist to govern Chile since Dr. Allende, Mr. Lagos did not forget Lota. One of his first acts as president last year was to order the Banco Estado to put its national Internet and telephone sales office in Lota to create 160 jobs.
"With globalization, distances do not exist anymore and opportunities are there for those who know how to seize them," Mr. Lagos told the crowd here. "We need to adjust to the new economy, or history will pass us by."
In his nearly two years in office, President Lagos has tried to heal a lot of old wounds in a way that does not threaten the stability of a country that is still sore from ideological conflicts that led to the deaths of 3,000 people and the torture and exile of many more from 1973 to 1990.
Mr. Lagos, 63, has become a firm ally of the United States and has pressed negotiations for a free trade agreement between the two countries. Managing an uneasy peace with the Chilean military, he has quietly moved toward buying a new fleet of fighter jets. He has expanded political freedoms by pushing Congress to repeal a law that punished journalists for criticizing or insulting judges, military commanders or cabinet members. 
Mr. Lagos has lowered tariffs and kept government deficits in check to control inflation, even if big businesses are not happy with his efforts to strengthen unions and crack down on tax evasion.
The image Mr. Lagos tries to convey is one of a national father figure. Once scheduled to become Dr. Allende's ambassador to the Soviet Union and then jailed for leading the opposition against General Pinochet, Mr. Lagos now chooses rhetoric that is soothing and unifying.
"A Socialist today understands that the fall of the Berlin Wall means we live in a world in which the market is not leftist or rightist," he said in an interview on his presidential plane. "It is simply an instrument to be used."
But the achievements of Mr. Lagos's government have so far been modest, as even supporters concede.
The military has fallen far short of its promises last year to account for people who disappeared during its rule, and critics say Mr. Lagos has been far too timid in pressuring the high command. Improvements in health care that Mr. Lagos promised on the campaign trail two years ago have yet to be instituted. Reform of the Constitution, which still gives the military independent powers, has stalled.
Unemployment has increased over the last two years, and the economy will achieve only 3 percent growth this year -- far below the performance of the last 15 years, although far better than Chile's slumping neighbors like Argentina.
Mr. Lagos's government also often seems to lack a clear agenda, in part because members of his coalition cabinet of Christian Democrats and Socialists often go their own way, publicly voicing divergent policies. A shake-up in the cabinet is expected after congressional elections later this month.
"Lagos has made no change," said Alfredo Jocelyn-Holt, a historian at the University of Chile. "He has unconditionally accepted the Pinochet model, even though he is a man of the left and struggled for years to overthrow the Pinochet dictatorship." 
Mr. Lagos has faced two major distractions. A slowdown in the world economy, causing a slump in export prices for copper and wood products, crimped his ability to address social problems. In addition, a long judicial process over whether to force General Pinochet to stand trial for human rights violations complicated his relations with the still powerful military.
Only days before Mr. Lagos took office in March 2000, General Pinochet was freed from house arrest in Britain but faced hundreds of criminal complaints here in Chile. The general's lawyers fought to avert a trial, arguing that the former dictator was too infirm to stand trial, opening the way to more than a year of court appeals. 
As judges first stripped General Pinochet of his senatorial immunity and then ordered his house arrest, top military commanders put heavy pressure on Mr. Lagos to intervene. Mr. Lagos repeatedly said in public that he would allow the courts to work independently, but a top Socialist Party activist who is close to the president said Mr. Lagos worked quietly to assure that General Pinochet would not stand trial, because of his poor health and failing memory. 
At a meeting with the military high command last year in the Defense Ministry, Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, the chief of the army, told Mr. Lagos that he did not want his successor to have to deal with the politically delicate situation of a Pinochet trial.
"The president reached across the table and shook General Izurieta's hand, and it was understood," said the confidant of Mr. Lagos. "It was not an explicit deal but it was implicit." 
Mr. Lagos continues to publicly deny that he played any role. But the confidant said aides to Mr. Lagos had associates indirectly alert Supreme Court judges that the president did not want a trial. The Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that General Pinochet was not well enough to stand trial, a decision it may well have made without any outside direction.
Despite Mr. Lagos' efforts, military-civilian relations remain touchy.
Just last week, after Mr. Lagos installed a new commander of the Carabinero national police, a police colonel who disagreed with the choice led 300 officers in a violent eviction of the Communist Party headquarters, arresting 40 people and injuring 10, without consulting civilian officials.
On the economic front, Mr. Lagos, facing a recession, took an uncommon course for a Socialist. He cut government spending earlier this year to control inflation, therefore allowing the Central Bank to sharply cut interest rates. The government also allowed the peso to slip in value, boosting the competitive advantage of such exports as wines, fruits, vegetables and salmon.
"We have devalued our currency 30 percent with almost no inflation," Mr. Lagos said. "I did that with tough fiscal policies. A left-wing politician has to be tough enough to say no."

HEADLINE: ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL; 
The National Title Is a Computer Game

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Opinion polls, confusing computers, bitter partisanship, crass commercialism and the occasional disputed election are all part of the American scene in the early 21st century. Why should college football be any different? It isn't.
 The sport reflected the general culture like a fun-house mirror yesterday when the Bowl Championship Series chose Nebraska to play Miami in the Rose Bowl for the national championship on Jan. 3. 
 There was no tournament. The Hurricanes went undefeated this season and almost everyone agrees they deserve a berth in the title game. But the Cornhuskers have not played since the day after Thanksgiving, when they lost to Colorado, 62-36. The victorious Buffaloes went on to win the Big 12 Conference championship. Although Nebraska was ranked second in the country in the B.C.S., Oregon finished second behind Miami in the coaches and news media polls, which make up 25 percent of the B.C.S. formula. Colorado finished third in the polls; Nebraska was fourth. 
But once the computers were added to the equation, Nebraska moved up to second in the total B.C.S. evaluation, while Colorado finished third and Oregon fourth. Colorado and Oregon are therefore sentenced to meet in the Fiesta Bowl while Nebraska goes to the Rose Bowl. Supporters of Colorado and Oregon, obviously, are not happy.
"I understand that frustration," said John Swofford, commissioner of the Atlantic Coast Conference and coordinator of the B.C.S. "I'm sure I would feel the same way. You've got three, four, maybe five teams who feel they're as good as anybody and deserve to play. Would it be nicer if everything was simpler and everyone agreed? Yes."
When someone asked whether the perception of chaos is good for the sport, Swofford replied, "It depends on what you consider chaos." 
One factor in the confusion is a B.C.S. element called strength of schedule. It can make all the difference. For instance: Because Texas Christian beat Southern Mississippi, 14-12, on Saturday, it helped increase Nebraska's strength of schedule because Nebraska beat T.C.U. in August. That moved Nebraska from 18th to 14th in strength of schedule, perhaps accounting for the .05 margin over Colorado. Is that clear? If not, please contact Knute Rockne on a Ouija board. 
The results were announced on national television in midafternoon during a show sponsored by a company that makes salty snack food. The host of the show kept mentioning the communications company that sponsors the Rose Bowl and the retail chain that sponsors the trophy. All the telecast needed was Vanna White turning over the cards and Regis Philbin asking, "Is that your final answer?"
The show included a split screen displaying Gary Barnett, the coach of Colorado, and Frank Solich, the coach of Nebraska, the way cable news channels show opposing politicians and pundits during the evening shout-outs. Barnett's frown trumped Solich's placid demeanor.
Barnett insisted that his team played more contending teams than Solich's. Solich declined to point out that Barnett's team lost more games, but he did say, "You're going to have controversy" under a system like this.
"We won 11 games in a row," Solich said. "We're very proud." Nebraska finished 11-1; Colorado was 10-2. Miami was 11-0. 
Barnett's Buffaloes almost qualified thanks to a big assist from his fellow coaches, who tried to run an end-around past the computers and perform some rough justice yesterday morning by changing their votes from last week. The coaches moved Colorado ahead of Nebraska, flipping the third and fourth places.
Despite the fact that neither team played, Colorado got better in the opinion of the coaches and Nebraska got worse.
But various computed components, including the strength of the respective schedules, left Colorado in third place in the B.C.S., slightly behind Nebraska. This computer factor amounts to revenge of the nerds, the triumph of the guys from the high school math club who could not get the attention of the girls watching football practice.
Cynical people may suggest that the B.C.S., in its fourth year, is a convenient arrangement among six major conferences to control the millions of dollars paid by the four major bowl games and their television sponsors.
There were even murmurs of antitrust challenges last week from Brigham Young, grumbles that lessened when B.Y.U. ruined its perfect record by losing in Hawaii on Saturday, 72-45. Skeptics may also suggest that some of the student-athletes are not enrolled at their institutions of higher learning primarily to advance their education.
Potential conflicts with classes and examinations are often cited for the absence of a playoff system to determine a champion. 
Others suggest it has more to do with preserving the economic fiefdoms of the big bowl games. None of this is to imply that recent regular-season games have been devalued or lack excitement.
On the contrary, the last few weeks have featured a string of entertaining upsets that prevented top teams like Florida, Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee from playing in the title game when all they had to do to get there was win. The scores have been close, the participants heroic, the plays memorable, and the fans in their painted faces and school-colored garments have been screaming their fool heads off.
This Rose Bowl could be a classic, pitting the modern passing offense of quarterback Ken Dorsey and Miami against the old-fashioned option attack run by Eric Crouch, the Nebraska quarterback who won the Heisman trophy Saturday in another much-debated decision. It is an archetypal American match pitting a city-slick team from an ocean coast against plodding farm boys from the heartland.
In a time of real-world fears of war and terrorism, a big debate about football and a little anticipation of a tainted but intriguing championship game may not be such a bad thing.

HEADLINE: Enron Made Payments in Bid To Hold Top Energy Traders 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
As it rushed to reach a merger agreement with Dynegy last month, Enron paid about $50 million to 75 employees who worked as natural gas and electricity traders. The payments, made in the first week in November, were meant to keep the company's most profitable energy traders from leaving before the merger, an Enron official said.
 That remuneration was separate from $55 million in bonuses paid to about 500 employees just days before Enron sought protection from creditors in bankruptcy court on Dec. 2, after Dynegy called off the merger. 
 Enron, after those payments were disclosed last week, said they were made to make sure "critical" workers stayed at the company for at least 90 days and that the bonuses primarily went to middle-level employees. 
Of the $55 million paid out before the bankruptcy filing, 11 executives received bonuses rangingfrom $500,000 and $5 million, a person close to the matter said, with a handful of senior officials receiving more than $1 million each.
Coming just as the company dismissed 4,000 employees -- including about half of its headquarters staff in Houston -- the total of $105 million in payments is sure to fuel resentment among workers who think that Enron took care of its higher-ranking employees at their expense. New details of the payments were reported by The Houston Chronicle.
The laid-off workers, who in some cases have already had up to 90 percent of their 401(k) retirement money evaporate as Enron's stock plunged this year, may receive no more than $4,500 in severance pay.
That compares with an average of almost $200,000 paid to each of more than 550 employees during the last month Enron was solvent.
An Enron spokesman defended the payments, saying they are not significant compared with the company's annual payroll of more than $2 billion, and that they were meant to retain employees needed for Enron to continue operation. Without those employees, he said, many Enron businesses might shut down completely, throwing even more people out of work and leaving less value for creditors.
Bankruptcy experts have said the payments are likely to come under scrutiny -- and may even be challenged -- by the hundreds of lenders and other companies who are Enron's creditors.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
A buyout company mayplan some tough love for two telecoms, and holders of their debt and stock.

BYLINE:  By Simon Romero 

 BODY:
EVEN though the crisis in the telecommunications industry was well under way a year ago, XO Communications and McLeodUSA were well received by some investors. How quickly things change.
 The stocks are below $1, and both XO and McLeodUSA are mired in debt. Saying there is no other way for the companies to avoid bankruptcy filings, the buyout firm Forstmann Little has announced huge restructuring plans the last two weeks for both XO, a telephone and Internet company based in Mclean, Va., and McLeodUSA, a telephone company in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
 Forstmann, led by the New York financier Theodore J. Forstmann and known for turning around companies like Gulfstream Aerospace and General Instruments, previously sank large sums into these companies and appears to be taking a long view for the industry.
The firm's austere proposals, though, which largely plunder shareholders and bondholders, have sent a chill through a part of the telecommunications industry already in tatters. Analysts and executives at competitive local exchange carriers, the start-up phone companies known as CLEC's (pronounced SEE-lecks), say the Forstmann plans have heightened the fears of investors.
Stock analysts say companies with large debt loads, like ITC Deltacom of West Point, Ga., and Mpower Holding of Pittsford, N.Y., are particularly vulnerable. ITC and Mpower remained in penny-stock territory last week. ITC closed the week at 99 cents, while Mpower finished at 45 cents. Less vulnerable are Allegiance Telecom and Time Warner Telecom, whose capital structures are not burdened by so much debt. These companies' stocks have remained relatively strong, with Allegiance gaining 94 cents last week, to $8.95, and Time Warner Telecom gaining $4.46, to $18.66.
"This is clearly not the right sector for public shareholders to put their money," said Glenn Waldorf, a telecommunications analyst who covers CLEC's at UBS Warburg. "A psychological threshold has been crossed showing it's no longer a mark of shame to take your pain and move on."
Some analysts are warning investors that other companies could wind up in situations like that of XO and McLeodUSA. Mr. Waldorf of UBS Warburg envisions a "game of restructuring dominoes" for other CLEC's.
The Forstmann restructuring plans are particularly painful for investors in XO, once known as NextLink Communications. XO's equity investors, whose holdings were valued at nearly $17 billion at the height of the technology bubble, will be completely wiped out. Shareholders in McLeodUSA, whose market value was once $16 billion, will be diluted to 30 percent from 79 percent of outstanding shares.
Bondholders will also be hit. In XO's case, they will get about 11 cents on the dollar for the $5 billion of debt securities they hold. That is about how much the debt traded for at the end of last month, traders say. McLeodUSA's bondholders will get about 19 percent of face value for holdings worth $2.9 billion on paper, in addition to 14 percent of equity in the company. According to traders, McLeodUSA's bonds were trading at 15 percent of face value at the end of last month.
The stocks of each company had already fallen by more than 90 percent for the year, punishing big investors including Forstmann, which had invested more than $1 billion in XO stock, and Craig O. McCaw, the cellphone pioneer.
Stull Stull & Brody, a law firm specializing in shareholder complaints, filed a lawsuit last week on behalf of XO shareholders, accusing the company misleading investors about its financial condition.
XO and McLeodUSA, with the help of their investment bankers, each raised $450 million from investors last January. Both companies needed the capital to pursue aggressive growth plans. XO, backed by Mr. McCaw, had recently expanded its business in Europe. McLeodUSA had recently expanded into the Texas telecommunications market with the acquisition of CapRock of Dallas.
Forstmann had already invested of $1.5 billion in XO and $1 billion in McLeodUSA. Now it is offering to put $400 million in cash into XO. It is also offering to buy McLeod's commercial-directory business for $535 million, convert its $1 billion in preferred stock into common stock and invest $100 million more in McLeod common shares. Some observers wonder why the buyout firm is dedicating even more funds to its telecommunications gamble in hopes of salvaging its investments.
"This is a spectator sport for us," said Royce Holland, chief executive of Allegiance Telecom of Dallas. "It'll be a while before we know whether Forstmann can pull these things off." 
What does Forstmann see? For one thing, the companies have growing revenues and could eventually become profitable if their debt loads were reduced.
Forstmann also has patience. Its turnaround of Gulfstream, the maker of corporate jets, took nearly 10 years. A person close to the buyout firm said XO and McLeodUSA are considered long-term investments. Mr. Forstmann declined to comment.
If the plans are approved by bondholders, Forstmann effectively gains control of the companies.
Another intrigue in the restructuring dance involves Carlos Slim Helu, the billionaire chairman of Telefonos de Mexico, whose company agreed to match Forstmann's $400 million pledge to invest in XO. Mr. Forstmann, a close friend of Mr. Slim's, invited him and Mr. McCaw to participate in the restructuring plan but only Mr. Slim accepted.
Mr. Slim will end up with 39 percent ownership of XO, as will Forstmann. Mr. Slim has a close relationship with SBC Communications of San Antonio, one of the nation's largest local telephone companies. Could SBC eventually acquire his holding in XO?
Whitney Johnson, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote a report speculating that Mr. Slim could eventually sell his stake to SBC. "A possible exit strategy for Telmex?" she asked.
SBC declined to comment. Adolfo Cerezo Perez, Telmex's chief financial officer, said the company was taking a long-term approach with its XO investment. "We see this as an opportunity to buy into one of the premier telecommunications assets at a very attractive price," Mr. Cerezo said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. "It is far too early to be talking about exit strategies."

HEADLINE: Official Says Resisting Bill On Terror Puts Britain at Risk 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
The country's chief law enforcement officer said today that Britain's alliance with the United States made it the likeliest European target for international terrorists like Osama bin Laden and that "naive" parliamentary resistance to the government's antiterrorism legislation was increasing the risk. 
 "Because of our close relationship with the Americans and total support for the U.S. and the robust way we have joined in on driving out bin Laden and the Taliban, we have a much higher profile than other European countries," the official, Home Secretary David Blunkett, said in a telephone interview from his Yorkshire parliamentary district. 
 "In the past, I have sought to damp down fears of a terror attack and not increase tensions," he said, "particularly around public parts of London, so as not to be detrimental to our economy.
"But when people say three months have lapsed and we can all have amnesia, we can forget about the threat, I remind them that terrorist organizations we host in our own communities plan their attacks months and years in advance, and so we have to be constantly vigilant until we have rooted them out." 
Mr. Blunkett made his remarks in response to action in the House of Lords last week adding seven limiting amendments to hard-line antiterror legislation the government is rushing through Parliament. He said the peers had "disemboweled" the proposed law and were acting in ignorance of the threat to national security. 
"God willing, there won't be an attack on us over Christmas and New Year," Mr. Blunkett said in the immediate aftermath of the Lords' rebellion. "Because all those who tell me we are not under threat are the ones who do not have the security and intelligence information which, for my sins, I carry."
A powerful member of Prime Minister Tony Blair's cabinet and known for his combativeness, Mr. Blunkett vowed to restore the disputed sections with only minor adjustments this week in the House of Commons, where the government has an overwhelming majority. 
Most European countries have tightened security measures in response to the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, but Britain has gone the furthest with its proposed law that would give prosecutors the right to detain indefinitely and without trial foreigners suspected of terrorist links. To do so, Britain had to invoke an article of the European Convention on Human Rights allowing countries to opt out of restrictions on such detentions.
The peers in the House of Lords maintained that they were acting to protect basic rights from government eagerness to impose draconian new police powers unrelated to the fight on terror. Among the amendments the Lords passed were ones calling for swift judicial review for interned terrorist suspects and limiting new information access provisions, which they claimed would allow the police to pry into almost anyone's personal bank accounts, tax returns and e-mail messages.
The Lords' intervention was welcomed by civil liberties and legal groups. "The amendments, if accepted, would give a proper focus to the fight against terrorism whilst avoiding measures that could impinge unfairly on the liberty of nonterrorists," said David McIntosh, president of the Law Society, a British counterpart to the American Bar Association. 
But Mr. Blunkett said he suspected the motivation of the peers in the House of Lords, where the Conservatives still wield power. "The demolition and sabotage was led by Tories whose interest is in giving the government a bloody nose and by others who are extremely naive and muddled," he said. 
Mr. Blunkett said he appreciated the concerns of civil liberties groups but contended that they had to be squared with the reality of the menace. "They are being terribly naive about the people we are dealing with," he said. 
He drew a parallel to the post-World War I government in Germany that was forced by events to yield to Hitler. "The Weimar Republic showed us that well-meaning and liberal-minded people can easily be swept aside by the evil that exists around us," he said. 
The House of Lords has the power to delay enactment of legislation passed by the House of Commons but not to overturn it. When the government disclosed the terms of the bill last month, it said it intended to have it be law by Christmas. Under that timetable, parliamentary action must be completed by Thursday. 
Mr. Blunkett said he would keep the House in session all Wednesday night if he had to, but he pleaded instead for a compromise to speed its passage. "I say to those who have questions about it to please come ahead with positive amendments to address them, but don't seek to destroy it," he said.

HEADLINE: Hewlett's Chief Is in a Battle For Her Deal and Her Career 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Shortly after she arrived at Hewlett-Packard two years ago, Carleton S. Fiorina invited the heirs of the founders over one afternoon. It was a pleasant couple of hours of talk over drinks, just a social get-together. The family members appreciated the gesture from the outsider who had come to take charge at the company that has their names on the door.
 "When she first became chief executive," one family member recalled, "she made a real effort to meet and get to know the family." 
 Ms. Fiorina, the nation's most prominent woman executive, understood the legacy of Hewlett-Packard. It is regarded as the entrepreneurial birthplace of Silicon Valley, founded in 1938 in a garage in Palo Alto, Calif., by William Hewlett and David Packard with $538. 
Her job was to revitalize a corporate icon, one with a rich past yet an uncertain future, sluggish and slipping behind in crucial computing markets. The renovation task, however, would be particularly delicate, because the founders' heirs control a total of about 18 percent of Hewlett-Packard shares.
Now, the heirs have united to stop her. They fear that Ms. Fiorina's plans for Hewlett-Packard's future are too risky for them to stomach. 
Last Friday, the Packard family delivered the most severe blow yet to Ms. Fiorina, her plans for the company and her career. The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the company's largest shareholder, declared it would vote against Hewlett-Packard's acquisition of Compaq Computer. The Packard foundation has joined Walter Hewlett and David Woodley Packard, the two oldest sons of the founders, who last month said they and their foundations would vote against the deal. 
Facing unified opposition from the families, the largest merger in computer history is in danger of a humbling rebuff.
To rescue the deal, Ms. Fiorina and her company must win the backing of major investors who have been skeptical so far. Page C1. 
If the deal collapses -- as many analysts predict -- Ms. Fiorina, who has championed it as the bold step Hewlett-Packard needs to become more competitive, will likely depart. 
In a lengthy interview last week at the company's Palo Alto headquarters, Ms. Fiorina, 47, stopped just short of confirming that.
If the shareholders take the unusual step of vetoing the deal, she said, "It would say a lot about the board and management's credibility."
In the interview, her first since the initial family opposition arose in early November, Ms. Fiorina defended the deal and her tenure at Hewlett-Packard. The interview came before the Packard foundation vote on Friday, but afterward she and the board said they would press ahead. She expressed confidence that they could still garner enough votes to have the merger approved.
"It's going to go through," she said. "It will."
The interview was in her second-floor office -- a kind of first-among-equals version of the classic Silicon Valley cubicle, a large corner space marked off by beige, shoulder-high partitions.
Her manner was direct, often combative, her handshake firm. She never criticized the families directly, but a theme of her comments was that her program of change is truer to the founders' vision than the stance of her opponents.
"This company has never been about looking in the rear-view mirror, though some people are more comfortable doing it," Ms. Fiorina said at one point.
Later, she declared, "To say that the status quo is a strategy is absurd. It's never been a strategy in this industry." 
The Compaq merger has been controversial since it was announced on Sept. 4. The immediate reaction from Wall Street was skeptical, as investors drove down the shares of both companies.
The skepticism is understandable. Big mergers in the fast-moving computer business have a poor track record. Corporate cultures clash, and integrating the operations of two big enterprises often turns out to be a time-consuming distraction. While the merging companies dither, markets -- and rivals -- move on.
A big merger would also be a striking departure from tradition at Hewlett-Packard, a company that has grown organically and nurtured a close-knit culture emphasizing trust, openness and consensus, known as the "H.P. Way."
Such concerns fueled the family opposition to the deal, led by Walter Hewlett, the one family member who is a company director. 
Ms. Fiorina sees things very differently. Based on her two years as chief executive, she is convinced that the company needs more than a strategy of evolution from within.
She has worked hard to modernize the company's culture. Leadership, she says, is a performance art. "Change has to be led from the top," she said. "People have to understand what you are trying to do and buy it." 
A determined, energetic performer, Ms. Fiorina traveled 250,000 miles in her first year to company facilities worldwide, urging employees to quicken the pace.
She reorganized to shear away layers of bureaucracy. And she engineered a new marketing campaign with a simplified "hp" logo, dropping the family names.
For her task, Ms. Fiorina intentionally adopted a personalized style of management. Young and articulate, with stylishly cut blond hair, she became a business celebrity. As the first woman to lead so large a company, her actions were inevitably scrutinized closely in Silicon Valley and beyond.
The star turn did not sit well with many Hewlett-Packard veterans and some family members. They noted the lucrative pay package required to lure her from Lucent Technologies in 1999 -- mostly stock once valued as high as $85 million, though now less than $35 million -- and the fact that she expanded the corporate jet fleet.
"Why do people comment on my flying a corporate jet when virtually every other chief executive in Silicon Valley does the same?" she replied with exasperation when asked about it. She offered no explanation herself. "I'm just saying you should ask yourself that question," Ms. Fiorina replied.
Later, though, she suggested that being a newcomer to Hewlett-Packard and to the valley, invited resistance. "I knew that coming in as an outsider and moving a 60-year-old company with a grand heritage, and all the crosscurrents that implies, was not going to be easy," she said. 
As the computer industry's slide accelerated this year, Ms. Fiorina decided that a more drastic step was needed -- and the Compaq merger became that step. 
She begs to differ with critics who say big mergers in the computer business are doomed to failure. "Where mergers do work -- in banking, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and other industries -- is where they are fundamentally focused on consolidation and not diversification," she said. Hewlett-Packard and Compaq have several overlapping, complementary businesses, making them ideal candidates for efficiency-enhancing consolidation, she explained.
Melding the personal computer operations of both companies, Ms. Fiorina said, will give the combined company the economies of scale it needs to better compete against the industry leader, Dell Computer.
Both companies, she added, have sizable positions in the market for the larger computers that are the engines of corporate office networks and the Internet. Greater size, she said, will give the new Hewlett-Packard more influence with corporate customers against rivals like I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems.
With the heady growth days of the late 1990's only a memory, Ms. Fiorina believes that the industry itself is ripe for consolidation. Moving quickly, with the Compaq merger, is a way to guarantee that Hewlett-Packard is a leader, instead of an also-ran. "The technology industry is widely viewed as not mature," she said. "But I think it is maturing," and thus ready for a cycle of mergers. 
She may be the public face of the merger, but she is by no means alone in advocating it. The boards of both companies support it (with the notable exception of Mr. Hewlett) and reiterated that support to each other yesterday in a conference call. 
"It's not simply my view," Ms. Fiorina noted. "That's important to remember. These are people with a lot of collective experience and knowledge."
A member of the board and a frequent adviser is Richard A. Hackborn, a retired Hewlett-Packard executive, who worked for the company for 33 years and built its printer business, the corporate crown jewel. Mr. Hackborn was a principal architect of the strategy that brought Ms. Fiorina to the company and led to the Compaq merger. 
As Mr. Hackborn envisioned it, corporate customers want companies that can offer them technology solutions -- complete with hardware, software and services -- to business problems, not just pieces of equipment. Compaq, Mr. Hackborn said, improves Hewlett's chances of becoming just such a supplier, more like I.B.M.
"I don't think we'll get there incrementally, on our own," he said in an interview. 
The Compaq merger, however, was not something Ms. Fiorina rushed into. In boardroom strategy sessions, she said, it had been regarded as a "distinct possibility" since December 1999. Yet the merger talks only began last June. 
Her main concern all along, she said, was the "integration challenge" of blending the two companies and their disparate cultures.
To solve those problems, she points to joint teams of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq workers who are preparing a single corporate Web site, a single customer service operation, unified teams for corporate customers and pay checks for all that say Hewlett-Packard. 
"None of this suggests it is easy," Ms. Fiorina said. "It suggests we understand what we're doing."

 BODY:
 Politics and War

ON THE GROUND -- The brutal five-year rule of the Taliban came to an official end as the last Afghan province, Zabul, slipped from their control. Their fractious opponents, due to start governing in two weeks, agreed to bury some of the many feuds that could jeopardize peace. A1

THE LAST STAGE -- The American military campaign in Afghanistan has been remarkably successful, but the siege of Tora Bora may be different. The 30 or 40 fortified caves that are the last bastion of Osama bin Laden's supporters -- and perhaps the hide-out of the terrorist mastermind himself -- have long been a safe refuge for Afghan fighters. B3

THE WHITE HOUSE -- President Bush has been switching between two personas lately: George Win-the-War and George the Compassionate Conservative, both of which enjoyed victories last week, domestic and foreign. B2

The Money Trail

DISMANTLING AL QAEDA -- Despite progress in unraveling the finances of the Sept. 11 attacks, investigators say it is proving difficult to dismantle the overall financing apparatus of Al Qaeda, which they say is so far-flung and diversified that it could survive even if Mr. bin Laden is captured or killed. A1

HOLDING THE REINS -- Saudi Arabia's top security official, Prince Nayef, said he believed that unnamed militants other than Osama bin Laden stood at the helm of Al Qaeda, and he warned that the arrest or killing of Mr. bin Laden would not cripple the terrorist organization. B4

Disillusioned Warriors

THE JIHADIS -- Legions of untrained Pashtun tribesmen from the Swat Valley, in northwest Pakistan, have not returned from Afghanistan, where they went to fight with the Taliban. Surviving tribe members blame Islamic militant leaders, saying they sent the valley's sons to their deaths, then did nothing to help the families left behind. A1

ANOTHER BIN LADEN TAPE -- A tape of Osama bin Laden found recently in Afghanistan shows him recounting how he listened to radio reports of the first plane crashing into the trade center, and quickly telling others "there will be more" as he awaited the second attack. According to administration officials who have read transcripts of the amateur videotape, Mr. bin Laden also seems amused that many of the hijackers apparently did not know they were on suicide missions. The White House is debating whether to make the tape public. B1

THE AMERICAN -- Vice President Dick Cheney, on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," said John Walker Lindh, the 20-year-old American who fought with the Taliban, had provided useful information to United States officials. One senior defense official warned, however, that it was "not the intelligence gold mine that a lot of people are thinking." B3

Questions of Security

DOMESTIC DEFENSE -- After Sept. 11, the rush was on to construct Fortress America, with sentries patrolling cliffs above the Hudson River, newly deputized sea marshals boarding ships entering California ports and NATO pilots from Germany and Italy flying radar patrols over the United States. But many state and local governments are balking because of the costs and the frustration over what they see as the federal government's confusing stream of intelligence information and security alerts. B1

THE DETAINEES -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service routinely holds foreigners it wants to deport for years because their home countries will not take them. While indefinite detention was a vexing problem before Sept. 11, immigration lawyers say the situation has gotten worse since the attacks. B5

ENLISTING BUSINESS -- Customs Service agents will begin urging businesses across the country this week to notify the government if they are approached by anyone trying to buy items that the agency believes terrorists want to buy for possibly illegal shipment abroad. B7

IN LONDON -- Britain's chief law enforcement officer, Home Secretary David Blunkett, said Britain's alliance with the United States made it the likeliest European target for international terrorists like Osama bin Laden and that "naive" parliamentary resistance to the government's antiterrorism legislation had increased the risk. A13

Aftermath of the Attacks

THE ECONOMY -- Small businesses throughout New York City -- not just near the trade center site -- and across the nation have experienced a potentially devastating drop in sales since Sept. 11. A1

THE MILITARY -- Reservists being called up for the first time are discovering a lesser-known requirement for active duty: good teeth. B6

THE COVERAGE -- The Pentagon is promising news organizations that it will be more helpful, after receiving complaints about restrictions placed on journalists in Afghanistan. B6

A WIDOW UNDERSTANDS -- After her husband died trying to help a stranger escape from the trade center, Migdalia Ramos was angry that he had put a stranger ahead of his family. Three weeks later, she found herself running into a burning building to save an elderly woman, and she knew why he had done what he did. B1

IN TEHRAN -- Many Iranians see the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan as an opportunity to resume relations with the United States for the first time since 1980. A12

IN WASHINGTON -- The closing of many buildings and monuments has kept some visitors away from the nation's capital and caused the loss of thousands of jobs at hotels, restaurants and airlines. A14

THE FOUNDATION -- The fall of the nation's largest Muslim charity, Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, was remarkably steep after the government froze its assets last week, calling it a terrorist front. A18

The Recovery Effort

AT GROUND ZERO -- The graveyard shift at the trade center site is work that presents unique physical and psychological challenges. The men and women who work the shift feel honored to do so. A1

Bin Laden on Camera, Signs of Cooperation and Costs of Alerts

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
As American bombers continue to pound the area in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden is believed to be holding out, new and chilling evidence has surfaced that United States officials say confirms his links to the attacks against the United States on Sept. 11.
 REACTION ON TAPE -- A videotape found in Afghanistan two weeks ago but not released publicly shows Mr. bin Laden describing his reaction to news of the strike against the World Trade Center. The existence of the tape was confirmed yesterday on television by several top members of the Bush administration. According to one official who has read the transcript, Mr. bin Laden described how he knew the attack was coming, but had not expected the level of its destruction. "He praises Allah for the fact that it was more successful than expected," the official said. Mr. bin Laden also suggested that not all the hijackers were aware that theirs was a suicide mission, the official said. 
 The date and source of the tape have not been identified, and the White House is still debating whether it should be released. This latest videotape -- first reported by The Washington Post -- should not be confused with another one alluded to by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain when he first laid out the case against Mr. bin Laden in September. That tape has not been made public.
BIN LADEN STILL ELUSIVE -- In Afghanistan, both Mr. bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader who was his chief protector, were still eluding capture, although a local anti-Taliban commander insisted that Mr. bin Laden had not slipped out of Afghanistan. Fighting between Al Qaeda fighters and anti-Taliban forces continued in the Tora Bora mountain region.
In northern Afghanistan, there was new hope that aid groups would finally be able to reach tens of thousands of refugees. The so-called Friendship Bridge between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan opened yesterday, and a first shipment of grain and medicine was sent across by train, heading for the refugee camps.
A TRUCE BETWEEN RIVALS -- As Afghanistan's new provisional government prepared to take power later this month, there were signs that its authority was already taking hold. Hamid Karzai, who will head the new government, reported that he had negotiated a truce between two rival factions in Kandahar. Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an influential warlord in the north, said he too would refrain from violence as he contests the makeup of the new government.
As the hunt for Mr. bin Laden continues in Afghanistan, new clues about his operations have emerged from a continuing investigation into the financial network behind Al Qaeda. For one thing, the terrorist organization is not so dependent on Mr. bin Laden's personal wealth -- his inheritance is valued at $25 million -- as on it is on an amalgam of private businesses, corporate shells, charities and links to crime groups. In Bosnia, for instance, investigators found that Al Qaeda operatives had skimmed from charities and linked up with local crime bosses. Experts say that breaking up the Al Qaeda's worldwide financial network is as important a goal as achieving a military victory in Afghanistan.
BURDEN OF DEFENSE -- Protecting the country from terrorism moved to the top of everybody's list of priorities after Sept. 11, but what exactly does that mean in real life? The White House put the former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge in charge of domestic defense, but in reality, the burden has fallen to the state and local levels, where both money and information have been trickling down slowly, and sometimes not at all. These frustrations became more acute each time Mr. Ridge put the nation on alert, which he did three times in three months. Communication is improving, but mayors and governors are still stuck with the job of balancing the cost for improved security, with the cost of maintaining basic services.
In New York City, the economic damage caused by the Sept. 11 attacks is continuing to spread out from ground zero, and small businesses are being hit the hardest. A recent report on the post-Sept. 11 economy predicted that employment in the city's small businesses will continue to fall through the first quarter of next year. So far, only one out of three applications for disaster loans, filed with the United States Small Business Administration, has been approved, well below the rate in other major disasters over the last decade.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MONEY; 
Terror Money Hard to Block, Officials Find

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
In Afghanistan, the hunt for Osama bin Laden is narrowing. But on the war's financial front, the government is only now beginning to come to grips with Al Qaeda's money-raising apparatus, which officials say is so far-flung and diversified that it could survive even if Mr. bin Laden is captured or killed.
 Delving into a network that generates millions of dollars a year, yet often trafficks in small amounts, the inquiry has uncovered at least $238,000 sent to the Sept. 11 hijackers in the United States through a dozen wire transfers from the United Arab Emirates. Several transfers are linked to an Al Qaeda official who used various aliases, United States government officials said in recent interviews. 
 Investigators have also found that the hijackers and some of their acquaintances declared about $40,000 in cash when entering the United States, the officials said, and law enforcement officials are trying to determine if that cash also aided the attacks. 
Despite progress in unraveling the finances of the September attacks, government officials say dismantling the overall financing of Al Qaeda is proving more difficult, in part because it hinges far less on Mr. bin Laden's fortune than was once believed.
During the last few years, government officials have concluded that Mr. bin Laden's inheritance, once estimated at $300 million, was actually more in the range of $25 million. Instead, Al Qaeda uses an amalgam of private enterprises, corporate shells and charities that are structured like a financial archipelago with connections hidden beneath the surface.
To support Al Qaeda, some operatives work like organized crime crews. Government officials exploring Al Qaeda's operation in Bosnia found that operatives skimmed money from relief charities and linked up with Bosnian crime bosses. The success in Bosnia made it a model for Al Qaeda to use in embattled countries around the world.
The description of the expansive and self-sufficient structure of the network is based on interviews with current and former officials of many American government agencies, as well as from court records and other official documents. The Bush administration's attempt to break up this financial network is as vital as the military action in Afghanistan, experts say.
"A military success would not be sufficient without an attack on the financial infrastructure" of Al Qaeda, said Michael Zeldin, former head of the money-laundering section at the Justice Department. "If that stays in place, then you may chase them from one geography to the next, you may be disruptive, but you haven't gotten to the root of the problem."
Since Sept. 11 the Bush administration has taken three public steps to block dozens of individuals, companies, charities and other organizations with Al Qaeda connections from the international banking system.
But out of public view, the effort is far broader, government officials say, involving diplomatic and covert actions. Working with governments in the Middle East and Europe, officials have privately confronted several international charities with accusations that terrorists had infiltrated their organizations and were diverting money to Al Qaeda.
United States officials, working with foreign counterparts, have monitored back transactions trying to track down Al Qaeda supporters. So-called "jump teams" of American forensic accountants, lawyers and other experts have descended on foreign countries to review records in search of Al Qaeda connections.
Evaluating progress on the financial front is far more difficult than it is in military battles. Much of the effort is only now getting under way, and the Bush administration has made public virtually none of the evidence it says it has linking individuals and private groups to Al Qaeda.
Success in this fight will be hard-won, experts say, primarily because Mr. bin Laden has fundamentally changed the nature of terrorist financing. In effect, at a time when state sponsorship for terrorism was in decline, Mr. bin Laden undertook a privatization of terror, creating a far more diffuse network than any faced in the past.
"The decline in state-sponsored terrorism means that the private support for terrorist groups has become the most essential element in fund-raising," said Reuven Paz, former academic director with the International Policy Institute for Counterterrorism in Herzlia, Israel. "That means any attempt to cut the money flow into Al Qaeda or other similar organizations will prove far more difficult than it has been in the past."

Invasion Prompts Money Flow
It all began -- as with most things Al Qaeda -- with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. 
As devout Muslims trooped there to defend the Islamic nation, wealthy Saudi businessmen funneled millions of dollars to support the effort through assorted charities. Among those businessmen was Mr. bin Laden, an heir to a Saudi construction fortune.
With the Afghan war playing out on the geopolitical chessboard of the cold war, the Central Intelligence Agency was directing even larger sums of cash toward the Afghan rebels, known as the mujahedeen. As the charities gained influence, American officials watched with little concern -- and indeed, with approval.
"The lion's share of the money for the mujahedeen came from the United States," one former senior intelligence official said. "We knew there was money coming from Arab states, primarily Saudi Arabia, that was being funneled through charities. But as long as we were all on the same side, it was welcome. It wasn't looked on as a threat that you needed to monitor." 
When the Afghan war end in 1989, officials said, Mr. bin Laden tapped those fund-raising contacts to support his idea of a wider jihad, or holy war, against the West. By 1991, he had a base in Sudan, where a militant Islamic government was in power, and Al Qaeda's financial operation took root. 
Using his inheritance and donations channeled through charities, Mr. bin Laden expanded his economic base. According to records in the Manhattan trial of Al Qaeda members who were convicted of bombing American embassies in Africa, he formed a company in Sudan called Wadi al-Aqiq, which managed investments in at least nine businesses, including a furniture company, a bakery and a cattle-breeding concern.
The organization also expanded contacts with charitable front groups, and formed some of its own. Supporters of Al Qaeda approached Arab businessmen for contributions. Often, they paid, either out of conviction or concern. "A lot of people gave money as part of the cause, and a lot of people gave money so terror wasn't directed at them," said Jack Devine, former acting director of operations with the C.I.A. and now president of the Arkin Group, a New York investigations firm. "You can give honorably or you can give out of fear."
Government officials also believe that Al Qaeda used seemingly independent companies as fronts. For example, earlier this month, President Bush blocked the accounts of a financial network called Al Barakaat, which owns an international collection of hawalas, an informal remittance system that moves millions of dollars around the world with virtually no paper trail. According to law enforcement information provided to the Treasury Department, the network is controlled by Al-Ittihad Al-Islamiya, an extremist Somali militia designated by President Bush as a terrorist organization.
Officials at Al Barakaat's headquarters in Mogadishu have denied that their money-transfer operation has any connection to Al Qaeda.
However, the information suggests that the connection to the terrorist groups works like this: Somali emigrants around the world use Al Barakaat to send money back home. That money is sometimes commingled with the illicit proceeds from welfare and insurance frauds and transferred to accounts in Dubai, where terrorist operatives siphon off a portion of it for Al Qaeda and the Somali militia group. Sometimes that portion is used to buy arms. The balance makes its way to Somalis back home.
Terrorists also benefit from fees on the transaction. Law-enforcement officials have also found that a fee of about 5 percent is charged on each transfer; in Dubai, operatives pass a piece of the fee to the Somali militia group, which then gives a cut to Al Qaeda.
Great effort goes into disguising these connections. For example, government officials said, people at Al Barakaat arranged for an arms shipment to people linked to Al Qaeda. In records, the officials said, the shipment was recorded as containing only blankets.
Al Qaeda both produces and profits from mayhem. After the organization's creation in Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden recognized that global unrest presented it with opportunities to expand its influence, as well as pump its financial machine.
Years of bloodletting in Bosnia, for example, allowed Al Qaeda to establish a beachhead in central Europe, government officials said. When the United States guided three rival Balkan states to a peace accord at a meeting in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995, the stage was set for Al Qaeda and other militant groups. "Various very militant groups who were mujahedeen-connected were involved in the Bosnia campaign and took advantage of the Dayton peace accords to set up shop" in the Balkans, one former intelligence official said. "They found a very hospitable environment" when a portion of Bosnia was placed in the hands of Muslims.
The bin Laden financial machine blossomed, according to officials who have been informed of intelligence information on the matter. Charities around the Arab world proclaimed that they were raising money for humanitarian purposes in Bosnia, but in fact portions benefited Islamic extremist groups in the area, including Al Qaeda.
Militants linked to Al Qaeda also established connections with Bosnian organized crime figures. The officials said Al Qaeda and the Taliban found a route for the trafficking of heroin from Afghanistan into Europe through the Balkans.
Their presence in Bosnia proved so successful for Al Qaeda operatives, officials said, that it became an "off-the-shelf" model for fund-raising and recruitment used by the terrorist organization again and again -- in Kosovo, Albania and Chechnya.
"There is a vast criminal network of these operating throughout Europe, that provides these groups with the financial revenue to buy military equipment," one former intelligence official said. "It is narco-terrorism all intertwined with organized crime."
By 1996, Mr. bin Laden was expelled from Sudan. He moved to Afghanistan and ingratiated himself with the ruling Taliban by pouring millions of dollars into the country. His group gained new financial powers; even the country's national airline, Ariana Afghan Airlines, became Al Qaeda's "Fed-Ex system" for shipping arms and personnel, officials said. This financial system transformed the nature of international terrorism. Al Qaeda offered amateurs dedicated to destruction at any cost a source of cash with no strings attached.
But that source could be stingy. While millions were available for recruitment and training, sometimes only a few thousand dollars were disbursed for particular attacks, leaving Al Qaeda cells struggling to support themselves with petty crimes, like credit card fraud.
"The organization writ large has a lot of money," said William Wechsler, who headed counterterrorism for the National Security Council in the Clinton administration. "But go to any portion of it, and it is scraping by."

Faltering Attack on Finances
After Al Qaeda's deadly bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the Clinton administration began the first major effort to disrupt the network's financing.
President Clinton ordered the freezing of assets linked to Al Qaeda, including the funds of Ariana Afghan Airlines. His administration enlisted the support of Arab and Asian nations against Ariana, and Russia helped push through a resolution against the airline at the United Nations. Within a short time, the airline could no longer land outside Afghanistan. Other efforts to disrupt Al Qaeda's finances were less successful. Beginning in 1999, midlevel Clinton administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates seeking information about charities aiding Al Qaeda.
But Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. provided no assistance, American officials said, and with the embassy bombings receding into memory, the administration largely moved on. "These visits were not followed up by senior-level intervention by the State Department, or for that matter by Treasury, to those governments," said Stuart Eizenstadt, a former Treasury official and a participant in the trips. "I think that was interpreted by those governments as meaning this was not the highest priority."
When terrorists struck on Sept. 11, the assault on Al Qaeda's finances had largely fallen by the wayside. The American government had developed a good deal of information about Al Qaeda's finances, but it was not widely shared among agencies.
To coordinate government action, the Bush administration created a Policy Coordinating Committee, bringing together officials from Treasury, State, Justice, theNational Security Council, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. Two interagency groups, the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center and Operation Green Quest, were created to identify sources of cash for terrorists.

More Muscle for Authorities
Presidential authority has also been expanded. Until now, a president could block assets of foreign entities if a finding was made that they threatened the Middle East peace process. President Bush's Executive Order 13224 expanded the power of the Treasury's office of foreign asset control to block the property of individuals and entities that commit, threaten to commit or support terrorism.
The executive order "put the backers of terrorism on an equal footing as those who issue the orders," said David Aufhauser, the general counsel at the Treasury Department. Officials said the new rules allowed the administration to freeze the assets of a wide array of individuals and groups by better using some information, much of which the government has had for years.
But, even with the broader powers, the government has frequently chosen not to issue blocking orders on some organizations with apparent ties to terrorism. Instead, many of them are allowed to continue running, not realizing that the administration, working with foreign governments, has begun covert efforts to disrupt their operations and to trace the activities of other individuals and groups who do business with them.
Eventually, officials said, some of those organizations have been shut down once the covert efforts were completed. "It would be easy to put 120 names on the list," Mr. Aufhauser said. "The standards are accessible, and our library is full. The question is, is that the intelligent way to proceed?"
For example, officials said, the Bahamas, which has strict bank-secrecy laws, allowed American investigators to sift through records of a closed operation there of Al Taqwa bank, a financial network suspected of providing support to Al Qaeda.
This month, Al Taqwa was cited with Al Barakaat by the United States in an order blocking their assets.
That same day, Swiss authorities detained principals of Al Taqwa, officials in Dubai seized assets and records of Al Barakaat, and coordinated enforcement actions were taken throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
In the basement of F.B.I. headquarters, more than 178,000 financial documents have been stamped with identification numbers and filed away. Many are in foreign languages, with financial information in currencies other than dollars. But each potentially contains another bit of evidence on the financing of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The government believes that the attacks cost about $500,000. Just under half that -- $238,000 -- was sent to the hijackers in more than a dozen wires from the United Arab Emirates, officials said. Four wires have received particular attention. They were sent in June and July of last year under three different names -- Mustafa Ahmed Al-Hisawi; Almohtaram, an Arabic honorific; and Fawor Trading. But officials believe each of the transfers, totaling $110,000, came from Mr. Ahmed, whose name appears in numerous Al Qaeda records.
Government officials said additional money appeared to have been provided to the hijackers in cash. Investigators have tracked down Customs records showing that, on arriving in the United States, the hijackers and some of their acquaintances declared about $40,000 in cash. It is not clear if any of those other people had prior knowledge of the plot.
Also, the hijackers had "maxed out" all of their credit cards to help finance the operation, one official said.
While they were living in the United States, at least one of the hijackers appears to have received financial assistance from the American office of a Middle Eastern organization that helps people traveling overseas, officials said.
In addition, officials said, at least one entity cited in the President's blocking orders has turned out to have a direct financial connection with a hijacker.
As the inquiry proceeds, government officials said, the effort is as much directed at detecting financial patterns that could signal another potential attack as it is at unraveling the financing of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Despite the progress that has been made, there are some frustrations among law enforcement officials about the pace of the financial investigation, government officials said, largely resulting from the complexity of obtaining and analyzing a huge volume of foreign records.
Those difficulties have as yet prevented investigators from analyzing financial records from Germany, a focal point in the hijacking conspiracy.
Also, government officials said, until early November, the United Arab Emirates seemed to be dragging its feet on providing documentation -- a problem officials said has dissipated. 
Foreign and American officials said the level of cooperation between law enforcement worldwide has been unusual.
Still, experts said, quick victories on the financial front are unlikely.
"We have been going after organized crime's financial network since we put Al Capone away," said Mr. Wechsler, the former National Security Council official. "And while the Mafia is a shell of what it once was, we haven't stamped it out yet."

GRAPHIC: Photo: Osama bin Laden (pg. B4) Chart: "Untangling Al Qaeda's Money Web"The various ways money is funneled to Al Qaeda, according to government officials and court records. LEGITIMATE BUSINESSESWhile in Sudan, Osama bin Laden had an array of businesses -- including a construction company, a bakery and a cattle-breeding concern -- which were controlled by a Sudanese holding company, Wadi al-Aqiq. While many of those enterprises are believed to have been liquidated, Al Qaeda continued to generate money by operating through legitimate businesses. CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONSAfter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden learned that charitable groups could be used as fronts to raise money for jihad. Al Qaeda works with charitable fronts that direct money to terrorism, and has infiltrated legitimate groups for the purpose of diverting humanitarian contributions. Some Arab businessmen have contributed to these groups. FINANCIAL NETWORKSAl Qaeda had relationships with seemingly independent companies that served as financial fronts. One financial network, Al Barakaat in Sudan, was used by Somali emigrants to send money home to their families. Al Barakaat charged a transaction fee of about 5 percent for every remittance. Some of that money would then be given to Al Qaeda. TAPPING INTO GLOBAL UNRESTAl Qaeda has learned that it has success in troubled countries. The model was established in Bosnia, where Al Qaeda worked with organized crime. Through this network is ultimately able to profit from the trafficking of heroin, which moved from Afghanistan into Europe. FRAUD AND PETTY CRIMEWhile Al Qaeda's financial network is worth tens of millions of dollars a year, local cells are expected to help finance themselves. To accomplish that, many operatives engage in various financial frauds involving insurance, credit cards and welfare. Others turn to petty crimes, like robbery.(pg. B4)

HEADLINE: A Brash Rival for Venezuela's President 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
Alfredo Pena may be just the mayor of Caracas, but that did not stop him from visiting the State Department and the World Bank in Washington in October, antagonizing his rival, President Hugo Chavez.
 The mayor has called the president's friendship with Fidel Castro of Cuba "a barbarity" and his policies "absurd." He held a news conference to throw his support behind a nationwide work stoppage planned for Monday by businessmen protesting Mr. Chavez's new program for economic reform. 
 It is titillating political theater, but Mr. Pena seems to get immense pleasure from provoking Mr. Chavez, Venezuela's volatile leader, whom the mayor once supported. The message from the whitewashed colonial-style building on Plaza Bolivar that houses city hall seems clear: the pugnacious Mr. Pena is poised to take on Mr. Chavez.
Mr. Pena, 57, a former television talk show host whose booming, raspy voice belies his slight build, has emerged as the leading challenger to a president who has rolled over political opponents in his three-year remaking of Venezuela.
"The man of the day, the great opposition, is Pena," said Luis Vicente Leon, co-director of the Caracas polling firm Datanalisis. "There is no one else. He's way ahead."
Polls still indicate that Mr. Chavez, who won the presidency by promising to root out corruption and improve the lives of Venezuela's poor, would win an election if it were held now. But pollsters said his popularity had fallen recently, with his combative style alienating former allies and creating new enemies.
Mr. Pena, meanwhile, has risen. Consultores 21, another Caracas polling firm, found last month that 45 percent of respondents felt "closer" to Mr. Pena, compared with 35 percent for Mr. Chavez. Meanwhile, a Datanalisis poll released last week, with more general questions about popularity, indicated that most Venezuelans believe that Mr. Pena is the country's most important leader.
Mr. Pena, speaking in his ornate office, noted that the next election is not until 2006, and he would not say that he was out to topple Mr. Chavez. 
But his high-octane language -- filled with belittling comments not unlike the discourse that Mr. Chavez's supporters love -- tells another story. To the delight of the president's critics, the mayor told Mr. Chavez to "wash your mouth out with soap." Wagging his finger, he has accused the president of backing policies that foment hunger and of backing guerrillas in Colombia.
"I am very critical of the international policies of this government," Mr. Pena said in an unusually understated moment.
Responding to being called Little Bean III by Mr. Chavez (the two other beans were other opponents), Mr. Pena shot back, "The beans went to Chavez's head, but every crazy man has his day."
Anibal Romero, a political analyst, said that kind of discourse is an important tool in Mr. Pena's arsenal. "He is like Chavez in that way," Mr. Romero said. "He is not a politician for the middle and upper classes. He's a politician for the masses."
Mr. Pena acknowledged that he was acutely aware that his performance as mayor would open or close the door to his political aspirations.
He is also aware of the significance of the Chavez government's accusations of mismanagement against him, while, the mayor contends, withholding money the city needs. "Maybe that is why they are boycotting and sabotaging my administration, so I fail," Mr. Pena said. "Then they eliminate me politically."
Mr. Pena is fighting back by taking on one of Caracas's most intractable problems, crime, and highlighting every small victory.
Earlier this year, the mayor brought in William J. Bratton, who helped oversee New York's crime drop as police commissioner in the mid-1990's. With some of New York's tactics in place in the crime-plagued Catia district, killings fell to 276 in the first nine months of this year from 393 in the same period of 2000.
The federal government has responded by saying its use of National Guard troops on the streets is the real reason for the crime drop.
Mr. Chavez's allies accuse the mayor of being the most clever of opportunists, noting that Mr. Pena played an important role in Mr. Chavez's run for the presidency, later undertaking the important job of helping rewrite the Constitution.
Then Mr. Pena used Mr. Chavez as a steppingstone to become mayor, said Luis Miquilena, the interior and justice minister. 
"But his ego is of such magnitude, his modesty is so big, that he says he got there through his own merits," said Mr. Miquilena.
The relationship between the mayor's office and the Chavez administration soured even further after Mr. Pena visited Washington, where he stopped by the State Department and also sought aid for his anticrime programs from the World Bank. The National Assembly in Caracas responded by opening an investigation, charging that Mr. Pena might qualify as a "traitor to the country" for criticizing Venezuela abroad.
Mr. Pena has not backed down. He sealed a deal with the Hialeah Police Department in Florida to train 50 Caracas police officers and secured $8 million in technical assistance from the Japanese government to help prevent floods and landslides in poor neighborhoods.
"We're looking for help, we're looking for cooperation," he said. "Because we do not have much help here."

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Bush the Commander Is Political Leader, Too

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
George W. Bush had to perform a wide straddle between the war and home fronts last week, first at a cheery boost-the-economy town hall meeting in Orlando, Fla., then at a somber boost-the-troops speech on the gargantuan deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
 But unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said he had to put aside his domestic agenda as "Dr. New Deal" to become "Dr. Win-the-War," this president seems to be running between two emergency rooms at once. 
 Ostensibly, George Win-the-War and George the Compassionate Conservative playing Dr. New Deal enjoyed victories in the first week of December both domestic and foreign. Kandahar fell, and Mr. Bush's soaring popularity as commander in chief helped him win two crucial votes on Capitol Hill. One, in the Senate, holds down money to New York and domestic defense just as Mr. Bush wanted, and another in the House would give the president more power to negotiate trade deals.
But Osama bin Laden is still at large, and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has called the remaining task of flushing out stray Taliban from Afghanistan a "particularly dirty and unpleasant one." Almost as unsavory, at least to the men and women at the White House charged with negotiating with Capitol Hill, were the war cries from Democrats angry that Mr. Bush continues to back an economic stimulus bill that they say favors big corporations and the rich. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, who is to meet with the president over breakfast tomorrow, warned that Mr. Bush has to get involved in forging a compromise -- or else.
"I think now he needs to weigh in heavily if we're going to salvage this negotiation," Mr. Daschle said in an interview. "If we don't, there's going to be a lot of questions about who's unwilling to act in good faith and truly trying to govern here."
Translation: Democrats are preparing for their own war with the White House on the languishing economy, Mr. Bush's greatest vulnerability, in an attempt to win next year's elections and prepare for the 2004 presidential race.
An 18-page memorandum by three Democratic political veterans -- James Carville, Stanley B. Greenberg and Robert M. Shrum -- proclaimed: "Republican economic policies are oddly out of sync with the national mood currently sweeping America."
Mr. Bush was clearly steeling for the coming assault when he announced from the Oval Office last week that a close friend, Marc Racicot, the former two-term governor of Montana, would take over as the new chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Racicot will replace James S. Gilmore III, who is now serving out his term as governor of Virginia, after Democrats won gubernatorial races not only in New Jersey but in Mr. Gilmore's home state. Mr. Gilmore, who was singled out for recognition by Mr. Bush last week aboard the Enterprise in Norfolk, Va., had been forced out as Republican chairman by the White House only the week before -- proof, if any were needed, that partisan politics is alive and well even after Sept. 11.
Mr. Bush, as Dr. New Deal, also prepared for the political year ahead when he traveled on Tuesday to the home of Walt Disney World (and of his younger brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida) to promote a government program for laid-off workers. While he was at it, the president twice blamed the Democratic-controlled Senate for the deadlock over the stimulus bill, saying the senators "need to stop fussing and stop talking and get something to my desk."
It was the president's most overtly political performance since Sept. 11, and one in which an upbeat, noisy and almost cocky Mr. Bush talked up his brother, who is facing $1 billion in state budget cuts and a re-election fight next year, probably against Janet Reno, President Bill Clinton's attorney general.
The crowd at the Orange County Convention Center of more than 4,000 enthusiasts, many provided with tickets by the local Republican Party, seemed to adore the Brothers Bush.
The event was such a warm bath for the president that he loosened up enough to let slip a joke at the expense of his mother. Asked if he ate dinner with his family while growing up, the president said flippantly that he did -- "so long as my mother wasn't cooking." When the laughter died down, the president tried to dig his way out, not entirely successfully. "Just kidding, Mom," he said. "She was one of the great fast-food cooks of all time."
In contrast, Mr. Bush was a grave commander in chief aboard the Enterprise on Friday. In a speech on the 60th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Bush evoked the sacrifices of World War II as inspiration for the current war.
"Now, your calling has come," Mr. Bush told the ship's sailors, many of whom had launched the first air strikes toward Afghanistan on Oct. 7, when "The Big E," one of the world's largest aircraft carriers, was off the coast of Pakistan.
Mr. Bush's performance left many in the crowd impressed. "I never would have believed when he was running for president that he would be doing what he's doing now," said Eleanor Kearns, 78, who was an aviation machinist during World War II. "He looked like a wimp then. Now he looks like a man who can win."
But Ms. Kearns was referring to Dr. Win-the-War, not Dr. New Deal.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DOMESTIC DEFENSE; 
Cities and States Say Confusion and Cost Hamper U.S. Security Drive

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK and TIMOTHY EGAN 

 BODY:
After Sept. 11, the rush was on to construct Fortress America, with sentries patrolling cliffs above the Hudson River, newly deputized sea marshals boarding ships entering California ports and NATO pilots from Germany and Italy flying radar patrols high over the United States. 
 But for all the calls to vigilance in a domestic defense drive like no other, many state and local governments are starting to balk because of the costs and the frustration over what they see as the federal government's confusing stream of intelligence information and security alerts. 
 The need to control costs was reinforced last week when the Senate, backed by a veto threat from President Bush, rejected a Democratic plan that would have given the states $17 billion for domestic programs to combat terrorism. The Bush administration is expected to offer its own aid plan in a budget proposal next month. 
In setting up the White House Office of Homeland Security, Mr. Bush gave its director, Tom Ridge, a bully pulpit but little authority or money. The burden of posting the National Guard, inspecting trucks and watching bridges, chemical plants and dams has fallen to mayors and governors. 
As a result, security holes remain. There is the general vulnerability to bioterrorism, but there is also the vulnerability of specific potential targets like nuclear plants and oil refineries, which remain in considerable jeopardy, many state officials say. 
Some officials, like Gov. Gary E. Johnson of New Mexico, have resisted calls from Washington for more security, citing common sense. Others, like Gov. Angus King of Maine, fend off requests for extra protection of ports, tank farms and other private sites simply because they cannot afford it. 
"We just aren't financially geared up for this level of what is really a national defense expenditure," Mr. King said. "The question for us is where do you stop with providing security?"
Beyond the business of actual protection is the public's perception of security. State and city officials are still at loose ends over how to respond when the federal government issues vague warnings about possible terrorist acts. 
When Mr. Ridge announced last week that there might be more attacks against the United States as Ramadan, the Islamic holy month, wound down, officials like Mayor Jeff Griffin of Reno, Nev., were unsure how to react. 
"I'm concerned that we might lose the public on this," Mr. Griffin said. "I don't know what to tell them. 'Be vigilant'?"
It was the third general alert in three months. During the alert last month, Gov. Gray Davis of California was criticized for going public with warnings about possible attacks on West Coast bridges. He was told a few days after the alert was lifted of a more specific threat to the Golden Gate Bridge, and this time he did not sound a public alarm, though he stepped up security.
"You're dealing with a very unseemly level of informants," Mr. Davis said of trying to decipher intelligence. "We get briefings every day, and every governor has to make a choice."
Some officials feel that they do not have enough information to make informed choices.
Because his city is a principal port of call for tankers carrying liquefied natural gas, Boston's mayor, Thomas M. Menino, assumed he would be alerted to threats made on gas supplies in this country. But when Attorney General John Ashcroft announced recently that Osama bin Laden might have approved a plan for his followers to attack gas supplies, it was news to Mr. Menino.
"You know how I found that out?" Mr. Menino said. "Reading the Internet. Nobody called and told me. I think the first thing that should happen is the mayor should be contacted, because the mayor is on the front lines."
Mr. Ridge says he looks to the nation's 650,000 police officers to be the main guardians in the domestic security realm. Yet they can be the last to receive information. Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore complained that it took a month for the F.B.I. to put detailed information about people on its post-Sept. 11 watch list into the national crime database, which local and state police officers check when making any arrest or routine traffic stop.
"Unless they think they all graduated from the Osama bin Laden school of perfect driving, why wouldn't they ask us to be looking for these folks on traffic stops or speeding stops?" Mr. O'Malley said. "It's mind-boggling to me."
Then there are the conflicting messages from federal agencies. Al Berndt, the assistant director of the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, said that in late October, four agencies -- the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Justice, the Defense Department and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- passed on confusing information regarding two power plants. 
In response, the plants called the state and requested National Guard troops. "The information they were telling us differed from what the Department of Defense had told us moments before," Mr. Berndt said. "It didn't translate into what we were supposed to do." 
Several mayors complained about restrictions on intelligence sharing between federal investigators and state and local law enforcement. Mayor Griffin of Reno, who learned from television that federal agents were investigating a letter suspected of containing anthrax that was received by a Microsoft office, said that mayors and police chiefs had to fill out onerous clearance forms to obtain crucial information. Some of those restrictions would be lifted under a bill introduced in Congress.
Inadequate communication is not just a security issue, but an economic one, mayors say.
"We don't want to scare people to the point where they're not working or shopping or flying or going to school," said Mayor Patrick McCrory of Charlotte, N.C., who wrote to Mr. Ridge several weeks ago asking that cities be given explicit information about the severity of a threat.
A panic-driven economic slowdown in turn shapes security, Mr. McCrory said. 
"Every time an alert came out, people canceled their trips," he said. "That affects not just airlines, but hotels, rental cars and restaurants and taxicabs -- and our tax revenues. Next thing, we don't have a resource to pay for the police."
Concerns like this prompted several mayors to meet with Mr. Ridge last month. They were generally pleased with his pledge to try to improve things. Mr. Ridge has referred to the issue in speeches, saying, "The national strategy that the president envisions will involve all levels of government, federal state and local." 
The F.B.I.'s director, Robert S. Mueller III, has also agreed to take steps toward better coordination with local law enforcement officials. 
But better communication does not mean more money or authority. Mr. Ridge cannot commit the federal government to protect, or require states and private business to protect, many potential targets: chemical plants, refineries, gas and oil pipelines and trucks carrying tankers of lethal compounds across the interstates. 
One exception is nuclear facilities, which are governed by a single federal agency -- the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- that can order security steps using the leverage of withholding operating licenses. Still, the plants remain at risk. While the reactors themselves are well protected, the 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel that is usually housed just outside the main reactor shells remains particularly vulnerable. 
A study last year by the commission suggested that breaching the storage cask of a spent fuel tank could create a radiation leak larger than the release from a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon. 
Thirteen states have called out the National Guard to help protect their plants. One is New York, where about 20 million people live within 50 miles of the Indian Point nuclear plant. But other states say they cannot afford that level of protection.
Nor can many states, especially poorer ones like West Virginia, afford other basic security measures. 
For a time after Sept. 11, West Virginia ordered all trucks carrying hazardous material to stop at weigh stations for inspection once inside the state border. Now, however, several dozen inspectors are roaming the roads, pulling over trucks at random to inspect licenses in a hit-or-miss effort. 
"Without a lot of extra money, there is simply no way we can protect most of our infrastructure," said Bill Case, a spokesman for Gov. Bob Wise.
Mayor Bob Corker of Chattanooga, Tenn., made a similar point. "You have all kinds of chemicals being transported back and forth, in and out of your city," he said. "And at the end of the day, you wonder how much you can really do." 
Many states have already begun to set limits on security spending. The Wisconsin building commission just scrapped plans to build a $1.7 million fence around the State Capitol after Gov. Scott McCallum questioned whether the extra safety was worth the expense.
In Maine, which is facing $31 million in one-time security costs and expects recurring annual costs of $20 million, Governor King was relieved when his security experts told him there was no pressing need to send the National Guard in to help guard the defunct Maine Yankee nuclear plant. He had been worried about setting an expensive precedent.
"What happens when you start providing government security to private facilities is if you say yes to one, how do you say no to the next and the next?" said Mr. King, who added that 1,000 Guard troops cost about $40 million a year. "There's the tank farm, the port of Portland, and everywhere else. I've already gotten calls from them, gotten letters from them." 
Some mayors and governors wonder how much they can cut basic services to keep up with the calls for vigilance. In Baltimore, where Mayor O'Malley estimates security will cost $19 million through this fiscal year, all nonemergency departments have been asked to reduce budgets by 4 percent, he said. "Last year, I had to raise taxes, close seven firehouses, five libraries and privatize 250 jobs in order to make up that kind of money," Mayor O'Malley said. 
In Idaho, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, a strong ally of Mr. Bush's, has been widely criticized for blocking entrances and putting up barricades in Boise, the capital.
"I think a lot of citizens are questioning this effort," Mr. Kempthorne said. "If nothing happens, no further attacks, these questions will remain in perpetuity. But if something does happen, the public would never forgive us for being unprepared."

Unpaid Pipers In a City Of Resilience

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THERE were pessimists who were despairing and optimists who were encouraging, which makes perfect sense. Both were talking about New York City, which delights in eluding typecasting. 
 The event was a weekend conference of the Citizens Budget Commission, the civic watchdog and research group that is wont to shake its fiscally prudent finger at mayors who inevitably stray. 
 That in fact emerged as the unofficial theme of the event at the IBM Palisades Conference Center in Rockland County: the stubborn inclination of mayors to spend in good times, making it tougher in the bad times. 
Even under Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican who promised fiscal prudence, the municipal work force expanded to 250,000 -- 6,600 more than when he took office; city debt grew to 17 percent of the budget from 5 percent, and budget surpluses generated by a booming economy were rolled from one year into the next rather than being set aside for the inevitable rainy day. 
Now, Mr. Giuliani leaves Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg an anticipated budget gap projected to be $3.5 billion to more than $4 billion, more than any of the last four mayors have had to close in a single year. Economists blame the recession, exacerbated by Sept. 11, and the administration's policies. It spent when it had the money.
"It's just the way it is, unless something or someone changes it," said Eugene J. Keilin, chairman of the commission. "But if we keep doing what we've been doing, we'll ultimately have to pay the piper."
The pattern is the same going way back, the big crunch coming in the mid-1970's, with the fiscal crisis that banished the kind of egregious fiscal irresponsibility that brought the city to near-bankruptcy. But with the return of fiscal stability also came generous spending whenever the economy permitted.
No mayor has yet gotten elusive productivity savings from the municipal unions, or restructured property taxes or undertaken any other fundamental budget reforms favored by fiscal experts.
Mayors have their own priorities: Edward I. Koch jump-started the rebirth of the Bronx by building housing for the poor. David N. Dinkins, facing a crime wave, began expanding the police force. Mr. Giuliani spent on safety, education and tax cuts. 
"It's called democracy: elections," said Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller. "It's an imperative of governing and decision-making, knowing you have to fix schools, subways, keep the city safe. It's not a question of bad faith but of a mindset. The mindset is short term." Especially now, with term limits. Why deal with long-term debt if it's not going to be your problem?
For optimism, the conference turned to history.
And Kenneth T. Jackson, president of the New-York Historical Society, noted that New York City has always reinvented itself, even as many other cities deteriorated, unable to adjust to the rise of suburbia, the decline in manufacturing, the competition of cheap labor and other strains.
NEW YORK has distinct strengths, said Mr. Jackson, a history professor at Columbia University and editor in chief of the "Encyclopedia of New York City." Contrary to its general reputation, the city is comparatively honest and safe, he said, citing its relative freedom from large-scale corruption, and the ability of mayors to find a "balance between freedom and order." The city also delivers basic services efficiently, he said, and has enough good private, parochial and elite public schools to keep the middle class and the affluent from fleeing to the suburbs.
And, he said, it elects mayors every now and then who convey "a sense of leadership and enthusiasm," creating an atmosphere that draws and retains people and businesses. Mr. Jackson noted that a half-century ago, the city seemed unstoppable. Everything looked great. But the general impression was wrong. Big trouble loomed, from the decline of manufacturing and the port to racial strife and competition from the Sunbelt.
Today, things look dire. Or maybe not. Mr. Jackson cited a 1934 quotation from Charles E. Merriam, then a professor at the University of Chicago: "The trouble with Lot's wife was that she looked backward and saw Sodom and Gomorrah," he told the United States Conference of Mayors. "If she had looked forward, she would have seen that heaven is also pictured as a city."
Judging from a weekend in the Palisades, if heaven in New York is productivity enhancements, the city is in trouble. If it's defined as resilience, the place could make it through yet one more time.

HEADLINE: Pataki, Giuliani and Bloomberg Return an Israeli Condolence Call 

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
This time, ground zero was in Jerusalem.
 It was a downtown pizza shop where a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 15 people in August. It was a pedestrian mall a minute's walk away, on Ben-Yehuda Street, where two other suicide bombers took 11 lives the night of Dec. 1, during a weekend when 26 Israelis died in explosions here and in Haifa. 
 So many people have made pilgrimages of solidarity to ground zero in Lower Manhattan that New York's leading elected officials felt they should do the same for another city reeling from terrorism.
And so today they packed themselves and their entourages into two planes -- Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg in one, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the other -- for a lightning visit that lasted barely half a day. 
But it was some half a day. The flying New Yorkers were practically in perpetual motion.
They went to the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City, planted trees at the terror site on Ben-Yehuda Street, visited wounded victims still in hospitals, called on President Moshe Katsav and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and took part in a candle-lighting ceremony at the start of Hanukkah.
Most of all, they vowed that Israel and America were shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism.
"We're together with you," Mr. Giuliani said. "We are bound by blood."
Mr. Bloomberg said: "The terrorism just has to stop, and both Americans and Israelis have to work together to stop it. But not just Americans and Israelis. We all have to work together."
And Mr. Pataki said they had simply had to come. He noted that when Mr. Sharon was in New York nine days ago, he went to ground zero, the World Trade Center site. His trip to the United States was cut short by the terrorism in Jerusalem and Haifa the very next day. "I knew as soon as I saw that on television that we should be here," the governor said.
By coming here, the New Yorkers ignored a State Department advisory urging Americans to stay away. They did not move entirely in lock-step, though. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg flew on Mr. Bloomberg's private jet. Mr. Giuliani and his group, including his friend Judith Nathan, arrived about an hour later on a plane offered by Donald J. Trump. The mayor also went to the Western Wall on his own, and visited patients at one hospital while the others went to another.
Protocol dictated that Mr. Pataki was the senior figure. The November election results suggested that Mr. Bloomberg was the man of the hour (not to mention that he was the only Jew among the three visiting the Jewish state). But the star, hands down, was Mr. Giuliani, popular with Israelis even before Sept. 11 and its aftermath gave him international luster.
His appeal was evident from the enormous cheers that he drew wherever he went. It was evident from the man on Ben-Yehuda Street who shouted in Hebrew the equivalent of "Mr. Giuliani, way to go!" It was evident from chants of "Rudy, Rudy" by a knot of young New Yorkers among the many hundreds gathered in Zion Square for the Hanukkah candle-lighting. It was evident from the middle-aged woman who rushed up to him -- forcing the police to hold her back -- and said in English, "Mr. Giuliani, I love you."
The message was consistent throughout the day: unity in the war against terrorism and solidarity between New Yorkers and Jerusalemites.
In fact, there are considerable differences in the nature of the terrorism each has faced. As horrible as the Sept. 11 attack was at the World Trade Center, it was a blow at a symbol of America's economic might. In Jerusalem, bombs go off with chilling regularity at places notable for being utterly ordinary: cafes, buses, pizzerias. That kind of terrorism in New York would be, for example, the destruction of a nondescript diner.
After Sept. 11, Jerusalem temporarily renamed Jaffa Road, one of its main thoroughfares, New York Street. A "New York Street" sign was put up again today near the pizzeria that was bombed in August, a Sbarro's outlet that was quickly rebuilt and reopened a month later.
On Ben-Yehuda Street, the New Yorkers planted oak and maple trees.
Given the centrality of that location, the oak and maple may get better treatment than an olive tree planted in a Jerusalem park eight years ago by Mayor David N. Dinkins, a few months before he lost City Hall to Mr. Giuliani. That spindly tree, not much bigger than a sprout, stands where few people can see it on a site that seems not to have been cleared of trash for some time.
At a luncheon given by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Mr. Giuliani said he had left the United States only four times in his eight years as mayor, and three of those trips were to Israel. (The fourth was to the Dominican Republic in 1998 after it was devastated by Hurricane Georges.) "So I'm a half Israeli citizen now," he said.
Without question, the most emotional moments were the hospital visits. Most of the victims at the pedestrian mall, a place popular with young people, were teenagers, some still struggling to recover.
At Shaarei Tzedek Hospital, Mr. Giuliani offered words of encouragement to Yonatan Baranik, 18, a frail young man battling cancer. He had gone with friends to Ben-Yehuda Street for ice cream, to celebrate because he was getting better. "Shalom, get well quickly," the mayor said to him, mentioning his own fight with prostate cancer.
In another room, he and Ms. Nathan saw Leah Saban, also 18, who had suffered burns over almost her entire body. Ms. Nathan left in tears. "It was very difficult, very difficult, to see the children so badly hurt," she said.
At the same time, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg were across town at Hadassah Hospital, where they called on Joseph Leifer, 29, of Borough Park, Brooklyn. Mr. Leifer had been hit in the legs and lower back by pieces of the bomb, packed with screws, bolts and nails. He sat in a wheelchair, and said he hoped to return home in a few days.
Mr. Bloomberg handed him a sheaf of letters written by New York schoolchildren, and invited him to his mayoral inauguration next month. And Mr. Pataki told Mr. Leifer, "They may have injured your legs, but they haven't injured your spirit."
There were a few light moments. Mayor Ehud Olmert of Jerusalem took note of the devastating effect that the last 14 months of nonstop killing had had on tourism. According to the Tourism Ministry, the number of visitors to Israel was down 52 percent in the first 10 months of 2001 compared with the same period last year. 
"Maybe you could stay a little longer," Mr. Olmert said to Mr. Giuliani. "We could give you a good rate."
But there was no escaping the day's serious purpose, a point driven home when Avi Avitan spoke to the crowd in Zion Square. His son, Assaf, was among those killed on Dec. 1. He was 15, about the same age as nearly all the dead.
"Have you forgotten, Lord," Mr. Avitan said, his voice cracking, "that they are only children?"

 Wheat and Hunger

Q. How is wheat processed to be delivered for relief, in Afghanistan, for example?

A. Wheat is most stable when shipped in the form of whole wheat, said Dr. Joseph H. Hotchkiss, professor of food science at Cornell University.
 The United States Agency for International Development issues guidelines for commodities used in food relief. For whole wheat, important considerations include a sturdy, ultraviolet-resistant bag and control of moisture, which should not exceed 13.5 percent. At 14 percent and above, Dr. Hotchkiss said, wheat is likely to grow mold, producing powerful carcinogens like afflatoxin. 
However, "to supply wheat is not to supply food," Dr. Hotchkiss stressed, because it must be processed into a palatable form, and unground wheat, with its rough husk, is very hard on the teeth and not appetizing.
The basic steps are to reduce it in size (by removing the husk and crushing or grinding it) and then to separate it into its components of starch, fat and wheat germ. It can be turned into noodles, or kneaded and leavened so that it will rise when baked into bread.
Wheat has long been a staple of Afghans. But people in other areas of the world, particularly where rice is the staple, may not know how to make wheat edible. There have even been cases, Dr. Hotchkiss said, in which sacks of grain from relief shipments were stacked to build houses instead of being eaten.

HEADLINE: ESSAY; 
Cracking the Cosmic Code With a Little Help From Dr. Hawking

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE 

 BODY:
Like some quantum particle popping into existence out of nowhere, "The Universe in a Nutshell," by the University of Cambridge physicist Stephen W. Hawking, was published and immediately popped onto the best-seller lists a few weeks ago.
 Physicists say such magical seeming appearances, called quantum fluctuations, are more likely when there is a large energy field to draw from, and this book draws from one of the largest energy fields in the history of publishing, namely Dr. Hawking's 1988 book, "A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes." 
 As a result, many thousands of Americans could spend the holidays confronting statements like: "We have come to realize that this standing still of real and imaginary time (either both stand still or neither does) means that space-time has a temperature, as I discovered for black holes," as Dr. Hawking writes on Page 63. 
Dr. Hawking's first book for a wide audience, "A Brief History of Time,"took readers on a tour through black holes, the gravitational traps from which not even light can emerge, and imaginary time as he described the quest for the vaunted "theory of everything" that would enable us to "know the mind of God." It lived on the best-seller lists for two years, selling 10 million copies.
The question that still haunts publishers, critics and others, incredulous that there could be as big an audience for a serious discussion of the origin of the universe as for the life of a movie star, is why?
According to popular and publishing lore, it was also one of the great unread classics of our time -- with James Joyce's "Finnegan's Wake" or David Foster Wallace's "Infinite Jest" as coffee-table monuments honored mostly in the breach. So a lot of people, suspicious that the earlier book was bought for Dr. Hawking's celebrity or its egghead aura -- are already wondering if the same thing will happen to the new book.
To colleagues, Dr. Hawking is a stubbornly intuitive theorist whose work on black holes has helped light the way to an eventual union of relativity and quantum theory -- a union that neither Einstein nor anybody else has yet been able to broker. To the world, he is the personification of courage and brilliance, St. George in a wheelchair tilting with galaxies and the unknown, who as been accorded some of the ultimate accolades in pop culture -- appearing as Einstein's poker buddy on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," and as a guest star on "The Simpsons."
While a graduate student, in 1963, he learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and was given a few years to live. He has moved about in a wheelchair for more than 25 years and now speaks only through a voice synthesizer. Dr. Hawking, for whom the word "puckish" seems to have been invented, has often said his disability is an advantage because it frees him to sit and think. Next month his colleagues will celebrate his 60th birthday with a weeklong all-star symposium in Cambridge.
In the new book's introduction, Dr. Hawking admits that "A Brief History of Time" was "not easy going" and laments that some readers got stuck and did not finish it. He has tried, he says, to make this one easier. Slightly longer than the earlier book, "Nutshell," at 216 pages, is embellished with colorful illustrations that give it a coffee-table-book look.
So far the critics are in qualified agreement; one, Bryan Appleyard in the The New Statesman of London, called it "difficult, though not absolutely so." The Times of London, did an informal poll, asking seven reporters and a math student to read it and report on its accessibility. The verdict was mixed. "It all made beautiful sense as I read it, though it tended to vanish like a dream when I put the book down," one wrote.
Albert Einstein once said that scientific theories should be able to be described so simply that a child could understand them. Complaints that modern physics fails this standard abysmally are as old, well, as modern physics, and are not confined to the childlike public.
The story goes that when the astronomer Arthur Eddington, whose observations of light bending during a solar eclipse in 1919 confirmed Einstein's general theory of relativity, was congratulated by a colleague on being one of the three people in the world who understood the abstruse theory, Eddington fell uncharacteristically silent. Chided for exhibiting a false modesty, Eddington replied, on the contrary, that he had been trying to imagine who the third person could be.
This newspaper's early accounts of Einstein's and Eddington's 1919 breakthroughs focused on the theory's incomprehensibility. "Efforts made to put in words intelligible to the nonscientific public the Einstein theory of light proved by the eclipse expedition so far have not been very successful," began a article on Nov. 10, 1919.
Niels Bohr, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, once said that anyone who was not outraged on hearing about the theory -- with its waves acting as particles, particles acting like waves, and the microscopic randomness and uncertainty it ascribed to nature -- had not really understood it.
Recent advances have made it even harder to explain the universe. The latest version of the putative theory of everything posits a universe with 10 or 11 dimensions, instead of the 3 of space and 1 of time of everyday experience, inhabited by wriggling strings or membranes. Nevertheless, scientists go on gamely trying to tell us what they are up to, in a book-writing tradition that includes Darwin's "Origin of Species," and Einstein's, "Relativity: The Special and the General Theory," written in 1916 and never out of print. 
Part of the lure of these books is the chance to reclaim one's citizenship in a troubled and baffling cosmos by hearing the word from the horse's mouth, from someone who has touched the cosmic mystery personally. But another part is surely being treated like an adult, of entering a rough-hewn colleagueship by being trusted to put work into deciphering statements like the one at the beginning of this essay, or to deal with straight talk of the nature of science and the universe.
Here, for example, is Dr. Hawking about those troublesome extra dimensions required by string theory but apparently unavailable for parking cars. "I must say that personally, I have been reluctant to believe in extra dimensions," he writes on Page 54 of the new book. "But as I am a positivist, the question 'Do extra dimensions really exist?' has no meaning. All one can ask is whether mathematical models with extra dimensions provide a good description of the universe."
In other words, if the experiments come out right, it doesn't matter. This could be considered jarring if you cling to the notion that science is the search for a reality that is deeper than the measurements on a laboratory table. But, quantum theory and relativity have taught us, science is about what can be observed and measured or it is about nothing at all. In science, as in democracy, there is no hidden secret knowledge, all that counts is on the table, observable and falsifiable. All else is metaphysics.
When it comes to putting the goods on the table without condescending, Dr. Hawking is a genius. While many authors of science books plough through chapters full of fundamentals before getting to the new stuff, Dr. Hawking, with perhaps a heightened appreciation of time, breezes speedily to the frontier without apologies.
For those who cannot keep up, Dr. Hawking has also provided a legacy. The success of his earlier book and that of Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" are widely credited with having given a commercial lift to the science-book genre, helping pave the way for efforts like "The Elegant Universe," by Dr. Brian Greene, a Columbia University string theorist; "The Inflationary Universe," by Dr. Alan Guth, cosmologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and "The Quark and the Jaguar," by the Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann.
To the extent that Dr. Hawking's earlier success has spawned imitators and widened the circle of readers and their sophistication, he has engineered a kind of positive feedback, and he has increased the odds that the readers will follow him and get to the end of the book this time.

An Old Enemy, Smoking, Hangs Tough

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
The obituaries all said that George Harrison died of cancer. But, in fact, what killed Mr. Harrison was smoking.
 Although public reports of his medical history are somewhat scanty, certain facts are clear. In 1997 he was treated for throat cancer, which he himself attributed to many years of smoking. He said at the time that he had quit smoking and that his doctors anticipated a complete cure. 
 But just four years later, he underwent surgery for lung cancer, followed by radiation therapy for a tumor in his brain, where lung cancer commonly spreads. A few months later, Mr. Harrison was dead.
Some 440,000 Americans succumb each year to the deadly effects of tobacco smoke. As the nation's single leading cause of death and disability, smoking costs our economy some $70 billion a year. Up to half of all long-term smokers will prematurely develop a debilitating disease, most often heart disease, chronic lung disease or cancer.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women, killing 70 percent more women each year than breast cancer. From 1950 to 1991, lung cancer in women rose by 550 percent, and from 1960 to 1990, the death rate from lung cancer in women rose by more than 400 percent. 

Worrisome Trends
What will it take to persuade the 48 million Americans who still smoke to quit, and what will it take to keep the 3,000 teenagers who each day start smoking to resist this deadly addiction?
Antismoking forces, who can count among their achievements the current bans on smoking in nearly all public buildings, hospitals and airlines, most workplaces and many restaurants, have failed to counter the public image of smoking as widespread and socially desirable, an image that is extensively portrayed through cigarette advertising and especially through movies. Tobacco companies now regularly invest in movies and receive in return a silent endorsement of their products in films.
In fact, after a three-decade decline, smoking in movies has returned to the level it was in films from the early 1960's, before the first surgeon general's report condemned smoking as a major health hazard. A study by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco revealed that in films from the 1970's and 1980's, tobacco was used about once every 10 to 15 minutes, but in movies from the 1990's, the rate was every 3 to 5 minutes.
"As in tobacco advertising, tobacco use in the movies is associated with youthful vigor, good health, good looks and personal and professional acceptance," the researchers, Dr. Stanton A. Glantz and Theresa F. Stockwell, reported.
Another study by researchers at Dartmouth College found that smoking was prominent in more than 85 percent of the top 25 box-office hits for each year from 1988 through 1997. Furthermore, tobacco brands were shown as often in films suitable for teenagers as they were in films for adult audiences, as well as in 20 percent of films rated for children. Some of the most popular film stars, like Julia Roberts, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jim Carrey, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brad Pitt, smoke on camera.
In a soon-to-be-published study, another group of researchers demonstrated that the more smoking middle school children see in movies, the more likely they are to experiment with tobacco. At my neighborhood movie theater, I have to hold my breath as I wend my way through the horde of teenagers and young adults puffing away outside the entrance.
The rate of regular tobacco use by 18- to 24-year-olds, once half that among older adults, now equals it. Dr. Glantz said that while antismoking efforts were being focused on children in the 1980's and early 90's, the tobacco industry shifted its marketing focus to 18- to 24-year-olds, with astounding success. In just four years, from 1993 to 1997, smoking rates among college students rose by 28 percent, so that 28 percent of students smoked, a higher rate than for adults on the whole. 
The recent rise in smoking rates among middle school and high school students may be even more of a worry. A study published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 1999 demonstrated that the younger a person was when starting to smoke, the more likely that person would suffer extensive DNA damage that could lead to lung cancer years later. Furthermore, in people who smoked as adolescents, the body does not repair damaged DNA as well as in those who began smoking at a later age.

Tobacco Control Can Work
The United States Public Health Service has a goal to reduce adult smoking prevalence to 12 percent by the year 2010, a target that many people find daunting since the current rate is 23 percent to 26 percent. But in the Dec. 5 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Glantz and his co-authors, Asaf Bitton and Caroline Fichtenberg, submit that this goal is achievable through a reinvigorated tobacco control program financed by the billions of dollars available to states from the industry through the 1998 settlement agreement. 
They suggest aggressive antitobacco media campaigns focusing on industry lies and the dangers of secondhand smoke and nicotine addiction, as well as community-based efforts that foster clean indoor air laws and that counter pro-tobacco influences.
At the same time, however, stronger efforts are needed to help people quit smoking. The Ad Hoc Working Group on Treatment of Tobacco Dependence, in a recent article in the journal Preventive Medicine, said "effective treatments for tobacco dependence do exist" but for them to work "financial barriers to treatment must be reduced, and consistent, high-quality treatment services must be ensured for all tobacco users who seek them."
The group called upon insurance providers to cover the costs of stop-smoking treatments, which have been shown to be more cost-effective than programs that insurance now covers like screening mammography and treatments for high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol.
Surveys have consistently shown that most adult smokers in this country want to stop smoking. Studies have also indicated that primary care physicians can have a major influence on helping people quit smoking. The ad hoc group noted that "70 percent of smokers see a clinician each year; if clinicians provided brief interventions to all smokers (at a cost of $3 per smoker), the national annual quit rate could be more than doubled." Adding brief behavioral counseling and medication, like the antidepressant bupropion and nicotine substitutes, "could more than triple the annual quit rate," the group said.
Perhaps the strongest efforts should be directed toward women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Smoking increases the chances of infertility, miscarriage, stillbirth and prematurity; and for babies born healthy, exposure to tobacco smoke in the womb and during early childhood can impair their lung function throughout childhood. Secondhand smoke is a killer, increasing a child's risk of developing asthma and pneumonia and an adult's chances of developing heart disease, lung cancer and breast cancer.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 22, 2001

 CORRECTION:
The Personal Health column in Science Times on Dec. 11, about the prevalence of smoking referred incorrectly to arrangements between tobacco companies and movie producers. Tobacco companies say they do not pay to have their products placed in movies, and they are forbidden to do so under the terms of a settlement with 46 state attorneys general.

 Re "Why Grade Inflation Is Serious" (editorial, Dec. 9): Grade inflation is one of the best arguments for standardized tests. 
While graduate school admission tests were designed for admission officers to compare students from one college to another, the tests are also used to compare students from the same college. 
 Standardized tests level the playing field. If one student had a difficult major with strict teachers, the test allows her to show her ability compared with the student who floated through school taking the easy courses from known easy graders.

HEADLINE: Manager's Exit Is Another Blow to ABB 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
The Swiss-Swedish industrial group ABB Ltd. lost its second top manager in three weeks and its third in 2001 today, at a time when concerns about its financial exposure to asbestos lawsuits in the United States have been revived in investors' minds.
 Renato Fassbind, 46, resigned as chief financial officer to become chief executive of a Swiss international trading house, Diethelm Keller Holding, ABB said today. Mr. Fassbind had been with ABB since 1997. It named Peter Voser, chief financial officer of Shell Worldwide Oil Products, to succeed Mr. Fassbind. 
 On Nov. 21, ABB lost its chairman, Percy Barnevik, who was instrumental in building the company into Europe's biggest electrical engineering group. Mr. Barnevik said his resignation was in part to accept responsibility for the company's poor recent performance. He was replaced by Jurgen Dormann of Aventis, the French drug maker.
ABB changed chief executives in January, with Jorgen Centerman replacing Goran Lindahl, who was dismissed by the board. ABB now has no senior manager who has been in place for more than two years. 
ABB's share price has fallen nearly 60 percent this year on a string of developments that have unnerved investors, beginning with a drop in demand for the company's drilling equipment and robots as the global economy began to slow. Making matters worse was a revelation early this year, in documents related to listing the stock on the New York Stock Exchange, that there were 90,000 asbestos-related suits pending against ABB in the United States.
News of such widespread exposure drew the ire of ABB's biggest shareholder, the financier Martin Ebner, who roundly criticized management for not being more forthcoming earlier. 
A court decision in the United States on Friday against a competitor, Halliburton, renewed investors' jitters about asbestos liability and sent ABB's stock skittering. It fell 1.55 Swiss francs (93 cents), or 8.2 percent, to 17.3 Swiss francs in Zurich; in New York, the American depository receipts lost $1.05, or 9.4 percent, to $10.10. Each A.D.R. represents one registered share.
Kurt Schiltknicht, Mr. Ebner's chief aide, said today that Mr. Ebner's investment group would continue to hold its 10.1 percent stake in ABB.
Analysts said that though they were encouraged that ABB was quickly able to replace Mr. Fassbind with a senior manager from a major company, the larger question of stability at the top of the company was still open. 
"There is a lot of coming and going, which may be a general renewal of management," said Alessandro Migliorini, of Banque Pictet in Geneva. "But the company also appears to have lost a lot of good managers." On the matter of asbestos, he said, "There are some signs that all is not well, despite the recent restructuring."
A briefing note from ABN Amro to its customers noted that ABB's asbestos exposure "remains a black box in our view." 
Thomas Ringkvist, a Paris-based analyst for BNP Paribas, noted several nagging worries about the company, including a stretched balance sheet, rising debt, constricted cash flow and reports in Swedish newspapers that its recent reorganization had been chaotic. 
ABB announced plans in October to speed elimination of 12,000 jobs out of 160,000 worldwide, and said it expected a 10 percent fall in profits.
The company also announced a strategic shift out of the climate-control business, saying it would sell its air treatment unit to a Luxembourg-based investment company, Global Air Movement, for $225 million. "The air handling business is undergoing a period of consolidation, and we feel the new owners are in a better position to grow and sustain these operations," Mr. Centerman said in a statement.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Madison Ave. Grapples With Post-Sept. 11 Era

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Three months after Sept. 11, Madison Avenue continues struggling to determine the right tone, approach and content for post-attack campaigns. The result has been advertising that is often strained or off-putting, even inappropriate.
 Only a handful of ads have managed to strike evocative chords by walking the fine line between exploitation and empathy. 
 Compared with the high-minded work that agencies created during World War II, much of it demanding sacrifice from citizens, today's advertising relies far more on reassurances that victory is achievable through sybaritism. The mantra of the booming economy of the 1990's, "Shop till you drop," has been replaced with a millennium mutation: "Shop till Osama drops." 
Consumers, moreover, could be excused for thinking they are shopping in a parallel universe, or perhaps more accurately, a series of parallel universes.
In one universe, patriotism is paramount as marketers paint their brands red, white and blue and proclaim, "My country, right or wrong" -- usually wrongly.
Who will ever forget, try as they may, when the Miller Brewing division of Philip Morris ran a commercial in which people held up signs with messages like "We are all New Yorkers" and "I will not be terrorized!" or the day Kmart ran an American flag as an ad, which urged readers to "embrace freedom" by tearing out and displaying it ("This side up").
In this universe, the product being peddled in a jingoistic spot or star-spangled banner ad can be patriotism itself, in the form of tasteless American flag Post-it Notes from 3M; tacky "Promise of Freedom" eagle figurines from Franklin Mint, a unit of Roll International; or tawdry "patriotic thong panties" from Frederick's of Hollywood, festooned with flags and the words "America the Beautiful."
In another universe, the mood is somber, and no commerce can be transacted without a nod, respectful or unctuous, to the victims of the attacks and their families. "We will never forget," promises a bizarre newspaper ad for General Electric by the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, owned by the Omnicom Group. The ad shows a defiant Statue of Liberty striding off her pedestal and rolling up her sleeves, as if brought to life by poltergeist in the finale of a movie called "Ghostbusters Go to War."
A commercial by the same agency for Visa made a similar point more subtly. Meant to encourage people to resume buying theater tickets, the spot presents an elegiac version of "Give My Regards to Broadway" sung by Judy Collins as scenes appear of actors getting ready for a performance.
In still another universe, doing well by doing good is the operative scheme, centered on pledges to contribute to Sept. 11-related charities and causes. For instance, a print ad for the Discover credit card lists merchandise from coffee beans to garden hose to movie tickets and asserts, "Just by doing what you do every day, you can help the families and victims of Sept. 11."
The ad, by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, also owned by Omnicom, goes on to explain that "every time you use your Discover Card" -- either the regular version or the "Discover American Flag Card" -- the company will donate to "America's relief efforts, until we reach our goal of $5 million." Welcome to Sacrifice Lite: no muss, no fuss, no messy commitment. Discover is a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
In other instances, it is donor beware, as the budget for self-congratulatory ads to promote the philanthropy can be larger than the actual sum being given away.
In a final universe, the determination has been made to resume the routine as if nothing has happened; ads maintain their normal funny, cloying or annoying attitudes. In this universe, populated primarily by beers, video games, fast food and snacks, the smiles seem forced, the enthusiasm too enthusiastic, not unlike the laughter at a cocktail party to divert attention from a guest's faux pas.
The reason for those confusing multiple realities is not difficult to determine. Never before have agencies and advertisers had to figure out how to aim sales pitches at a public grappling with simultaneous situations of domestic terrorism, recession, biohazards and war.
Moreover, the intertwining of the fate of the nation with the fate of the economy has brought a blurring of the distinction between altruistic public service advertising, which Madison Avenue traditionally produces during national crises, and campaigns capitalizing on Sept. 11 for capitalistic purposes, intended to keep commercial interests afloat.
Take for instance the campaign for General Motors carrying the theme "Keep America rolling," which sought successfully to stimulate automobile sales after Sept. 11 with zero-percent loans. The first print ad spent two paragraphs recounting how "the world as we knew it came to a halt" and how the attacks "shook us to our very core."
Then the ad shrewdly took a brisk U-turn: "Now it's time to move forward. For years, the auto industry has played a crucial role in our economy. General Motors takes that responsibility seriously." The ad, by the Troy, Mich., office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, concluded with this deft blend of selflessness and self-interest: "This may very well be the most serious crisis our nation has ever faced. In this time of terrible adversity, let's stand together. And keep America rolling."
How? Why, by spending tens of thousands of dollars on a new G.M. car, truck or minivan.
Another unsettling example of this peculiar interweaving of national and commercial interests is a spot from the New York office of McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, for the Travel Industry Association of America. 
The spot, tellingly titled "The President's Own Words," uses film of President Bush addressing a joint session of Congress, much as public service announcements for nonprofit causes from the American Red Cross to the Harvard Alcohol Project feature a president's appearance.
This time, though, the scenes of the president are interspersed with scenes of employees of travel-related businesses -- profit-making enterprises -- who repeat his words to "live your lives, do your business around the country, take your families." They include pilots, flight attendants, crews of cruise ships, hotel workers and chefs, representing travel industry giants like American Express; Hertz, a unit of Ford Motor; and Marriott International, which are contributing an estimated $20 million to run the spot.
In fact, McCann-Erickson is also the ad agency for Marriott.
President Bush is joined by a cadre of elected officials in campaigns commingling public service and commercial promotion, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and Jean Chretien, prime minister of Canada. Those efforts seek to rebuild the New York City brand by encouraging tourism, shopping and dining out to help local businesses.
The campaigns, by BBDO New York and the New York and Toronto offices of the Wolf Group, work more effectively than the travel commercial because they mask their intent to benefit private companies with a burst of feel-good emotionalism tapping the reservoir of good will the city has earned the last three months.
Mr. Giuliani is by far the best performer of the bunch, particularly in the delightful BBDO New York spots carrying the theme "The New York miracle. Be a part of it." 
The humorous pro bono commercials present well-known residents like Robert De Niro and Barbara Walters, each pursuing an improbable "New York dream" from taking part in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade to being in a Broadway musical.
Don't be surprised if after Mr. Giuliani leaves office, he appears in a Super Bowl commercial by BBDO New York for one of the agency's paying clients like Pepsi-Cola.

HEADLINE: For Many Generation X'ers, Grass Is Greener at Home 

BYLINE:  By MAGGIE JACKSON 

 BODY:
Generation X'ers, the workers known for job-hopping, aren't as footloose in the employment market as they are reputed to be.
 Nearly half of professionals 26 to 37 years old would be very happy to spend the rest of their careers with their current companies, according to a study released today. The survey involved 1,300 men and women and was carried out in late 2000, before the economic downturn made job hunting harder for all ages. 
 The survey dispels the myth that this generation is not loyal, said Sheila Wellington, president of Catalyst, the research group that conducted the study. While Generation X came of age during the country's longest economic boom and pioneered the dot-com revolution, she said, the survey shows that many in this cohort have old-fashioned goals. 
"There are a lot of seeming myths and assumptions about 26- to 37- year-olds," Ms. Wellington said. "But GenX'ers are attracted to their organizations for utterly traditional reasons: reputation of the organization, opportunities to advance -- pretty much the reasons that most of us would assume worked for the generation that preceded them."
Still, Catalyst and other research organizations that have studied Generation X caution that this age group has high demands for employers that, if not met, could prompt employees to depart, downturn or no.
"They're highly sensitive to being treated as the wonderful people that they are," said Dr. David L. Stum, president of Aon Consulting's Loyalty Institute, a division, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., of the Aon Corporation. "The GenX'er who believes the employer is not making a commitment to him will leave."
That's how 30-year-old Colleen Galle, a vice president at the J .P. Morgan investment bank, views her career so far. During nearly nine years with the company, Ms. Galle has turned down job offers with higher pay, she said. She has stayed because she has had varied jobs within the firm, good benefits, and now, as the mother of a 4-month-old, flexibility in her work.
"I've explored moving," said Ms. Galle, who lives in Short Hills, N.J., "but there is a comfort, there is a loyalty. I have got to give them a chance to meet my demands, but if they can't, I'll go elsewhere or I'll quit work." She was not part of Catalyst's survey.
Catalyst carried out the survey in September 2000 at eight United States and two Canadian companies. Seventy percent of the respondents were women, and more than half were college graduates. Catalyst works with companies to advance women in business, and it chose to focus on Generation X'ers to explore their attitudes as future business leaders.
The study found that more than 70 percent of the workers, born between 1964 and 1975, rated companionship, a loving family and enjoying life as extremely important. In contrast, fewer than 20 percent of the workers said earning a lot of money and becoming an influential leader were extremely important goals.
Asked about their commitment to their companies, 47 percent of the respondents said they would be very happy to spend the rest of their careers at their current organizations.
Not surprisingly, corporate loyalty is rising in the current economic climate, according to recent surveys done by Harris Interactive.
Among 25- to 39-year-olds, nearly 60 percent said in 1999 that they would be likely to leave their jobs voluntarily in the next five years, compared with 45 percent who said that this past October, in a survey commissioned by Spherion, a recruiting firm based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Among workers of all ages, the number who said they were likely to leave fell to 42 percent in the October survey from 50 percent in 1999.
While job insecurities play a part in this shift, said Robert Morgan, president of Spherion's human capital consulting group, employers have worked hard at retaining good workers in recent years as labor shortages intensified.
"Because of the war for talent," Mr. Morgan said, "employers had to get better to compete in the market. A lot of mentoring, professional development, career development programs were started. They've done that out of necessity."

HEADLINE: The Veiled Resource 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
I was in a burka shop the other day, chatting with the male proprietor, when two women walked in to browse the latest fashions (powder blue, gold embroidery). They observed silently as the two of us men discussed whether women want to wear burkas. It seemed a bit ridiculous, so I asked the women: "What do you think?"
 Scandalized, they raced out of the shop. 
 Over the last week I've been rebuffed by dozens of Afghan women. To find out how much of the repression of women in Afghanistan was the result of the Taliban and how much was culture, I thought I should consult the real experts: ordinary women. But men are not supposed to talk to women here except when absolutely necessary, and accosting a female stranger to interview her is a shocking breach of protocol.
While American outrage at mistreatment of women has focused on the Taliban -- partly because of clever media work by the Bush administration to bolster support for the war -- the inequity goes far deeper. The war may be ending, but the effort to bring opportunities to Afghan women should be just beginning.
Here is where the United States can play a leadership role. During the United States' occupation of Japan after World War II, we wrote a constitution for Japan that guaranteed equal rights for women, and similar nudging by us in the coming years can help all Afghans, men and women alike.
The Taliban are gone from Kabul, but women are still fifth-class citizens. Women are no longer required to wear the burka, but they do anyway. Every woman on the streets in Kabul still looks like a shrouded ghost, and as in Japan in 1945, there is little internal pressure for equality.
"We obey our husbands, and our husbands have more rights than us -- that is our culture," Wahida Kamily, a 23-year-old high school graduate, told me through the mesh of her burka. I asked her what she thought of the many Afghan husbands who beat their wives. "If a wife doesn't listen to her husband," she said primly, "it's right for him to beat her."
In the Dari language, a man who does not beat his wife is sometimes dismissed with the phrase "to nadari," which suggests that he is a eunuch. And in Pashto, there's a phrase "khezi pa kor ka ya gor ka." That means: "A woman belongs in the house -- or in a grave."
Much has been made of the missed opportunities of all these women, but there is another important cost: the missed opportunity for Afghanistan as a whole. Afghanistan has one resource of far greater economic value than oil or diamonds: the half of the population that has been largely excluded from economic life.
History has repeatedly shown the economic advantages of education and autonomy for women, and indeed the West pulled ahead of the rest of the world beginning in the 1400's partly because it was educating more girls. David S. Landes, the economic historian at Harvard, argues in his magisterial "The Wealth and Poverty of Nations," "The best clue to a nation's growth and development potential is the status and role of women."
Across Asia, the fuel for economic expansion has been literate women workers churning out toys, shoes and clothing. The owner of a Kabul raisin factory I visited said that girls are more careful workers than boys, and now that the Taliban is gone he plans to fire most of his 50 male employees and hire female replacements. Perhaps the revolution is beginning.
Encouraging more opportunity for Afghan women is not cultural imperialism, any more than are our efforts to bring Afghanistan a central bank, modern roads or free elections. These are all simply elements of nation-building. 
So for the sake of all Afghans, we should gently prod the new government to improve education, health care and job opportunities for women, and also direct our aid in that direction. In an auspicious start, Afghanistan's interim government has two women ministers. Even the most chauvinistic men I talked to -- including one who said he would beat his wife if she so much as asked for permission to remove her burka -- accepted this.
"It's good to have women ministers," said Wali Mohammed, a 29-year-old man standing among the bombed-out buildings of western Kabul. "Women should be allowed to vote," he added magnanimously, "and if a woman has no husband, she can decide for herself who to vote for."

HEADLINE: New Pentagon Debate Over Stealth Plane 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
A fierce struggle is under way among senior Pentagon officials over whether to restart production of the most expensive aircraft in history, the B-2 stealth bomber, administration officials said today.
 The debate pits the senior leadership of the Air Force, which adamantly opposes building more of the bat-winged planes because of their high cost, against policy analysts close to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who view the B-2 as the kind of advanced weapons system that could transform the way the United States wages war. 
 At stake is a proposal by Northrop Grumman, the manufacturer, to reopen plants in California and build 40 more of the jets over the coming decade for about $30 billion. Northrop built the existing fleet of 21 B-2's for about $44 billion, which included research and development costs that would not be part of the new price. 
The proposal, which was first floated by Northrop last spring only to be knocked down by the Air Force, has been resurrected by its advocates inside the Pentagon because Mr. Rumsfeld is preparing to submit the proposed 2003 Pentagon budget to the White House by early January. Mr. Rumsfeld has said that he wants to use the 2003 spending plan to resolve debates on many major weapons programs.
The bomber debate has also been reignited by the war in Afghanistan, with both sides arguing that the high-tech bombing campaign that successfully demoralized and dispersed the Taliban forces has bolstered their positions. 
Mr. Rumsfeld has tried to stay above the fray while the Air Force and his policy advisers have wrestled in classified analyses and closed-door meetings. But Mr. Rumsfeld, who in 1995 signed a letter with six former defense secretaries urging the Clinton administration to buy more B-2's, is widely thought to admire the plane, which can fly very long missions, deliver precision-guided bombs and avoid radar detection.
Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, was also an outspoken advocate of the B-2 before joining the Bush administration, and might be willing to support buying more planes if a strong military and economic case could be made for them, people familiar with the debate said.
On Tuesday, President Bush is scheduled to give a major address on the war at the Citadel, in Charleston, S.C., that his advisers said would reprise some of the themes of a 1999 campaign speech at the same school. In the earlier speech, Mr. Bush praised "long-range aircraft" capable of striking with "pinpoint accuracy," code words, the speech's authors said, for the B-2 bomber. 
This time, it is not clear whether Mr. Bush will address the bomber issue, since it remains so hotly contested within the Pentagon. "No decisions have been reached," an administration official said today.
The fight over the B-2 in many ways exemplifies the issues Mr. Rumsfeld is grappling with as he tries to reshape the armed forces for new kinds of conflicts in the post-Soviet world of global terrorism, cyberwarfare and proliferating chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. 
Advocates, who include Andrew Marshall, a senior civilian analyst at the Pentagon and close adviser to Mr. Rumsfeld, maintain that radar-evading bombers like the B-2, which are capable of delivering satellite- and laser-guided bombs, are necessary to maintain America's battlefield edge in far-flung future conflicts. 
The difficulty in obtaining basing rights in Central Asia for short-range fighter jets during the Afghan campaign underscored the need for long-range aircraft, those advocates argue. Based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the B-2 flew a small number of bombing missions over Afghanistan early in the campaign, with aerial refueling. It also flew nonstop bombing missions from Missouri to Yugoslavia in the 1999 Kosovo campaign.
"Air Force strike fighters played a small role in the Afghan war," said one advocate of the B-2. "Yet the Air Force is scheduled to buy 2,200 short-range tactical aircraft in the coming decades, and zero bombers. For some of us, their portfolio seems unbalanced."
But the Air Force has staunchly opposed buying more B-2's, in large part because the immense cost would almost certainly force it to slash other programs, including its highest-priority acquisition, the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jet. Even the secretary of the Air Force, James Roche, a former Northrop executive, has strongly opposed buying more B-2's. 
Senior Air Force officers contend that upgrades to B-52 and B-1 bombers that enabled them to drop precision-guided weapons in Afghanistan had reduced the need for additional B-2's. "I think we've proven that we've got not only the right airplanes but pretty much the right mix," Gen. John Jumper, the Air Force chief of staff, told reporters recently. 
The Pentagon, which conceived of the B-2 as one leg of the nation's nuclear force, originally planned to buy 132 of the planes. But the program was plagued by cost overruns and production delays, and with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Congress stopped production after the 21st plane in the 1990's. 
The plane is not only expensive to buy, but to maintain, since every nick or dent on its specially designed skin must be repaired with particular kinds of tape and epoxy that require as long as 80 hours to cure. For those reasons, buying more B-2's is likely to stir opposition among lawmakers worried that this would drain money from their districts.
"If there is a decision" to restart the production line, said a person close to the debate, "it will require a significant amount of political capital on the part of both Rumsfeld and the president, not only to get it through the Air Force, but to sell it on Capitol Hill."

HEADLINE: Willamette to Pursue Acquisition to Try toThwart Hostile Bid 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The timber company Willamette Industries authorized its management yesterday to start talks to buy a large unit of the rival Georgia-Pacific Corporation, a move seen as another major defense against a year-old hostile bid from the Weyerhaeuser Company. 
 An acquisition of the building products business -- which had revenue of around $7 billion last year -- would make Willamette a leading maker of wood panels and lumber and a big distributor of other building material products. 
 Willamette took the initiative to start talks in what could be described as the final snub to Weyerhaeuser's $5.5 billion offer last year. 
 A large Willamette acquisition would create an entirely different company, and essentially invalidate Weyerhaeuser's offer. That means Willamette's stock could decline on fears that Weyerhaeuser could pull its offer.
 Weyerhaeuser declined to comment but Willamette's shares showed early signs of decline, shedding 60 cents in after-hours trading at $44. Georgia-Pacific was one of the most actively traded issues in after-hours, losing $1.52, to $28.95.
 Willamette's board, which includes three Weyerhaeuser directors, gave the go-ahead yesterday afternoon for talks with Georgia-Pacific.
 The board of Georgia-Pacific, based in Atlanta, also authorized management to start a dialogue with Willamette on combining the two businesses.
 Weyerhaeuser's last offer on the table was at $50 a Willamette share, which closed at $46.40 yesterday. Two months ago, Willamette indicated it was willing to discuss an offer closer to $60 a share but it was turned down by Weyerhaeuser.
 "They publicly slammed the door shut on that overture in less than two hours without so much as a phone call," said Duane McDougall, president and chief executive of Willamette Industries, "and we made it clear that we intended to pursue our strategic plan. That's what we are doing." 
 A potential deal would give Georgia-Pacific the opportunity to sell a business that has been experiencing much slower growth compared with the rest of the company's consumer paper, packaging, and container-board business lines.
 Georgia-Pacific has been considering several options on this business and its chairman and chief executive, Pete Correll, said yesterday that one option being considered was splitting the company in two.
 An economic downturn has hit the building products business recently and most of the products had a sales decline in the third quarter.
 Gypsum wallboard sales fell 27.6 percent; lumber sales dropped 18.8 percent; particle-board sales fell 12.6 percent; and plywood shrank 7.4 percent.
 The company was recently forced to slow down production to match demand. It recently decided to run its gypsum plant on a one-shift, five-day basis.
 A possible divestiture of the business would be the latest in a string of transformation deals that Georgia-Pacific has done recently. In 1997, it spun off its timberland assets. Last year the company bought the Fort James Corporation, which turned Georgia-Pacific into the world's largest maker of tissue paper.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Gauges Are Down as Many Energy Issues Are Hammered

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as investors cashed in on the recent run-up and cast a cautious eye toward the Federal Reserve's meeting today.
 Economists expect the Fed's policy makers to cut short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point. Such a move would bring the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 1.75 percent, its lowest since the early 1960's. If the Fed acts as expected, it will be the 11th rate cut this year. 
 Analysts said the stock market had already priced in a quarter-point reduction, and they noted that trading in futures contracts on the federal funds rate reflected a 100 percent chance of such a cut. As such, they said, investors were expected to place greater emphasis on the Federal Reserve's statement about the strength of the economy. 
"What the market would like to see is the Fed indicate that this is the last cut," said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist and director of research at Global Partner Securities, formerly Westfalia Investments. "That would boost investors' confidence in the sense that investors would feel comfortable that the Fed feels confident that the economy is about to turn."
With no economic news yesterday and few announcements from corporate America, each of the three major indexes lost ground. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 128.01 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,921.45. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index dropped 29.14 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,992.12. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 18.38 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,139.93.
Investors punished the energy sector as fresh concerns about the industry, initially stoked by the collapse of Enron, swept the market.
Calpine, the country's largest independent power producer, fell $3.58, to $17.79, after a Morgan Stanley analyst downgraded it to neutral from strong buy.
An article on Sunday in the Money & Business section of The New York Times questioned Calpine's ability to maintain its growth rate and cited its recent shift to trading energy. The article also pointed to some financial and accounting similarities that Calpine has with Enron and its extensive dealings with Enron.
After the close of trading, Calpine's chief executive, Peter Cartright, called the article misleading and said "the comparison between Calpine and Enron is ridiculous."
Investors' cool treatment of Calpine spread to other independent power producers. NRG Energy fell $1.19, to $14.11; Orion Power dropped 27 cents, to $25.67; Aquila fell 47 cents, to $16.80; Reliant Resources plunged $2.14, to $14.71; Dynegy tumbled $2.48, to $27.80; and El Paso slumped $1.86, to $41.90. 
Shares of Halliburton, one of the world's largest oil field service companies, bounced back yesterday after falling 42.5 percent on Friday when a jury in Baltimore awarded $30 million to plaintiffs in an asbestos lawsuit. Salmon Smith Barney and UBS Warburg downgraded the stock. Halliburton jumped $2, to $14, after company executives said they planned to appeal the verdict.
Compaq Computer fell $1.62, to $9.70, after the company's proposed takeover by Hewlett-Packard appeared to be in jeopardy. Members of the Hewlett family have opposed the deal since it was announced in September. On Friday, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, which holds 10 percent of Hewlett's stock, said it would not back the merger, leading many analysts to believe that the deal was near collapse. Shareholders are to vote on the deal early next year. Hewlett lost only 52 cents, to $23, as investors bet it was in a better financial position to absorb the aftershock if the deal fell through.
Despite the market's pullback, analysts said the day's activity did not represent a major downward trend.
"We had a significant move when the Nasdaq broke through the 200-day moving average," said Rod Smyth, chief investment strategist at First Union Securities. "This is just a consolidating day." --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bond prices rose yesterday as a three-month high in yields on the most widely traded two-year notes lured investors.
Some people bought government debt anticipating that the Federal Reserve will accompany an interest rate reduction today with a statement indicating it may cut rates again in January. 
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32, to 99 7/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.10 percent from 5.16 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond rose 17/32, to 97 11/32. Its yield fell to 5.56 percent from 5.60 percent on Friday.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: COMPENSATION; 
Holding the Victims' Purse Strings, Uneasily

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Kenneth R. Feinberg, the Washington mediator in charge of the multibillion-dollar federal fund set up to compensate the families of those killed and injured in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, had just taken his first close look at ground zero in New York, the smoking pit where the twin towers once stood.
 Mr. Feinberg's brash, can-do optimism about his new task seemed to falter for a moment last Tuesday. "I'm confident, very confident, that the system ultimately will be perceived as fair," he said as he rode uptown from the site. "But I do not really expect to ameliorate anybody's pain. A check won't do that." 
 But as the special master of the new federal fund, Mr. Feinberg will be the man who writes those checks, the architect of the process that produces them and the final arbiter of their size. If he recognizes that the checks will not erase anyone's pain, he fully realizes that they will provide comfort and most likely provoke controversy. 
His awards, based in part on the victims' lost earning power, could well exceed $1 million per family and are apt to be the single most important source of long-term financial support for thousands of victim families. Those who file a claim with the fund waive their right to sue, and the awards cannot be appealed to any court.
By some Congressional estimates, Mr. Feinberg could ultimately pay out as much as $11 billion in compensation, but official estimates must wait until the fund's rules are written.
Until those formal rules are released, he will discuss only the questions he faces, not the answers he might have reached. But the questions are imposing enough.
"How do you define who is eligible?" he asked, as if leading a law seminar at Georgetown University, where he teaches part time. "The statute covers those killed or injured in the attacks or its 'immediate aftermath,' but how do you define immediate aftermath? Hours? Days?"
That just scratches the surface. There are additional questions of what it means to have been injured, and whether psychological hurt might be compensated, or what should happen if no will exists and there are different family members filing claims.
But perhaps no question hangs over Mr. Feinberg and his every decision more ominously than the matter of fairness. A large part of each award will be calculated by using estimates of a victim's lifetime earnings, and so differing assumptions will have to be made about the earning power of a bond trader and a dishwasher. The former earned more but might have retired or burned out earlier; the latter earned less, but almost certainly would have worked most of his life.
These disparate employment histories will necessarily require awards of vastly different sizes -- a fact that may not be palatable to the public, Mr. Feinberg acknowledged. But he must somehow ensure that people in similar circumstances are treated similarly. 
Mr. Feinberg has indicated that one possible partial solution to the question of fairness could be to make sure the damages for "pain and suffering" are calculated to ensure that every family gets some minimum amount, regardless of its lost breadwinner's paycheck. Mr. Feinberg agrees that the equity hurdle is daunting, although he will not yet commit to how he will try to overcome it.
As if that were not enough, Mr. Feinberg also has to wrestle with the decision of whether whatever funds a family has received from charity should be deducted from their federal award. "The charities have made it very clear that they do not like the idea, but we're looking at all the options," he said.
Seeking answers to these questions, Mr. Feinberg has been consulting a remarkable cross section of people: a Nobel economist, aviation disaster lawyers, victim families, political leaders, investment bankers, arbitration specialists and labor statisticians.
But economic calculations are not his primary concern, he said. "The Achilles' heel of this program is the emotional force associated with these deaths," he said. "The emotional forces are the key to this whole thing."
With an anonymous process based on paper filings and formulas, "there would be no expiation," he added. "You need to let people explain why they believe they are victims, and why they are different from every other victim."
As that concern suggests, there is nothing uncomplicated about Mr. Feinberg.
Asked about his hobbies, he always gives the same answer: opera and classical music. But if that conjures up an image of studiousness and high-brow tastes, ask him how he first discovered these sedate pastimes. 
"Oh, I remember it perfectly," he said with a grin. "When I was 9 years old, I saw Groucho Marx in 'A Night at the Opera.' I was hooked for life."
Part grand opera, part Marx Brothers, he defies easy labels. He built his legal reputation by negotiating settlements, not by winning cases. A former top aide to the liberal Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, he has won the confidence of Attorney General John Ashcroft, the conservative Republican who appointed him. And asked about the logistics and rule-making involved in his new job, he talks instead about the storms of the heart, the freshness of the survivors' grief.
Mr. Feinberg, known as much for his resilient optimism as for his blitzkrieg brain, is not daunted by the complexities he faces. Indeed, when he first learned about the fund, Mr. Feinberg said, he thought, "This sounds like something I've been training to do all my life."
At 56, he has been a lawyer for 31 years, having been the court-appointed mediator in a number of disputes, beginning in the mid-1980's with injury claims over the Agent Orange defoliant used in Vietnam and continuing through cases over asbestos, the Dalkon Shield birth control device and the dispute over the shutdown of the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island. Logistically and legally, he said, the new compensation fund was much simpler than any of those. "You don't have hundreds of thousands of claims, as you did in the Agent Orange case," he said. "And you don't have the causation disputes; here, there is no question about causation."
But that simplicity is counterbalanced by the speed that Congress demanded, he said. Litigation over injuries or wrongful deaths usually takes years, he explained, "and time has a way of dampening emotions; but we don't have that luxury."
By law, the fund must open for business on Dec. 21 and, after a claim is filed, the special master has 120 days to reach a decision.
"In tort terms, that is virtually overnight -- it is so soon after the injury and the loss," he said. "So the hearing process needs to be staffed by people who can deal effectively with individuals -- not just number- crunchers, but people with a humanistic side."
The statute's pace has accelerated Mr. Feinberg's naturally frenetic pace. Last Tuesday, in less than 10 hours, he squeezed in four meetings in three locations, his first reluctant look at ground zero, a long interview and, finally, a concert version of Bela Bartok's one-act opera, "Bluebeard's Castle," at Carnegie Hall.
"His natural talent is cutting a deal that everybody can live with," said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University. 
He has not always won unanimous praise for the deals he has cut. Some Vietnam veterans, for example, complained that the settlement in the Agent Orange case was too little and far too late. 
Mr. Feinberg says he still thinks of the Agent Orange case as a success, and has argued that the veterans faced an uphill fight and a very uncertain outcome in court. Indeed, he suggests that the families pondering whether to sue over the terrorist attacks face very similar odds. 
"I question whether anyone who opts out of this system has a meaningful alternative remedy," he said. "With the liability caps that Congress put in place for the airlines, the delay in getting to trial, the roll of the dice that you would face in court -- that is not a meaningful alternative."

HEADLINE: 2001 Bonuses On Wall Street Decline 30%, To $10 Billion 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
It's official: this year's bonuses for Wall Street workers will plunge by about 30 percent, to $10 billion, according to State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, whose office annually estimates bonus payments.
 The $4.3 billion decline -- the first since 1998 and far steeper than that year's drop -- means that some investment bankers may not be able to afford the new Jaguars of their dreams, and that their spouses may not find baubles from Harry Winston in their Christmas stockings. 
 But it has far broader implications for city government (that $4 billion got taxed at the highest rate) and for a lot of people whose jobs are far from Wall Street. Taxi drivers and florists, baby sitters and busboys, golf pros and travel agents, real estate brokers and antiques dealers: everyone who has benefited from the flood of Wall Street profits washing through the city may now be hurt by the turning tide. 
"It has a very big ripple effect for the employment and income of a lot of ordinary people who depend on it for their livelihoods," said Marcia Van Wagner, chief economist for the Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscal watchdog group.
And, she noted, the drop in bonuses comes on top of the dot-com bust, the national recession and the fallout from Sept. 11. "It may be a quadruple whammy," she said. "We're really getting it from all sides."
Mr. McCall's estimate of bonus payouts is based upon data that include industry profits and tax collections.
It is possible that the bonus pool could shrink even more than the comptroller's office has estimated. Complaints are seeping out from some big brokerage firms about bonuses that are half the amount of last year's.
And companies that traditionally pay out the bonuses in December and January still have time to cut them further, depending on what their fourth-quarter profits look like, said Frank Fernandez, chief economist for the Securities Industry Association, Wall Street's trade group. At one large firm, the total bonus pool has shrunk by roughly 60 percent, he said.
Though not unexpected, the decline follows a decade of almost uninterrupted increases in Wall Street bonuses, which in 1991 totaled $4.1 billion. Turmoil in the bond market in 1998 trimmed bonuses slightly, to $9.7 billion from $11 billion, but they quickly rebounded to last year's record $14.3 billion, according to data from the comptroller's office.
Bonuses last year accounted for about a third of the pay on Wall Street, according to Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist of The New York STAT, a newsletter focusing on the city's economy.
And even though Wall Street jobs make up only 5 percent of the city's employment base, Wall Street workers pay about 15 percent of the city's main tax revenues, she said. City revenues per employee on Wall Street are almost three times the amount of those from workers in other industries.
Still, Ms. Denham said, "The bonus pool is really gravy, as opposed to meat and potatoes. Job retention is much more significant."
But the news there is not so good, either. Since its peak employment of 190,100 in August 2000, Wall Street had been slowly cutting jobs. That is, until October, when it lopped almost 16,000 positions, sending the number of jobs at securities firms to 165,400.
Some of those jobs -- the association estimates as many as 9,000 -- were simply moved to New Jersey. And perhaps half of them will return.
But Wall Street firms are still cutting. Mr. Fernandez said that his organization had heard of 8,000 or so more layoffs in the industry, and that the pattern had shown "that 95 percent of U.S. securities job losses have occurred in New York City."
None of this is good news for a city that is facing, next fiscal year, a $3.5 billion gap between revenues and spending. Nor is it good news for the housing market, especially the market for million-dollar-plus co-ops in Manhattan.
"The long and short of it is that this is New York City's key industry," said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New YOrk. "And when there are problems in a key industry, it typically has a disproportionate effect on the economy."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Spending on Ads Is Down Sharply

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
Advertising spending in major media fell 7.8 percent in the first nine months of 2001 as cutbacks by marketers accelerated, according to a report yesterday from CMR in New York, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending.
 The 7.8 percent decline, to $68.8 billion from $74.7 billion in the period a year earlier, compared with a decline of 5.2 percent in the first quarter and 5.9 percent in the first half. 
 The medium affected the most by the spending decline in the first nine months was newspapers, down 21.5 percent, followed by national spot radio, down 18.6 percent, and spot television, down 17.9 percent.
The two advertisers spending the most on advertising so far this year -- General Motors and Philip Morris -- reduced spending by large amounts, 28.4 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively. Two advertisers in the top 10 increased ad spending: AOL Time Warner, up 11.9 percent, and Ford Motor, up 5.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Fiat Auto Chief Resigns in Midst of a Revamping 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Roberto Testore, the chief executive of Fiat Auto, resigned today as Fiat S.p.A., the parent company, announced a restructuring plan.
 The restructuring by Fiat, the world's eighth-largest automaker in terms of vehicles sold, reflects the continued struggles of the global auto industry as economic conditions worsen. Fiat will close or overhaul 18 plants and lay off 6,000 workers worldwide by 2004 as part of the moves. 
 The Italian auto giant is in a situation somewhat similar to the Ford Motor Company. Ford and Fiat Auto have dismissed chief executives this year, and the two companies are expected to report annual net losses. Ford executives are also at work on a turnaround effort to return to profitability. 
The health of Fiat, by association, affects General Motors, since G.M. owns a 20 percent stake in Fiat Auto and Fiat owns 5.6 percent of G.M. as part of a relationship that extends to sharing power-train and purchasing operations in Europe.
Mr. Testore will be replaced by Giancarlo Boschetti, the chief executive of Iveco, a trucking company owned by Fiat S.p.A. Fiat Auto includes the Fiat brand, in addition to Alfa Romeo and Lancia, a European luxury line. None of the three brands' vehicles are currently sold in the United States, though there are plans to bring back Alfa Romeo to the United States in 2005. Fiat S.p.A. also owns the Ferrari brand and Maserati as part of a separate operating unit. 
Fiat said its restructuring plan would result in a charge of 800 million euros this year ($712.6 million using current exchange rates).
Fiat Auto will be broken into four distinct operating groups, the company said, in an attempt to reinforce its various brands. Fiat also projects that divestments from noncore businesses will be worth more than $2.2 billion. Fiat also said it would close two United States plants operated by its CNH unit, which makes farming and other machinery. 
Fiat S.p.A.'s auto sales in Western Europe fell 4.6 percent through the first 10 months of the year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data service. The company is expected to lose about 56 cents a share this year, according to Morgan Stanley, and its net debt soared in the third quarter from roughly $6.2 billion to $8.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Firm of Reagan Adviser Raises $1.4 Billion Fund 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Heartland Industrial Partners, a private equity firm started by a former Reagan administration official, David Stockman, finished raising a $1.4 billion fund with an investment from a Canadian pension plan. 
 The Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board said it would invest $150 million in the fund over six years. 
Heartland, which two years ago sought to raise $2 billion for the fund, aims to make acquisitions in auto parts and other manufacturing industries. In February, the firm paid $260 million for 60 percent of the Collins & Aikman Corporation, a maker of car interiors. 
 "These are capable people," Mark Weisdorf, vice president of private market investments for the Toronto-based board, said in an interview. "They are focusing on old-economy industrial, which fits in well with the portfolio we're developing." 
Mr. Stockman declined to comment on fund-raising. 
Heartland, with offices in Greenwich, and Bloomfield Hills, Mich., has nine partners, including a former Penske Corporation president, Timothy D. Leuliette, and the former Chase Securities leveraged-finance executive Daniel Tredwell, and 11 associates, according to its Web site.
Other investors in Heartland's fund include the state of Michigan's pension plan, J. P. Morgan Chase & Company, and American International Group Inc. 
Weisdorf said the Canadian pension plan, with private equity commitments of $700 million out of total assets of about $7.6 billion, will get the chance to make direct investments in Heartland acquisitions alongside the private equity firm.

HEADLINE: Delphi Automotive Will Cut 1,400 More Jobs 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TROY, Mich., Dec. 10 

 BODY:
The Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation, the maker of auto parts, said today that it would eliminate 1,400 more jobs, on top of 11,500 cuts announced in March, as it reduces costs and as vehicle production slows.
 The job reductions will cost $150 million to $200 million, the company said. 
 The additional laid-off workers, representing less than 1 percent of the work force of 198,000, will leave in March and April through voluntary retirements and buyouts, Alan Dawes, the company's chief financial officer, said in an interview. 
Profit next year excluding those expenses will be $275 million, compared with a forecast of $200 million to $225 million for 2001, as sales decline about 2 percent, to $25.5 billion, the company said.
Delphi's biggest customer, the General Motors Corporation, its former parent, and other automakers expect consumers to buy fewer cars and trucks as no-interest loan offers end next month and the economy slows.
Shares of Delphi, based in Troy, fell 76 cents, to $13.39. 
Delphi said it was still considering selling or closing businesses with about $3.4 billion in annual revenue, including its instrument cluster and sensor unit and its Harrison Thermal Systems division. Together, the two units have about 12,130 workers in the United States, Mexico, Europe, South America and Asia.
The company said it was in talks with several potential buyers for some or all of its instrument-cluster business, which has annual sales of $500 million, and expects a sale in the middle of next year. The business has about 1,780 workers in plants in the United States and Mexico.
Delphi is also looking to restructure its Harrison Thermal Systems division, with about 10,350 workers, to improve profitability and productivity. The company reached a local agreement in Lockport, N.Y., last month that allows it to cut costs through productivity improvements, exit some older product lines and combine some operations including closing a warehouse.
The company recently agreed to sell its $500 million generator business to Delco Remy International Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Delphi said it expected the sale to close at the end of the year and will result in a book loss of $130 million to $150 million.

HEADLINE: Big Steel: An Invalid That Can Roar In Washington 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Trying to keep their long downward slide from becoming a death spiral, the nation's old-line steel makers are pressing the federal government for special treatment granted to almost no other industry.
 They are almost certainly overreaching, analysts say. And even if the industry succeeds in getting what it wants, the plan would do little more, critics say, than put off the day when it succumbs to subsidized foreign rivals and a nimble new breed of domestic competitors that oppose granting big steel makers the concessions they are seeking. 
 The steel makers want trade protection from low-priced imports. They want the United States to put pressure on other nations to scale back their steel-making capacity. They want billions of dollars in taxpayer money to help pay health and pension benefits. And they want assurances that their proposal to merge many of the American industry's biggest companies into a bigger, more efficient competitor will not run into antitrust problems. 
While unlikely to get everything they want, the big steel makers are getting enough encouragement in Washington to make it worth the effort. That reflects their political power as well as an environment after the September attacks in which nearly any industry that can associate its plight with national or economic security can get a hearing from the two parties.
Aware that President Bush's re-election hopes in 2004 could hinge on his success in steel-making states like Pennsylvania, which went for Al Gore last year, and West Virginia, which went for Mr. Bush, the White House has encouraged the industry on several levels.
Despite his strong stance in favor of free trade, Mr. Bush has actively pursued sanctions against nations judged to be dumping steel in this country below cost, and is expected to impose tariffs and quotas on them in the next several months. His economic team will again press other nations to end government subsidies and shut down excess steel-making capacity during a round of international talks this week.
Even before the USX Corporation and a number of other major steel makers said last week that they were considering merging, the White House had been quietly encouraging the industry to consolidate, industry executives and union leaders said.
But the administration signaled after the announcement that it was wary of embracing some other elements of the consolidation plan, including the call for billions of dollars to help pay a huge bill for retiree health and pension benefits.
It would be hard enough for the administration to reconcile what amounts to an expensive bailout with its professed free-market principles and its stated disdain for government handouts to business.
Moreover, supporting the full plan would be tricky because it is opposed by a newer and smaller class of steel companies known as mini-mills, which are no longer so small and are usually far more efficient than the operations of the older companies. Big consumers of steel are also wary of the plan.
And if the consolidation plan were to involve large-scale layoffs, it could also lose the support of steel workers' unions.
"The president is aware of the serious problems facing the steel industry," a White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, said. "We're listening to USX and to others involved in the industry, including unions and consumers. There is a range of views among those involved in the industry."
The help they are seeking, companies like the US Steel Group of USX, Bethlehem Steel and Wheeling-Pittsburgh say, would provide the industry time to whip itself into the kind of shape needed to survive and prosper, and allow the United States to maintain the steel industry, a core element of its industrial base.
The American industry today is a shell of its former self. In the last few years, 25 steel companies have filed for bankruptcy protection. Employment in the last two decades has fallen to around 150,000 from 450,000.
While steel making remains an economic force and a way of life in states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Indiana, it has largely faded in other places.
A century ago, Birmingham, Ala., was so proud of its steel-making prowess that it commissioned a 56-foot statue of Vulcan, the god of fire and metal-working, and for nearly 100 years the statue overlooked the city from a 124-foot pedestal atop Red Mountain. But the Birmingham Steel Corporation suffered the indignity this fall of having its shares delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for failing to maintain required levels of financial strength. And Vulcan, tarnished and rusting away, was taken down and sent off for repairs.
Still, Rust Belt politics remain compelling for both parties, giving Big Steel and its workers an opening in Washington. To push their case, the big steel makers have hired a number of the best-connected Republican lobbyists, including Ed Gillespie, who advised the Bush campaign and has close ties to the White House.
A bill introduced in the House earlier this year by Representative Peter J. Visclosky, Democrat of Indiana, would give the industry much of what it wants from the federal government.
One provision would grant the steel makers $2.4 billion over the next three years to pay 80 percent of the health care benefits promised by the big companies to retirees, many of whom stop working before they become eligible for Medicare at 65.
Mr. Visclosky's bill picked up 226 co-sponsors from both parties, a majority of the House, though the Republican leadership has so far kept it from coming to the floor.
In contrast to the Clinton administration, which angered steel companies and unions by refusing to pursue the antidumping trade case aggressively, Mr. Bush has handled the case much as the industry is seeking. And the industry has allies both among Democrats sympathetic to union pleas to preserve jobs and from Republicans who cast the issue in other terms.
"This is an industry that has significant national security implications," said Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania. "It's important from the whole basic concept of maintaining manufacturing in this country. It's important to have a vibrant domestic source of steel."
Allowing the industry to be liquidated, Mr. Santorum said, "would put this country on a path to overdependence, similar to oil, on foreign sources."
Some analysts, and the competitors of the big steel companies, said the industry was simply looking for corporate welfare.
"The large companies who are talking about consolidating are marching down death row," said Robert W. Crandall, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "This is not going to revive them. We're really talking about how to continue the orderly decline of these big producers who are now down to half the capacity of what they were 25 years ago."
The argument that the old-line steel companies are vital on national or economic security grounds is "absolute baloney," Mr. Crandall said. One or two mills, he said, could provide all the steel plate needed for armor or shipbuilding.
The trade group for the mini-mill industry, the Steel Manufacturers Association, is trying to develop some political influence of its own as it battles the big steel makers, pointing out to the administration and Congress that its members operate in 126 of 435 Congressional districts and employ 120,000 people.
"The majority of our industry is not in favor of bailing out a few steel companies that mismanaged their assets," said Thomas A. Danjczek, the association's president. "Combining several companies that failed to earn their cost of capital doesn't mean the new company will be able to do it. It's like two garbage trucks colliding."

HEADLINE: Tom Daschle Isn't the Problem 

 BODY:
The closing days of this year's Congressional session have brought forth a wild Republican campaign to demonize Senator Tom Daschle. It almost seems as if the G.O.P. is holding a contest to see who can most often use the word "obstructionist" to describe him. The attacks -- including ads in Mr. Daschle's home state of South Dakota featuring side-by-side photographs of him and Saddam Hussein -- are a sure sign of the Senate majority leader's effectiveness in blocking President Bush's hard-right agenda. Today Mr. Bush meets with Mr. Daschle at the White House, where they can move beyond vilification to legislation. 
 The word "obstructionist," voiced over the weekend by Vice President Dick Cheney, has an unreal ring. Perhaps Mr. Cheney was in a remote, secure location when, after Sept. 11 and with Mr. Daschle's help, Congress passed a use-of-force resolution, a $40 billion emergency spending bill, an airline bailout, a counterterrorism bill and an airport security bill. The Senate has also passed 13 appropriations bills and its own version of education reform and a patients' bill of rights. The two things that Mr. Cheney cited that the Senate had "obstructed" were legislation to drill for energy in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and a "stimulus" bill to give out huge tax breaks to corporations and rich people. 
 Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush have called for bipartisan cooperation in Congress. Yet when asked, the vice president declined to disavow the attack ads running in South Dakota that accused Mr. Daschle of helping the Iraqi dictator by blocking the destruction of the Alaska reserve. 
The suspicion is growing in some quarters in Washington that Mr. Bush may not really want economic stimulus legislation. How else to explain that the White House is sticking with a bill, passed by the House, that many Republicans say privately they would just as soon abandon? The effect of spending less than $100 billion to jolt a $10 trillion economy is likely to be small, and the unnecessary tax breaks aimed at corporations and the wealthy would make the nation's upcoming deficits even worse. But there are some good ideas in some versions of the stimulus bill that should be passed, irrespective of their large-scale economic impact. These pieces would provide unemployment and health benefits to laid off workers who desperately need help after Sept. 11.
If Mr. Bush continues to be inflexible on the economic package, Mr. Daschle should switch tactics and attach the health and jobless benefits to some other bill before Congress adjourns near Christmas. It would be a travesty to ignore the real needs of the most vulnerable Americans at a time like this one. You might even say it was obstructionist.

HEADLINE: Social Security Panel Presents Options but No Unified Plan 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Bedeviled by the arithmetic and politics of putting the retirement system on a sound footing, President Bush's Social Security commission will take up its final report on Tuesday without having reached a consensus on how to implement the administration's goal of allowing workers to invest part of their payroll taxes on Wall Street.
 A draft of the commission's final report, made public late today, set out a menu of options for adding personal investment accounts to the retirement system, including one that would do little to address Social Security's long-term financial problems and two others that would rely on substantial cuts in the current guaranteed benefit. 
 The commission's chairmen, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the former Democratic senator from New York, and Richard D. Parsons, a Republican who last week was named the next chief executive of AOL Time Warner, suggested another approach in their introduction to the report. 
They said the government could set up a voluntary system in which workers contributed one percent of their earnings beyond their current payroll taxes, matched by an equivalent amount from the government, to be paid for out of general revenues at a cost to taxpayers of $40 billion a year. 
Such an approach is similar to one advocated by the Clinton administration several years ago. In putting it forward again, Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Parsons appeared to be acknowledging the political difficulties of moving forward anytime soon on the types of plans the current administration has favored, which are based on using current levels of payroll taxes.
Critics of Mr. Bush's approach said the report showed that it was impossible to create personal accounts without some combination of deep cuts in guaranteed benefits or additional revenues that would ultimately come from taxpayers.
Peter R. Orszag, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the liberal-leaning research group, said that in the report's fine print was an assumption that the commission's plans would rely in part on benefit cuts not just to Social Security's retirement benefits but also the disability insurance program. If anything, the disability program has been considered more politically sacrosanct than the system's old-age component.
Members of the commission said they expected to approve the report on Tuesday and send it to the White House at the end of the week after some final technical revisions.
Whether anything will come of the report, the latest in a long line on the issue from inside and outside the government, is unclear. 
Republicans in Congress said they had no intention of taking it up next year, when the midterm Congressional elections will be held, out of concern that Mr. Bush's support for personal accounts would bring intense attacks from Democrats. 
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Social Security might not be at the top of the legislative calendar next year, as the president had originally hoped, "given the fact that we now have a recession and a war." 
But he said Mr. Bush was not backing off his approach on either substantive or political grounds.
"The president believes very much that one of the reasons he won the presidency was because he took a bold position on Social Security," Mr. Fleischer said.
The commission members defended the report as providing Mr. Bush and Congress with an array of choices that could be the basis for a broader national debate over how to prepare Social Security for the financial strains caused by the aging of the population and longer life spans. 
"It's true the commission didn't coalesce around one of these plans," said Estelle James, an economist at the World Bank and a member of the commission. "But this is an important social choice. We need to have a broader discussion about which way we want to go. I hope we've moved the ball forward by clarifying the choices and tradeoffs."
In laying out a variety of approaches rather than a single comprehensive recommendation, the panel's 16 members appeared to have fudged on the president's original charge to them.
Introducing the members of the commission in May, Mr. Bush said their goal was to take his basic principles -- including putting Social Security on sound footing for the long run and creating personal investment accounts that would allow workers to accumulate wealth -- and turn them into "concrete reforms."
"What we were really trying to do is lay out methods of designing, establishing and implementing personal accounts in the context of improving the fiscal sustainability of Social Security," said Olivia S. Mitchell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and a member of the commission.
"What we've all come to after intense study and analysis is that it's feasible to do that," Professor Mitchell said. "Some people have charged that personal accounts of necessity make the problem worse. We argue that there are many ways to design a personal account and improve the fiscal sustainability of Social Security."

Re "Recovery and the Reluctant Consumer" (Business Day, Dec. 10):
Without an increase in consumer confidence, the recession might linger like a bad case of the flu that we just can't shake. 
 Congress is considering a bipartisan proposal that could help: a national sales tax holiday. This is a simple, proven proposal, used by several states, including New York. 
 For a designated period of time in January or February, one of the slowest spending periods of the year, state sales taxes could be suspended. The federal government would reimburse states for lost revenue. This idea has strong bipartisan support. Suspending this tax will give families and businesses a welcome boost.

HEADLINE: How Low Will They Go? 

BYLINE:  By AMANDA HESSER

 BODY:
LAST year when the Hudson Cafeteria opened, no one blinked an eye at the $28.50 macaroni and cheese with seared foie gras. No, New Yorkers waited in line for it like horses at a trough. Diners, by then, had grown used to $32 roast chicken and $15 shrimp cocktail. It was the price of admission to the newest restaurants, even when the chef was just out of cooking school.
 But this season, things seem to be shifting. The restaurants that are opening share the ambition typical of a new place, and something else, too. They are all markedly less expensive, many with entrees that dip into the high teens and rarely inch above $24. The days of breaking the $30 price ceiling seem, for the moment at least, to have vanished. 
 That doesn't mean, however, that fine cooking is going with it. At Moda, the menu is sprinkled with tempting dishes like fennel-crusted pork loin for $18 and grilled quail with polenta for $24. You can have strip steak at SQC on the Upper West Side for $23 and turmeric-scented striped bass at TanDa on Park Avenue South for $24. 
There is also Marseille, which recently opened on Ninth Avenue. The owners hired Alex Urena, a chef who won wide acclaim at Blue Hill and trained with Ferran Adria in Spain. Mr. Urena has turned out a menu that feels like a vibrant weave of Jean Georges and El Bulli, with a finely layered vegetable terrine and peanut butter tart with celery ice cream and celery foam for $7 each, and poached foie gras for $1 more. The most expensive dish is the bouillabaisse. Ample pieces of rouget, shrimp, mussels and cod are neatly arranged in the center of a bowl, and the warm broth is poured over at the table. All for $24. 
A new, more tame menu, said Josh Moulton, an owner of Moda in Midtown, is a visceral reaction to the price creep that had been infecting menus throughout the city. 
"I felt like every ambitious opening that had occurred over the past two years had just upped the ante," Mr. Moulton said. "Prices were getting higher and higher, and the $30 entree was becoming the norm, not the exception, and frankly I know how much chicken costs. And I understand that when people stuff it with truffles and foie gras it gets up there, but a great roast chicken is a great roast chicken and it doesn't go for more than three bucks a pound." 
(In fact, what some chefs consider the best chicken of all, from Four Story Hill Farm in Pennsylvania, was only $3.29 a pound last year, Mr. Moulton said.)
"I think there's sort of an emotional impact when an entree is over $30," Paul Bolles-Beaven, a partner at Union Square Cafe said, "and everyone knows you're not paying more because the fish or the foie gras costs more."
Restaurateurs pay close attention to food cost, which is the percentage of a dish's price spent on ingredients. Most restaurants aim to keep it under 30 percent, which tends to be easier for Italian restaurants with lower-cost ingredients like pasta. According to a study last year for the New York State Restaurant Association, the average food cost of more than 1,000 higher-end restaurants in New York City was 30.91 percent.
Tolerance for the emotional impact of inflated prices, even without a lagging economy, was bound to wear thin. And despite an enormous push for status items like truffles and caviar on menus a few years ago, restaurateurs have found that most diners do not necessarily want foie gras to sustain them. "I find it so interesting that at the same time that American dining ambition and food knowledge has risen," Mr. Moulton added, "people still want to have a good, nourishing meal."
This has been proven by more expensive restaurants like Babbo, which took flavorful parts like beef cheeks, goose liver and head cheese and gave them the stylish urgency of foams. Since Tom Valenti, an owner of Ouest, began braising lamb shanks, they probably had not enjoyed such attention since the Middle Ages. Now it's hard to find a bistro or brasserie without them.
Cooking with these cuts of meat, though, is also a way to save money. "You can do a rib-eye steak," Chris Russell, an owner of TanDa, said, "which is a delicious piece of meat, instead of filet mignon. You can use a lamb shank instead of a rack of lamb. You can do a similar preparation, and the flavor will still be delicious, but the food cost will be 80 percent less." 
It is no surprise then to find sauteed calf's liver with Swiss chard for $18 as an entree at the Harrison, or beef cheeks with Israeli couscous for $18 at Marseille. 
Sometimes it is just a matter of responding to the mood of diners. When Mr. Russell owned Moomba, for instance, prices were higher across the board. He charged $8 for a bottle of San Pellegrino sparkling water at Moomba; at TanDa, it's $7. And at Hudson Cafeteria, the price of that macaroni and cheese with foie gras is now $26.
There are other techniques for curbing prices that give you the option to spend a lot if you so choose. At SQC, Scott Campbell, an owner, said the menu "is deconstructed where food is at different price points."
"There are people who don't want to spend more than $16 for an entree," he said, "so there's an intermediate category." While the strip steak is $23, most other dishes hover around $20. If you don't feel like splurging for the steak, you can still have beef, in the ravioli with oxtail and marrow for $16.
Right after you are seated at Marseille, a waiter encourages you to order a "mezze" while you are still choosing appetizers and entrees. Each mezze consists of three tiny plates of tastes like piquillo peppers, zucchini blossom with basil and white bean bruschetta. Most are about $8. What you may not realize, though, is that what they are doing essentially is asking you to pay for your amuse-bouche. It's fair enough, though, since you are being charged as little as $16 for a main course of poached duck. 
The appetizers at Marseille, which range from $7 to $12, and desserts, which are $7, also give strength to their efforts. It is not that common. Mr. Bolles-Beaven added, "I've been to restaurants where it's obvious they've increased their appetizer prices as much as possible to make up for not having entrees over $30."
In many cases, though, it's not about being clever. The lamb with white beans and escarole at Moda is just $27. "Let's face it," Mr. Moulton, a partner, said. "Beans and escarole are not that expensive. So the only thing I'm really paying for is the lamb."
Mr. Moulton said Moda looked to other restaurants as a model. "When you look downtown, you're getting people like Wylie Dufresne at 71 Clinton, where you're getting really high-quality food and good service in a less precious setting."
Mr. Dufresne, who opened 71 Clinton in 1999, has never charged more than $26 for any dish. But he also works with higher costs. Most restaurants aim for a 27 to 28 percent food cost; his is 31 to 32 percent.
"Part of the $30 entree," he said, "goes into the plate itself, and the glass and silver. I don't see that as the future. I think the grand restaurants will endure, but I think what people want is they want to eat that kind of food in a casual kind of atmosphere."
Mr. Dufresne was not the only pioneer. Before the economy started to slip, other restaurants began adopting a similar approach. After Anne Rosenzweig closed the Lobster Club, she opened Inside with her chef, Charleen Badman. Much of the food is in the same style as a the Lobster Club, but with a more focused, less expensive menu. 
As these restaurants proliferate, though, a distinction needs to be made. Many people associate welcoming, reasonably priced restaurants with comfort food. 
"Either you feel welcome and you're taken care of, or you're not," said Jimmy Bradley, an owner of the Harrison. "Somewhere along the way someone needs to work on rephrasing comfort food. I don't think people are all that interested in comfort food. I think they're interested in being taken care of and perceived value."
They would like to eat well, and not go home with a knot in their stomach. Perhaps it's not that much to ask of places created to feed one's hunger.

HEADLINE: A Temple Where Wine and Food Are the Deities 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: NAPA, Calif. 

 BODY:
THE good life is a religion in Northern California. Now, it finally has a temple.
 With profundities etched in limestone and all-organic grounds inspired by the kitchen gardens of a Loire chateau, the world's most wildly ambitious cultural institution devoted to wine, food and the arts opened its doors last month in this gritty river town. In nonabundant times, the 80,000-square-foot museum -- founded by Robert Mondavi, who gave $20 million -- bears the name Copia: The American Center of Wine, Food and the Arts, after the Roman goddess of abundance. 
 Copia is not America's first museum devoted to food and drink. The proud heritage includes the Nut Museum in Old Lyme, Conn.; the Catfish Capitol museum in Belzoni, Miss., and the Museum of Pez Memorabilia in nearby Burlingame. But Copia is a new invention entirely -- a "conceptual museum," in the words of its director, Peggy A. Loar, that aims to be a sort of Museum of Modern Art for eaters and drinkers. Even the restaurant, with organic vegetables and herbs from the museum garden, has a quasi-educational function (if you can manage to get a table). 
The $55 million center inhabits 12 acres along the Napa River and was designed by James Stewart Polshek, the New York architect whose work includes Bill Clinton's presidential library in Little Rock, Ark. It has an outdoor cooking pavilion, an amphitheater for classes on sparkling wines or how to cook hoppin' John, a vast exhibition space and an extensive edible garden that will probably become a destination in itself.
It is stunningly ambitious in concept and, judging by its opening exhibitions, extremely tricky in execution, veering from the down-to-earth to the esoteric and the wacky. It is probably safe to say that only at Copia would a two-piece Han dynasty stove cohabit with mannequins dressed in two-piece suits weighed down with a hundred pounds of plastic grapes.
Already, just three weeks after opening, it has its detractors, among them the working-class residents of the town of Napa who feel trod upon by their richer Napa Valley neighbors. Others have been concerned about the possibility that those connected with the museum could use it to promote their food and wine. 
Copia's emergence in these parts seems apt. Perhaps only in Northern California do family garages double as wineries and neighborhood potlucks as culinary gridirons.
"There is nothing in Europe like Copia, except for a crummy little museum in the South of France," said Julia Child, who at age 89 recently became a full-time Californian and has donated her copper pots -- every shrine needs relics -- to the museum. "I think it's wonderful we're the people who thought of it," she added. "But you couldn't have it in North Dakota."
Rising in an unfashionable stretch next to a Beverage Warehouse, the center was conceived not only as a highbrow cultural institution but as a linchpin for the revitalization of Napa, a city of 73,000 that has long been the handmaiden to the upper valley's plutocratic glamour. Its more subtle aim is to market fine wine to the 4.5 million tourists who come to the wine country each year.
ALTHOUGH still a work in progress -- think of it as a two-minute egg -- Copia's reach is difficult to overstate. Its peculiar zen is inscribed in limestone: "Wine and food speak not only to the palate, but to the mind and the deeper domain of the heart."
Mr. Polshek's building is a pull-out-the-stops architectural statement, with a fieldstone wall recalling old-school Napa wineries and an abstract undulating metal roof. Mr. Polshek, who also designed the Rose Center for Earth and Space in Manhattan, calls his contemporary form, which echoes a bend in the river, "a great croissant."
The gardens are three and a half resplendently edible organic acres set into gridded parterres. It's hard not to be moved by the sight of 40 varieties of lavender, 30 varieties of wine grapes, 20 varieties of carrots, olive groves, aromatic wine gardens and ethnic vegetable gardens dedicated to Asians, Italians and other American pilgrims. It is California writ small.
But things get more complicated inside. You are greeted by the Circle of the Senses, flashing video images of cascading cornflakes and other foods set to jazz. Nearby a holiday exhibition of vintage tableware includes turkey-shaped chocolate molds -- on loan from Martha Stewart. 
To Ms. Loar, the center's director, the museum's purview is no less than "the whole spectrum of civilization, including abundance and scarcity." (She fought for the short, "poppy" name). "I think of this place as a conceptual museum, a museum of ideas," she said. "It's about agriculture and material culture, about earth to table." The food curator, Daphne Derven, calls it "intellectual nourishment."
Begin, say, with a half-hour lecture on the Meyer lemon, a segment of which is arranged at 3 o'clock on your plate. Then move on to "Making Scents of Wine" -- a sort of "Northern California for Dummies" -- a seminar on aroma by the museum's wine curator, Peter Marks, formerly chief wine merchant at wine.com. Learn about retronasal passages in the back of the mouth and how to detect a burnt rubber smell in your pinot noir.
Wander upstairs to "Active Ingredients," a temporary exhibition for which conceptual artists created works examining our contemporary relationship to food and drink. Notice the sculpture of molten caramel by a San Francisco sculptor, Gay Outlaw -- her real name -- whose previous work includes a 34-foot-long serpentine wall of encased fruitcakes. (She studied pastry at La Varenne in Paris.) Her work here, meant to evoke the optical patterns of vineyards along the highway, is composed of 1,300 pounds of melted sugar and 80 gallons of corn syrup suspended on springs, suggesting, we are told, "the temporal nature of perception and even existence."
More accessible perhaps is the core exhibition, "Forks in the Road," an interactive exploration of attitudes toward food.
On a recent afternoon, many museumgoers lunched first at Julia's Kitchen, the museum's main restaurant, which is named for Ms. Child, an honorary trustee of the center. The menu, with prices up to $26 for grilled Black Angus New York steak, includes numerous wines and seared foies gras and doubtlessly accounted for the elevated noise level and palpably jolly mood. Ms. Child, incidentally, said, "I didn't do anything at all to develop the restaurant," including supply any recipes or dishes. It is run by Seasoned Elements, a branch of a San Francisco catering company.
The exhibition includes poignant recollections of family gatherings by ordinary people and numerous interactive kiosks, including one with cascading beads resembling a hippie voting booth in which visitors are asked to identify foods prized elsewhere that they'd prefer to hide under their napkins. (Seal blubber? Calf brains?) Another asks visitors to identify cross sections of candy bars. "I know the C.E.O. of a very large software company who will do anything for a Reese's," said Angel I. Ferrer, a software developer from Alexandria, Va.
Serious issues concerning hunger, genetically altered foods, agribusiness and body image are addressed, but fleetingly. In a not-so-subtle bit of lobbying, the wisdom of restricting wine consumption to people 21 and over is also raised as a question.
The center, 12 years in the making, has been the consuming passion of Mr. Mondavi, a son of Italian immigrants, who founded it with his wife, Margrit Biever Mondavi, a native Napan. Some 40 vintners have also become major donors. At lunchtime, the din of clattering silverware wafts past the Wine Spectator Tasting Table in the Beringer Vineyard Atrium.
Mr. Mondavi, who has also recently donated $25 million to the University of California at Davis for a wine and food science institute and a performing arts center, each bearing his name, makes no bones about his motives. "We wanted to have a place where you could enjoy life and learn how to enhance your life," he said. "We wanted the center to combine all three -- wine, food and art -- to show that in moderation, wine is healthy and good for you, going back to the Egyptians and Romans."
Critics, many of whom have not yet visited, have expressed initial concern over whether the museum will maintain its independence from its backers. "There could be a strange fuzzy line between the supporters who've put in a ton of money and the museum itself," said Patricia Unterman, who is the chef and an owner of the Hayes Street Grill in San Francisco and a food writer.
Fears by some competitors that the high-profile museum might star the wines of Mr. Mondavi and other donors prompted an esoteric piece of legislation, which became law last year. Sponsored by State Senator Wesley Chesbro, who represents a wide swath of wine country, it prevents Copia from pouring or selling private-label wines in its gift shop, Cornucopia, or pouring them in its educational programs. It can dispense wine only under a generic Copia label. Part of the bill's purpose was "to prevent Copia from promoting those vintners who serve on its board of directors," Senator Chesbro said. "Museum ethics always require an arm's length between donors and your artistic purpose," said Kurt Nystrom, the center's deputy director. "It's a minefield every museum has to tread across."
More contentious perhaps has been the museum's reception among longtime Napans. Now the glittering centerpiece of a $300 million flood control project, financed by the federal government and a local sales tax, Copia has served as a symbol of change and a flash point for resentment in a town where the goddess of abundance has spent precious little time.
The cultural divide between this blue-collar city, which is 30 percent Hispanic, and "upvalley," with its $350-a-night country inns and charmed sybaritic life, is "strong and powerful," said Moira Johnston Block, founder of the Friends of the Napa River, which campaigned for Copia. An invisible psychic line has long separated laborers, many of whom live in Napa, from the Valley. Last summer 10 emergency yurts were erected to house migrant workers in Yountville about a mile from the French Laundry.
NAPA grew up along the river, which flooded regularly. Many residents were shipyard workers who commuted to Mare Island, about 20 miles away. When the shipyard closed in the early 1990's, it devastated the community. "We kind of lingered," said Ed Henderson, the mayor.
The city's riverine lifeblood became a repository of wrecked autos, chemicals, tannery wastes and other pollutants. Like many people here, George A. Elicker, whose great-grandparents came from Scotland in 1868, views the center, with its $12.50 admission fee, as "a monument to Mondavi, definitely not for the common people." At the local Mervyns discount store, a former forewoman at the Mondavi winery, who did not want her name used, put it this way: "Those who have money are for it. Those who don't are against it."
The center is a fork in the road. To Ms. Johnston Block and others, Mr. Mondavi's decision to put the museum in downtown Napa -- as urged by his second wife, Margrit, who raised her children here -- created "an anchor tenant for a revitalized Napa." Though the museum was not predicated on river restoration or flood control, the measure passed by residents in 1998 will restore the river to health and create seven miles of riverside trails.
Others are following suit: Francis Ford Coppola, a fellow vintner, is restoring the city's 1937 movie palace, the Uptown Theater, with a partner, and Mr. Mondavi has contributed to both the Oxbow School, a private art school for high school students, and the restoration of the 1879 Napa Valley Opera House, to be renamed, much to the chagrin of Mr. Elicker, the Margrit Biever Mondavi Opera House.
All this serves up some major challenges and opportunities for the museum. It must not only bridge the local divide but also, in changed economic and social times, walk an increasingly fine line between abundance and indulgence.
"There's a message that sometimes emanates from Northern California that the way to do good for the world is to eat gourmet food," said Warren Belasco, a food historian and a professor of American studies at the University of Maryland at Baltimore. "Maybe we have to give up stuff."
Since the terrorist attacks, said Barbara Haber, curator of books at the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University, "people want to be together more -- they're cherishing the everyday." Food and drink, she said, are inherently populist subjects. "Done well," she said, "the center can be meaningful and full of human sentiment, especially after an overabundant 1990's. It's not just a palace of gastronomy."
Ms. Loar said she is committed to tackling "not hoity-toity" subjects. For example, the museum might collaborate with economists from the University of California at Davis, one of three institutional partners, on an exhibition to help ordinary people shop more economically at the grocery store.
Right now there are some empty calories. Forthcoming exhibitions include a major show on teapots and "Sweet Tooth," which will feature paintings and sculpture related to desserts, materials to include gnawed chocolate. Next month, the Asian influence on the American table will be explored in cooking classes in the Asian garden and in seminars on subjects like sake and haiku.
Clark Wolf, a New York restaurant consultant, called the opening of Copia "a moment of record." But, he added, "it does have to prove itself."
"The key will be keeping it grounded and unpretentious," he said. "I'm nervous about someone out curating tomatoes."
In the end, it may be important to bear in mind that Julia Child's favorite food is baked potatoes.

HEADLINE: LESSONS; 
An Economic Recovery Will Tell in the Classroom

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE relation between family circumstances and a child's academic proficiency is well known, but policymakers usually assume that if all children can be held to the same standards, the achievement gap between rich and poor will eventually disappear. We pay too little attention to how social and economic forces themselves influence learning.
 Unemployment has now risen to 5.7 percent, up from less than 4 percent in October 2000. The biggest downturns have been in low-wage industries like hotels and restaurants. More job losses are expected. 
 If the past is any guide, rising unemployment will cause children's school performance to decline, but commentators will attribute the drop entirely to poor teachers, low standards or overcrowded schools. Educators will watch from the sidelines as Congress debates unemployment insurance or the timing of a stimulus package.
But these debates are not only about the economy. They will affect education. And steps to soften the recession could aid school performance.
Social science supports the common-sense idea that family stress has an impact on children; few stresses are as dangerous as a parent's job loss. Glen H. Elder, a professor at the University of North Carolina, found that unemployment in the 1930's often led to a deterioration in child-rearing practices. Some fathers who lost jobs became irritable, tense and moody. Their disciplinary styles became more arbitrary and punitive. Their children's aspirations and school performance then fell. The effects were even worse when job loss led to conflicts between husband and wife.
Studies of youth since the Great Depression confirm Dr. Elder's findings. Adolescent boys in families suffering sudden unemployment are more likely to be delinquent and use drugs. Girls are more likely to lose self-confidence and be depressed. In the already difficult middle school years, children of the unemployed are more likely to get into fights and refuse to complete schoolwork.
Unemployment also affects younger children, perhaps more than older ones. Under economic pressure, some mothers rely less on reasoning and more on threats, hostile comments and physical punishment. These can lead to children's emotional problems and lower academic performance.
The psychological impacts of job loss are compounded by more material ones. Nutrition and health care can suffer, especially for children of the low-income unemployed who are without the resources to cushion sudden hardship. These setbacks can harm cognitive ability. Loss of housing can force children to change schools, losing continuity of instruction. If families move to smaller apartments, or even to shelters, loss of study space can result.
In contrast, students probably do better when family incomes go up. School leaders take pride in the test-score improvements of recent years for low-income children. But school reforms may not have been entirely responsible for such gains in the strong economy of the 1990's. Some children may have had better nutrition and health care, more adequate and stable housing, and more patient parents, all of which nurtured learning.
A conclusion that economic security affects achievement is backed up in a new analysis by a team led by Eric Dearing, a Harvard researcher, showing that when poor families' income increases, their young children's readiness for school also goes up. Typically, low-income children enter school with fewer social and literacy skills than other children. But it is hard to say how much of this stems from income itself. Perhaps poor children do worse because their mothers have less education. If so, then raising family income would not in itself lead to more learning.
What is unusual about Dr. Dearing's work is his showing that school readiness improves in poor families whose incomes go up in comparison to the readiness of children who are similar in other respects except for the income gain.
Dr. Dearing's conclusion buttresses findings of studies done of mothers who move from welfare to work. These show that children's achievement improves if family income increases but may not when mothers do not gain substantially higher income. These analyses also reinforce the results of experiments conducted by the Nixon administration more than a quarter-century ago. Then, poor families were randomly selected to receive income supplements and their children's school performance improved.
It would be comforting to think that schools alone could raise achievement for low-income students, but such a shortcut is illusory. As shepherds of schoolchildren, educators have a stake in promoting a federal economic policy that focuses on immediate income support for the unemployed, because this in itself could make instruction more effective.

HEADLINE: Text of Federal Reserve's Statement 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, its monetary policy panel, said it would lower interest rates for the 11th time this year: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1.75 percent. 
In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 1.25 percent. 
 Economic activity remains soft, with underlying inflation likely to edge lower from relatively modest levels. To be sure, weakness in demand shows signs of abating, but those signs are preliminary and tentative. The committee continues to believe that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. 
Although the necessary reallocation of resources to enhance security may restrain advances in productivity for a time, the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate. 
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Another Rate Cut From the Fed 

 BODY:
An economic recovery may be on the horizon, but don't expect things to get frothy any time soon. That was the Federal Reserve Board's message to financial markets yesterday, as it cut overnight interest rates yet again, this time by a quarter of a percentage point. It was the 11th cut this year, bringing the rate down to 1.75 percent, below the rate of inflation and its lowest level in more than four decades. While noting that the economy remains soft, the central bank also indicated, for the first time, that it sees signs that the slump may be ending. 
 Once the current recession is over, Americans may be in for a period of lackluster growth. Lingering hopes for a dramatic "V-shaped" recovery, whereby the economy rockets back to its torrid late-90's pace, seem unrealistic. In an effort to stem the recent rise in longer-term interest rates, the Fed noted that inflation is likely to edge even lower. 
 The current recession is unusual because it was precipitated by a slowdown in capital spending by overextended businesses, instead of by weakening consumer demand. Indeed, under the circumstances, consumer spending has held up relatively well. Capitalizing on interest-free loans offered by car makers, consumers made October the best month ever, improbably enough, for vehicle sales.
All this means that the recovery anticipated by Wall Street, when it comes, may be lackluster. Business investment may pick up, but there will not be the kind of pent-up consumer demand associated with robust recoveries. The economy may drift, even as it ceases contracting. 
Last Friday the Labor Department reported a loss of 331,000 jobs during November. The jobless rate rose to 5.7 percent, the highest level in six years. Even forecasters who expect a rebound in the first half of next year anticipate the number of jobless to grow further.
The Fed's rate cuts this year did not stave off a recession, but they most likely made it less severe. Congress, distracted by the Republican agenda to cut taxes on the very rich, has so far failed to provide an equally meaningful stimulus. When it does, its first priority ought to be relief for the unemployed and low-wage earners, those who may be in for a rough "recovery" in 2002.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE CHARITIES; 
Those Who Lost Homes or Jobs Are to Get $2,500 Grants

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
The Sept. 11 Fund, the second-largest charity formed since the terror attacks, will announce plans today to distribute $75 million by year's end to victims and their families, with most of that money going to those who lost homes or jobs in Lower Manhattan.
 The payment plan is significant because it represents the single largest disbursement of charity aimed specifically at the legions of newly unemployed and homeless, a broad category that is excluded from many of the charities responding to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
 Under the fund's plan, an estimated 20,000 people who lost jobs or homes will receive $2,500 each, or about two-thirds of the $75 million. Only those who lived or worked south of Canal Street will qualify, and only those permanently displaced from their homes will be covered, officials said. 
The rest of the $75 million will be distributed to the families of those killed or injured, with each family getting a check for $10,000 regardless of how much they have already received from other charities.
Franklin Thomas, chairman of the $340-million Sept. 11 Fund, which was created by the United Way and the New York Community Trust, said in an interview yesterday that the cash-distribution plan is an attempt to make sure that the unemployed and those made homeless by the collapse of the World Trade Center are not overlooked -- as some assert has happened -- in the distribution of more than $1.5 billion in charitable donations.
John Haynes, 44, who lost his job as a chef in the employee cafeteria at Windows on the World, said a $2,500 check would be a welcome change after months of frustrating and often fruitless attempts to obtain assistance from charities. Over and over, he said, he has been politely turned away, forcing him to dip into his meager savings because he cannot support two children on a $279-a-week unemployment check. 
"For a lot of people who really need this money, this is a godsend," he said, speaking of himself and the thousands of others who lost jobs after the attacks. "We have been overlooked, and when we voice our concerns we only get crumbs, while others get pies."
Mr. Thomas said that the Sept. 11 Fund plans to hold back on distributing tens of millions of dollars, in part as a reserve to pay for long-term needs such as mental health counseling. But the reserve could also be used, he said, to address potential inequities if -- after all the charity and government aid has been distributed -- some families end up with far less than others.
Questions of equity have become particularly divisive in recent weeks. Some families are openly resentful at the hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing to the families of the firefighters, police officers and other uniformed rescuers who were killed on Sept. 11.
Several police and fire widows have argued that their families deserve a larger share of the charity because their husbands sacrificed their lives to save others.
"There's no damn perfect way to do this," Mr. Thomas said, acknowledging the virtual impossibility of distributing money in a way that pleases everyone. 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has been accused by some victims' families of giving preferential treatment to the families of uniformed casualties, said yesterday it was his concern for families who "might fall through the cracks" that prompted him to establish a new city office to provide each victim's family with a caseworker.
"There is potentially a great deal of aid available for all of the legitimate victims, the families of the legitimate victims of the World Trade Center," he told reporters. "But people need to know how to find it, how to access it." 
Like several other charities, the Sept. 11 Fund has faced severe criticism from some victims' families for not distributing donations more quickly and with less paperwork. Indeed, several leaders of Families of Sept. 11, a victims' group that represents hundreds of surviving relatives, greeted the news of the $75 million plan with skepticism yesterday, with some calling it a public relations gesture, albeit a welcome one. 
"They've caused so much pain," Carie Lemack, president of the group, said of the Sept. 11 Fund and other major charities, including the American Red Cross, which has raised more than $560 million for victims of the attacks.
Ms. Lemack, a Massachusetts resident whose mother was on one of the jets flown into the World Trade Center, complained that the Sept. 11 Fund has yet to distribute money to her local United Way, which has been helping more than 100 families.
A spokeswoman for the Sept. 11 Fund said a grant would be made soon. Nonetheless, Ms. Lemack vowed that she would never again donate a single dollar to a major charity. "Never in my life," she said.
Mr. Thomas acknowledged that the $75 million plan is, at least in part, a response to criticism about the sluggish, bureaucratic nature of the relief efforts.
"You can't not be influenced by some of that pressure," Mr. Thomas said. He noted, for example, that the cash-assistance checks would be sent out automatically, making use of thousands of names and addresses already collected by Safe Horizon and the Red Cross, the two major charities that dealt directly with victims.
No new application will be required, he said. Victims who have not signed up with those agencies may call 1-866-689-HELP (1-866-689-4357) to register for the cash assistance checks, or apply at their local United Way.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Internet Piracy Is Suspected As U.S. Agents Raid Campuses

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
Federal law enforcement agents seized computers and raided computer networks at M.I.T., the University of California at Los Angeles and other large universities today in shutting down what they described as one of the Internet's largest and most sophisticated software piracy networks.
 The Customs Service, which led the investigation, said that the network had distributed things like the latest Windows software and digital copies of the hit film "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." The ringleaders may include university students and employees and executives in the software industry, the officials said. 
 Duke and Purdue confirmed that raids had been carried out in dormitory rooms and that undergraduate students -- one at each school -- had been questioned by federal agents. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, officials said, the raid was directed at computers in the economics department. The University of Oregon said a raid had been carried out on computer equipment at an unidentified "off-campus location." 
Customs officials said arrests were imminent, although none were made today while investigators reviewed computer hard drives and other material seized in the raids. Raids were also carried out at several computer and software companies around the country.
Investigators said that the piracy ring dubbed itself the DrinkOrDie network and that members were so brazen that they had their own public Web site. They appeared to be motivated more by the thrill of piracy than by the opportunity for profit, the agents said, adding that the activity crossed international borders. Raids were also carried out today in Britain, Australia, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
Customs investigators would not identify the software executives under suspicion except to say that they were all experts in programming or Internet communications.
The investigators said some were insiders who stole software from their own firms and handed it over to the pirates, apparently viewing themselves as "Robin Hood" figures who took from their rich employers so the software would be freely available to the poor -- and anyone else with an interest in it. The stolen software was then posted on Internet sites for easy distribution.
The Customs Service said it could not immediately estimate the value of the software distributed by the DrinkOrDie network, described as one of the better known of several large software piracy gangs using the Internet. The software industry estimates that it loses about $12 billion a year because of all types of piracy, though it is not known how many people who use pirated software would otherwise buy it.
Investigators said the computers and computer networks raided today were found to contain thousands of copies of pirated business software, including some of the latest and most popular word-processing and spreadsheet programs, as well as the code for Sony PlayStation and Nintendo games.
They said they also found digitized versions of several other popular Hollywood films released in theaters in recent weeks, including "Behind Enemy Lines," "Monsters Inc." and "Spy Game."
Customs officials said this was the largest Internet software piracy investigation ever conducted across international borders. 
"This investigation underscores the severity and scope of a multibillion-dollar software swindle over the Internet," said Robert C. Bonner, the customs commissioner, "as well as the vulnerabilities of this technology to outside attack."
The Customs Service said it had singled out DrinkOrDie because it was considered one of most sophisticated of the rings operating within a loose, global network. The groups sprang up in the early 1990's when computer hackers began organizing into competitive gangs that stole software, "cracked" its security protections and then posted it online.
Investigators said that DrinkOrDie was founded in 1993 in Moscow by a Russian who was known to other hackers only by the code name "deviator." The piracy ring had a worldwide membership by 1995, the agents said, and after what appeared to be one of its earliest pirating feats, it took credit for releasing the Windows 95 operating system over the Internet two weeks before Microsoft released it to the public.
The Web site of the network, www.drinkordie.com, was closed today. Only the home page stayed available for a time; it displayed an animated vision of two human eyes and long sequences of the numbers 1 and 0, representing digital code.
The Customs Service said that the five universities raided today had cooperated and were not considered targets of the criminal investigation. "The search was done with the Duke police and with someone from our student affairs office present," said David Jarmul, a spokesman for the university. He said the raid had been carried out on the dormitory room of a male undergraduate.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Plans to Raise Transit Fares 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
Faced with a daunting deficit and falling government aid, New Jersey Transit today proposed its first fare increases in more than a decade.
 The state-run agency, apparently reversing a long reluctance in Trenton to raise fares, wants riders on its buses, commuter trains and the Newark subway to pay a 10 percent increase in the coming year, and additional increases pegged to inflation in each of the five years after that. 
 The proposal comes less than a week after New York's comptroller, H. Carl McCall, warned that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority might have to raise subway and bus fares by 50 cents in 2003 to help close a budget gap. The M.T.A. said such talk was premature, though it could not rule out an increase. 
New Jersey Transit's board of directors is to hold six public hearings on Jan. 2 on the fare proposal and is expected to disclose the locations at its meeting Wednesday, said James Weinstein, the state transportation commissioner and the agency's board chairman. If the board approves the increases, they will be the first since 1990 for the statewide system, supplementing fare revenues that have declined 29 percent in real dollars over the last decade while costs have risen 67 percent.
Exempted from the initial increase is the recently inaugurated Hudson-Bergen light rail system, since the fare structure there reflects current real costs, Mr. Weinstein said. After the first year of the fare increase, that line and all others would be subject to the inflation-driven increases, which would be automatic and not require approval by the board.
"It is no secret that N.J. Transit is facing a budget crisis," Mr. Weinstein said. "I believe this is the right time to advance this fare policy initiative."
Some mass transit advocates and state officials noted today that the timing of the proposal -- at the close of Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco's administration and before a new Legislature and Governor-elect James E. McGreevey take office -- was likely to diffuse political blame for the fare increases and make their adoption more likely.
A spokeswoman for Mr. McGreevey declined comment tonight on the fare proposal. "We have not received any information from New Jersey Transit, and we have not reviewed the proposal," said the spokeswoman, Jo Astrid Glading.
Many New Jersey commuters, who often find standing room only on crowded trains and buses, are already angry about the level of service and can be expected to be vocal in the hearings.
Few rider advocates or others familiar with mass transit in the state question the agency's need for higher fares and increased aid to operate the nation's third-largest public transportation system. Fares have not budged as state and federal operating assistance to the agency has either stalled or declined in recent years. The result is an annual operating deficit of $500 million, said Martin E. Robins, principal writer of a report saying last month that the agency was mired in a "financial morass."
"This is a reasonable first step," said Mr. Robins, who heads the Alan E. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. "But the next administration needs to create a blue-ribbon commission to look at transportation funding overall."
Jennifer Jaroski, New Jersey coordinator for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a mass transit advocacy group, agreed that a fare increase was needed, but as part of a balanced plan that also raises the gasoline tax, which finances highways. Revenues from drivers and from mass transit fares have to be balanced to keep one from siphoning off funds from the other, she said.
"But I think this should be pushed back until McGreevey is in office," she added. "He did campaign as a pro-transit candidate, and it is his administration, after all, which will be stuck with the decision."
Ranking members of transportation committees in both legislative houses today welcomed the fare proposal, which they said should mute some of the agency's requests for subsidies. It should also enable some of the state's private bus lines to increase fares without feeling that they are putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage, said State Senator Andrew R. Ciesla, a Republican and chairman of the Senate transportation committee. "But I don't think that the automatic inflation increases in the other years are fair," he said. "There needs to be some analysis of the marketplace to see if it is necessary."
If adopted, the 10 percent fare increase would mean an additional $44 million for the agency, which has an annual budget of $1.138 billion. Mr. Robins said that the figure was just a small fraction of the agency's deficit,and that continued state subsidies would be necessary. 
In recent years, according to his study, New Jersey Transit has made up for the lack of increases in subsidies and fares by using federal and state funds intended for long-term capital investments to meet some annual operating costs.
This has been done, he said, with the willing assistance of elected officials, who saw this approach as a way of avoiding pressure on the state's general fund that might lead to tax increases or less financing for other politically popular programs.

HEADLINE: Only the Latest Blow for a Staggered Commercial Printing Industry 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Several inches of dust on the floor made it look as if a snowstorm had blown through the offices of Admiral Communications, a printing company four blocks south of the World Trade Center. That was bad for the hundreds of reams of paper that had recently been delivered, much of it for a big job for one of the Wall Street firms that made up the bulk of Admiral's customer base before Sept. 11.
 Worse, however, was the ink that dried in the presses. Admiral's employees ran for their lives when the twin towers collapsed, and then the printing plant was closed off for three weeks in the zone around the disaster, inaccessible even to Arthur Baron, whose father founded the company in 1946. So one morning recently, insurance adjusters were trying to estimate the value of those eye-high stacks of ruined paper and dozens of rollers that had to be pried from the presses, slathered in dried ink. 
"Our phone service was out for three weeks, and our clients thought we were just gone," Mr. Baron said. "Now, we're doing less business with fewer employees. My gut feeling is we're barely surviving right now." 
A slowing economy already had New York City's printing industry on its knees on Sept. 11, when the cloud of soot settled over the industry's traditional home in Lower Manhattan. Restrictions on bridge and tunnel crossings made things worse, halting deliveries of ink, paper and finished products, even for printers in the boroughs outside Manhattan. The blows followed years in which rising real estate prices and traffic bottlenecks forced printing companies, like many other manufacturers, out of Manhattan. 
Now, dozens of printing employees have been laid off across the city, and companies in related industries, like graphic arts, are suffering too. For many printing companies, the business of producing reports for stock offerings sank with the dot-com market. The cancellation of orders for trade-show brochures and advertising campaigns after Sept. 11 have them wondering if their futures are in doubt.
"Business has never been this slow for most companies since the 1980's," said Vicki Keenan, director of public affairs for the Association of Graphic Communications, a regional trade group for printers. "The logistics of the security measures around the city have had a huge impact on the ability of companies to deliver products, and the smaller printers have been hit particularly hard." 
Admiral's plight is shared by several printing companies near ground zero, most acutely Fitch Graphics, whose building at 130 Cedar Street was showered with debris from the trade center, including steel beams that crashed through the roof.
"We are very grateful that all our people got out," said John Fitch, the company's owner. But even operating out of a secondary print site on West 45th Street, he has only been able to bring back about 25 of 70 employees because of a lack of business.
Mr. Fitch said he had applied to several aid programs. He was told that the company has too many employees to qualify for the city's grant program for small manufacturers, and another aid program told Mr. Fitch that it could not make a loan big enough to suit his company's needs. 
"All we need is one little grain of sand in the billion-dollar bucket and we can put 50 people back to work," he said. 
Farther from the disaster site, business is moderately better, but is still suffering from the economic downturn and sharp limits on corporate marketing budgets.
"There has been a tremendous dip in advertising work," said Stuart Leventhal, owner of Lexicon, a printing company on Hudson Street north of Canal Street. "People are afraid to make a commitment and do things and spend money. For us, a little bit of fear equals a lot of business lost or shifted into the unforeseen future."
Anthony Caifano, secretary-treasurer for Local 1 of the Amalgamated Lithographers of America union, said about 10 percent of the union's 2,000 members have been laid off since Sept. 11. The industry was particularly hurt by the attack, he said, because most printing jobs for the holidays take place in September and October.
City economic officials have taken some steps to help the printing industry. Last month, City Hall and the Economic Development Corporation selected Hudson Development to build a $25 million, 400,000-square-foot building specifically for printing companies in College Point, Queens. That followed the establishment in May 2000 of an $8 million relocation fund to help commercial printers and graphic arts companies move to new sites in New York City.
In recent years, many printing companies that were based in downtown Manhattan have moved to Long Island City, Queens, in part to take advantage of cheaper rent and more space. Many of them, however, had been all but forced out of their warehouse-type buildings when landlords converted them to commercial office space, allowing them to charge higher rents.
Alan Bergman, a co-owner of the Hudson Printing Company, moved the company to Long Island City 13 months ago after its rent was raised. 
Founded by Mr. Bergman's grandfather in Manhattan in 1922, Hudson Printing was able to retain most of its customers and all of its employees despite the move, Mr. Bergman said, as well as configure its printing and assembly lines more efficiently, thanks to more space. 
But business has slowed recently, he said, as companies have canceled trade shows and seminars, eliminating the need for brochures and other printed materials.
What bothers Mr. Bergman more, he said, is the fact that the city often sends printing orders for official government business to printers outside the city, the state or even the country. 
"Obviously, that hurts," Mr. Bergman said. "We think city printing business should stay in the city. Every small printer in New York City has excess capacity. I don't think it would be a problem for any of us to accommodate the city's work."
Warner Johnston, a spokesman for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, said the city takes the lowest bidder for nearly all of its printing jobs. "As the guardian of public funds, we have the responsibility to use the contractor who costs us the least," he said.
The decision by NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau, to move up its midwinter tourism promotion to November from January appeared to be some balm. But then the rush order, for 450,000 copies of a new 24-page tourism brochure, went to a printing company in New Jersey.
Tourism officials said the requirements for quick turnaround of a large printing job required the greater capacity available only at bigger printers outside the city. 
"We certainly make every effort to print our stuff in the city," said Keith Yazmir, a spokesman for NYC & Company. "But our marketing efforts support a $25 billion industry. If we can get people to visit more quickly, then all those people are going to make a lot more money than just a single vendor on a relatively small printing project."
Mr. Yazmir added that a smaller one-page flier on tourism packages was printed in New York City. 
New York printers take cold comfort in that, however, and several said that the money saved on an individual printing job is offset by jobs lost in New York City. 
"There's a real malaise in the communications industry in New York," said Mr. Leventhal, of Lexicon printers. "It's definitely more difficult to be a printer here than it had been in the past."

HEADLINE: Should I Get a Mammogram? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Whether mammograms save lives or not (front page, Dec. 9; editorial, Dec. 10), one thing we know for sure: diagnosis and treatment can never end the breast cancer epidemic. That requires prevention. 
 The nearly threefold increase in breast cancer risk in the United States since the 1940's strongly suggests that environmental factors, which may be changed, are still to be discovered. Yet the entire budget of the National Institute for Environmental Health Science is $500 million, while the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation estimates the cost of breast cancer to the United States economy at $6 billion. 
 An investment in environmental research is speculative, of course, since we cannot anticipate where it will lead; but it is our daughters' best hope.

KROGER TO LAY OFF 1 ,500 AFTER 33% DROP IN EARNINGS

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The Kroger Company, the supermarket chain, announced yesterday that it would cut about 1,500 jobs after reporting that third-quarter earnings had fallen 33 percent because of the sluggish economy and one-time expenses. 
Kroger also lowered its earning forecast for the fourth quarter. Its shares fell $3.38, to $19.92. Earnings for the quarter ended Nov. 10 were $133.1 million, or 16 cents a share, down from $200.9 million, or 24 cents a year ago. That included third-quarter expenses of $10 million for systems conversions, $110 million for store closings and $81 million for energy contracts in California. Sales in the quarter rose 3.8 percent, to $11.38 billion, from $10.96 billion last year.

For Some Professions, Thinking Small Can Pay Big Dividends

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
Engineers, architects and surveyors are well paid almost anywhere. But if they really want to make their paychecks go farther, they should consider moving to Corpus Christi, Tex.; Mobile, Ala., or Hickory, N.C. 
 That may seem surprising, but according to an analysis of compensation data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 1999, the most recent available year, they earned more than three times the average income in those cities, better than they could do anywhere else. Where did they fare the worst? Springfield, Mass., and New York City. There, their pay was only 41 percent and 47 percent higher, respectively, than the average. 
 The same analysis showed that lawyers were best compensated in Washington at 338 percent of the average working wage. They did not do nearly as well in Minneapolis-St. Paul, where they were only 66 percent above the average.
 Why such disparities? Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, said: "Strong demand for workers is most evident in industries and businesses that drive local economies. So, in Corpus Christi, home to much of the nation's energy exploration and development, surveyors are in high demand and their compensation reflects that."
 Whatever the reason, the numbers point to a time-tested workplace truth: go where they need you. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Overtime Becomes Class-Action Fodder 

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
Chris Lyle was excited about her promotion from waitress to store manager at Pizza Hut in Northern California a few years ago, but soon wondered what her new title really meant. She said her duties were mostly making dough, mopping floors and taking orders, pretty much what an hourly worker would do -- except she was not paid overtime. "There were times my employees were making more money than me, when I looked at the hours I worked," said Mrs. Lyle, 30, who lives in Fairfield, Calif.
 Mrs. Lyle worked as a manager in several Pizza Hut stores from 1993 to 1998, including a full-service restaurant and take-out shops, starting at a salary of $18,000. "I thought it was a lot of money," she said. But the 50-hour week that managers were supposed to put in turned out to be more like 60, she said. 
 Mrs. Lyle, who now works at a mattress company, was a plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit against Pizza Hut by salaried workers who said they were misclassified under federal and state labor laws as exempt from time-and-a-half overtime wages. The suit was settled in May for over $10 million.
Pizza Hut's general counsel, Robert Millen, would not comment on Mrs. Lyle's case but said, "Our policy is always to pay our employees a fair wage for their work, in compliance with all applicable laws."
The debate about who is legally entitled to overtime pay has received more attention recently thanks to a flurry of class-action lawsuits seeking overtime pay at household names including Starbucks and U-Haul. One factor behind the trend was the team-building craze of recent years that blurred the lines between workers and managers, according to Jerry M. Newman, professor of organization and human resources at the University of Buffalo.
"In a team, there's a lot more sharing of responsibilities and less care is paid to who's the manager and who isn't," Mr. Newman said. In addition, recent labor shortages in some industries forced more managers to take on rank-and-file tasks. With the economy now in recession, companies are further fueling worker discontent with layoffs and reduced paid overtime.
Mark Cheskin, a Miami labor lawyer who represents businesses, says class-action lawsuits at his practice have gone up close to 10 percent over the last year. In one case, a store manager who was fired by a retailer Mr. Cheskin represents contends that he was not a manager, even though he supervised about 100 people and 4 departments. The former employee says he mostly helped customers, cleaned the work site and stocked inventory.
"We're seeing more people wondering about whether they are really exempt,"said Bill Coleman, senior vice president for compensation at Salary.com, a salary-comparison Web site. "The average employee doesn't know the ins and outs of overtime."
Indeed, Mr. Coleman said, the 1938 Federal Fair Labor Standards Act that governs overtime pay "is universally misunderstood." It outlines four types of employees who can be exempted from overtime-pay requirements -- executives who manage some part of a company's business and have the authority to hire and fire workers; administrators who perform nonmanual work and exercise some independent judgment; professionals like lawyers and accountants; and traveling sales representatives. While the act offers detailed descriptions, the actual decisions on who is really exempt are open to interpretation by the courts or by Labor Department investigators.
State labor laws can also come into play. For example, California, where many class-action overtime suits have hit the courts in the last few years, is thought to have the nation's most employee-friendly overtime laws. There, employees are exempt from the overtime rule only if they spend more than half their time on exempt duties that require them to use their own discretion and judgment, experts say.
One widely publicized California case involved claims adjusters at Farmers Insurance Exchange, a unit of the Los Angeles-based Farmers Insurance Group, whom the company classified as exempt from overtime. A jury ruled in July that Farmers owed $90 million for not paying its claims adjusters overtime, noting that the adjusters had "no formal advisory role" in managing business functions or making corporate policy.
Mary Flynn, a Farmers spokeswoman, said the company was appealing.
Such overtime disputes are popping up across the country. In Tennessee, 20 workers with managerial and administrative titles at the Tennessee Valley Authority, the largest public power utility, sued the company for eliminating overtime wages.
Steven Warren of Niota, Tenn., has worked for the company, based in Knoxville, for 15 years, holding a number of positions including shift supervisor and lieutenant. He said he typically worked 44-hour weeks, but if someone were on vacation he would have to work an extra 12-hour shift free.
Basically, he said, he was responsible for making sure employee training was up to date, but he did not have the authority to hire and fire workers or establish workplace policies. "We didn't have the power to do anything," he said.
In October, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found that the shift supervisors at Tennessee Valley who were part of the suit "did spend some of their time supervising employees," but "this supervision was not managerial in nature because they had no control over the people they supervised." The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision in 1999 to award the workers more than $500,000 in back overtime pay.
John Moulton, a spokesman for Tennessee Valley, said that the agency did not think the employees were entitled to overtime and that it was considering an appeal.
In another case, the Labor Department investigated an overtime claim at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in June and found that 92 respiratory therapists were entitled to a total of nearly $119,000 in back overtime pay.
A hospital spokesman said it had changed its policy but had also altered scheduling so that therapists did not work overtime because it could not afford to pay it.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs, Enron has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation. Only one group of true believers remains: the people who worked there and just got burned there.
 They may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management. 
 Even so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where, they wonder, can they go from here? 
"Innovative is a cliche, but that's what Enron was," Brandon Rigney, who operated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. "This is four days gone from the place, and I'm already in withdrawal."
Enron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire.
It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company's energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions.
In recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34, he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets.
Mr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because it "didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity."
Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative company for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job.
Under Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, the company tested new strategies, like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace.
"You could come up with an idea and get people excited," said Janel Guerrero, 33, who worked in Enron's government affairs department, noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly.
"You didn't ponder; it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover," she added. 
Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy, paper, pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising. But quickness sometimes exacts a price. Some ventures went broke, like Azurix, its spinoff water company. The broadband unit lost about $1 billion.
"When top management got into broadband, metal, steel, pulp, we thought it was innovative," Mr. Rigney said. "When people said, 'We'll trade water and waste water -- that's the future,' we said, 'That's cool.' I didn't hear dissent in the ranks. But I drank the Kool-Aid with everyone else, even though it made my head throb."
Indeed, the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations, critics say. Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money, the company collapsed last month. But even near the end, it was buzzing with new ventures.
"I just got here five months ago," said Fred Radvansky, 38, who was attending a Houston job fair. "I was part of a group of about 70 people. We were rolling out a new Enron model. We were going to start trading freight."
If inventiveness flourished at Enron, the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses: cutthroat competition and management arrogance.
"It was kind of like a dot-com phenomenon," said Harvey J. Padewer, president of energy services at Duke Energy, a big utility. "They created a kill-and-eat culture."
Mr. Rigney, the former Web site operator, remembers it well. "People tried to take work away from you," he said. "There was a Darwinism for ideas, for projects."
That undermined the company's health, critics say. For example, it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their long-term effect on the bottom line.
Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive 5 to 10 percent of the work force damaged morale, and some longtime employees felt unwanted. "There were all these M.B.A.'s coming in and they were evaluating things differently," said Becky Cantrell, who worked on regulatory matters. "I was one of the oldest people at 55. When I saw someone my age it was a relief."
For all the doubts some employees harbored, others reveled in the derring-do atmosphere even after Enron's financial fall, and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc., a stodgy Houston electric utility.
"They bragged about being a meat-and-potatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska," one former Enron employee said. "We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types. It would have never worked."
After the merger fell apart, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and laid off about 4,000 employees in Houston. Over the next few days, television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings, even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enron's shimmering new 40-story headquarters office tower. Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail. Others are still packing up and wondering.
"I don't think Enron will ever be recreated," Mr. Shankman said on Thursday, sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for 500 people at Enron. "Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early."
Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down; it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets, like projects in Brazil and India.
Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies. In the meantime, some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites. Others are writing letters to The Houston Chronicle about how, for a brief time, they thought they were part of something special.
"Enron was what I thought epitomized a global 'American Dream' of sorts," wrote Kathy Walthall, a former Enron contractor. "By far the best days of my career were as a consultant for Enron. The environment was an extreme rush. Very busy, very progressive and innovative."
But Ms. Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the company to fall so swiftly.
"I really hope the company turns around," she wrote. "But I know it will never be the same."

Modest Rally Fizzles After Merck's Warning on Earnings

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks erased much of their gains yesterday, after a modest afternoon rally that followed the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate reduction faded when Merck & Company warned that it would not meet its earnings forecast.
 Merck's forecast weighed on other drug makers and helped to drag some major indexes lower. Technology stocks, however, eked out modest gains. 
 "First the Fed cut," said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Company. But the statement "coming out of it was still pretty cautious and that keeps investors nervous," he said. 
"Merck was definitely the knockout punch for the day," he added.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 33.08 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 9,888.37. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.17 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,136.76. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index rose 9.81 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,001.93.
Stocks initially moved higher after the Federal Reserve trimmed short-term interest rates for the 11th time this year, reducing the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, to 1.75 percent, its lowest level in 40 years. The Fed said, however, that some signs of economic weakness appeared to be abating.
"The text was much more important than the action itself," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen. "They're starting to make noises that what they've done already is enough."
Still, the Fed's policy makers said that those signs of improvement were preliminary and tentative, leading many analysts to believe that the central bank left itself room to reduce rates again when it meets in January.
As investors tried to sort through exactly what the Fed's statement meant, the late-afternoon earnings warning by Merck overshadowed any upbeat sentiment. The company, one of the 30 Dow industrials, said its earnings for 2001 would be lower than previous projections. In a meeting with analysts and investors, Merck executives said they were comfortable with earnings in the range of $3.12 to $3.15 a share. The company had previously forecast earnings of $3.12 to $3.18 a share. Shares of Merck tumbled $6.29, to $60.70, on the news.
Merck's news weighed on other drug makers. Eli Lilly fell $1.14, to $80.40; Pfizer dipped 99 cents, to $40.35, and American Home Products lost $1.44, to $58.75.
General Motors, another Dow component, also lost ground yesterday. Its shares fell $1.69, to $48.65, after its partner, Fiat Auto, sold more than $5 billion in five-year notes that could be converted into 32 million G.M. shares.
Technology stocks were among the day's few bright spots. Shares of Nokia, the world's largest cellphone maker, leapt $1.71, to $25.50, after the company said it would meet and possibly exceed its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.
Other wireless communications equipment makers were buoyed by Nokia's upbeat forecast. Motorola advanced 17 cents, to $16.82, and Ericsson rose 19 cents, to $6.01.

The Man Behind the Curtain In the Hewlett-Compaq Merger

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
With its merger with Compaq in serious danger, Hewlett-Packard will increasingly turn to a leading member of its board to sell the plan to large shareholders, whose votes will make or break the deal.
 The board member, Richard A. Hackborn, a 33-year Hewlett veteran, is unknown outside the industry. But in the face of the rejection of the merger by the heirs of the Hewlett-Packard founders, he is probably the best person to lend credibility to the plan. 
 Mr. Hackborn, 64, tall and white-haired, pushed to bring the company's chief executive, Carleton S. Fiorina, in two years ago from Lucent Technologies. He has been her adviser and mentor. To ease her transition and coach her, Mr. Hackborn took the chairman's post for several months, before handing it off to her. He is the guiding hand behind a strategic rethinking at Hewlett-Packard that began even before Ms. Fiorina arrived, and that eventually led to the Compaq Computer bid. 
Now, both companies must convince investors and the industry that the combination is the best way forward -- a risk, yes, but a carefully calculated one that is well worth taking.
Mr. Hackborn began his career at the company in the HP Labs as an engineer, and he was soon heading research-and-development teams. In 1977, seeking new challenges, he moved to Boise, Idaho, and he proceeded to build the Hewlett-Packard printer business, the corporate crown jewel.
He was known for contributing thoughtful, detailed strategy papers on various subjects from Boise. "I did it when I was asked, and sometimes when I wasn't," Mr. Hackborn observed during an interview last week at his large, ranch home in Boise, with a waterfall and a pond on a wooded three acres.
Three times over the years, William Hewlett and David Packard, the founders, came to his home, urging him to return to the Silicon Valley headquarters. The last offer was to become chief executive.
Yet Mr. Hackborn and his wife, Sondra, a native Californian who moved north reluctantly at first, had grown deeply attached to the natural beauty of Idaho and their local network of friends. He turned down the offer.
Mr. Hackborn retired as an executive vice president of Hewlett-Packard at 56. Shortly afterward, he got a call from Bill Gates, asking him to join the Microsoft board, which he did until last year when his work on Hewlett-Packard matters became increasingly time consuming.
Throughout the industry, Mr. Hackborn is highly regarded as both a skilled technologist and a shrewd strategist. And he commands respect in Silicon Valley in a way that Ms. Fiorina, an outsider who is seen as a general manager instead of someone who deeply understands technology, cannot.
"I'm not a big fan of Carly's," said one venture capitalist, who worked at Hewlett-Packard for years. "But if Dick Hackborn really supports the deal, you have to take it seriously."
In 1998, in the midst of the technology boom, Mr. Hackborn said he became "really concerned" about what he saw as the festering troubles at Hewlett-Packard. The personal computer business trailed behind more efficient rivals, notably Dell Computer, and was losing money. The company's business in larger computers, mostly data-serving machines running the Unix operating system, was not making much money, even when industry demand was surging. And Hewlett-Packard was not really embracing the Internet.
The company, Mr. Hackborn said, had become sluggish at a time when speed was essential. The first step was to bring in Ms. Fiorina, someone from outside the traditional culture to shake things up. "We needed a much greater push for change at the top, with more urgency," he said. "We needed someone who could drive change and could articulate it."
He credits her with learning at "lightning speed" a wealth of detail about the industry, customers and products. Not every step has been sure-footed, but Mr. Hackborn said he and the board backed Ms. Fiorina wholeheartedly. "She's going through a massive learning experience," he said. "We knew it was going to be a learning experience."
The Hewlett-Packard board first discussed the possibility of acquiring Compaq at the end of 1999, but serious merger talks did not begin until last June. "None of us was convinced that Compaq was the exact right answer at the start," Mr. Hackborn conceded.
The deal's opponents contend that those initial reservations were the right instinct, and that the Compaq merger is a mistake. They say that the merger would reduce the size and profitability of Hewlett-Packard's most valuable franchise -- the printer business -- in the combined company, while increasing the shareholders' bet on the troubled personal computer business. And the critics point out that big mergers in the fast-moving computer business nearly always fail, as the two enterprises are distracted with internal matters as markets and rivals move ahead.
Mr. Hackborn, however, said he had come to believe firmly that the Compaq merger offered opportunities that Hewlett-Packard should seize now as the industry is consolidating in a slump.
First, combining with Compaq will help fix the PC business, giving Hewlett greater size and efficiency. The Dell model of selling PC's directly -- instead of through resellers and other middlemen -- is the way to go, he said. "Compaq is moving there rapidly," Mr. Hackborn said. "It's not Dell yet, but it's a lot further along than H.P."
Second, he believes that there is a "huge opportunity" for the combined company in the future generation of data-serving computers, based on the new Itanium chip, jointly developed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard. Server computers using the high-performance Itanium chips will start to ship in large numbers by the middle of next year. They promise to bring the lower-cost economics of the PC world into corporate data centers, a lucrative stronghold for mainframes and large Unix machines, where I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems are leaders.
Because it helped develop the Itanium technology, Hewlett-Packard will be given certain advantages over other computer makers. It gets a head start of several months in bringing its Itanium-based machines to market, for example. The largest market for Itanium chips is expected to be on machines running Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, though Itanium technology will also work well with Linux, a variant of the Unix operating system that is distributed free, and Hewlett-Packard's flavor of Unix.
Working closely with Intel and Microsoft, Mr. Hackborn says, Hewlett-Packard can be the leading designer of Itanium-based server computers and supplier of related hardware and services.
As such, Hewlett-Packard sees its future as being the lower-cost alternative to I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems in the lucrative market of supplying the data centers of large corporations. And Compaq is a leading maker of PC-based servers and data storage systems and has a large corporate customer base -- all of which, Mr. Hackborn insists, should accelerate that strategy. 
"This puts the new H.P. on a comparable footing with Intel and Microsoft," he said.
The opponents of the deal, Mr. Hackborn argues, have no plan for Hewlett-Packard's future. But should they prevail, he suggests, it will be a future without him. 
"If the merger gets turned down by shareholders," he said, "they will have to get a board and a management to fix the PC business and these other problems."

HEADLINE: Rating Firm Turns Negative About New Jersey's Economy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
In the clearest sign yet of New Jersey's weakening fiscal condition, Moody's Investors Service warned today that the state is likely to face a significant downturn during the next 18 months, and assigned a negative outlook to the state's newly issued municipal bonds. 
 While the agency did not take the more drastic step of downgrading the state's bonds, which still have a high rating of Aa2, Moody's financial analysts said that the falling tax revenues and sputtering national economy had forced them to adjust their outlook for New Jersey's economy from "stable" to "negative." 
 The report also forecast that New Jersey was likely to exhaust its budget reserve fund of $1.2 billion this fiscal year, which ends next June, and could face a deficit of $2.4 billion -- or 10 percent of total state revenues -- for the fiscal year beginning in July 2003. Robert A. Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's, said New Jersey's economic performance was likely to be hampered by the national recession. 
New Jersey's dependence on the financial services industry, combined with the aftereffects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, have also contributed to a downturn in the state's economy.
News of the bond agency's bleak assessment of the state's finances intensified the running dispute between Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco and Governor-elect Jim McGreevey, who takes office Jan. 15. Mr. DiFrancesco has accused Mr. McGreevey of exaggerating the extent of the state's budget shortfall in order to prepare state residents and legislators for strict austerity in the early days of the McGreevey administration.
But nearly as soon as he was elected, Mr. McGreevey began warning state residents that he was inheriting a budget crisis that could culminate in a $1.9 billion deficit in its $24 billion budget this fiscal year and a $3.7 billion gap the next year. 
The analysts at Moody's said they did not wish to take sides in the political disagreement between Mr. McGreevey and Mr. DiFrancesco. But much of its forecast seemed close to the bleak assessment Mr. McGreevey and his transition team have been giving, and the governor-elect pointed out those similarities today as he repeated his call for legislators to rein in their spending during the final weeks of the legislative term that ends Jan 7.
"Moody's corroborates and confirms to a large measure our projections," he said, "so you know, to ignore Moody's and budgetary realities while engaging in profligate spending is simply irresponsible."
The Senate Democratic leader, Richard J. Codey, responded to Moody's new assessment of the state's finances by withdrawing one spending bill he had sponsored, a $14 million proposal to equip the state's acute care hospitals with additional staffing and equipment to treat patients who suffer strokes. Mr. Codey also urged fellow senators to pull $100 million in new spending bills now being considered by the Senate budget panel. 
But it was unclear whether other lawmakers would follow suit. And Tom Wilson, Mr. DiFrancesco's spokesman, said that for all the McGreevey administration's discussion of deficits, the governor-elect had offered only scant suggestions about ways to cut spending or increase revenue.
"They've identified problems that are in the billions, and the solutions they've proposed are only in the millions," Mr. Wilson said.
Whether or not Mr. McGreevey makes detailed deficit-reduction proposals before his inauguration, it is clear he will face an array of unpleasant choices as he prepares his first budget in a time of austerity and growing economic uncertainty. During the last eight years, even as the state's economy enjoyed a record boom, New Jersey sharply increased its debt load, thereby limiting the amount of borrowing Mr. McGreevey will be able to do without hurting the state's bond rating and increasing its interest costs.
Mr. McGreevey has also narrowed his own options by making a campaign promise not to raise taxes. But keeping that promise -- amid declining tax revenues, a sputtering economy and an expected rise in public assistance costs -- will test Mr. McGreevey's creativity as a manger. 
Mr. Kurtter said that Moody's decided not to take the more drastic step of lowering the rating on New Jersey's bonds because the incoming McGreevey administration had promised to make deficit reduction its top priority and seemed intent on reining in the state's spending.

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns Zimbabwe That Next Year's Election Must Be Fair 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
A senior Bush administration official met today with Zimbabwe's ministers of finance and foreign affairs and warned them that time was running out to create an environment for fair national elections next year.
 The mission, led by Walter H. Kansteiner, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, followed an overwhelming vote in the House of Representatives last week for a bill that would offer Zimbabwe economic incentives if it eased its recent authoritarian moves, but would urge President Bush to punish Zimbabwe if it failed to act. 
 Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, who has held office since blacks won majority rule in 1980, announced today that national elections would take place in March. At 77, he is running again for office, and faces a major challenge from the Movement for Democratic Change. 
In recent months, his government has cracked down on opposition supporters and on the independent news media. The crackdown and Zimbabwe's efforts to limit international monitoring of the elections have alarmed many countries. 
Mr. Kansteiner said the credibility of the elections was a principal topic of the meetings today.
"Our message was, 'You still have time to make this right,' " Mr. Kansteiner said by telephone. "If you have a free and fair electoral process, the election can reflect the will of the people and the voice of the Zimbabwean people will be heard."
The response from Finance Minister Simba Makoni and Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge was, Mr. Kansteiner said, ambiguous. "It was clear they wanted to show some flexibility," he said, "but at the same time, clearly they are worried about their political future." 
News reports from Harare said President Mugabe had announced that he would allow election observers from the Organization of African Unity, and even from the Commonwealth, but that only Africans would be accepted. 
Calls seeking further comment from Jonathan Moyo, the minister of information, were not answered.
Leaders from the Southern African Development Community also concluded meetings today with Mr. Mugabe. Neighboring countries have become increasingly frustrated by Zimbabwe's mounting economic and political problems, and the development meetings today and Monday were an attempt to exert pressure. 
But the members of the development community have opposed sanctions, a step the European Union is considering. Southern African nations fear that punitive steps could unsettle the region further.
Inflation in Zimbabwe is soaring, AIDS infection and unemployment are high and the country, once one of Africa's most self-sufficient, will need food aid for hundreds of thousands of people in coming months. 
Still, Mr. Kansteiner said he was encouraged by signals from regional capitals in recent weeks. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and others have increased their criticism of the Mugabe government, reflecting "a worry about the way this country is headed," he said.
Mr. Kansteiner said he made little headway on the question of foreign new media, which the two ministers said have been unfair to Zimbabwe. Many international news organizations have been denied entry to Zimbabwe. "I suggested that if you allowed the international press to come to Zimbabwe, you might get more coverage and better coverage," he said.

HEADLINE: Bye, Rudy, Yurts And All 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
It was getting dark.
Outside, City Hall was covered with Christmas wreaths basking in the 50-degree weather.
 Inside, the mayor was sorting through stuff in his office, figuring out what to pack, collecting pictures of his son, Andrew, on the podium the day of the 1994 swearing-in and later in his high school football uniform. He would take his Sammy Sosa black home-run bat, he said last night, swinging it a bit. But the Yankees championship Waterford crystal bats would have to stay, the Conflict of Interest Board said. 
 Yep, Rudy's really leaving. And he's at peace with that. Or so he says.
I ask where he will live.
"Got any good suggestions?" Mayor Giuliani asked, grinning and looking relaxed for the first time in a long time. "I have my tent the Moroccan ambassador gave me. No, it was the Mongolian ambassador."
"Your yurt," nods his spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel.
I suggest that maybe Michael Bloomberg will let him stay in Gracie Mansion, since he prefers his posh Upper East Side town house.
"I think Mike's going to eventually move into Gracie Mansion," he says. "For security reasons."
He's nonchalant about his successor appointing a raft of Democrats. "I appointed a lot of Democrats," he said. "I think he's trying to get the best people and forget about this Democrat-Republican-Liberal stuff. Besides, even if Mike were to hire every Republican in New York City, he'd have 1,000 jobs left over."
In this quiet moment, he talks about his unquiet year.
"I think actually the most fundamental change occurred when I dealt with prostate cancer," he said. "That was the first time that required me to say, 'I am going to die. Not necessarily of cancer, but I am gonna die.' So you realize you'd better do something with your life that makes you happy with yourself. I decided politics was not my entire life."
Enter Judith Nathan?
"We're very, very close," he says, for once not flinching at the mention of his personal life. "She's very sensitive. She's very smart. She's got me to focus on my health in a way that I never did before. She's made me think about exercise. I don't always do it, but I think about it a lot."
I asked him if it was strange for him to spend time with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the woman he had once planned to vitiate in a campaign.
"I really respected the way she handled herself the couple of times she came to ground zero. She seemed to be sincerely moved by what she was dealing with. Some people didn't have as much humanity. They were trying, but they couldn't really give themselves to other people."
He says we should be ready for terrorists to attack again. He was surprised at Osama bin Laden's contention on tape that he did not expect the twin towers to fall.
"If you wanted to do a certain amount of damage but not take the buildings down, it would be much easier to use a private airplane, which they could just have stolen," he said.
Does he think the attorney general is impinging too much on civil liberties?
"No, it seems right," he said. "We're still in the middle of an emergency. We're still at war."
I asked if he thought John Walker, the American Taliban fighter, was a "poor fellow," as the president put it, or if he wanted him strung up.
"I could feel sorry for someone and still string 'em up," said the former prosecutor.
Did he have any regrets about trying to stay on for three months?
"Maybe I personalized it too much," he said. "It was almost like it was a personal attack, here this was my city and I had done so much to make it a beautiful city. The economy was doing much better than the country. So when the attack took place, I thought, God, I can't leave now. I have to put this all back together neatly and hand it off to somebody.
"I was in a different place than being a politician at that point. I was thinking of it as a patriot, this is my patriotic duty to put it back in better condition."
The next mayor and the president don't seem that eager to have Rudy around, casting his hero's shadow.
So what will he do? Start a management and crisis consulting business with friends and lecture.
"I just love doing speeches," he said. "I could do 10 a day if they'd let me -- on any subject."
Does the idea of being governor or president beckon?
"Would I want to be involved in elective or appointed office in the future?" he said. "Yeah, I would."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ATTITUDES; 
Public Is Wary But Supportive On Rights Curbs

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
Americans are willing to grant the government wide latitude in pursuing suspected terrorists but are wary of some of the Bush administration's recent counterterrorism proposals and worried about the potential impact on civil liberties, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 In general, they remain overwhelmingly supportive of the administration's handling of the war on terrorism. But public opinion on the tradeoff between national security and civil liberties has more nuances than many in the White House and on Capitol Hill have suggested, the survey found. 
 Fifty-one percent said it was not a good idea to try foreigners accused of terrorism in secret military proceedings, a possibility under a recent presidential order.
And 8 in 10 Americans said they believed the president should make changes in the criminal justice system in consultation with Congress, not by executive order, as he has done recently. 
In another sign of Americans' unsettled feelings, when asked what worried them more -- that the government would fail to enact strong antiterrorism laws or that the government would enact new antiterrorism laws that excessively restrict the average person's civil liberties -- Americans were evenly divided, 43 to 45 percent.
Still, the public shares the Bush administration's hard line on many key issues: Nearly 8 in 10 support indefinite detention for noncitizens deemed a threat to national security. More than 7 in 10 backed government monitoring of conversations between suspected terrorists in jail and their lawyers. Sixty-four percent said that in wartime, it was a good idea for the president to have the authority to change rights usually guaranteed by the Constitution.
And a plurality of Americans see the Republicans as the party better able to make the right decisions in dealing with terrorists, reflecting their traditional advantage on law and order issues, which the Democrats have fought hard to seize in recent years. 
Attorney General John Ashcroft, who has spearheaded many of these changes, is still largely unknown, but 31 percent said they viewed him favorably, compared with 8 percent who said they viewed him unfavorably.
Throughout the poll, there was evidence of two standards of justice in the public's mind -- one for ordinary crimes and another for terrorism; one for citizens and another for foreigners. In general, Americans were willing to give the government substantial leeway in dealing with foreigners suspected of terrorism. 
But they do express anxiety about their own rights: 65 percent said they were concerned about losing some of their rights. Thirty-six percent said they were worried that some of these law enforcement changes might end up applying to them. Blacks were nearly twice as likely as whites to have that fear.
"My feeling is, once it starts, where does it stop?" asked Vivian Collins, a 52-year-old day-care provider from Delaware, who was interviewed after the poll was taken.
Nearly two-thirds of the public said they were not willing to give the government the right to "monitor the telephone calls and e-mail of ordinary Americans" to reduce the threat of terrorism. And Americans were evenly divided when asked if the federal government should have more authority to use wiretaps to reduce the threat of terrorism -- 48 percent were in favor and 44 percent said it would violate Americans' rights.
The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Friday through Monday, with 1,052 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The poll found Mr. Bush's standing with the public remained extraordinarily high, with an overall job approval rating of 86 percent. Ninety-one percent said they approved of his handling of the war against terrorism. Seventy-five percent said they approved of his performance on foreign policy. 
And even in a recession, 61 percent said they approved of his handling of the economy.
Americans overwhelmingly said they thought the war in Afghanistan was going well for the United States -- 51 percent said they thought it was going "very well," twice the number who felt that way in late October.
Most people said they were now confident that Osama bin Laden would be captured or killed by the United States. Men were even more confident than women that United States forces would capture or kill the Al Qaeda leader.
A majority of Americans said they thought the fighting in Afghanistan would lead to a wider war between the West and Muslim countries, but there were signs that people were feeling more secure at home.
In October, 53 percent said they thought it very likely that there would be another terrorist attack in the United States in the next few months. In the latest poll, 23 percent said they expected such an attack. In such a climate, concerns over the economy are getting more attention from the public.
This climate also explains why Americans are increasingly tolerant of criticism of the president: Seventy-three percent said it was O.K. to criticize him on economic or other domestic issues, up from 58 percent who felt that way in early October.
The administration has cited preventing another terrorist attack as its primary goal and the fundamental rationale for many of its actions, including the questioning of Middle Eastern immigrants and the monitoring of conversations between suspected terrorists in jail and their lawyers. While these proposals have generated intense debate in Washington, there are signs that the public is only beginning to pay attention.
For example, when asked if the Bush administration's proposals affecting civil liberties went too far, not far enough, or were about right, 49 percent said they did not know enough about them to say.
The poll also found that the public's view of these issues was extremely sensitive to how a question was worded. For instance, 61 percent said it was "a good idea" for the Justice Department to interview 5,000 young men, mostly recent immigrants from the Middle East, "based on their age and the country they come from."
But the results were quite different when the wording was changed to: "Do you think the United States Government should be allowed to routinely question Middle Eastern men who have come to the United States in the past two years and are here legally, even if they are not suspected of any crime, or does that violate people's rights?" Forty-two percent said it should be allowed, while 54 percent said it violates their rights.
The Justice Department has said that these interviews are voluntary, that those questioned are not suspected of wrongdoing, and that the effort is simply to gather information, like canvassing a neighborhood after a crime.
When it comes to trying suspected terrorists, 50 percent of the respondents said they preferred using open criminal courts -- with a jury, a civilian judge and a unanimous verdict -- as opposed to military trials that could be secret, presided over by a military judge and would not require a unanimous verdict.
"I'm always concerned about secrecy in terms of military courts," said Henry Lohse, 68, a retired engineer from Franklin Square, N.Y. "There's always the chance that innocent people could be crucified by someone else's lies."
Forty percent said they favored military tribunals. 
Officials from the Department of Defense, which is responsible for developing the rules for such trials, are expected to testify on Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Mr. Bush has promised that any such trials would be "full and fair" proceedings.
There were some regional differences in views. Respondents in the West, for instance, were more likely to favor trials in criminal court than people in other parts of the country.
There was strong opposition -- 75 percent --- to a proposal the Justice Department is said to be considering: relaxing current restrictions that prevent the F.B.I. from conducting surveillance on groups that gather at religious institutions, unless there is evidence of wrongdoing.
Democrats and Republicans, not surprisingly, saw some of these issues differently. 
For instance, Republicans were more concerned about the government enacting laws that were tough enough to deal with terrorists, while Democrats were more concerned about the possibility that the new laws would restrict civil liberties.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Friday through Monday with 1,052 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, marital status and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Appointments By Bloomberg Aim to Lessen Legal Morass 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday appointed Carol A. Robles-Roman as deputy mayor for legal affairs, a new area of authority for a deputy mayor in the city.
 Saying that he would like to substantially reduce the number of legal cases brought by the city, Mr. Bloomberg also appointed Michael A. Cardozo, a senior partner at Proskauer Rose LLP, as corporation counsel, in charge of the city's Law Department, which oversees all civil and criminal legal proceedings. 
 The selection of Mr. Cardozo, a former president of the New York City bar, along with the appointment of a deputy mayor in charge of legal affairs, indicated that Mr. Bloomberg would like to pursue new avenues with the department, and better coordinate the various offices of the mayoralty and the Law Department. Mr. Bloomberg -- a mayor who, unlike his most recent predecessors, is not a lawyer -- said yesterday that he would like to reduce the city's load of cases, many of which were pursued unsuccessfully under the Giuliani administration, and the rising tide of judgments against the city and settlements. 
"I think some things that the past mayor took to court would not be things that I would take to court," Mr. Bloomberg said, adding that his goal was to keep the city out of the courtroom whenever possible.
"I think the coordination between different departments in the city is the only ways we are going to be able to do more with less," he said. "The whole objective here should be to try and find ways to do more for the city without resorting to the courts."
New York City paid a record level in settlements and damages for personal injury claims in 2000, according to a report issued by City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi. Last year, the city paid out $459 million in damages and settlements, up by 10.5 percent from the 1999 level and the highest amount recorded for a single year.
Ms. Robles-Roman, 39, most recently director of public affairs for the state court system, lives in the Bronx and has worked for numerous judges in the state. She will be the liaison to the mayor's various committees and will also oversee several agencies and offices. "We all know we are really facing an incredibly daunting time right now," she said. "I am just going to pledge my loyalty to the mayor and to all of you, all New Yorkers, because at this period you deserve no less." 
Mr. Bloomberg is expected to announce a fifth and final deputy mayor, for economic development, as early as this week. All of Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayors will receive the same salary, about $160,000 a year, said Edward Skyler, the mayor-elect's press secretary.
Mr. Cardozo, 60, a Westchester resident, plans to move into New York City. He was president of the New York City Bar Association from 1996 to 1998 and has worked on many committees for more than 30 years.
"The number of people that suggested Michael Cardozo was off the charts," Mr. Bloomberg said. "He was the overwhelming choice of all of the people that advise me, and he was my choice."

HEADLINE: Gambling on a Film Fantasy; 
'Lord of the Rings' Shows New Line Cinema's Value to AOL

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
The recent management shuffle at the top of AOL Time Warner -- in which Richard D. Parsons, a veteran Time Warner executive, emerged as the surprise successor to the retiring chief executive, Gerald M. Levin -- only revived a question that has nagged New Line Cinema, a mere cog in the company's vast global empire, for years: What does AOL Time Warner, which already has Warner Brothers studios, , need with a second, separate film studio?
 The answer lies in sprawling tale of good versus evil in a mythical world populated by elves, dwarfs, wizards, goblins and a three-foot-tall, hairy-footed hero named Frodo Baggins. 
 The tale, the first in New Line's film trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's half-century old fantasy epic, "The Lord of the Rings," will open in movie theaters across the country a week from tomorrow, and the initial signs are so enncouraging that New Line may have done more than turn out a potential hit movie -- it may have secured its own future. 
When the smallish studio took on the audacious gamble of spending more than $270 million to make three "Rings" films at once, more than one skeptic in Hollywood thought the task would have been formidable for even the largest studio, notwithstanding the top-notch international cast led by Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood and Cate Blanchett. 
In a phone interview, Mr. Parsons gave New Line a strong vote of confidence, even given the studio's mixed record of flops and successes. 
"New Line makes movies, and any company that makes movies is going to have some hits and it's going to have some misses," Mr. Parsons said. "You're making a big mistake if you're trying to estimate the viability of an entity like New Line on the basis of one film. In fact, as it's coming together, 'Lord of the Rings' looks like it's potentially going to be a huge franchise for AOL Time Warner."
The scent of success is particularly satisfying to Robert K. Shaye, who founded New Line 35 years ago in a Lower Manhattan walk-up, and Michael Lynne, co-chairmen. 
After all, the film had been languishing at Miramax as a too costly two-parter, and they snapped it up and turned into a trilogy with a budget far higher than they were used to. By filming three movies at once, they achieved significant economies of scale, but the bet was risky: If the first film flopped, the studio would be sitting on expensive sequels that promised only further financial drain. 
"It may have been bold in some senses," Mr. Lynne said. "But it was never imprudent."
Early reviews of the 2-hour-58-minute first installment from Peter Jackson, the New Zealand director, have been extremely positive, some to the point of giddiness. It's subtitled "The Fellowship of the Ring," and it opens on Dec. 19. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, the first critic to issue his Top 10 list, has already named it the year's best film. The National Board of Review, the first group to issue its year-end passel of awards, gave one to Mr. Jackson for special achievement. And the regular market research of audience interest in coming movies has shown explosive enthusiasm for it.
"You can just sit here and look ahead and see that there are three films opening wide in December that are really positioned to be hugely successful," said Joe Roth, a former chairman of Walt Disney Studios and the founder of Revolution Studios. "One of them is 'Ocean's 11,' another is Will Smith in 'Ali' and the third is 'The Lord of the Rings.' "
Mr. Parsons said he would like to put an end to rumors that AOL Time Warner would sell New Line or fold it into the much larger and more mainstream Warner Brothers studio.
"When Time Warner first merged with Ted Turner back in 1996, we reviewed whether it made sense to keep or sell New Line at that time and made the judgment to keep it," Mr. Parsons said. "We wanted and needed the production, not just for New Line's sake but for our cable networks."
Last year, when Time Warner merged with AOL, the issue was revisited, he said. Again, the conglomerate decided to leave New Line independent, figuring that in the risky, cyclical world of moviemaking and in a corporation with so many outlets and so much hunger for content, it would be wise to maintain more than one film production unit.
Changes were made, however. Mr. Lynne was raised to co-chairman with Mr. Shaye. And the company was asked to end a recent drift toward more expensive productions and return to the kind of midbudget films on which it was built, like the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" series. "We modified, to some extent, their positioning within the pantheon of movie companies, to take them closer to their core competency," Mr. Parsons said. "That means no big-budget films and more medium-budget films."
From time to time, he said, New Line might come across a project -- like "The Lord of the Rings" -- that it wants to turn into a bigger-budget production. In that case, Mr. Parsons said, Mr. Shaye and Mr. Lynne must convince him and other corporate officials that it's a worthwhile risk.
"For example, with the third 'Austin Powers' movie that they're making now," he said. "To make that, they are going outside their normal bandwidth of midbudget films, but because it's part of such a successful franchise, they made a case for the higher level of its production costs and we told them to go for it."
Wall Street analysts have been cautiously and increasingly optimistic about the prospects for the Tolkien series. "The relative performance of the first film will be very critical for setting the pattern for the rest of the trilogy," said Jill S. Krutick, an entertainment analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. "Luckily for them, the buzz on this movie has been extraordinary, and it looks like it could really turn into another huge franchise for AOL Time Warner."
Through it all, Mr. Shaye and Mr. Lynne have insisted that while it was a formidable challenge, the making of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy was never reckless or big enough to put their company at risk.
The production costs on the first installment, including actors' salaries and extensive post-production special effects, were about $93 million, they said. This means that the special-effects and post-production costs for the other installments -- "The Two Towers," coming next December, and "The Return of the King," to be released in December 2003 -- will bring the full production cost of the series to somewhere north of $270 million, but still well below $300 million. On top of that, of course, will come tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs, about $50 million for the first film alone.
The project was "well insured," as Mr. Lynne put it. New Line will distribute the films in North America, but the other regions of the globe have been licensed to foreign partners, bringing in about $55 million a film. Another $11 million a film came from Burger King, JVC Electronics, Barnes & Noble and other toy and merchandise companies. And a final $10 million a film came in tax incentives from the government of New Zealand, where the films were shot. "All of that is cash money," Mr. Lynne said. And it means that New Line is vulnerable for less than 20 percent of each film's production costs.
Meanwhile, he said, the potential upside is much larger. New Line stands to make all of the profits of the films' North American runs, plus 50 percent of the profits from overseas runs, after the distribution fees are paid to foreign partners.
"Was it an aggressive thought?" Mr. Lynne said. "Yes. Was making three big films at once something that had never been done before? Yes. But the reason for those things was not the irrational plunging that people continually want to nail us with."
Mark Ordesky, the president of Fine Line Pictures, New Line's specialty film division, was a longtime Tolkien fan and early proponent of the project. He remembered the first meeting in 1998 between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Shaye. The rights to the project had been in the hands of Miramax Films, but that studio, reluctant to make a film of the scope and expense that Mr. Jackson was proposing, gave him a three-week window to shop it around to other studios.
"At the time, Peter Jackson was proposing that it be made into two films," Mr. Ordesky said. "In the middle of his pitch, Bob Shaye asked him: 'Aren't there three books in the series? Why are you making two films? Why not three?' "
The argument for doing it this way was economy of scale, Mr. Ordesky said. Major sets in distant locations (the trilogy was shot over 15 months in remote sections of New Zealand) could be built once. The huge cast could be assembled only once and for one fee, saving the studio from the higher costs of getting an actor to return for a sequel.
Of course, the downside was even more obvious. 
Rolf Mittweig, president for worldwide distribution and marketing for New Line, said "The Fellowship of the Ring" would open on about 5,000 screens at more than 3,000 theaters in North America and was expected to have a huge opening weekend, befitting a prospective blockbuster, although not as big as the opening of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" on Nov. 16, which was on more than 8,200 screens in 3,672 theaters. 
There are only so many screens to go around, Mr. Mittweig said, and in the crowded pre-Christmas season it is impossible for New Line to line up as many screens as "Harry Potter" had. Still, he said, the studio hopes to have the movie on an average of two or three screens at the major multiplexes, as well as 10,000 screens around the world by the middle of January.
"From the beginning, we divided up the audience into three groups," said Russell Schwartz, New Line's president for domestic marketing. "The first 25 percent are fanatics who couldn't wait for the films to come out. The important thing there was to convince them that we were taking the project seriously and doing it right. Another 50 percent were people who had heard of the books but hadn't read them. And the final 25 percent were people who never heard of Tolkien and couldn't care less."
In the earliest months, Mr. Jackson and his team sought to reassure Tolkien fanatics. "Then, between March and October, we focused our attention on that middle 50 percent," Mr. Schwartz said.
"Only in the last couple of weeks have we turned our attention to that last 25 percent," he said.
Mr. Shaye and Mr. Lynne were sitting in their Beverly Hills offices one recent afternoon, looking over the latest audience tracking numbers and the early reviews, optimistic that things seemed to be coming together well, but superstitious that it might still blow up in their faces.
"We are crossing our fingers, as we always do on all of our films," Mr. Lynne said.

BYLINE:  By James Barron; With Robert F. Worth 

 BODY:
Nobel Nobility
Someone at a dinner at the Swedish consul general's residence on Monday was trying to remember something she had heard on the radio, about how Alfred Nobel once predicted that his prizes would last 30 to 50 years, because by then there would be peace in the world or else the barbarians would be in control.
 The prizes have now lasted 100 years. 
 Hence the dinner, organized by Sweden's consul general in New York, OLLE WASTBERG. He invited a Nobel laureate -- JAMES TOBIN, who won in economics in 1981 -- and such guests as GEORGE RUPP, the president of Columbia University; REGINA S. PERUGGI, the president of the Central Park Conservancy; and SAMUEL J. LeFRAK, the real estate developer. 
If dining with a Nobel Prize winner on the night this year's Nobels were awarded in Oslo and Stockholm was not enough, a Pulitzer was also present.
She was COURTNEY PULITZER, who publishes a technology newsletter and said she is distantly related to the publishing baron who started another long-running prize.

Stand-up Auctioneer
JERRY SEINFELD'S debut as an auctioneer, in his apartment building on the Upper West Side, was a hit with the neighbors.
He was not selling the building, on Central Park West. He was presiding at a building fund-raiser for two fire companies, Ladder Company 25 and Engine Company 74, which lost nine firefighters in the terrorist attack on Sept. 11.
How did the auction happen? "I live in a building with lots of rich and famous people," said HEATHER RANDALL, who organized it. "I said to myself, I should get the famous people to perform for the rich people."
So she lined up ADOLPH GREEN and PHYLLIS NEWMAN to sing "New York, New York." Then she put her husband, TONY RANDALL, on the block to be a butler at a neighbor's party. Mr. Randall's services went for $3,000, to JOHN McENROE. A one-hour tennis lesson with Mr. McEnroe went for $4,000, and an answering machine message recorded by LEONARD NIMOY, presumably in the voice of Mr. Spock, sold for $2,000. Even as an auctioneer, Mr. Seinfeld sounded like he was doing stand-up comedy -- no monosyllabic machine-gun patter for him. "I know you people got money -- I've seen you in the lobby," he said when the bidding flagged on a mink scarf and pair of watches.
Later, when a Jack Russell puppy was up for sale, someone mentioned a television program that had featured a Jack Russell. "I don't watch TV," he replied. "Since I left it, I have no interest in it."

Prep-School Drama
The American Folk Art Museum opened its new $22 million building yesterday at 45 West 53rd Street. But the chairman, RALPH ESMERIAN, was still talking about the night last week when one of his prep-school buddies stopped by, unannounced. And the prep-school buddy, SAM WATERSTON, was still raving about the museum: "An achievement nearly equaling his performance as Ragueneau in 'Cyrano de Bergerac' in 1957."
What about that production, at Groton? Mr. Waterston and Mr. Esmerian said the star was THOMAS H. WRIGHT III, who went on to be the vice president and secretary of Princeton University. "Tom Wright got me into show business," Mr. Waterston said. "I wanted to be in show business so badly I went into show business out of a jealous and envious reaction that he got the part. It's really true."

It's Tony, Calling for Mario
MARIO M. CUOMO went to the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts yesterday because he answered the phone when TONY BENNETT called.
"I was in my office late," Mr. Cuomo said. "I picked up the phone. on the other end, a guy says, 'I'd like to speak to Governor Cuomo.' " Here Mr. Cuomo -- who was governor of New York for 12 years and was once widely talked about as a possible presidential candidate -- sounded awestruck: Tony Bennett was calling him and saying: "Hey, Gov, you know about this Frank Sinatra school? Frankie wanted it; I'm trying to chip in. Would you come down and do a thing?"
The "thing" at the school, at La Guardia Community College in Queens, involved speaking. "I'd rather be sitting with the kids, listening to Tony," Mr. Cuomo said, "than up there myself." With Robert F. Worth

HEADLINE: With the Economy Still Fragile, the FedAgain Cuts Rates 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
With unemployment rising and the outlook for recovery muddled, the Federal Reserve continued its campaign of interest rate cuts today as President Bush and the two parties in Congress made progress in reviving negotiations on an economic stimulus package.
 The Fed reduced its main lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.75 percent, the 11th time this year it has cut borrowing costs. In announcing the move, the Fed, the nation's central bank, noted signs that the downturn may be reaching a bottom, the first time the Fed has done so since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. But it added that the positive signs were tentative, and it left the door open to further rate cuts in the new year. 
 As the Fed was meeting, Mr. Bush instructed Secretary of the Treasury Paul H. O'Neill to go to Capitol Hill with a modified offer on the proposed economic recovery package. 
The president's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Bush was willing to move toward the Democrats on several components of the package, including reducing rather than repealing the alternative minimum tax for corporations, limiting individual income tax reductions and increasing the amount of money the administration would be willing to devote to helping laid-off workers.
"The president has listened to the Democrats," Mr. Fleischer told reporters in South Carolina, where Mr. Bush was speaking. "He hopes the Democrats will now be willing to listen to him."
Mr. Bush met at the White House tonight with a bipartisan group of senators about the economic stimulus package, and White House officials said they were encouraged by the talks.
House Republicans also signaled that they were open to a compromise, and Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota the majority leader, said he saw "the makings of an agreement."
The two parties must still overcome substantial differences before they can agree on a stimulus plan, with the main sticking point being Republican insistence on accelerating some of the tax cuts for individuals contained in the tax reduction bill Mr. Bush signed in June. 
Administration officials said the president was now willing to limit individual tax cuts to dropping the current 27 percent rate to 25 percent. The 27 percent rate affects single people with taxable income of $27,950 and above and couples with income of $46,700 and above. Mr. Bush was essentially moving his position into line with Congressional Republicans, who had given up on their calls for accelerated cuts in the top brackets.
Democrats, saying Mr. Bush's earlier tax cut was fiscally irresponsible and tilted toward the wealthy, want to block the acceleration of rate cuts.
Some members of both parties and some administration officials acknowledge that the economy might bounce back without any fiscal stimulus. But with neither party eager to run the risk of being blamed for inaction should the economy continue to deteriorate, the two sides emphasized today that there was enough common ground to forge a compromise.
"I think we're narrowing down the points of disagreement," said Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, the minority leader.
Mr. Daschle said the real breakthrough was the willingness of Republicans in the House to reconsider the tax-cutting stimulus bill they passed in October, a piece of legislation that Democrats have portrayed as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporate interests at the expense of unemployed and low-income workers who need help the most.
The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, said on Monday that if talks remained stalled, he would consider stripping some provisions out of the House bill that were most objectionable to Democrats, including a cut in the capital gains tax and granting corporations billions in immediate refunds as part of the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax.
Senator Daschle said he was willing to give Republicans most of what they wanted in terms of tax incentives for businesses to invest in new factories and equipment. He said that in return he would like the administration and Congressional Republicans to drop their insistence on income tax rate reductions and instead include in the package a Republican proposal to suspend, for one month, the Social Security payroll taxes levied on workers and their employers. 
Mr. Daschle said he also wanted assurances that Republicans would support the full package of assistance to laid-off workers, including subsidies for health insurance premiums and expansion of unemployment benefits for part-time workers.
"With those two conditions, we've got a deal," Mr. Daschle said.
But both sides cautioned that the negotiations, which have been ridden with personal animosity and deep ideological divisions, could again break down. Mr. Lott warned that Republicans might not go along with any deal that required them to give up accelerated income tax reductions.
"I think that would be a very big problem for Senate Republicans," Mr. Lott said.
With no assurance that Congress and the administration will enact a stimulus bill, the burden for lifting the economy has remained on the Federal Reserve, which has now pushed its federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks to 1.75 percent, the lowest level in nearly four decades.
The Fed also cut its discount rate on overnight loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent.
The moves were intended to reduce borrowing costs across the economy, helping to stimulate more economic activity among consumers and businesses. Banks immediately followed by reducing their prime lending rates to business customers to 4.75 percent from 5 percent, a move that also puts downward pressure on some home equity, credit card and adjustable-rate mortgage loans.
Most mortgage rates, though, are set by trading in the bond market, and are unlikely to move much because of the Fed's action.
In its statement today, the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee hinted that its nearly yearlong series of rate cuts, which has brought the federal funds rate down by 4.75 percentage points, from 6.5 percent at the start of the year, may be drawing to a close. 
Today's cut of a quarter-point in the fed funds rate followed three consecutive half-point reductions after the attacks on Sept. 11. Some analysts said the Fed had little choice today but to scale back to quarter-point moves, since it is starting to run out of room to reduce rates at all.
But its statement also made clear that the Fed thinks it has more leeway to cut rates if necessary, in part because inflation has remained dormant. 
"Economic activity remains soft, with underlying inflation likely to edge lower from relatively modest levels," the statement said. "To be sure, weakness in demand shows signs of abating, but those signs are preliminary and tentative."
The statement went on to use the Fed's code for a willingness to cut rates again, saying "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities, said Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues were trying to reassure both the stock market, which has rebounded smartly over the last two months on hopes that the economy will bounce back strongly next year, and the bond market, which has pushed long-term interest rates higher out of fear that a recovery will generate inflation.
"Not only does the Fed point out that inflation is heading lower, thereby reassuring bond investors," Mr. Vitner said, "but they also hint that the economy is bottoming out, which should give stocks a boost."
The Fed's statement reflected a debate among economists about how quickly the United States would pull out of the first recession in a decade. 
Citing upbeat signs like the strong stock market and relatively healthy consumer sales, some analysts are forecasting a quick rebound. Financial markets are already beginning to forecast interest rate increases by the Fed this spring, reflecting a belief that the combination of the rate cuts this year, plus action by Congress on a stimulus package, could send the economy into overdrive.
Other analysts say the rebound could take longer and be more lethargic than expected. If this view is correct, interest rates would be likely to go lower, and stay low for longer, than investors expect.
In any case, unemployment tends to keep rising even after the worst of a formal downturn is past, and sometimes even well into the recovery. Economists said the Fed tends to keep cutting rates for as long as unemployment keeps rising, suggesting that it could reduce rates once or twice more if this recession is of a typical length and depth.
"Over the past two decades," economists at UBS Warburg said in a report today, "the Fed has not stopped easing until there's no further decline in the unemployment rate, which we expect to rise further from 5.7 percent in November to 6.2 percent" by the end of March.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The State of the Stimulus Package"Highlights of President Bush's new offer to Democrats in Congress on the proposed economic stimulus package: INDIVIDUAL TAX CUTS -- Limits acceleration of personal income tax cuts to a reduction of the current 27 percent bracket to 25 percent. The bracket affects single taxpayers with taxable incomes of $27,950 and above and couples with taxable income of $46,700 and above. The president had previously sought a reduction in all income tax rates. CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX -- Reduces the tax instead of repealing it, as Mr. Bush had originally suggested. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS -- Makes workers in all states eligible for a 13-week extension of jobless benefits beyond the current 26-week limit. Mr. Bush had sought to limit the expansion to states hardest hit by Sept. 11. HEALTH INSURANCE -- Provides additional money to create a program under which unemployed workers could claim a tax credit to help them pay for health insurance. The administration had opposed any federal health insurance program for the uninsured. (pg. C3)

HEADLINE: A Finale in Three-Part Harmony 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
The most important and least surprising conclusion to the work of President Bush's Social Security commission was nowhere and everywhere in the final report the panel approved today: overhauling the retirement system is so complicated, painful and politically sensitive that it is almost impossible to get a consensus.
 That was true in this case even though the commission's 16 members were handpicked by the White House for their support of the president's call to add personal investment accounts to Social Security. 
 Rather than rallying behind a single comprehensive plan, the panel, with Mr. Bush's blessing and encouragement, put forward three proposals that would allow workers to invest varying portions of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds. It is up to Congress and the president, members of the commission said, to make the tough decisions about choosing among the approaches, apportioning the associated benefit cuts and coming up with the trillions of dollars necessary to put Social Security on a sound footing for the long run. 
The difficulty of reaching a consensus on Social Security is even more pronounced in Congress, where Republicans remain terrified of the issue and Democrats are eager to exploit it for political purposes. And it will be a very tall order when it comes to the general public, which is intrigued by investment accounts but leery of any changes to a system that has worked well for 66 years.
"The criticism is fair," said Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, one of the leading advocates of taking painful steps now to deal with Social Security's problems.
"Initially we did think the commission would come up with something more comprehensive and a single recommendation," he said. "But it's unfair to say they punted. They said there's a very significant structural problem with Social Security that can only be fixed with significant structural reforms, and all their proposals do have some variation of a personal account in them."
If the commission achieved anything, it was to make sure that personal accounts, which a few years ago were supported by a few investment firms and free-market research groups but almost no one else, gain a prominent place in what seems certain to be years of additional debate about how to prepare Social Security for the aging of the population.
"This is the first time a national panel appointed by a president has proposed that Americans acquire wealth as part of social insurance," said Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the former Democratic senator from New York, the commission's co-chairman.
The commission's report made clear that it is possible to create personal investment accounts within the retirement system, and at the same time improve Social Security's long term financial condition. The question is, at what cost? The best answer the commission could come up with was a combination of reductions in currently scheduled guaranteed benefits and large infusions of general government revenue. 
The commission disclosed today that it would probably take $2 trillion to $3 trillion of new revenue to shore up the system for 75 years, money that could only come from increased borrowing, higher taxes or spending cuts in other programs.
"This is the mother of all magic asterisks," said Peter R. Orszag, an economist at the Brookings Institution, the liberal-leaning research group, referring to how the government would have to come up with the money. 
He said the need for the additional revenue confirmed what critics of the administration have been saying all year, that Mr. Bush's tax cut took off the table money needed for other uses, including Social Security. The administration has already said it expects budget deficits for at least the next several years, and some analysts say the deficits could continue through the decade.
"Given the tax cut, the slowing economy and the associated security costs of the war on terrorism, there's no money left in the non-Social Security budget," Mr. Orszag said.
Knowing that Democrats will hammer them in campaign commercials next year for trading cuts in the guaranteed Social Security benefit for the uncertainty of investing in the stock market, many Republicans are hoping to tuck the commission's report away for the next 12 months.
It is unclear whether the White House will heed their request that the issue disappear for a while. Mr. Bush seems genuinely convinced that the issue is a winner, especially among younger voters who are comfortable with investing and willing to take a long view of Wall Street's ups and downs. The commission's other co-chairman, Richard D. Parsons, who was named last week to be the next chief executive of AOL Time Warner, said Mr. Bush had assured him he would highlight the issue in his state of the union address.
Mr. Kolbe said Republicans will do better to engage on the issue rather than to run away.
"The Democrats are going to hammer us on it anyhow," he said. "Putting your head down in a bunker won't save you. We've got to be able to explain what we're doing and why we're doing it. The president is going to have to lead the debate in the next year during the Congressional elections."
President Bill Clinton tried much the same thing a few years ago. And even though he was careful not to tie himself to any one position, the issue was so divisive that he put it on the back burner.
It is not clear that Mr. Bush, whose commission has painted a big target on his back, will have any greater success.

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS; 
Black Americans Are Still Buying

BYLINE:  By Martin Arnold 

 BODY:
Two seemingly disparate occurrences. A publisher told me recently that generally first novels by African-Americans have larger first printings than those by white authors, because they sell better. And I became aware of a new, remarkable book of photographs and text about the black experience in America since World War II that has 37,500 copies in print, a substantial amount for such a book other than those depicting Sept. 11.
 The two together made me think that perhaps the time had come to look at how African-American books and their publishers are faring during a somewhat depressed time for book publishing generally. The answer seems to be: a bit better than white mainstream publishing but not quite as well as before the terror attacks. African-Americans still seem to hunger for fiction and nonfiction that reflects their experience. 
 An example is the picture-and-text book "In Our Own Image: Treasured African-American Traditions, Journeys and Icons" (Running Press) by Patrick Henry Bass and Karen Pugh, which went into stores at the end of October with a first printing of 15,000 copies, at $30 a copy. Running Press, which incidentally is not a black publishing house, now has 37,500 copies in print, with more to come. The book's more than 300 photographs, collected by Ms. Pugh from professional photographers and scrapbooks and shoe boxes, depict Americans at school, in suburban homes, dressed for visiting, at the beach and hiking, playing in bands and marching for causes.
The middle-class lifestyle after World War II. Only these Americans are black. "They are like the people next door, but unfortunately the people next door moved out when we moved in, so they didn't know we were essentially the same as them," is the way Ms. Pugh put it. 
The text was written by Mr. Bass, the books editor of Essence, the glossy African-American magazine, which is a powerful force in the sale of books by and about blacks. Mr. Bass said: "Certain books are recession-proof for African-Americans -- spiritual, empowerment, cultural reflection and family. Mainstream publishing doesn't often include African-Americans in these books."
The white publisher who spoke about the larger first printings said that many first novels by black authors sell well enough not just to cover their advances, but also to earn some royalties for their writers. Which doesn't happen that often for white first novelists. But that doesn't mean black writers always get advances as large as white writers do for first novels, and advances for first novels, with certain exceptions, aren't large enough to live on. 
First fiction by African-American authors has a greater potential for sales because blacks are ravenous for books relevant to their experience, and until recently there have not been many available. Moreover, there are significant outlets for their sale in addition to chain bookstores. There are the black independent bookstores, the black book clubs and an ever-growing number, almost an explosion, of black reading clubs. African-American books sell well in stores like Wal-Mart, and Essence magazine is a powerful engine of sales. So when the first batch of a new African-American novel arrives in stores, there's a population ready.
Which shouldn't be too surprising since storytelling is a natural ritual of many black families. Max Rodriguez, publisher of QBR: The Black Book Review, said: "We are oral, and now that oral tradition is being translated into stories in print for the first time. This leads to devouring of novels that will be talked about, making for strong word-of-mouth sales."
Melody Guy, an editor for Strivers Row, a black imprint at Villard, which started publishing trade paperback commercial fiction in January, said that "most of our first novels have an initial printing of between 17,000 and 20,000 copies, and a majority of them went back for second and thirds, and most are paying royalties." Two of her books hit the Essence best-seller list, influential because most of the book buying is done by black women.
Janet Hill, an executive editor at Doubleday and head of its Harlem Moon imprint, will have the imprint's first books published in September 2002, headed by "Gumbo: A Celebration of African-American Literature," an anthology of stories compiled by Marita Golden and E. Lynn Harris, the best-selling novelist. Ms. Hill is optimistic that the lull in book publishing will not affect African-American readers. Anita Diggs, head of Ballantine's black imprint, One World Books, said that she was publishing 11 hardcover titles between now and August and that so far recession was not affecting black book sales.
Of course, no publisher wants to say business is in a slump, particularly those who head new imprints, which five of the black book publishers are. There's a fear that the first to go in a crunch will be a new imprint. Not realistic in this case because blacks seem to be on an upward curve in book buying.
In fact, in the face of recession, Denise Stinson, literary agent and head of Walk Worthy Press, in partnership with Warner Books to publish black Christian fiction, seems to be on the march. Her organizing has led to dozens of black reading clubs in churches and bookstores and people's homes in 26 states, plus one in Germany. Her plan is to publish books and have a network through which to sell and publicize. It's rather like the old Hollywood system, where the studios owned theater chains in which to show the movies they produced.
Karen R. Thomas, executive editor of Dafina Books, the Kensington Publishing Corporation's black imprint, said that though a black reader might not be buying as many books each month, after Sept. 11 "she still wants to escape and go into a bookstore and pick up a comforting novel." She said surveys showed that blacks were brand loyal "whether for an author or a product, and this translates into the habit of buying books regularly when they see the writer's name on a new book."
And of course, there is this: For a very long time now African-Americans had very few books that spoke to their unique experience. Now there are many, and they love that, and many say reading such books is not a luxury but a necessity.

A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News
By Bernard Goldberg
Illustrated. 232 pages. Regnery Publishing. $27.95.
 In 1995, the veteran CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg wrote an Op-Ed article for The Wall Street Journal, accusing his employers of slanting the news. He alleged the unfairness of a mocking report on the presidential candidate Steve Forbes and his proposal of a flat tax, citing derisive language ("scheme," "wacky" and "elixir"), the use of one-sided experts and the idea that most editors were "total dunces when it comes to the economy." 
 In-house reaction to this article did not augur well for Mr. Goldberg's long-term prospects at the network. He finally left in 2000. Now it's payback time.
Expanding widely on the claims he made in that original article, Mr. Goldberg has written "Bias," a book larded with specific examples to support his point of view. Although he refers to "the two or three conservative friends I have," he may pick up a lot more of them on the strength of this assault. He examines television's coverage of such issues as race, AIDS and homelessness to eyebrow-raising effect. All this, he says, supports the idea that most of those who shape these stories tilt to the left. 
Even among those who reject that premise, or some of the ad hominem bitterness on display here, "Bias" should be taken seriously. Unlike Bill O'Reilly, whose best-sellers (like "The No-Spin Zone") trumpet a bullying brand of conservatism as they recycle transcripts of television interviews, Mr. Goldberg has done real homework and has written a real book. Whatever his conclusions, however shaky his suppositions, he asks questions that are worth asking.
"Whenever you hear an anchorman or reporter use the word 'controversial,' it is usually a signal that the idea that follows is one the media elites do not agree with," he maintains. And whenever you hear the word "conservative" on one end of the political spectrum, he adds, you won't often hear "liberal" on the other. That, he says, is because network heavyweights regard their own opinions as middle-of-the-road and simply assume that the wider world agrees with them. (He twice quotes Pauline Kael's astonished reaction to the fact that Richard Nixon had been elected president. "I don't know a single person who voted for him!" she exclaimed, despite the fact that Nixon won in 49 states. She did live in the 50th state, Massachusetts.)
Do the networks also shape a false portrait of reality? Mr. Goldberg describes, in detail, the ways in which both the AIDS epidemic and the problems of the homeless may have been distorted. He uses data from the Center for Media and Public Affairs to suggest that rumors of a heterosexual AIDS outbreak were greatly exaggerated and that many of those afflicted caught the virus via drug use or sex with those already affected. He singles out "The Killer Next Door," a report on CBS's "48 Hours" that featured a middle-class, married, white woman as a representative AIDS patient. And as for narration that claimed "children are waking to a frightening new fact of life: the shadow of certain death," Mr. Goldberg notes that it is better suited to Stephen King than to news. 
But his argument is weakened by what he leaves unsaid: that the condition of a person with AIDS is not improved by blaming the victim. 
It is also diminished by willfully unreasonable analogies: "Why should the children of Jesse Jackson or Colin Powell or Diana Ross get some kind of racial preference when they apply to college or go out for a job, but no 'affirmative action' is given to the child of a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant coal miner from West Virginia?" An example that loaded is as unfair as the weighted news stories he denounces. 
But when it comes to race-related issues, Mr. Goldberg also presents his strongest evidence. He claims that a CBS producer was chided ("We have to be more careful next time") for filming too many black prisoners on an Alabama chain gang, even though only one prisoner happened to be white. If the program was truly sensitive to race, he asks, why not investigate whether the black convicts had been unfairly arrested, instead of worrying about putting them on the air? And why, he wonders, are there demonstrably fewer black interviewees on newsmagazine shows during the all-important periods that determine advertising rates? "South Africa in the bad old days was more integrated than 'Dateline' during sweeps!" he says.
Mr. Goldberg's hits keep on coming as he reels off obvious absurdities. He mentions a rule for the Gannett newspaper chain insisting upon minority sources for all stories, so that a Greenville, S.C., story about Hanukkah required someone who was both Jewish and from a racial minority group. ("Too bad Sammy Davis Jr. is dead," he says.) Then there is the insistence upon calling the black victim of a hate crime "African-American" on the "CBS Evening News," even though the man was actually Jamaican. And as for a motive for the manipulation of racial identities, maybe there is one that transcends even political leanings. "If someone discovered that Eskimo shows got bigger ratings and more advertising revenue," he writes, "the geniuses at the networks would change Frasier's name to Nanook."
In the end, the observations in "Bias" about the economics of television are as disturbing as what he has to say about women in the work force (they should stay home, but television is afraid to say so), the homeless (they were more apt to be deranged and dangerous than television indicated) or religion (someone in television once thoughtlessly referred to Gary Bauer as "the little nut from the Christian group" at a meeting). The most important bias to contemplate here is the one against serious, unglamorous news. "Edward R. Murrow's 'Harvest of Shame,' the great CBS News documentary about poor migrant families traveling America trying to survive by picking fruits and vegetables, would never be done today," he says. "Too many poor people. Not our audience. We want the people who buy cars and computers."

HEADLINE: Sentiment on Japan's Economy Worsens 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Japanese business leaders are rapidly losing confidence in the country's weakening economy, and they see no end to the current recession in the first quarter of 2002, according to a closely watched Bank of Japan survey released today.
 The bank's Tankan index of business prospects at nearly 9,000 companies fell to its lowest level in nearly three years. As slumping prices and demand for Japanese exports pummeled the country's largest companies in the third quarter, managers reacted by slashing their forecasts of sales and profit and their plans for capital spending, the survey found. 
 The quarterly Tankan report is the latest indicator in a grim flood of statistics documenting Japan's woes. Industrial production has fallen lower than at any time since 1988, unemployment has swollen beyond anything seen since World War II and growth has shifted into reverse for the fourth time in 10 years, with total economic output shrinking 0.5 percent in the July-September quarter. 
Manufacturers, the main drivers of growth in an economy heavily dependent on exports, are aggressively cutting costs, including the use of mass layoffs, a phenomenon hardly seen in Japan until very recently. But with few signs of a turnaround in Japan's main trading partners, most analysts expect matters to get worse before they get better. 
"I'd like to forget this year as soon as possible," said Koji Nishigaki, the president of the NEC Corporation, a leading maker of cellphones, personal computers and telecommunications equipment. "All over Japan, there is a lot of trouble." 
Like its peers here, NEC is eliminating jobs, closing factories and shifting production to China and other lower-cost countries. It is partway through a revamping that calls for 15,000 workers to retire early or be transferred to related companies. Though the moves will help stem losses, they will do little to generate new profits, which depend on a broader recovery in the semiconductor industry. 
The Tankan report gives few hints that companies expect a rebound soon. The index of sentiment at large manufacturers, calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who are pessimistic from the percentage who are optimistic, fell to minus 38 in December from minus 33 in September.
The result was not quite as bleak as some economists had expected, and a small sigh of relief briefly buoyed the yen in the currency markets. One dollar cost 125.82 yen in Tokyo after the bank's report was released, down from 126.01 in New York trading on Tuesday. Japanese stocks posted strong advances for the day, which traders attributed to lower interest rates in the United States and renewed hope for an uptick in technology sales.
But the surveyed managers said the outlook in three months' time would be only slightly less gloomy, at an index level of minus 36.
"Companies may expect conditions to stop deteriorating early next year, but that doesn't mean they will start to improve," said Yoshikazu Suehiro, senior economist at the NLI Research Institute, an affiliate of the Nippon Life Insurance Company. 
Indeed, companies surveyed by the Bank of Japan said they expected to spend 7.8 percent less on factories, equipment and capital goods in the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends March 31, and they expect sales to slip 3 percent and profits 18.7 percent from a year ago. 
Government forecasters expect an economic contraction of 0.9 percent for the fiscal year as a whole, potentially the steepest since the war, and are basing next year's budget forecasts on a further contraction of 0.3 percent. 
Lawmakers, alarmed by the glum forecasts, are using the numbers to hammer Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's plan to cut public spending and reduce the nation's debt. Mr. Koizumi has so far refused to abandon his program, though he has approved some supplemental spending to stimulate the economy.

HEADLINE: Housing and the Poor 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Housing Gains in Poor Areas, Study Shows" (news article, Dec. 8) says that statistical trends found by a recent study are "good news for those seeking signs of general economic improvement in poor areas of New York City." But these trends should also be cause for concern. 
 Median household income has not necessarily risen in poorer neighborhoods because of greater opportunities for low-income residents. Neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and central Harlem are gentrifying, attracting people with higher incomes who increase the historically low figure for median household income in these areas. 
 It is vital to create successful mixed-income communities. But we should not forget that we face a substantial affordable housing problem, which causes longtime residents to be pushed out when their neighborhoods become real estate hot spots. The "gains" you describe signify the onset of the gentrification process, which leaves out those people who are most in need.
